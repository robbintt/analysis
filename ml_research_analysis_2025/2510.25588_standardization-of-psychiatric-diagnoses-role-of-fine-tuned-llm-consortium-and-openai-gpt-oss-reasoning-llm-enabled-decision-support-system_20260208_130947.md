## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of standardizing psychiatric diagnoses, which are often subjective and inconsistent due to clinician variability. The authors propose a Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. The system uses fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient conversational datasets, with predictions aggregated through a consensus-based reasoning process led by the OpenAI-gpt-oss model. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in psychiatric diagnosis, with Llama-3 fine-tuning achieving stable training loss and validation loss. The system shows improved diagnostic precision and consistency compared to baseline models, particularly after fine-tuning on domain-specific data. A prototype was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

## Method Summary
The system fine-tunes three LLMs (Llama-3, Mistral, Qwen2) using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization on psychiatrist-patient conversational datasets (~2,000 records). Models are trained via Unsloth library on Google Colab GPUs, achieving convergence in ~27 minutes with 14.6 GB peak memory. Fine-tuned models are deployed via Ollama, and their diagnostic predictions are aggregated by LLM Agents into structured prompts for the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. The reasoning model synthesizes consortium outputs into a final DSM-5-aligned diagnosis. The architecture employs a 2/3, 1/6, 1/6 train/validation/test split and outputs specific diagnostic codes (e.g., 296.21 for Major Depressive Disorder).

## Key Results
- Llama-3 fine-tuning achieved stable training and validation loss curves with narrowing generalization gap (~2.41 area), indicating convergence without severe overfitting
- Post-fine-tuning outputs demonstrated correct DSM-5 code inclusion (e.g., 296.21, 300.01, 309.81) compared to verbose pre-fine-tuning outputs
- Consortium approach showed improved diagnostic precision and consistency compared to baseline models, with the reasoning LLM effectively adjudicating between diverse model predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs on psychiatric dialogue data improves diagnostic precision and DSM-5 code alignment compared to baseline models.
- **Mechanism:** QLoRA fine-tuning adapts model weights through low-rank matrices to recognize symptom patterns in psychiatrist-patient conversations, mapping linguistic markers to specific diagnostic criteria. The 4-bit quantization enables this adaptation on consumer-grade hardware while retaining domain learning.
- **Core assumption:** Curated psychiatrist-patient dialogues contain learnable patterns that generalize to unseen clinical cases without overfitting to the small dataset (~2,000 records).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Llama-3 fine-tuning achieving stable training loss and validation loss"
  - [section 5.1] Figures 7-10 show training/validation loss curves with narrowing generalization gap (area ~2.41), indicating convergence without severe overfitting
  - [section 5.2] Figures 11-16 demonstrate before/after comparisons: pre-fine-tuning outputs are verbose and lack DSM-5 codes; post-fine-tuning outputs include correct codes (e.g., 296.21, 300.01, 309.81)
  - [corpus] Limited external validation; related work (MDD-Thinker, MentalSeek-Dx) explores similar approaches but no direct replication of this specific QLoRA psychiatric fine-tuning approach
- **Break condition:** If validation loss diverges from training loss or generalization gap widens after step 25, domain adaptation has failed and model is overfitting.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A consortium of architecturally diverse fine-tuned LLMs provides complementary diagnostic perspectives that improve robustness compared to any single model.
- **Mechanism:** Each model (Llama-3, Mistral, Qwen2) possesses different pre-training corpora and architectural attention mechanisms. When fine-tuned on the same psychiatric data, they develop different inductive biases, producing varied interpretations of ambiguous symptom presentations. This diversity allows the system to capture uncertainty and edge cases.
- **Core assumption:** Model architectural diversity translates to meaningful diagnostic diversity, and prediction disagreements contain useful signal rather than pure noise that should be averaged away.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process"
  - [section 3.3] "consortium of fine-tuned LLMs...enhances diagnostic robustness through diversity in model reasoning"
  - [section 5.3] Figure 17 shows Llama-3, Mistral, and Qwen2 producing different preliminary diagnoses for the same case, which OpenAI-gpt-oss then reconciles
  - [corpus] Similar consortium architectures appear in related papers (Proof-of-TBI, Neuromuscular Reflex Analysis) from same research group, but independent validation of ensemble benefit is limited
- **Break condition:** If consortium members produce highly correlated outputs (>0.9 agreement rate) on diverse test cases, architectural diversity is not translating to diagnostic diversity and ensemble benefit is lost.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A dedicated reasoning LLM (OpenAI-gpt-oss) can synthesize multiple consortium predictions into a final, clinically coherent diagnosis aligned with DSM-5 criteria.
- **Mechanism:** The reasoning LLM receives a structured prompt containing all consortium predictions, symptom summaries, and diagnostic context. It applies multi-step reasoning to evaluate consistency across predictions, resolve contradictions, and select/adjudicate the most clinically appropriate diagnosis. The LLM Agent Layer formats this input to optimize reasoning model comprehension.
- **Core assumption:** The reasoning model possesses sufficient embedded medical knowledge and reasoning capacity to validly adjudicate between competing diagnoses without introducing hallucinations or systematic biases.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM...experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in psychiatric diagnosis"
  - [section 3.4] "OpenAI-gpt-oss serves as the final decision-making engine...determines the most consistent and clinically aligned diagnostic outcome"
  - [section 4.4] Figure 5 shows structured prompt format feeding consortium outputs to reasoning model
  - [corpus] Reasoning LLM approaches for mental health are explored in MentalSeek-Dx and MDD-Thinker papers, but specific OpenAI-gpt-oss psychiatric validation data is not available in corpus
- **Break condition:** If reasoning LLM consistently produces diagnoses not supported by any consortium member, or overrides correct predictions with incorrect ones, the arbitration mechanism is unreliable and may be hallucinating clinical knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: This technique enables fine-tuning 7B+ parameter models on consumer GPUs (~6GB VRAM utilized in paper) by freezing quantized base weights and training only low-rank adapter matrices.
  - Quick check question: Why does QLoRA quantize base weights to 4-bit but keep adapter layers in higher precision, and what tradeoff does this introduce?

- **Concept: DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Structure**
  - Why needed here: The system is designed to output DSM-5-aligned diagnoses with specific codes (e.g., 296.21 for Major Depressive Disorder). Understanding how diagnostic criteria map to symptom clusters is essential for evaluating whether model outputs are clinically valid.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a DSM-5 diagnostic code, a symptom criterion, and a duration specifier, and why might an LLM confuse them?

- **Concept: Ensemble Diversity and Error Correlation**
  - Why needed here: The consortium approach assumes different models make different errors. If models are highly correlated, ensemble benefits collapse.
  - Quick check question: If Llama-3 and Mistral both incorrectly predict "Bipolar I" for a Major Depression case, what does this tell you about the training data or model architectures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data Lake Layer -> LLM Agent Layer -> LLM Consortium Layer -> OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning Layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data preprocessing -> Convert to Unsloth conversational format (instruction/content/text schema per Figure 6)
  2. QLoRA fine-tuning via Unsloth on Google Colab (A100/Tesla GPUs, ~27 minutes for 2K samples)
  3. Model quantization and packaging for Ollama deployment
  4. LLM Agent constructs model-specific prompts with patient dialogue context
  5. Parallel inference across consortium -> collect preliminary diagnoses
  6. Agent formats aggregated output into reasoning prompt (Figure 5 structure)
  7. OpenAI-gpt-oss synthesizes final diagnosis with reasoning trace

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **QLoRA vs. full fine-tuning:** Enables consumer-grade deployment but may sacrifice ~5-10% accuracy vs. full-parameter adaptation (not quantified in paper)
  - **Consortium size (3 models):** Balances diversity vs. inference latency/cost; adding more models increases robustness but with diminishing returns
  - **External reasoning LLM dependency:** OpenAI-gpt-oss provides advanced reasoning but creates API dependency, latency, and data privacy considerations vs. fully local deployment
  - **Dataset scale (~2K records):** Sufficient for prototype but limits generalization to rare conditions and diverse populations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training loss drops but validation loss rises after step ~20 -> overfitting to small dataset; reduce learning rate or augment data
  - Consortium outputs near-identical diagnoses across all test cases -> models not learning diverse representations; check for data leakage or insufficient architectural differentiation
  - Reasoning LLM outputs diagnosis codes not in training data -> hallucination; improve prompt constraints or add negative examples
  - Pre-fine-tuning and post-fine-tuning outputs look similar -> fine-tuning not effective; check learning rate, epoch count, or data format compliance
  - Ollama deployment fails with OOM -> quantization insufficient; reduce model or use more aggressive quantization

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline accuracy benchmark:** Run 50 held-out test cases through (a) unfine-tuned baseline models, (b) fine-tuned single models, and (c) full consortium+reasoning pipeline. Measure DSM-5 code accuracy, symptom extraction precision, and diagnostic reasoning coherence.
  2. **Consortium ablation study:** Systematically remove one model at a time from consortium and measure impact on final diagnosis accuracy. Quantify whether all three models contribute meaningfully or if one dominates.
  3. **Reasoning layer validation:** Create 20 test cases where consortium models disagree significantly (no majority). Manually evaluate whether OpenAI-gpt-oss arbitration produces clinically appropriate resolutions vs. simple heuristics like majority voting or random selection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the performance differential between the text-based system and a multimodal version incorporating voice and facial affect?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future work will focus on... integration with multimodal inputs—such as voice, facial expressions, and affective signals."
- Why unresolved: The current prototype and evaluation are restricted to text-based conversational data.
- Evidence: A comparative study measuring diagnostic accuracy when audio/visual data streams are added to the LLM consortium inputs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system maintain high diagnostic fidelity in live clinical settings compared to retrospective dataset evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "clinical validation" as a primary focus for future research.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates technical feasibility via a prototype and loss metrics, but has not yet conducted trials in active clinical workflows.
- Evidence: Results from prospective clinical trials comparing the system's real-time predictions against ground-truth diagnoses by practicing psychiatrists.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the size of the training dataset (~2,000 records) impact the model's ability to generalize to rare conditions or diverse demographics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes the dataset consisted of "approximately 2,000 annotated records," which may limit robustness across the full spectrum of psychiatric disorders.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on specific conditions (Depression, PTSD) and does not analyze performance variance across low-prevalence disorders.
- Evidence: Performance metrics (F1-score, sensitivity) specifically on "rare" conditions or demographic subgroups not well-represented in the 2,000-record dataset.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (~2,000 records) constrains generalizability to rare psychiatric conditions and diverse populations
- Critical dependency on OpenAI-gpt-oss external API with unclear model specifics raises reproducibility and data privacy concerns
- Absence of clinical validation with practicing psychiatrists means real-world diagnostic accuracy remains unproven

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The fine-tuning methodology (QLoRA) is technically sound and the training convergence patterns are clearly documented through loss curves.
- **Medium confidence**: The consortium approach shows promise based on internal consistency metrics, but lacks independent external validation of ensemble benefits.
- **Low confidence**: The reasoning LLM's adjudication quality cannot be independently verified due to limited transparency around OpenAI-gpt-oss model capabilities and the absence of ground-truth adjudication for cases where consortium models disagree.

## Next Checks
1. **Clinical accuracy validation**: Engage 10+ practicing psychiatrists to independently evaluate the system's diagnoses on 100+ diverse psychiatric cases, measuring inter-rater reliability between human experts and the AI system.
2. **Dataset robustness testing**: Conduct cross-validation using multiple psychiatric dialogue datasets (if available) to assess whether the ~2,000 record dataset size is sufficient for stable performance across different psychiatric conditions and patient demographics.
3. **Reasoning LLM arbitration audit**: Systematically collect 50 cases where consortium models disagree significantly, have independent psychiatrists determine the correct diagnosis, and evaluate whether OpenAI-gpt-oss consistently produces the clinically appropriate resolution.
