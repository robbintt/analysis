# Virtual Fashion Photo-Shoots: Building a Large-Scale Garment-Lookbook Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.00633
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00633
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Constructed first large-scale garment-lookbook dataset (360K pairs) enabling virtual fashion photo-shoot task

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the novel task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which aims to generate editorial-style fashion imagery by transforming standardized garment images into contextually rich lookbook photos. To enable this task, the authors construct the first large-scale garment-lookbook dataset with 360,000 pairs across three quality levels. Since such pairs are not readily available, they develop an automated retrieval pipeline combining vision-language models, object detection, and SigLIP-based similarity estimation. Their ensemble approach achieves 89.3% R@1 on the DressCode benchmark, outperforming individual models by over 10 percentage points.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an automated pipeline to create garment-lookbook pairs by leveraging vision-language models to retrieve contextually appropriate lookbook images for standardized garment photos. The process involves detecting and segmenting garments, using object detection to identify fashion items in lookbook images, and applying SigLIP-based similarity models to score and filter pairs. To improve retrieval performance, they created an ensemble of SigLIP2, Proxynca++, and Hyp-DINO models, achieving significant improvements over individual models. The resulting dataset spans three quality levels (high: 10K, medium: 50K, low: 300K) and provides a foundation for training generative models for virtual fashion photo-shoots.

## Key Results
- Constructed first large-scale garment-lookbook dataset with 360,000 pairs across three quality levels
- Ensemble of SigLIP2, Proxynca++, and Hyp-DINO achieves 89.3% R@1, 96.6% R@5, and 98.0% R@10 on DressCode benchmark
- Ensemble outperforms individual models by over 10 percentage points in R@1 score
- Three-tier quality structure enables controlled experiments across dataset granularity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple vision-language models in the ensemble. SigLIP2 provides strong image-text matching capabilities, Proxynca++ offers efficient contrastive learning, and Hyp-DINO contributes contextual understanding. The automated pipeline ensures scalability while maintaining quality through similarity scoring and filtering. By training on large-scale garment-lookbook pairs, models learn to understand both the garment features and contextual elements that make fashion imagery compelling.

## Foundational Learning
**Vision-Language Models**: Bridge image and text understanding for fashion context retrieval
- Why needed: Fashion imagery requires understanding both visual and textual semantics
- Quick check: Verify model can match garment descriptions to appropriate lookbook contexts

**Object Detection in Fashion**: Identify and segment garments from complex imagery
- Why needed: Standardize garment representations across diverse sources
- Quick check: Test detection accuracy on varied garment poses and lighting

**Similarity Estimation**: Quantify semantic alignment between garment and lookbook pairs
- Why needed: Enable automated quality filtering and dataset curation
- Quick check: Validate similarity scores correlate with human aesthetic judgments

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Garment images -> Object Detection -> SigLIP similarity scoring -> Quality filtering -> Dataset tiers

**Critical Path**: The similarity estimation stage is critical as it determines which pairs make it into each quality tier and ultimately affects the dataset's utility for training generative models.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Automated retrieval enables large-scale dataset creation but may introduce bias from training data; ensemble approach improves accuracy but increases computational complexity; three-tier quality structure provides flexibility but relies on heuristic quality assessment.

**Failure Signatures**: Low-quality pairs with mismatched contexts, inconsistent garment representations across tiers, ensemble overfitting to DressCode benchmark rather than generalizing to real-world fashion imagery.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate that high-similarity pairs correspond to visually coherent garment-lookbook matches through human evaluation
2. Measure the impact of each ensemble component through ablation studies on retrieval performance
3. Train a baseline generative model on each quality tier to assess correlation between similarity scores and output quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Automated retrieval pipeline reliability depends on proprietary SigLIP training data with unknown bias characteristics
- Quality tier correlations with downstream task performance remain unverified without external validation
- Lack of qualitative analysis of retrieved pairs raises questions about contextual coherence despite high similarity scores

## Confidence
- **High**: The retrieval pipeline architecture and dataset scale (360K pairs) are clearly described and reproducible
- **Medium**: The reported retrieval performance metrics (89.3% R@1, 96.6% R@10) are internally consistent, but the lack of external validation reduces confidence in generalizability
- **Low**: Claims about the dataset's utility for training generative models are aspirational, as no such experiments are reported

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human evaluation study to verify that high-similarity pairs correspond to visually and contextually coherent garment-lookbook matches
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of SigLIP2, Proxynca++, and Hyp-DINO to ensemble performance
3. Test the dataset's utility by training a baseline generative model and measuring the impact of quality tiers on output realism and contextual grounding
