# Understanding the Implicit Biases of Design Choices for Time Series Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.19236
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19236
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** This paper analyzes how architectural and training decisions in TSFMs create three main biases: temporal (patch size affects frequency learning), geometric (embedding choices impact local/global processing), and regression-to-the-mean (loss functions affect uncertainty handling).

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the implicit biases created by design choices in time series foundation models (TSFMs), rather than proposing new architectures. Through controlled experiments comparing Chronos and Chronos-Bolt models, the authors identify three key biases: temporal bias from patch size affecting frequency learning, geometric bias from embedding choices impacting local/global information processing, and regression-to-the-mean bias from loss functions affecting uncertainty handling. The study demonstrates that these biases can be intuitive or counterintuitive depending on data properties, and shows how they interact in complex ways, particularly in outlier handling. The work provides insights for designing TSFMs that are robust to different data characteristics and highlights challenges in developing models that scale well with increasing data and compute.

## Method Summary
The paper compares pretrained Chronos (discrete embedding, cross-entropy loss, patch=1) with Chronos-Bolt variants (continuous MLP embedding, L1 quantile loss, patch∈{1,2,4,8,16}) through controlled experiments. The methodology involves synthetic signal analysis (sinusoidal, multi-scale, chaotic Lorenz systems), embedding property measurements (angles, distances, norms), attention visualization, and forecasting experiments on both synthetic and 15 real-world benchmark datasets. The authors systematically vary design choices to isolate and measure each bias, using frequency loss, periodicity preservation (autocorrelation), and forecasting metrics (MASE, WQL, MSE) as evaluation criteria.

## Key Results
- Temporal bias: Increasing patch size generally suppresses high-frequency information while favoring low-frequency periodicity, provided patch alignment matches signal motifs
- Geometric bias: Discrete (quantized) embeddings force models to focus on immediate neighbors, while continuous embeddings facilitate global context mixing
- Regression-to-the-mean: Models trained with regression losses (L1, L2) tend to forecast the mean during uncertainty, while Cross-Entropy losses preserve multi-modal outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Temporal Bias (Frequency vs. Periodicity)
- **Claim:** Increasing patch size generally suppresses high-frequency information while favoring low-frequency periodicity, provided the patch alignment matches the signal's motifs.
- **Mechanism:** Patching groups input points into a single token. Theorem 1 shows that patches of different frequencies are embedded into nearly orthogonal subspaces. As patch size $k$ increases, the model's attention mechanism tends to align with the low-frequency subspace, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise (or signal) and treating the sequence as a lower-resolution trend.
- **Core assumption:** The model's attention weights ($W_Q, W_K$) align preferentially with the dominant variance in the embedding space, which typically corresponds to low-frequency components in large patches.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "temporal (influenced by patch size, affecting frequency and periodicity learning)..."
  - [Section 2]: "A larger patch size, e.g., 16 in Chronos-Bolt, favors low-frequency components... Conversely, a smaller patch size... can capture parts of these high frequency components."
  - [Section C.1.2]: Visualizes that attention scores are dominated by low-frequency patches when $k$ is large.
  - [Corpus]: General TSFM literature confirms patching is standard, but this paper specificiates the *frequency consequence*.
- **Break condition:** If the patch size misaligns with the signal's periodicity (aliasing) or if the signal contains essential high-frequency chaotic data, large patches cause severe information loss (Section 2, Figure 2).

### Mechanism 2: Geometric Bias (Angular Locality vs. Mixing)
- **Claim:** Discrete (quantized) embeddings introduce an angular bias that forces the model to focus heavily on immediate neighbors (parroting), whereas continuous embeddings facilitate global context mixing.
- **Mechanism:** Quantization maps continuous values to discrete bins, effectively "bending" the input geometry. This increases the angular distance between embedded vectors, creating a bimodal attention distribution where tokens attend almost exclusively to immediate neighbors. Continuous embeddings (e.g., MLPs) preserve input topology, allowing attention to distribute more evenly across the context.
- **Core assumption:** The preservation of input geometry (distances and angles) determines the "reach" of the self-attention mechanism.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "geometric (arising from embedding choices, impacting local/global information processing)"
  - [Section 3]: "A quantization-based embedding introduces a continuous-to-discrete 'unrounding noise'... [and] emphasize local information over global context."
  - [Figure 4b]: Shows Chronos (quantized) has bimodal attention (local), while Chronos-Bolt (continuous) has uniform attention.
- **Break condition:** If a task requires identifying a global trend rather than repeating the last local motif (parroting), the angular bias of quantization leads to failure (Section A.2.1).

### Mechanism 3: Regression-to-the-Mean (Uncertainty Handling)
- **Claim:** Models trained with regression losses ($L_1, L_2$) tend to forecast the mean or median during uncertainty, while Cross-Entropy (CE) losses preserve multi-modal outcomes.
- **Mechanism:** $L_2$ loss minimizes squared error by converging to the expected value (mean), effectively averaging out divergent future possibilities. CE loss, cast as a classification task over value bins, minimizes the divergence between the predicted distribution and the true distribution, allowing the model to maintain high probability on distinct, separate outcomes (modes) rather than averaging them.
- **Core assumption:** The gradient of the loss function dictates how the model resolves ambiguity in stochastic sequences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "regression-to-the-mean (determined by the loss function, affecting uncertainty handling)"
  - [Section 4]: "$L_2$-based loss: favors the mean... Cross-entropy loss: models the full probability distribution... and can settle on a/the 'mode'."
  - [Corpus]: Corpus mentions standard normalization issues but lacks specific causal links to this loss/bias trade-off.
- **Break condition:** In deterministic or simple stochastic settings, CE loss might unpredictably "jump" between modes when a stable mean forecast would be more actionable (Section 4, Figure 7b).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Spectral Bias / Frequency Principle**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding why the model naturally prefers low-frequency components and how patching exacerbates this.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a neural network learn a smooth, slow-moving trend before it learns a high-frequency oscillation?

- **Concept:** **Tokenization Strategies (Quantization vs. Continuous)**
  - **Why needed here:** To grasp the trade-off between the "parroting" behavior of discrete tokens (Chronos) and the "context mixing" of continuous tokens (Chronos-Bolt).
  - **Quick check question:** If you map the numbers 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to the same discrete token "A", what geometric information is lost compared to keeping them as continuous vectors?

- **Concept:** **Probabilistic Forecasting Losses (NLL vs. CRPS)**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand the mathematical drive behind "regression to the mean" in $L_1/L_2$ losses versus the distributional fidelity of Cross-Entropy.
  - **Quick check question:** If a stock price is equally likely to be \$100 or \$200 tomorrow, what price would an $L_2$-optimized model predict to minimize error?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Time Series → Patching (Temporal Knob) → Embedding (Geometric Knob: Discrete vs. Continuous) → Transformer Backbone (T5) → Output Head (Regression-to-Mean Knob: CE vs. Quantile/MSE)
- **Critical path:** The interaction between **Patch Size** and **Embedding Type**. A large patch size hides high-frequency noise (Temporal Bias), while a continuous embedding amplifies this effect by diluting local "parroting" in favor of global mixing (Geometric Bias).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Chronos (Discrete + CE + Small Patch):** Excels at "parroting" local patterns and preserving chaotic dynamics (modes), but fails at global trend reasoning and outlier smoothing.
  - **Chronos-Bolt (Continuous + Quantile + Large Patch):** Excels at robustness, denoising, and global context, but fails at preserving fine-scale details or multi-modal chaotic behaviors.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Oversmoothing:** Forecast looks like a flat line or simple sine wave (Patch size too large or strong regression-to-mean).
  - **Context ignoring:** Forecast ignores the long-term trend and repeats the immediate past (Embedding is too discrete/angular).
  - **Norm explosion:** Small signals are ignored while large offsets dominate (Continuous embedding norm bias).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Frequency Ablation:** Run a synthetic signal $x(t) = \sin(t) + \sin(50t)$ through the model with patch sizes $k=1, 8, 16$. Measure the ratio of high-frequency power in the forecast vs. ground truth to verify Temporal Bias.
  2. **Attention Visualization:** Feed a periodic sequence (e.g., $\sin(t)$) into both a quantized and continuous version of the model. Plot the attention heatmaps to confirm bimodal (local) vs. uniform (global) attention distributions (Geometric Bias).
  3. **Uncertainty Test:** Train/evaluate on a binary random walk (steps of 0 or 1). Compare the forecast distribution: does the model predict $\approx 0.5$ (Regression Bias) or a bimodal distribution at 0 and 1 (CE/Mode behavior)?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can post-training compression techniques effectively retain the beneficial simplicity bias observed in large TSFMs while reducing computational overhead?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section F.1 identifies this as a "promising direction" to maintain robustness without paying the costs of over-parameterization.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper identifies the bias, it notes the precise mechanism remains an active area of research and has not validated compression strategies for this specific purpose.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results showing that compressed models maintain the same preference for simple solutions and generalization capabilities as their larger counterparts.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can TSFMs be designed to be forward-compatible with orders of magnitude more data and compute?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion highlights the need for design principles that allow models to absorb "qualitatively more/different data" gracefully as an "important follow-up direction."
- **Why unresolved:** Current design choices often optimize for specific benchmarks but act deleteriously on qualitatively different data (e.g., chaotic systems).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Architectural frameworks or "knobs" that demonstrate continual improvement and robustness across both standard benchmarks and qualitatively distinct datasets as scale increases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do the identified implicit biases (temporal, geometric, regression-to-mean) remain the dominant performance drivers as models scale to internet-level sizes?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 1 discusses the "bitter lesson," noting it is "not obvious (and likely not true)" that the best models for one regime apply to another.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper's controlled experiments are limited to specific model sizes (e.g., Chronos vs. Chronos-Bolt); the behavior of these biases at extreme scales is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A scaling law analysis specifically tracking the magnitude and interaction of these three biases across exponentially larger parameter counts and datasets.

## Limitations
- Analysis relies heavily on synthetic data experiments that may not fully capture real-world complexities
- Interaction effects between multiple biases are demonstrated but not systematically quantified
- Theoretical analysis assumes simplified conditions (infinite context, fixed embedding properties) that may not hold in practical deployments

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The geometric bias mechanism (quantization vs. continuous embeddings affecting local vs. global attention) is well-supported by both theoretical analysis and visual attention heatmaps
- **Medium Confidence:** The temporal bias findings are convincing for aligned periodic signals but less robust for general signals with arbitrary frequency content
- **Medium Confidence:** The regression-to-the-mean bias is mathematically sound but the practical impact varies significantly with the underlying data distribution and task requirements

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world robustness test:** Apply the identified biases framework to a diverse set of production time series datasets (finance, healthcare, IoT) to verify that the synthetic experiment patterns generalize
2. **Multi-bias interaction quantification:** Design experiments that systematically vary all three design knobs simultaneously to measure interaction effects and identify potential compensation strategies
3. **Transfer learning validation:** Test whether understanding these biases improves zero-shot transfer performance by deliberately choosing design configurations optimized for target domain characteristics
