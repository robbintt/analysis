# Accurate and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Task Prediction of HEA Properties Using Prior-Guided Deep Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.14828
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14828
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Hierarchical Deep Gaussian Processes (HDGP) with encoder-decoder priors achieve superior multi-task prediction of HEA properties, demonstrating state-of-the-art RMSE, R², and Spearman correlation while providing uncertainty quantification.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates surrogate modeling approaches for predicting multiple correlated material properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV high-entropy alloy system. The authors systematically compare conventional Gaussian Processes, Deep Gaussian Processes, encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost using a dataset combining experimental and computational properties. The hierarchical DGP architecture, enhanced with encoder-decoder prior information, demonstrates superior performance for predicting mechanical properties like yield strength, hardness, and modulus. The approach effectively captures inter-property correlations and provides input-dependent uncertainty estimates, making it particularly valuable for materials design in data-limited regimes.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-layer variational Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) that learns residuals between experimental data and encoder-decoder predictions. The encoder-decoder provides prior predictions, which are subtracted from training targets so the DGP learns to model the residuals. After prediction, the prior is added back to produce final estimates. The DGP is configured with 10 latent Gaussian Processes per layer and a reduction parameter controlling latent dimensionality. The model handles heterotopic data where different properties are measured for different compositions. Training uses ELBO optimization via BoTorch, with performance evaluated across five randomized 80/20 train-test splits.

## Key Results
- HDGP models with encoder-decoder priors (HDGP P-All) outperform other approaches, achieving the lowest RMSE and highest R² and Spearman correlation coefficients for key mechanical properties.
- The hierarchical DGP structure effectively captures inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainties that single-layer models cannot represent.
- Multi-task learning with auxiliary computational properties slightly improves main-task prediction accuracy, though the benefit is modest.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hierarchical composition of Gaussian Process layers enables capture of non-stationary, input-dependent uncertainty patterns that single-layer models cannot represent.
- **Mechanism:** Each GP layer transforms inputs through its own covariance structure, with outputs of one layer feeding into the next. This allows the model to represent variance that changes with composition rather than assuming homoscedastic noise.
- **Core assumption:** HEA composition-property relationships exhibit non-linear interactions and heteroscedastic uncertainty that require hierarchical representation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The hierarchical DGP structure effectively captures inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainties"
  - [Section 4.2] "Each function f(i) is modeled as a GP with its own covariance structure, effectively capturing different levels of abstraction from the input data"
  - [corpus] Related work on uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling (Paper ID 82304) supports hierarchical approaches for computationally expensive models, though direct HEA-specific corpus validation is limited
- **Break condition:** When data relationships are sufficiently stationary and linear, added depth provides no benefit while increasing computational cost and optimization difficulty.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Injecting encoder-decoder predictions as informative priors prevents the DGP from defaulting to constant mean predictions in sparsely-sampled regions.
- **Mechanism:** The prior is subtracted from training outputs, so the DGP learns residuals. After prediction, the prior is re-added. This provides a composition-dependent baseline rather than a global constant.
- **Core assumption:** The encoder-decoder network captures useful structure even with limited training data, and its systematic errors can be corrected by the residual-learning DGP.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates"
  - [Section 2.3] "Any GP-based model without prior defaults to constant mean in unseen region. Addition of prior makes the model converge to the prior at a specific input compositions rather than one constant value"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus precedent for this specific prior injection technique in materials modeling; represents domain-specific contribution requiring validation
- **Break condition:** When the encoder-decoder prior is poorly trained (e.g., severely overfitted or systematically biased), it misleads the DGP rather than helping it.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-task learning with auxiliary computational properties improves main-task prediction accuracy by exploiting inter-property correlations.
- **Mechanism:** The DGP jointly models all tasks, sharing statistical strength. Auxiliary tasks (e.g., VEC, SFE, Curtin-Varvenne yield strength predictions) provide additional compositional context that informs experimental property predictions.
- **Core assumption:** Material properties in HEAs exhibit physically meaningful correlations (e.g., hardness and yield strength both relate to strengthening mechanisms) that can be leveraged for transfer learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "effectively captures inter-property correlations"
  - [Section 2.3] "HDGP-P-All surpassed the performance of HDGP-P-Main in most of the tasks and it can possibly be attributed to the addition of auxiliary tasks"
  - [corpus] Multi-task learning for uncertainty-aware systems is supported by evidential multi-task learning approaches (Paper ID 95370), though HEA-specific multi-task validation remains limited
- **Break condition:** When auxiliary tasks are noise-corrupted or genuinely uncorrelated with main tasks, they introduce distraction rather than signal, degrading performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Process Regression**
  - Why needed here: DGPs are compositional extensions of GPs. Without understanding mean functions, covariance kernels, and posterior prediction formulas, the hierarchical architecture is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a GP trained on three points, can you sketch how predictive variance changes between and beyond those points?

- **Concept: Variational Inference and ELBO Optimization**
  - Why needed here: Deep GPs have intractable posteriors; the paper uses variational methods with Evidence Lower Bound maximization. Understanding this is essential for debugging training.
  - Quick check question: Why does maximizing ELBO approximate Bayesian inference, and what tradeoff does it introduce compared to exact inference?

- **Concept: Isotopic vs. Heterotopic Multi-Output Data**
  - Why needed here: The BIRDSHOT dataset has incomplete observations (not all properties measured for all compositions). The model must handle missing outputs during training.
  - Quick check question: If Task A is observed at 100 compositions but Task B only at 30, how can a multi-output model leverage the full Task A data to improve Task B predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Composition (8D) → [Prior Encoder-Decoder] → Prior predictions
                     ↓
  Composition (8D) → [DGP Layer 1: 10 latent GPs] → Hidden representation
                     ↓ (reduction parameter controls dim)
  Hidden → [DGP Layer 2: 10 latent GPs] → Multi-task outputs (11 properties)
                     ↓
  Final prediction = DGP output + Prior (if prior-injected variant)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Scale all inputs and outputs (required for numerical stability)
  2. Train encoder-decoder on available data (only for HDGP-P-* variants; use separate train split to prevent leakage)
  3. Configure DGP: 2 layers, 10 latent GPs per layer, reduction parameter via cross-validation
  4. Train via ELBO optimization (gradient-based, implemented in BoTorch)
  5. For prior-injected models: subtract prior from training targets, add back after prediction
  6. Descale outputs to original units for evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Reduction parameter**: Controls latent dimensionality between layers. Lower values = more capacity but higher overfitting risk. Paper uses cross-validation to select.
  - **Prior vs. no-prior**: Prior injection improves out-of-distribution robustness but requires training an additional model and careful split management.
  - **Auxiliary task inclusion**: HDGP-P-All (main + auxiliary) slightly outperforms HDGP-P-Main (main only), suggesting auxiliary tasks help, but benefit is modest.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Constant predictions in sparse regions → Prior not injected or encoder-decoder failed to train
  - Training ELBO decreases but test RMSE increases → Overfitting; increase reduction parameter or reduce latent GP count
  - Large variance across random seeds → Data too sparse for model capacity; reduce complexity
  - Numerical NaN during optimization → Check input/output scaling; reduce learning rate

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate cGP baseline on a single task (e.g., yield strength) to establish RMSE/R² baseline and confirm your GP implementation is correct.
  2. Sweep reduction parameter from 1 to (num_tasks - 1) for HDGP-NP-All, plotting Spearman correlation and RMSE vs. reduction value to identify optimal model capacity.
  3. Run ablation comparing: (a) HDGP-P-All, (b) HDGP-NP-All, (c) encoder-decoder alone, (d) cGP. Quantify the marginal contribution of prior injection vs. hierarchical depth vs. multi-task structure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the integration of domain-specific priors into Deep Gaussian Processes be optimized beyond the residual modeling approach used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that future research should "further optimize the integration of domain-specific prior knowledge."
  - Why unresolved: The current study utilized a specific method of prior injection (subtracting encoder-decoder predictions to model residuals), but did not compare this against other integration architectures.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of different prior integration techniques (e.g., kernel-level fusion vs. mean-function adjustments) demonstrating superior convergence or accuracy over the residual method.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the computational efficiency of the proposed HDGP framework be enhanced to enable application on significantly larger datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion explicitly calls for future work to "enhance computational efficiency to facilitate broader applications of these advanced methods."
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation was limited to a dataset of approximately 100 distinct compositions; the scalability of the two-layered variational DGP to databases with thousands of entries remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks showing training times and memory usage for the HDGP model on datasets an order of magnitude larger, potentially utilizing sparse variational methods.

- **Open Question 3:** Does explicitly propagating the uncertainty of computational descriptors (e.g., SFE, VarvYS) improve the predictive accuracy or uncertainty calibration of the surrogate model?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that computational descriptors like SFE and VEC have "model-form uncertainty" and "inherent uncertainty," but explicitly states that "explicit uncertainty quantification was not included" in the current framework.
  - Why unresolved: The current model treats computational inputs as deterministic values, potentially ignoring the error bounds of the underlying DFT or ML models used to generate them.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis where input descriptors are represented as distributions rather than scalars, comparing the resulting output confidence intervals against the current deterministic input approach.

## Limitations

- The encoder-decoder architecture details are incompletely specified, creating uncertainty about whether reproduced results would match reported performance.
- Data limitations with only ~100 compositions and heterotopic measurements constrain the model's ability to generalize to truly novel compositions.
- The BIRDSHOT dataset is specialized, limiting broader validation of the approach across different material systems.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The superiority of hierarchical DGP over single-layer GP is well-established through clear RMSE and correlation coefficient improvements across multiple properties.
- **Medium confidence:** The contribution of encoder-decoder priors is demonstrated but incompletely specified, preventing full reproducibility without external resources.
- **Medium confidence:** Multi-task learning benefits are shown but modest; the auxiliary tasks' contribution could be more rigorously quantified through ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture specification verification:** Obtain and document the exact encoder-decoder architecture parameters (layers, neurons, activation functions, regularization) to enable complete reproducibility and community validation.

2. **Out-of-distribution robustness test:** Evaluate model performance on compositions significantly different from training data (e.g., extreme elemental fractions) to quantify uncertainty quantification capabilities in truly novel regions.

3. **Cross-system generalization study:** Apply the same modeling approach to a different HEA system or traditional alloy dataset to assess whether hierarchical DGP + prior injection provides consistent advantages across materials domains.
