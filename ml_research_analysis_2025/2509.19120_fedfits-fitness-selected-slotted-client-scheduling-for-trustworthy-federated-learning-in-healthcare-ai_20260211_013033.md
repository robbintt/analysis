# FedFiTS: Fitness-Selected, Slotted Client Scheduling for Trustworthy Federated Learning in Healthcare AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19120
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19120
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Combines fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation to address trust, fairness, and robustness in healthcare AI, achieving better accuracy and resilience than FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow

## Executive Summary
FedFiTS introduces a selective federated learning framework that addresses trust, fairness, and robustness challenges in healthcare AI through a three-phase client selection strategy. The approach combines fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation, progressing through free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation phases. By employing dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling, the framework aims to maintain high-quality model updates while ensuring fair participation and resilience to poisoning attacks.

## Method Summary
FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy: Free-for-All (FFA) training where all clients participate for initial rounds, Natural Selection (NAT) that computes fitness scores and applies threshold filtering, and Slotted Team Participation (STP) that maintains selected teams across multiple rounds. Client fitness is determined by a multi-objective scoring function combining data quantity and model alignment via angular distance metrics. The framework includes adaptive slot reselection based on performance fluctuation detection, with convergence bounds established for both convex and non-convex objectives. Communication-complexity analysis demonstrates improvements over FedAvg.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks
- Achieves higher accuracy (98.9% vs 95.9% at K=200) and faster convergence on MNIST dataset
- Maintains >94% accuracy under 20% poisoned client attack, compared to FedPow's ~91-93%
- Dynamic α configuration achieves ~82% client participation versus 65% for fixed α=0.5

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Three-Phase Client Selection with Slot Persistence
- **Claim:** Achieves faster convergence and better robustness by stabilizing client teams while maintaining quality gates
- **Core assumption:** Client quality is temporally correlated—clients performing well at selection time will continue contributing value for at least one slot duration
- **Evidence:** Three-phase participation strategy with FFA, NAT, and STP phases as described in abstract and Section III.A
- **Break condition:** Rapid client quality fluctuations within slots may retain deteriorating clients; mitigate by setting PFT aggressively low (1-2 rounds of decline)

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Objective Fitness Scoring with Geometric Performance Metric
- **Claim:** Combining data quantity with model alignment via θ angle metric provides better client ranking than single-metric approaches
- **Core assumption:** (Loss, accuracy) plane and angular distance meaningfully capture client-server model alignment for heterogeneous data
- **Evidence:** Mathematical formulation in Section III.A, hyperparameter experiments showing α=0.5, β=0.1 optimal in Section V.E
- **Break condition:** Conflicting loss-accuracy trajectories may misrank clients; mitigate by monitoring θ correlation with validation performance

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Slot Reselection via Performance Fluctuation Detection
- **Claim:** Dynamic slot termination based on performance plateau detection prevents wasted rounds while maintaining team stability
- **Core assumption:** Single-round performance decline (θ decrease) is a reliable early signal of team quality degradation
- **Evidence:** Formal definition of p(t) and switching function h(t+1) in Section III.A, lower β values excluding compromised clients faster in Section V.F
- **Break condition:** Noisy θ fluctuations could trigger premature reselection; mitigate by requiring 2+ consecutive declines or using exponential moving average

## Foundational Learning

- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg) basics:**
  - **Why needed here:** FedFiTS is built atop FedAvg's local-SGD-then-aggregate structure; understanding weight averaging is prerequisite to grasping how selective aggregation modifies it
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why FedAvg aggregates client updates as weighted averages by dataset size, and how this affects convergence under non-IID data?

- **Non-IID data distributions in FL:**
  - **Why needed here:** FedFiTS explicitly addresses "dataset heterogeneity" and "client dissimilarity"; the θ metric and α-β tuning are designed for non-IID settings
  - **Quick check question:** Given 3 clients with class-imbalanced datasets (Client A has 90% class 0, Client B has 90% class 1, Client C is balanced), how would FedAvg's global model behave, and what might FedFiTS's θ scores reveal?

- **Poisoning attacks and Byzantine-robust aggregation:**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims resilience to "data poisoning, adversarial attacks" via threshold-based selection; understanding attack vectors clarifies why NAT and PFT matter
  - **Quick check question:** If an adversary controls 20% of clients and performs label-flipping, which FedFiTS component (FFA, NAT, STP) provides the primary defense, and what assumption about the adversary's behavior does this rely on?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Server maintains global model w(t), computes threshold(t), evaluates θ_k via testset scoring, aggregates selected client weights, tracks p(t) and triggers h(t+1) → Client local training, computes local metrics on testset, returns w_k(t) and θ_k → Selection module implements score calculation, threshold comparison, and team assembly → Slot controller monitors θ(t) trajectory, maintains p(t), enforces MSL/PFT constraints

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Initialization:** Distribute w(0) to all clients; set MSL, PFT, initial α/β
  2. **FFA phase (rounds 1-2):** All clients train; collect w_k and θ_k; compute initial scores and threshold
  3. **NAT phase (end of round 2):** Select clients where score_k ≥ threshold(t); form S_t
  4. **STP phase (rounds 3+):** Only S_t clients train; server monitors θ(t); if p(t) ≥ PFT or t mod MSL = 0, trigger h(t+1)=True and re-run NAT
  5. **Dynamic α (optional):** At each reselection, recompute α per Eq. 18-19

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **MSL (high vs. low):** High MSL favors stability and reduces communication but risks retaining declining teams; low MSL increases overhead but adapts faster
  - **β (openness):** High β allows borderline clients, increasing participation/fairness but admitting potentially noisy updates; low β is stricter, improving robustness
  - **α (dynamic vs. fixed):** Dynamic α adapts to data/performance distribution shifts but adds complexity; fixed α=0.5 is simpler but may misweight in skewed settings

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Participation collapse:** If threshold(t) is too high (β too low), S_t shrinks to a small clique, reducing diversity. Detect by monitoring |S_t|/K ratio; if <0.2 for multiple slots, increase β or enforce minimum participation floor
  - **Stagnant θ:** If θ(t) plateaus without reaching target accuracy, may indicate all selected clients are mediocre. Trigger FFA re-evaluation regardless of MSL/PFT
  - **Poisoning bypass:** If compromised clients consistently score above threshold, NAT is failing. Check if compromised clients have large q_k (dominating score) or low θ_k (mimicking global model); add robust aggregation as fallback

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline comparison on MNIST with non-IID partition:** Implement FedFiTS with MSL=10, PFT=2, α=0.5, β=0.1; compare accuracy and time-to-98% against FedAvg over 100 rounds
  2. **Robustness test with 20% poisoned clients:** Inject label-flipping attack on 20% of clients; compare FedFiTS vs. FedPow degradation under attack
  3. **Ablation on α (fixed vs. dynamic):** Run 3 configurations—(a) fixed α=0.5, (b) fixed α=0.1, (c) dynamic α—on Fashion-MNIST with K=100 clients

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does FedFiTS effectively mitigate disparity in model performance across specific demographic subgroups?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VII states future work requires "explicit evaluation using metrics such as group accuracy balance and disparity reduction," noting that current experiments only utilized client participation ratio as a proxy for fairness
- **Why unresolved:** The paper acknowledges that while participation ratios are balanced, actual predictive performance across diverse patient demographics remains unmeasured
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results reporting group-wise accuracy, demographic parity, or equalized odds on the test datasets

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is FedFiTS resilient to targeted backdoor attacks and gradient inversion techniques?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VII identifies the need to extend security analysis "beyond poisoning resistance to address backdoor attacks and gradient inversion"
- **Why unresolved:** The current robustness evaluation is limited to data/model poisoning; the aggregation mechanism's ability to detect stealthy backdoor triggers or prevent reconstruction of training data from gradients is unknown
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical analysis of backdoor attack success rates and image reconstruction quality metrics when FedFiTS is subjected to these specific attack vectors

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the dynamic selection strategy of FedFiTS affect clinician trust and decision-making adoption in clinical settings?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VI.G posits, "Future research should focus on how clinicians' trust in FL models evolves over time and how model transparency impacts medical decision-making in real-world settings"
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides an algorithmic solution but lacks qualitative or quantitative user studies involving medical professionals
- **What evidence would resolve it:** User studies with healthcare practitioners measuring trust scores, interpretability assessments, and willingness to adopt the AI assistance tool

## Limitations
- Effectiveness relies heavily on assumption that θ_k meaningfully captures client-server alignment, with limited empirical validation
- Key hyperparameters (MSL, PFT, α, β) appear critical but lack systematic sensitivity analysis
- Poisoning attack evaluation shows promising results but attack methodology is underspecified

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental results showing FedFiTS outperforming baselines on accuracy and time-to-target across multiple datasets
- **Medium confidence:** Convergence theory claims (no proof provided), robustness to poisoning (attack methodology unclear)
- **Low confidence:** The theoretical significance of θ_k as a fitness metric, and the generalizability of results beyond tested datasets and hyperparameter settings

## Next Checks
1. **Metric validation:** Conduct ablation studies isolating θ_k's contribution by comparing FedFiTS against variants using alternative fitness metrics (loss-only, accuracy-only, or gradient similarity) on the same datasets
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Systematically sweep MSL ∈ {5, 10, 20}, PFT ∈ {1, 2, 3}, α ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}, β ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5} to quantify performance variance and identify robust defaults
3. **Attack methodology clarification:** Replicate the poisoning experiments with explicit attack parameters (percentage of poisoned clients, attack strategy) and extend to other attack types (gradient poisoning, model replacement) to test generalizability
