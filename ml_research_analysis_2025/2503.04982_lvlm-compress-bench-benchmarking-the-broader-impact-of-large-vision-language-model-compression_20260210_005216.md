# LVLM-Compress-Bench: Benchmarking the Broader Impact of Large Vision-Language Model Compression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04982
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LVLM-Compress-Bench framework evaluates compression impacts on LVLMs, showing group-wise quantization maintains accuracy and trust metrics at 2-bit precision

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LVLM-Compress-Bench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating compression techniques on large vision-language models (LVLMs). The framework systematically assesses both static weight compression using AWQ and dynamic KV cache compression using various quantization schemes across multiple LLaVA variants and ten multi-modal datasets. The study demonstrates that advanced quantization methods, particularly group-wise quantization, can maintain model accuracy and societal trust metrics even at aggressive 2-bit compression levels. The research also reveals that weight quantization and KV cache compression are complementary approaches for maximizing memory efficiency.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates four compression strategies: uniform quantization (KC128VT128), outlier-reduced quantization (KC128VT64), group-wise quantization (KC128VT128), and mixed-precision quantization (KC128VT64). These methods are applied to four LLaVA variants across ten multi-modal datasets including ScienceQA, DocVQA, and MMStar. The evaluation metrics encompass both traditional accuracy measures and novel societal trust assessments. The study uses NVIDIA's Open Source Triton Inference Server for benchmarking and includes comprehensive analysis of memory efficiency trade-offs between different compression approaches.

## Key Results
- Group-wise quantization (g-KC128VT128) maintains accuracy and societal trust metrics even at 2-bit precision
- Weight quantization complements KV cache compression for greater memory savings
- Advanced KV quantization schemes retain performance close to baseline models without significant degradation in trust-related metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of group-wise quantization stems from its ability to preserve local information patterns within each group while reducing precision. By partitioning weights into smaller groups before quantization, the method maintains more fine-grained distinctions compared to uniform quantization. This preservation of local structure is particularly important for multi-modal tasks where visual and textual features must be accurately aligned. The complementary nature of weight and KV cache compression works because they target different memory bottlenecks: weights dominate model size while KV cache dominates inference-time memory usage.

## Foundational Learning
The framework demonstrates that compression techniques which preserve local information structures (like group-wise quantization) are more effective than those that treat all parameters uniformly. This suggests that successful compression requires understanding the inherent structure and information distribution within LVLMs. The finding that KV cache compression and weight compression are complementary indicates that different components of LVLMs have distinct compression characteristics, requiring tailored approaches for each component.

## Architecture Onboarding
The benchmarking framework is designed to be extensible to new LVLM architectures through its modular evaluation pipeline. The core components include: (1) a standardized model loading interface compatible with Hugging Face Transformers, (2) automated dataset preprocessing pipelines for multi-modal inputs, (3) configurable quantization parameter settings, and (4) a unified evaluation harness that collects both accuracy and trust metrics. New architectures can be integrated by implementing the base model interface and specifying model-specific quantization parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How do pruning and low-rank decomposition methods compare to quantization in terms of maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness on Large Vision-Language Models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly states that future work requires a "detailed and comprehensive understanding of various weight and KV compression methods including pruning and low-rank decomposition."
- Why unresolved: The authors restricted the current scope to "plug-and-play" quantization methods, excluding pruning because it typically requires fine-tuning or architectural changes which were out of scope for this initial benchmark.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the LVLM-Compress-Bench framework to include structured/unstructured pruning methods (e.g., SliceGPT) and evaluating them against the same societal and accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for selecting group sizes when performing joint KV cache and weight quantization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 notes that the choice of group size has lower accuracy variance for KV-only compression, but for joint compression "selection of optimal grouping an interesting future research."
- Why unresolved: While the authors identified that group size impacts accuracy by up to ~5% in joint compression scenarios, they did not define a generalized rule or automated method for determining the optimal configuration.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study across varying model sizes and compression budgets to derive a heuristic or adaptive algorithm for optimal group size selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are existing evaluation metrics sufficient to capture the full range of trust and vulnerability risks in compressed LVLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 (Limitations) states, "the evaluation metrics may not be sufficient enough to comprehensively capture the impact of compressed models, to capture the trust and other vulnerability issues."
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge that as compression introduces approximation errors, current benchmarks might miss subtle "parting impacts" or emergent biases not present in the FP16 baseline.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of new stress-test datasets or adversarial metrics specifically designed to surface failure modes unique to low-precision arithmetic in multi-modal models.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on a narrow sample of LVLM architectures (four LLaVA variants) and may not generalize to other compression techniques or model families
- Memory efficiency analysis is based on theoretical calculations rather than real-world deployment measurements
- Societal trust metrics evaluation lacks detailed methodology explanation, making it difficult to assess the robustness of these findings

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The finding that group-wise quantization (g-KC128VT128) maintains accuracy and societal trust metrics at 2-bit precision is supported by comprehensive experimental data across multiple datasets. The comparison between static weight compression and dynamic KV cache compression is methodologically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about the complementary nature of weight and KV cache compression for memory savings are based on theoretical calculations rather than empirical measurements. While the mathematical framework is sound, real-world validation would strengthen these conclusions.

**Low Confidence**: The societal trust metrics evaluation lacks transparency in methodology and validation. Without clear details on how these metrics were collected, scored, and validated across the ten datasets, confidence in these findings remains limited.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Test the compression framework on additional LVLM architectures beyond LLaVA (e.g., MiniGPT, Qwen-VL) to assess generalizability of the findings.

2. **Real-World Deployment Testing**: Measure actual memory usage and inference latency on production hardware rather than theoretical calculations to validate claimed efficiency gains.

3. **Extended Societal Impact Analysis**: Implement a standardized, transparent methodology for evaluating societal trust metrics, including diverse human evaluation panels and documented bias testing across demographic groups.
