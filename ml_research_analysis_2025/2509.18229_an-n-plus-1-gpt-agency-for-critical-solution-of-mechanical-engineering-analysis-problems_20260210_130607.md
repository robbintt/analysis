- Primary result: An N-Plus-1 GPT Agency improves mechanical engineering problem-solving reliability through independent solution generation and critical synthesis, leveraging Condorcet's Jury Theorem to achieve high success rates when individual GPT instances have >50% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an N-Plus-1 GPT Agency architecture that significantly improves the reliability of AI-generated solutions for mechanical engineering analysis problems. The system addresses the fundamental limitation of single GPT instances, which can produce both flawless and flawed solutions with success probabilities around 85%. By generating N independent problem solutions and synthesizing them through critical comparison, the agency demonstrates substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives. The approach provides transparency and pedagogical value by maintaining all solution attempts for inspection while leveraging statistical principles to ensure high confidence in the final recommendation.

## Method Summary
The N-Plus-1 GPT Agency consists of Agent Solve (generating N candidate solutions independently) and Agent Compare (synthesizing results through critical comparison). The method is grounded in Condorcet's Jury Theorem, which states that if a single GPT instance has success probability p > 0.5 for a problem class, aggregating N independent solutions yields a predominant answer that is correct with high probability. The agency processes natural language problem statements with images through an Agent Manage preprocessing stage, then generates N independent solutions using a 4-stage approach (Data Completion → Mathematical Model → Solution Procedure → Verification/Validation). Agent Compare reviews all solutions to identify the Predominant Opinion and can recognize minority solutions that include "missing physics" or valid alternative interpretations of ambiguous problem statements.

## Key Results
- Single GPT instances achieve ~85% success rate on MIT mechanical engineering problems, with notable failures in complex boundary conditions and missing physics
- N-Plus-1 agency with N=10 achieves substantially higher reliability by generating N independent solutions and synthesizing via Predominant Opinion
- Agent Compare can recognize minority solutions that include correct "missing physics" (e.g., thermal radiation) that majority solutions omit
- The framework successfully handles epistemic uncertainty by identifying when multiple distinct solution clusters indicate ambiguous problem statements
- Performance improvements are significant compared to commercial alternatives like Grok Heavy, with added transparency through logging of all N raw solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: If a single GPT instance has a success probability $p > 0.5$ for a given problem class, aggregating $N$ independent solutions yields a predominant answer that is correct with high probability.
- Mechanism: The system relies on **Condorcet's Jury Theorem**. It launches $N$ independent "Agent Solve" instances. If the majority ($>N/2$) converge on the same solution (the Predominant Opinion), the probability of that solution being correct approaches 1 as $N$ increases, provided the individual error rate is below 50%.
- Core assumption: Individual GPT instances perform better than random chance ($p > 0.5$) for the specific engineering domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2... the Predominant... Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution."
  - [section 5.1] Derives the conditional probability $\Pr(\text{Correct}|M_1) = 1 / (1 + (\frac{1-p}{p})^{2M_1-N})$.
  - [corpus] While corpus papers like `arXiv:2504.14681` (Mechatronics Design) explore multi-agent frameworks for task decomposition, they do not explicitly anchor reliability on this specific statistical jury theorem.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the base model's success probability for a problem drops to $\leq 0.5$ (the "Unfavorable Regime"), causing the predominant opinion to likely be incorrect.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A distinct comparison agent can identify correct solutions even when they are minority opinions by recognizing "missing physics" or errors in the majority.
- Mechanism: **Recognition vs. Recollection**. "Agent Compare" reviews all $N$ solutions. While it statistically prefers the Predominant Opinion, it is designed to detect "missing physics" (e.g., omitted thermal radiation) in the majority if a Secondary Opinion explicitly includes it. It is easier for the model to recognize a missing term in a comparison than to recall that term during generation.
- Core assumption: The Compare agent possesses sufficient domain knowledge to audit the solutions and identify specific physical omissions or mathematical errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.4] "Recollection (by Agent Solve) is more difficult than recognition (by Agent Compare)... comparison of two Agent Solve Problem Solution Realizations... will typically elicit an 'Aha' response."
  - [section A.3.1] Describes a case where 1 of 2 realizations included thermal radiation (correct) while the other missed it; Compare recognized the validity of the minority physics.
  - [corpus] `arXiv:2601.01774` discusses direct prediction vs. solver-assisted approaches for equations, validating the difficulty of pure generation (recollection), though it does not model the specific N-vs-1 comparison architecture.
- Break condition: The Compare agent is not critical enough and defaults to the majority opinion even when the majority makes a subtle, systematic error (e.g., incorrect boundary conditions).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple independent realizations expose **epistemic uncertainty** (ambiguity in problem statement) by revealing distinct but valid modeling assumptions.
- Mechanism: **Multimodal Distribution Analysis**. Instead of a single answer, the $N$ solutions form clusters (Equivalence Classes). If multiple distinct clusters appear (e.g., pinned-pinned vs. pinned-free boundary conditions), it signals that the Problem Statement allows for multiple valid interpretations (Data Completions), preventing over-confidence in a single "correct" answer.
- Core assumption: Valid interpretations result in semantically distinct but internally consistent solution clusters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] "Epistemic uncertainty gives rise to different Data Completions and ultimately different Correct Problem Solutions... a multi-modal distribution."
  - [section A.3.2] "PROBRuler" example shows two realizations with different boundary conditions; Agent Compare notes the ambiguity rather than forcing a single recommendation.
  - [corpus] `arXiv:2505.14148` (MM-Agent) notes the open-ended nature of mathematical modeling, supporting the premise that single-solution approaches can miss valid alternative interpretations.
- Break condition: The problem statement is prescriptive enough that valid ambiguity is minimal, making the generation of multiple distinct models a waste of resources.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Condorcet's Jury Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This is the mathematical justification for the "N" in N-Plus-1. You must understand that reliability improves *only* if the individual agent beats random chance ($p > 0.5$).
  - Quick check question: If a GPT model solves a problem correctly only 40% of the time, will running it 10 times and taking the majority vote likely yield the correct answer?

- Concept: **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between "the model is hallucinating" (noise) and "the problem statement is ambiguous" (epistemic) is central to the Agent Compare logic.
  - Quick check question: If 5 agents choose Model A and 5 choose Model B, is this a failure of the agency, or a signal about the problem statement?

- Concept: **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Agents**
  - Why needed here: This architecture uses homogeneous Solver agents (same model, different seeds) but a heterogeneous architecture (Solver vs. Compare). Understanding this distinction is key to debugging.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important that the $N$ Solve agents run independently without sharing context during their generation phase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Agent Manage**: Preprocesses input (text/images)
  - **N × Agent Solve**: Independent parallel runs generating proposed solutions (homogeneous)
  - **Agent Compare**: Synthesizes results, performs outlier analysis, and recommends a solution (heterogeneous)
  - **Agent Grade**: (Proposed future) Independent assessor using a grading template

- Critical path: The **independence** of the $N$ Solve realizations. If seeds are not randomized or temperature is 0, the "jury" collapses to a single voter, defeating the statistical mechanism.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Cost vs. Confidence**: Increasing $N$ increases reliability (per Condorcet) but linearly increases API costs and latency. The paper suggests $N=3$ or $N=4$ may be sufficient for high-performance models (like GPT-5) where $p \approx 1$.
  - **Transparency vs. Opacity**: Unlike Grok Heavy (opaque collaboration), this architecture logs all $N$ raw solutions for pedagogical inspection.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Scattered Realizations**: No predominant opinion (e.g., 10 different answers). Indicates the problem is too hard for the model or deeply ambiguous.
  - **Confident Majority Error**: $p < 0.5$ for the class, leading to a strong consensus on the wrong answer.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline Calibration**: Run Agency on a known problem set (Canon) with $N=10$ to estimate the single-solve success probability ($\hat{p}$). Confirm $\hat{p} > 0.5$ before deployment.
  2. **Missing Physics Test**: Construct a problem where a subtle physical effect (e.g., radiation) is often omitted by standard models. Verify if Agent Compare can "rescue" the correct minority solution from the $N$ bucket.
  3. **Epistemic Uncertainty Probe**: Feed a deliberately ambiguous problem (like PROBRuler) and verify that Agent Compare reports the ambiguity/multimodality rather than hallucinating a false consensus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific interventions in Agent Solve Instructions can effectively correct "Incorrect Prevalent Opinions" caused by systematic errors in pre-training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the risk of incorrect consensus and states: "In this case, our only recourse is to intervene through the mechanism of Agent Solve Instructions. We relegate the design of these 'interventions' to future work."
- Why unresolved: The Agency currently relies on a statistical consensus (Condorcet's Jury Theorem) which fails if the underlying model has a systematic "blind spot" (e.g., missing physics) shared across all N instances.
- What evidence would resolve it: A set of validated instruction heuristics that successfully shift the consensus from an incorrect prevalent opinion to a correct secondary opinion on known "trap" problems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the statistical inference framework be extended to handle multi-part questions and integrate actionable outlier analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "Enhancement of the underlying statistical inference framework, in particular to consider multi-part questions and outlier analysis" as a key item for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current probabilistic framework assumes a single Quantity of Interest (QoI) with a binary Correct/Incorrect outcome; it does not account for partial credit or dependencies in multi-part engineering problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified probabilistic model that provides valid confidence estimates for multi-part problems and demonstrably improves recommendation accuracy by identifying statistical outliers.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does decoupling Agent Compare from Agent Recommend improve the Agency's ability to recognize and synthesize multiple valid solutions (epistemic uncertainty)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes current limitations in handling multiple correct solutions and proposes the "Development of a new Agent Recommend... [so] Agent Compare focuses only on comparison."
- Why unresolved: In the Prototype Agency, comparison and recommendation are merged, leading to rigid recommendations that may fail to acknowledge valid alternative interpretations of ambiguous problem statements.
- What evidence would resolve it: A/B testing showing that the decoupled architecture results in recommendations that explicitly acknowledge and retain valid alternative solution paths more often than the prototype.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can an automated Agent Grade be implemented to reliably apply a Grading Template while maintaining strict isolation from the problem-solving agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work includes the "Development of an Agent Grade which applies Problem Statement Grading Template to evaluate grade G... shared only with User, not other Agency Agents."
- Why unresolved: Reliable automated grading is necessary for scalability, but current LLMs may struggle to consistently apply detailed rubrics without hallucination or bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: An Agent Grade implementation that achieves high correlation with human expert graders across the Problem Statement Canon.

## Limitations
- The statistical mechanism fails if individual GPT instances have success probability ≤ 0.5 for a problem class
- The current architecture may be too rigid in handling epistemic uncertainty, not fully retaining valid alternative solution paths
- Systematic errors shared across all N instances (incorrect prevalent opinions) cannot be corrected without specific intervention heuristics

## Confidence
- Method effectiveness: High
- Statistical framework validity: High
- Practical implementation details: Medium
- Scalability to broader domains: Medium
- Ability to handle all failure modes: Low

## Next Checks
1. Verify that single GPT success probability on MIT mechanical engineering problems exceeds 0.5 before deploying N-Plus-1 agency
2. Test Agent Compare's ability to recognize and rescue minority solutions containing "missing physics" from majority consensus
3. Evaluate whether the agency correctly identifies and reports epistemic uncertainty when problem statements are ambiguous rather than forcing false consensus
