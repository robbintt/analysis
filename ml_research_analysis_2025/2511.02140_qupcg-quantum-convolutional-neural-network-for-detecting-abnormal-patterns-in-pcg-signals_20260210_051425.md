## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QuPCG, a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network for detecting abnormal heart sound patterns in phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The approach converts 1D PCG signals into 2D wavelet images, then compresses them into 8-pixel representations for 8-qubit quantum encoding. The QCNN processes these features through three layers of quantum convolution and pooling, followed by classical optimization. Experiments on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate competitive performance with 93.33% test accuracy and 97.14% training accuracy, showing that quantum models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical signals.

## Method Summary
The QuPCG method employs a hybrid quantum-classical architecture where PCG signals are first transformed into 2D wavelet images through preprocessing. These images are compressed to 8-pixel representations suitable for 8-qubit quantum encoding. The quantum convolutional neural network consists of three layers of quantum convolution and pooling operations, followed by classical optimization layers. The model processes the compact quantum-encoded features to classify S3 and murmur abnormalities. The approach leverages quantum parallelism to capture complex temporal-spectral correlations in the biomedical signals while maintaining computational efficiency through the compressed representation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93.33% test accuracy and 97.14% training accuracy on HLS-CMDS dataset
- First application of QCNN to bioacoustic signal processing
- Demonstrated efficient capture of temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical signals
- 8-qubit encoding successfully processed compressed 2D wavelet representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting quantum superposition and entanglement to process compressed representations of PCG signals. The conversion to 2D wavelet images captures both temporal and spectral features, while the quantum convolutional layers leverage quantum parallelism to identify complex patterns in the compressed 8-pixel representations. The hybrid architecture combines quantum feature extraction with classical optimization, allowing the model to efficiently learn the discriminative patterns between normal and abnormal heart sounds.

## Foundational Learning
- **Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal processing**: Essential for understanding the biomedical context and signal characteristics. Quick check: Verify basic heart sound waveform morphology and S3/murmur patterns.
- **Wavelet transform for biomedical signals**: Needed to understand the preprocessing step that converts 1D signals to 2D representations. Quick check: Confirm wavelet coefficients capture relevant temporal-spectral features.
- **Quantum convolutional neural networks**: Core to understanding the model architecture and quantum operations. Quick check: Review quantum convolution and pooling layer implementations.

- **8-qubit quantum encoding**: Fundamental to the model's compressed representation approach. Quick check: Confirm the mapping from 8-pixel representations to quantum states.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: PCG signal -> Wavelet transform -> 2D image compression (8 pixels) -> 8-qubit quantum encoding -> Quantum convolution & pooling (3 layers) -> Classical optimization -> Classification output

**Critical path**: Signal preprocessing (wavelet + compression) -> Quantum feature extraction (convolution + pooling) -> Classical optimization -> Classification

**Design tradeoffs**: The fixed 8-qubit encoding limits scalability but ensures computational efficiency; quantum layers provide potential parallelism but require careful parameter tuning; hybrid architecture balances quantum advantage with classical reliability.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on larger datasets suggests limited generalization; accuracy gap between training and test indicates potential overfitting; inability to scale beyond 8 qubits constrains applicability to higher-dimensional features.

**First experiments**: 1) Test model sensitivity to different wavelet families and compression ratios; 2) Evaluate performance degradation when increasing quantum layer depth; 3) Compare quantum convolution output distributions with classical counterparts.
