# Towards Secure MLOps: Surveying Attacks, Mitigation Strategies, and Research Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02032
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02032
- Reference count: 40
- Presents systematic application of MITRE ATLAS framework to assess attacks across MLOps ecosystem phases

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the growing security challenges in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) by systematically analyzing attack vectors and mitigation strategies. As MLOps unifies various roles and workflows to accelerate model development and deployment, it introduces new vulnerabilities that can lead to compromised credentials, financial losses, and poisoned training data. The research employs the MITRE ATLAS framework to map attack techniques to specific MLOps phases, supported by real-world incidents and red-teaming exercises.

The study presents a comprehensive threat model capturing attackers with varying knowledge and capabilities, along with a taxonomy of attack techniques and corresponding mitigation strategies. Given MLOps' evolving nature, the paper identifies critical research gaps requiring immediate attention and emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols from the outset to protect against evolving cyber threats.

## Method Summary
The research systematically applies the MITRE ATLAS framework to assess attacks across different phases of the MLOps ecosystem, supplemented by reviews of white and grey literature. The methodology involves reviewing prior work, developing a threat model that captures attackers with different knowledge and capabilities, and presenting a structured taxonomy of attack techniques mapped to MLOps phases. The study supports this taxonomy with examples from red-teaming exercises and real-world incidents, followed by corresponding mitigation strategies. The approach emphasizes practical applicability through actionable early-stage defenses while acknowledging the gradual evolution of MLOps adoption.

## Key Results
- Systematic mapping of attack techniques to MLOps phases using MITRE ATLAS framework
- Comprehensive threat model capturing different attacker knowledge and capability levels
- Taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with attack categories for actionable defenses
- Identification of key research gaps in MLOps security requiring immediate attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic application of the MITRE ATLAS framework provides a structured approach to understanding MLOps security threats by mapping known attack techniques to specific phases of the MLOps lifecycle. This methodology works because it leverages an established cybersecurity framework while adapting it to the unique characteristics of ML workflows, capturing both technical vulnerabilities and operational risks across the unified MLOps ecosystem.

## Foundational Learning

1. **MITRE ATLAS Framework** - A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations, adapted for ML systems. Why needed: Provides standardized vocabulary for describing attacks across MLOps phases. Quick check: Verify framework covers all MLOps lifecycle stages.

2. **Threat Modeling in MLOps** - Process of identifying potential attackers, their capabilities, and attack vectors specific to ML workflows. Why needed: Establishes baseline understanding of security risks in unified ML operations. Quick check: Confirm model accounts for both internal and external threat actors.

3. **Attack Surface Analysis** - Systematic identification of vulnerabilities across data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring phases. Why needed: Reveals how a single misconfiguration can compromise entire MLOps pipeline. Quick check: Map each attack vector to specific MLOps components.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Model Training -> Model Deployment -> Monitoring -> Feedback Loop

**Critical Path**: The model training phase represents the most critical security vulnerability point, where poisoned data or compromised credentials can irreversibly affect model behavior and downstream deployments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The unified nature of MLOps enables efficiency but creates single points of failure; security measures must balance operational agility with comprehensive protection across all phases.

**Failure Signatures**: Compromised credentials manifest as unauthorized access to training data or model artifacts; poisoned data shows as degraded model performance or unexpected predictions; supply chain attacks appear as tampered dependencies or malicious code injection.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test MITRE ATLAS mapping against real MLOps incident data to validate coverage
2. Implement proposed mitigation strategies in a controlled MLOps environment to measure effectiveness
3. Conduct red-teaming exercises simulating different attacker capability levels on MLOps pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several critical research gaps requiring immediate attention, though specific open questions are not explicitly enumerated in the provided content. The gradual evolution and adoption of MLOps presents ongoing challenges in identifying emerging attack vectors, developing adaptive mitigation strategies, and establishing industry-wide security standards that can keep pace with technological advancements.

## Limitations

- Taxonomy relies heavily on documented incidents and existing threat models, potentially missing emerging attack vectors unique to evolving MLOps practices
- Focus on systematic categorization may underemphasize practical implementation challenges and real-world effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies
- Threat model assumes clear attacker knowledge boundaries that may not reflect complex multi-stakeholder MLOps environments where internal actors blur distinctions

## Confidence

- **High**: Systematic mapping of attacks to MLOps phases using MITRE ATLAS framework
- **Medium**: Proposed taxonomy of mitigation strategies and their practical applicability
- **Medium**: Identification of research gaps and future challenges

## Next Checks

1. Validate the taxonomy against real-world MLOps incident data from multiple organizations to ensure comprehensive coverage of attack vectors
2. Conduct empirical testing of proposed mitigation strategies in controlled MLOps environments to assess effectiveness
3. Survey MLOps practitioners to evaluate the practical applicability and completeness of the threat model's attacker capabilities and knowledge assumptions
