# Measuring Uncertainty in Transformer Circuits with Effective Information Consistency

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.07149
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07149
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Introduces EICS, a single-pass, white-box metric that quantifies coherence and uncertainty in transformer circuits using sheaf inconsistency and Gaussian causal emergence.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS), a white-box metric for quantifying coherence and uncertainty in transformer circuits. The method combines normalized sheaf inconsistency (derived from local Jacobians and activations) with a Gaussian proxy for circuit-level causal emergence. EICS provides a dimensionless score in [0,1] that indicates whether a circuit is functioning coherently: high scores suggest strong causal integrity with low internal disagreement, while low scores indicate potential incoherence or uncertainty. The approach offers a mechanistic alternative to black-box uncertainty quantification methods, directly attributing uncertainty to specific circuit behaviors.

## Method Summary
EICS measures circuit coherence by combining two components: a normalized sheaf inconsistency measure (C_sh) that quantifies internal disagreement between edge Jacobians and activations, and a Gaussian proxy for causal emergence (g∆EIG) that captures the circuit's overall causal capacity. The method operates in a single forward pass, extracting local Jacobians from the transformer and computing both components using efficient Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) schemes. The final score is dimensionless and interpretable, with higher values indicating more coherent circuit behavior and lower uncertainty. Computationally, EICS can be evaluated in O(|V_M|) Jacobian-vector products using a node-seeded JVP scheme, with optional fast/exact modes for the Gaussian EI proxy.

## Key Results
- EICS provides a single-pass, white-box uncertainty metric for transformer circuits that directly attributes uncertainty to specific circuit behaviors
- Theoretical analysis establishes stability properties and practical guidance for interpretation and computational efficiency
- Toy sanity-check demonstrates that EICS decreases as noise increases in circuit edges, matching intuitive expectations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EICS works by measuring two complementary aspects of circuit behavior: internal consistency and causal capacity. The sheaf inconsistency component detects when different parts of the circuit are disagreeing about the computation, similar to how mismatched puzzle pieces indicate an incomplete or incorrect solution. The Gaussian causal emergence proxy measures the circuit's overall ability to influence downstream activations, capturing whether the circuit is actually doing meaningful computation rather than just passing information through. By combining these measures, EICS provides a comprehensive assessment of both whether the circuit is internally coherent and whether it's having a meaningful causal impact.

## Foundational Learning

**Sheaf Theory**
- Why needed: Provides the mathematical framework for measuring consistency across local data (edge Jacobians) and global constraints (circuit flow)
- Quick check: Can you explain what a sheaf is in one sentence? (A tool for tracking how local data patches agree when glued together)

**Jacobian-Vector Products (JVPs)**
- Why needed: Efficiently compute directional derivatives without forming full Jacobians, crucial for scalability
- Quick check: Can you implement a JVP for a simple linear layer?

**Causal Emergence**
- Why needed: Quantifies the circuit's ability to influence downstream activations, distinguishing meaningful computation from information flow
- Quick check: Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation in one sentence?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Transformer Forward Pass -> Edge Jacobians Extraction -> Node-Jacobian JVPs -> Sheaf Inconsistency (C_sh) + Gaussian EI Proxy (g∆EIG) -> EICS Score

**Critical Path**
1. Forward pass to record activations
2. Extract edge Jacobians for all circuit edges
3. Compute C_sh using node-seeded JVPs
4. Compute g∆EIG using macro-Jacobian and node Jacobians
5. Combine to get final EICS score

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Single-pass vs multi-pass: EICS trades some accuracy for computational efficiency
- Exact vs approximate: Gaussian proxy vs true intervention-based EI
- White-box vs black-box: Mechanistic attribution vs opaque uncertainty scores

**Failure Signatures**
- Memory blowout: Explicit Jacobian computation fails on large layers
- Spectral gap collapse: Disconnected subgraphs or zero Jacobians
- Saturation: Large α values may cause score compression

**First Experiments**
1. Run the provided toy sanity-check code and verify EICS decreases with increasing noise
2. Apply EICS to a small, well-understood circuit (e.g., induction head) and check if scores correlate with known functional outcomes
3. Compare EICS against black-box uncertainty methods on the same circuits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Empirical Validation Gap**
The paper explicitly states that empirical validation on LLM tasks is deferred. While the theoretical framework and toy examples are provided, there's no demonstration that EICS reliably discriminates between trustworthy and untrustworthy outputs in real transformer models. The proposed validation protocol for factual QA tasks remains untested.

**Circuit Identification Sensitivity**
EICS is only as meaningful as the specified circuit subgraph G_M. The paper doesn't analyze how errors or incompleteness in circuit identification affect the metric's reliability. Misspecified or partially-identified circuits could lead to misleading EICS scores.

**Nonlinear Approximation Fidelity**
The method assumes local linearity and uses a Gaussian EI proxy rather than true intervention-defined EI. The approximation quality for nonlinear transformer circuits remains untested beyond the linear toy example, raising questions about accuracy in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation on real LLM circuits or downstream tasks
- Computationally intensive Jacobian operations may limit scalability
- Metric reliability depends heavily on accurate circuit identification
- Gaussian approximation may not capture nonlinear circuit behaviors

## Confidence

**High** in mathematical formulation and sheaf-theoretic foundation
**Medium** in theoretical stability analysis and computational complexity claims
**Low** in empirical performance and practical utility without real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. Apply EICS to a known transformer circuit (e.g., induction head) in a pre-trained model and compare the score to known functional outcomes
2. Benchmark the Hutchinson/Lanczos approximations against exact computation on small circuits to quantify accuracy and speedup
3. Test EICS sensitivity to different subgraph selections (e.g., including/excluding key nodes) to see if the metric reliably captures functional coherence
