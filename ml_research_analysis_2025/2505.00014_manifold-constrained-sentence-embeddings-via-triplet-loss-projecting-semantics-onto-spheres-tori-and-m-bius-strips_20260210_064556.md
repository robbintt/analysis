# Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Manifold-constrained embeddings outperform traditional methods, with sphere embeddings achieving 0.7705 Silhouette Score and 0.9988 accuracy on AG News

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to sentence embeddings by constraining them to continuous manifolds—specifically the unit sphere, torus, and Möbius strip—using triplet loss as the training objective. The method enforces geometric constraints during training to produce embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured. Experiments on AG News and MBTI datasets show that manifold-constrained embeddings outperform traditional methods like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained Keras embeddings. The sphere-constrained embeddings achieved the highest Silhouette Score of 0.7705 on AG News, with near-perfect classification accuracy across multiple classifiers. The Möbius and torus embeddings also showed improved clustering and classification performance. These results demonstrate the value of embedding in manifold space, where topological structure complements semantic separation, offering a new direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

## Method Summary
The method constrains sentence embeddings to continuous manifolds (sphere, torus, Möbius strip) using triplet loss. The architecture consists of an embedding layer followed by mean pooling, a projection layer, and a manifold constraint layer. Sphere constraints use L2 normalization, torus constraints use parametric periodic functions, and Möbius constraints use twisted coordinate projection. The triplet loss objective encourages the learning of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured. The approach is evaluated on AG News (4-class news categorization) and MBTI datasets (personality typing), with metrics including Silhouette Score for clustering quality and classification accuracy across multiple classifiers.

## Key Results
- Sphere embeddings achieved 0.7705 Silhouette Score on AG News, outperforming TF-IDF (0.5302), Word2Vec (0.6757), and unconstrained embeddings (0.6947)
- Sphere embeddings achieved 0.9988 accuracy across Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers on AG News
- All manifold-constrained methods outperformed baselines on AG News, with torus (-0.056) and sphere (-0.059) showing better clustering on MBTI despite negative scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Manifold constraints act as geometric regularizers that bound the embedding space and prevent arbitrary drift.
- **Mechanism:** By projecting embeddings onto compact manifolds (sphere via L2 normalization, torus via periodic functions, Möbius via twisted coordinate projection), the model enforces topological structure that constrains where embeddings can lie. This prevents embeddings from spreading unboundedly in Euclidean space.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic relationships in language have intrinsic geometric properties that can be captured by specific manifold topologies.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "constrains sentence embeddings to lie on continuous manifolds — specifically the unit sphere, torus, and Möbius strip"
  - [Section 3.3]: Explicit formulas for fsphere(x), ftorus(x), fmobius(x) show how constraints are applied
  - [Section 7.1]: "guarantees that the resulting embedding space remains bounded, differentiable, and topologically structured"
  - [corpus]: Related work on contrastive loss (arxiv:2510.02161) suggests triplet loss variance behavior is still being studied—manifold constraints may provide implicit regularization that complements this
- **Break condition:** If semantic structure in a domain lacks the geometric properties assumed (e.g., purely hierarchical relationships), manifold projection may not help or could degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Triplet loss combined with manifold projection creates cleaner class boundaries by operating in a constrained metric space.
- **Mechanism:** Triplet loss minimizes anchor-positive distance while maximizing anchor-negative distance with margin α. When embeddings are already constrained to a manifold, the distance metric operates on a structured surface rather than unbounded Euclidean space, leading to more discriminative separation.
- **Core assumption:** The margin α and manifold geometry are compatible—distances on the manifold remain meaningful for the triplet objective.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "using triplet loss as the core training objective... encourages the learning of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured"
  - [Section 3.2]: Ltriplet formula with explicit margin α
  - [Section 5.2]: Sphere embeddings achieve 0.9988 accuracy across all classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
  - [corpus]: arxiv:2510.02161 compares contrastive and triplet loss optimization behavior, noting variance differences—this paper's results should be interpreted with awareness that loss function choice affects optimization dynamics
- **Break condition:** If triplet sampling is poor (hard negatives not sufficiently challenging), manifold constraints alone cannot fix semantic confusion.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Different manifold topologies capture qualitatively different linguistic structures, with sphere providing isotropic compactness and Möbius/torus capturing cyclic or twisted relationships.
- **Mechanism:** Sphere normalization promotes uniform angular distribution; torus periodic functions capture cyclical patterns; Möbius twist captures polarity inversions. Each manifold's differential geometry encodes structural priors.
- **Core assumption:** Language contains cyclic, periodic, or non-orientable semantic relationships that Euclidean spaces cannot efficiently represent.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 7.1]: Lists specific benefits—"Spheres: Promote isotropic distribution... Tori: Capture cyclic relationships... Möbius strips: Model non-orientable semantic continua"
  - [Section 6.1]: On MBTI dataset, torus (-0.056) and sphere (-0.059) outperform other methods in Silhouette Score, though all are negative
  - [Section A.2-A.3]: Mathematical formulations show how periodic (torus) and twisted (Möbius) structures are constructed
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—related papers focus on contrastive learning rather than manifold topology. The claim that specific topologies match specific linguistic structures remains largely theoretical in this work.
- **Break condition:** Empirical validation on MBTI shows negative Silhouette Scores across all methods, suggesting complex subjective text may not benefit equally from these topological priors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Triplet Loss and Metric Learning**
  - Why needed here: The entire training objective relies on understanding how anchor-positive-negative sampling works and why margin α matters for creating separable embeddings.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why triplet loss requires semi-hard negative mining to avoid collapsed embeddings?

- **Concept: Differential Geometry Basics (Manifolds, Normals, Curvature)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why projecting onto S^(d-1) differs from unconstrained Euclidean space, and what "non-orientable" means for Möbius strips.
  - Quick check question: What does L2 normalization do to the gradient flow during backpropagation, and why might this act as regularization?

- **Concept: Silhouette Score and Clustering Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper's primary metric for embedding quality is Silhouette Score; understanding its range [-1, 1] and interpretation is essential for evaluating results.
  - Quick check question: Why might a Silhouette Score of 0.77 on AG News but negative scores on MBTI indicate about the datasets' respective semantic structures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input tokens → Embedding Layer → Pooling Layer → Projection Layer → Manifold Constraint Layer → Triplet Loss

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement standard Keras embedding + pooling pipeline first
  2. Add triplet loss with functional anchor-positive-negative sampling
  3. Insert manifold projection layer after projection layer, before loss computation
  4. Verify gradients flow through manifold constraint (normalization is differentiable)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Sphere vs. Torus vs. Möbius:** Sphere is simplest (just L2 norm); torus/Möbius require more compute and hyperparameters (radii R, r). Start with sphere.
  - **Embedding dimension:** Paper uses 3D for visualization, but higher dimensions may be needed for real tasks. Trade-off between interpretability and expressiveness.
  - **Triplet sampling strategy:** Paper does not specify mining strategy. Random sampling may suffice for clean datasets (AG News); semi-hard mining likely needed for noisy data (MBTI).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Negative Silhouette Scores despite training convergence → manifold prior mismatch with data structure
  - High classifier accuracy but poor clustering → embeddings are discriminative but not geometrically coherent
  - Gradient instability with torus/Möbius → periodic functions can create gradient discontinuities; check numerical stability

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Implement sphere-constrained embeddings on AG News with triplet loss; target Silhouette Score > 0.7. If achieved, pipeline is working.
  2. **Ablation on manifold choice:** Compare sphere vs. torus vs. Möbius vs. unconstrained on same data. Expect sphere > others on AG News based on paper results.
  3. **Dataset sensitivity test:** Apply same pipeline to MBTI or another subjective dataset. If Silhouette Scores remain negative across all manifolds, confirms domain-dependent effectiveness (as paper shows).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can geodesic-based loss functions, which compute distances along manifold surfaces, outperform Euclidean triplet loss for manifold-constrained sentence embeddings?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Instead of Euclidean distance, loss functions will be defined using geodesic distances computed along the manifold surface."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current framework applies triplet loss using Euclidean distance even after manifold projection; the theoretical advantage of intrinsic manifold distances remains untested.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments training with geodesic triplet loss versus Euclidean triplet loss on the same manifolds, measuring Silhouette Scores and classification accuracy.

- **Question:** Can adaptive manifold selection—jointly learning the optimal manifold type or curvature with the embedding model—outperform fixed, manually specified manifolds?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "We also aim to explore learning the underlying manifold type or curvature jointly with the model to enable more expressive, data-driven geometry selection."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current work requires manually choosing sphere, torus, or Möbius strip a priori; no mechanism exists to infer which topology best suits a given dataset or task.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments with a learnable manifold parameterization that dynamically selects geometry, compared against fixed manifold baselines on diverse NLP tasks.

- **Question:** How do manifold-constrained embeddings compare against modern transformer-based sentence embeddings (e.g., BERT, SimCSE) rather than only classical baselines?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper compares against TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained Keras embeddings but does not benchmark against state-of-the-art contextualized representations.
  - **Why unresolved:** Strong results against weak baselines do not establish whether manifold constraints provide additive value over modern pre-trained sentence encoders.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Direct comparison of manifold-projected embeddings versus SimCSE, BERT-[CLS], or Sentence-BERT on the same downstream classification and clustering tasks.

- **Question:** What linguistic or dataset properties predict which manifold geometry (sphere, torus, Möbius) will be most effective?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Sphere embeddings excelled on AG News (factual, categorical) while all manifolds struggled on MBTI (subjective, overlapping), but the paper offers no principled explanation for when each manifold is appropriate.
  - **Why unresolved:** The connection between manifold topology and semantic structure in text remains intuitive rather than empirically characterized.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic experiments across datasets with known properties (hierarchical, cyclical, sentiment-polar) correlating performance with manifold choice, or analysis probing what linguistic features each manifold captures.

## Limitations

- Negative Silhouette Scores on MBTI (-0.056 to -0.059) across all methods suggest topological priors may not generalize to subjective or noisy text domains
- Limited ablation studies on why specific manifolds (torus vs. Möbius) perform differently and no comparison against other structured embedding approaches
- Only two datasets tested (news classification and personality typing), both with specific characteristics, limiting generalization claims

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Sphere embeddings outperforming baselines on AG News (0.7705 Silhouette Score, 0.9988 accuracy) — results are internally consistent and supported by clear evaluation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that Möbius/torus embeddings capture cyclic/non-orientable relationships — theoretical justification exists but empirical validation is limited to single datasets
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to other NLP tasks — only two datasets tested, both with specific characteristics

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on manifold choice**: Replicate the AG News experiment comparing sphere vs. torus vs. Möbius vs. unconstrained embeddings using identical triplet sampling and hyperparameters to verify the claimed performance ordering holds

2. **Alternative structured spaces**: Test hyperbolic embeddings or hierarchical clustering constraints as comparators to determine if manifold constraints provide unique benefits beyond general structured regularization

3. **Dataset diversity test**: Apply the pipeline to a third dataset with different characteristics (e.g., biomedical text, legal documents, or sentiment analysis) to assess robustness across domains beyond news and personality typing
