# Crash Severity Prediction Using Deep Learning Approaches: A Hybrid CNN-RNN Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04316
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Hybrid CNN-RNN achieved 72% accuracy, 73% precision, and 72.9% recall on 4-class crash severity prediction

## Executive Summary
This study presents a hybrid CNN-RNN deep learning framework for predicting traffic crash severity using a dataset of 15,870 accidents from Virginia I-64 highway (2015-2021). The proposed hybrid model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for temporal dependencies to predict four crash severity levels: fatal, non-fatal, suspected serious injury, and minor/possible injury. When compared against logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, naive Bayes, standalone RNN, and CNN models, the hybrid CNN-RNN achieved superior performance with 72% accuracy, 73% precision, and 72.9% recall.

## Method Summary
The study used 15,870 crash records from Virginia I-64 highway (2015-2021) with 11 selected features including First Harmful Event, Vehicle Count, Road Type, Weather Condition, Belt Condition, Light Condition, Alcohol Condition, Area Type, Traffic Control Device, Young Driver Condition, and Night. The methodology involved converting categorical variables to binary dummy variables then to time series format, applying Extra Trees classifier for feature selection (importance threshold >0.025), and using synthetic data generation to address class imbalance. The hybrid CNN-RNN architecture consisted of 6 layers with 64 model dimension, 50 epochs, ReLU and SoftMax activations, and 0.002 dropout. The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics against multiple baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Hybrid CNN-RNN achieved 72% accuracy, 73% precision, and 72.9% recall on test set
- Model demonstrated 4% higher accuracy than standalone RNN and 21% higher accuracy than standalone CNN
- Showed improvements of 10% and 25% in recall compared to RNN and CNN respectively
- Effectively addressed class imbalance through synthetic data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The hybrid CNN-RNN architecture improves crash severity prediction by combining feature extraction with sequential processing.
- Mechanism: CNN layers act as learnable feature extractors from the input representation, producing embeddings that are then passed to RNN layers which model sequential dependencies across the transformed features.
- Core assumption: Crash records, when converted to a sequence-like format, contain learnable spatial and temporal patterns that correlate with severity outcomes.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "hybrid model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for temporal dependencies"; [section] "The input data is first fed into the CNN module, where features are extracted. These features are then passed as input to the RNN module to predict the severity level of the crash."
- Break condition: If crash data lacks inherent sequential structure, the RNN component may overfit to noise rather than meaningful temporal dependencies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synthetic data generation mitigates class imbalance and improves minority class (fatal crashes) prediction.
- Mechanism: A generative model learns the distribution of minority class samples and creates synthetic examples until all severity classes have similar representation, reducing classifier bias toward majority classes.
- Core assumption: Synthetic samples preserve the statistical properties and feature correlations of real minority-class crashes.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "hybrid approach effectively addressed class imbalance through synthetic data generation"; [section] "A generative model is developed by analyzing the existing data points and learning the characteristics and patterns of the minority group."
- Break condition: If synthetic samples introduce artifacts or violate real-world feature correlations, the model learns spurious patterns that do not generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Deep learning models outperform traditional statistical methods by capturing non-linear interactions among crash-related variables.
- Mechanism: Multiple layers with non-linear activations learn hierarchical representations that capture complex feature interactions without predefined distributional assumptions.
- Core assumption: Crash severity depends on non-linear combinations of features that statistical models with fixed assumptions cannot capture.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Deep learning models have gained popularity in this domain due to their capability to capture non-linear relationships among variables"; [section] "The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of the CNN-RNN hybrid model in predicting crash severity levels."
- Break condition: If the true relationships are approximately linear or if the dataset is too small, deep models may overfit without meaningful generalization gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sequence modeling for tabular data**
  - Why needed here: The paper converts categorical crash variables into "time series" format for RNN processing, but does not justify what temporal ordering means in this context.
  - Quick check question: If you shuffle the rows of crash data before training, does model performance change?

- **Concept: Class imbalance in multi-class classification**
  - Why needed here: Fatal crashes represent only ~0.5% of the dataset; without rebalancing, classifiers would optimize for majority classes (minor/no injury).
  - Quick check question: After synthetic oversampling, what is the new class distribution, and do synthetic samples pass a similarity test against real minority samples?

- **Concept: Feature selection via ensemble methods**
  - Why needed here: The extra trees classifier reduced 45 variables to ~12 features with importance scores >0.025.
  - Quick check question: Does removing low-importance features improve or degrade validation accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input layer -> CNN module -> RNN module -> Fully connected + SoftMax -> Output layer (4 severity classes)
- **Critical path:** Data preprocessing (categorical → binary dummy variables → sequence format) → Extra trees feature selection → Synthetic oversampling → CNN feature extraction → RNN sequential processing → SoftMax classification
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Depth vs. data size: 6 layers on ~16K samples is relatively deep; risk of overfitting
  - Synthetic data vs. real distribution: Oversampling may introduce bias if synthetic samples deviate from real crash patterns
  - Hybrid vs. standalone: Hybrid adds complexity; the 4-21% accuracy gain over RNN/CNN alone must be weighed against training cost and interpretability loss
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High training accuracy but low validation recall on fatal crashes → likely overfitting to synthetic minority samples
  - Similar performance with shuffled vs. ordered data → RNN component not learning meaningful sequences
  - Precision/recall gap widens after oversampling → synthetic samples may not match real distribution
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation study:** Compare hybrid CNN-RNN vs. CNN-only vs. RNN-only on the same data (already done in paper; verify reproducibility with shuffled data).
  2. **Sequence validity test:** Train the model with randomly ordered input rows; if performance unchanged, the RNN's "temporal" component is not contributing meaningfully.
  3. **Synthetic data audit:** Visualize feature distributions of real vs. synthetic fatal crash samples; measure divergence to assess whether synthetic samples are realistic.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Paper lacks clarity on how tabular crash data is converted into sequence format for RNN processing
- Synthetic data generation method is not specified, raising concerns about sample quality
- With only 81 fatal crashes in the dataset, improved recall on this minority class may reflect overfitting to synthetic samples

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in superiority of hybrid CNN-RNN over traditional statistical methods for capturing non-linear feature interactions
- **Medium confidence** in effectiveness of synthetic data generation for addressing class imbalance, pending verification of synthetic sample quality
- **Low confidence** in meaningfulness of RNN component's temporal processing, as the paper does not justify sequential structure of tabular crash data

## Next Checks
1. **Sequence validity test**: Train the model with randomly shuffled input rows; if performance remains unchanged, the RNN's temporal component is not learning meaningful sequences.
2. **Synthetic data audit**: Compare feature distributions and nearest-neighbor distances between real and synthetic fatal crash samples to verify that oversampling preserves minority class characteristics.
3. **Ablation study**: Compare hybrid CNN-RNN performance against CNN-only and RNN-only models on the same data to quantify the actual contribution of the hybrid architecture.
