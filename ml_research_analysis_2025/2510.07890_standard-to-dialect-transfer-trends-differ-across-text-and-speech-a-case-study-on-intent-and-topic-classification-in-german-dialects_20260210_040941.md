core_contribution: 'Research on transferring from a standard language to a non-standard
  dialect has focused on text, but dialects are primarily spoken and text models struggle
  with non-standard spellings. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer across three
  settings: text-only, speech-only, and cascaded (automatic transcription followed

# Standard-to-Dialect Transfer Trends Differ across Text and Speech: A Case Study on Intent and Topic Classification in German Dialects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07890
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Speech-only models are more robust to dialectal variation than text models for German dialects

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates standard-to-dialect transfer for intent and topic classification in German dialects, comparing three settings: text-only, speech-only, and cascaded (ASR followed by text classification). The authors release the first dialectal audio intent dataset for German. Their findings reveal that speech-only models outperform other approaches when processing dialectal input, while text-only models work best on standard German data. The study demonstrates that cascaded systems can outperform text-only models if the ASR effectively normalizes dialectal input, though they still lag behind speech-only approaches for German dialects.

## Method Summary
The study compares standard-to-dialect transfer across three experimental settings using German and its dialects. The text-only approach uses pre-trained language models fine-tuned on dialectal text data. The speech-only approach employs speech models trained directly on audio dialect data. The cascaded approach first transcribes dialectal speech using ASR, then applies text classification. The authors create a novel dialectal audio intent dataset for German and evaluate all three approaches on both intent and topic classification tasks. They analyze performance differences across standard versus dialectal input and examine robustness to dialectal variation.

## Key Results
- Speech-only models achieve the best performance on dialectal input data
- Text-only models perform best when processing standard German data
- Cascaded systems can outperform text-only models for dialectal input if ASR normalizes the data effectively
- Speech-only models demonstrate greater robustness to dialectal variation than text models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The observed performance differences stem from how different modalities process linguistic variation. Speech-only models process continuous audio signals that naturally capture phonetic variations across dialects without being constrained by orthographic conventions. Text models, conversely, must work with pre-defined token representations that struggle with non-standard spellings common in dialectal text. Cascaded systems can benefit from ASR normalization that maps dialectal pronunciations to standard spellings, effectively bridging the gap between spoken and written forms.

## Foundational Learning
- Dialectal variation in German: Understanding regional pronunciation and lexical differences is essential for interpreting why transfer learning approaches succeed or fail differently across modalities. Quick check: Can you identify key phonetic differences between standard German and major dialects?
- Speech representation learning: Knowledge of how speech models encode acoustic features helps explain their robustness to dialectal variation. Quick check: What acoustic features do speech models typically learn that help distinguish dialects?
- ASR normalization capabilities: Understanding how automatic speech recognition systems handle dialectal input is crucial for interpreting cascaded system performance. Quick check: What types of normalization do modern ASR systems apply to dialectal speech?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Speech data -> Speech model OR ASR -> Text normalization -> Text model
Critical path: Audio input → Feature extraction → Classification output (speech-only) OR Audio input → ASR transcription → Text normalization → Text classification (cascaded)
Design tradeoffs: Speech-only models avoid orthographic ambiguity but require more computational resources; cascaded systems leverage powerful text models but depend on ASR quality; text-only models are computationally efficient but struggle with dialectal variation
Failure signatures: Speech-only models fail on noisy audio; cascaded systems fail when ASR produces erroneous transcriptions; text-only models fail on non-standard spellings and vocabulary
First experiments: 1) Compare baseline performance on standard vs. dialectal data; 2) Test ASR accuracy on dialectal speech; 3) Evaluate the impact of different text normalization strategies in cascaded systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on German dialects, limiting generalizability to other language families
- The dataset covers a limited set of intents and topics, potentially constraining generalizability of findings
- The study does not address potential biases in ASR systems' ability to normalize different dialectal features

## Confidence
High confidence: Speech-only models are more robust to dialectal variation than text models
Medium confidence: Cascaded systems can outperform text-only models when ASR normalizes dialectal input effectively

## Next Checks
1. Test comparative performance across additional German dialects not represented in the current dataset to assess robustness to wider dialectal variation
2. Evaluate whether observed advantages of speech-only models persist when using more diverse classification tasks beyond intent and topic classification
3. Conduct ablation studies on cascaded systems to quantify the contribution of ASR normalization versus other factors in improving dialectal classification performance
