# Beat-ssl: Capturing Local ECG Morphology through Heartbeat-level Contrastive Learning with Soft Targets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16147
- Reference count: 26
- Achieved 93% of foundation model performance with 31.8× less pretraining data

## Executive Summary
Beat-SSL introduces a contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that captures both global rhythm-level and local heartbeat-level contexts using soft targets derived from feature similarity. The method addresses limited labeled ECG data by leveraging self-supervised pretraining with physiologically-inspired augmentations in the VCG domain. Beat-SSL employs dual-level contrasting with soft similarity targets ranging from 0 to 1, rather than binary labels, to better capture continuous feature relationships. The approach demonstrates that incorporating heartbeat-level local context with soft targets enables effective representation learning for both global rhythm assessment and precise local morphology analysis in ECG signals.

## Method Summary
Beat-SSL is a contrastive learning framework that captures local ECG morphology through heartbeat-level context using soft targets. The method leverages self-supervised pretraining with physiologically-inspired augmentations in the vectorcardiogram (VCG) domain to address limited labeled ECG data. It employs dual-level contrasting with soft similarity targets (ranging from 0 to 1) rather than binary labels, allowing for better capture of continuous feature relationships. The framework is designed to learn representations that are effective for both global rhythm assessment and precise local morphology analysis in ECG signals.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93% of foundation model performance that was pretrained on 31.8× more data for multilabel classification
- Outperformed all other methods by 4% on ECG segmentation tasks
- Demonstrated effective representation learning for both global rhythm assessment and precise local morphology analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The soft target approach (0-1 similarity scores) provides continuous feature relationships rather than binary distinctions, better capturing the physiological continuity in ECG morphology. The dual-level contrasting mechanism allows the model to learn both global rhythm patterns and local heartbeat-specific features simultaneously. The physiologically-inspired VCG domain augmentations help the model learn invariant representations that generalize across different patient populations and acquisition conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- Vectorcardiogram (VCG) domain: Converts 3-lead ECG signals into vector representations; needed for physiologically-inspired augmentations that capture spatial relationships
- Contrastive learning: Self-supervised method that learns representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar samples; needed to leverage unlabeled ECG data effectively
- Soft similarity targets: Continuous similarity scores between 0-1 rather than binary labels; needed to capture the continuous nature of physiological feature relationships
- Dual-level contrasting: Learning at both global rhythm and local heartbeat levels; needed for comprehensive ECG representation learning
- Self-supervised pretraining: Learning representations without labels; needed to address limited labeled ECG data

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input ECG -> VCG Transformation -> Augmentation Layer -> Encoder Network -> Contrastive Loss (Global) -> Contrastive Loss (Local) -> Soft Similarity Targets

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from input ECG through VCG transformation and augmentation to the encoder network, where dual-level contrastive losses operate simultaneously with soft similarity targets to produce the final representations.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Soft vs binary targets: Soft targets capture continuous relationships but require more complex loss functions
- Global vs local contrasting: Dual-level approach captures comprehensive context but increases computational complexity
- VCG vs direct ECG processing: VCG provides physiological insights but adds transformation overhead

Failure Signatures:
- Poor segmentation performance indicates inadequate local context capture
- Suboptimal classification suggests insufficient global rhythm learning
- Overfitting on training data may occur with aggressive augmentations

First Experiments:
1. Compare performance with and without soft similarity targets (0-1 vs binary)
2. Test global-only versus dual-level contrasting effectiveness
3. Evaluate different physiologically-inspired augmentation strategies in VCG domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance comparison relies on a single external foundation model baseline without broader model comparisons
- Absence of statistical significance testing and confidence intervals limits assessment of practical significance
- Framework's computational requirements and scalability for real-time applications are not discussed

## Confidence
- Performance claims (93% of foundation model): Medium
- Segmentation improvement (4%): Medium  
- Soft target superiority: Low
- Physiological motivation: Medium
- Generalization across datasets: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing soft targets (0-1) versus binary targets to quantify the specific contribution of the soft target approach
2. Perform statistical significance testing with confidence intervals across multiple runs to validate performance claims
3. Test the framework on additional independent ECG datasets from different populations to assess generalizability and potential domain adaptation needs
