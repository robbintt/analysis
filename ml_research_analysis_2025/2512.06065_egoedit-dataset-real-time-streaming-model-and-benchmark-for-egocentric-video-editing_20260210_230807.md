# EgoEdit: Dataset, Real-Time Streaming Model, and Benchmark for Egocentric Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06065
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces real-time streaming model for egocentric video editing with 38.1fps performance

## Executive Summary
EgoEdit addresses the critical gap between existing video editors and the unique requirements of egocentric video editing for augmented reality applications. The system introduces a streaming model that can edit egocentric videos in real-time while maintaining hand-object interaction fidelity. The work is supported by EgoEditData, a large-scale dataset of 99.7k instruction-guided video pairs, and EgoEditBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating instruction faithfulness, temporal stability, and hand preservation under egocentric motion.

## Method Summary
EgoEdit employs a streaming architecture with channel-wise source video conditioning to enable real-time egocentric video editing. The model uses autoregressive Self-Forcing distillation to achieve efficient inference while maintaining high-quality output. The system processes videos frame-by-frame with 855ms first-frame latency on a single H100 GPU, achieving 38.1fps throughput. The approach specifically addresses the challenges of egocentric footage where hand-object interactions and egocentric motion create unique editing difficulties not present in third-person video.

## Key Results
- Achieves real-time performance at 38.1fps with 855ms first-frame latency on H100 GPU
- Outperforms baselines on egocentric tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general editing
- EgoEditBench demonstrates superior instruction faithfulness, temporal stability, and hand preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The real-time streaming capability stems from the channel-wise source video conditioning and autoregressive Self-Forcing distillation, which together enable efficient inference while preserving visual quality. The streaming architecture processes frames sequentially, making it suitable for AR applications where latency is critical.

## Foundational Learning

**Egocentric Video Characteristics** - Understanding that egocentric footage involves hand-object interactions and egomotion that differ fundamentally from third-person perspectives; needed because standard video editing models fail on this domain; quick check: compare hand visibility and interaction preservation between third-person and egocentric editing outputs.

**Streaming Architecture** - Processing videos frame-by-frame rather than as complete sequences; needed to achieve real-time performance for AR applications; quick check: measure frame processing time and verify constant throughput.

**Channel-wise Source Conditioning** - Conditioning each channel of the feature map separately with source video information; needed to maintain visual consistency while applying edits; quick check: compare conditioning methods on feature preservation metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Frames -> Channel-wise Conditioning -> Streaming Decoder -> Output Frames
The architecture processes each frame through channel-wise conditioning before passing to the streaming decoder for real-time output generation.

**Critical Path**: Input frame reception → Channel conditioning → Streaming inference → Frame output. The streaming decoder is the bottleneck, with latency dominated by the first frame processing (855ms).

**Design Tradeoffs**: Real-time performance vs. editing quality - the streaming approach sacrifices some global coherence for latency; channel-wise conditioning vs. full-frame conditioning - trades some editing flexibility for efficiency; autoregressive vs. non-autoregressive - balances quality with speed.

**Failure Signatures**: Motion blur in fast-moving scenes, inconsistent hand appearance across frames, artifacts at hand-object boundaries, and lag in following complex instructions during rapid movements.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test single-frame editing latency and throughput on different GPU hardware
2. Evaluate hand preservation accuracy on videos with rapid hand movements
3. Compare instruction faithfulness between streaming and batch processing modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Performance claims are based on H100 GPU, with unknown performance on mobile AR hardware
- Dataset domain specificity to hand-object interactions may limit generalizability to other egocentric scenarios
- Evaluation focuses on controlled benchmarks rather than diverse in-the-wild AR applications

## Confidence

- Real-time streaming architecture: High confidence
- Channel-wise conditioning mechanism: High confidence
- Dataset curation methodology: Medium confidence
- Generalizability to diverse egocentric scenarios: Medium confidence
- Real-world AR application performance: Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate EgoEdit performance on mobile AR hardware to verify real-time capability in deployed scenarios
2. Test the model on egocentric footage from different domains (sports, cooking, medical procedures) to assess generalizability
3. Conduct user studies comparing EgoEdit-edited videos against ground truth in AR applications to validate perceptual quality and utility in practical settings
