# Stock Market Price Prediction using Neural Prophet with Deep Neural Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.05202
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05202
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: 93.21% accuracy achieved using Neural Prophet with Deep Neural Network approach on Crunchbase dataset

## Executive Summary
This research proposes a hybrid approach combining Neural Prophet with Deep Neural Networks (NP-DNN) for stock market price prediction. The method addresses the inherent volatility and complexity of financial markets by integrating advanced preprocessing techniques including Z-score normalization and missing value imputation with feature extraction using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The model is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. When tested on the Crunchbase dataset, the NP-DNN approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods such as Decision Support Systems, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Large Language Models, achieving an accuracy of 93.21%.

## Method Summary
The proposed NP-DNN methodology combines Neural Prophet's time series forecasting capabilities with deep neural networks for enhanced feature extraction and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with data preprocessing using Z-score normalization to standardize features and handle outliers, followed by missing value imputation to ensure data completeness. Feature extraction is performed using Multi-Layer Perceptron networks to capture complex patterns in the financial data. The integrated model is then optimized using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to maximize predictive performance. The complete pipeline is evaluated on the Crunchbase dataset, which contains comprehensive financial and market data suitable for stock price prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93.21% accuracy on Crunchbase dataset, significantly outperforming traditional methods
- Outperformed Decision Support Systems, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Large Language Models
- Demonstrated effectiveness of combining advanced preprocessing with deep learning for financial time series forecasting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of Neural Prophet with Deep Neural Networks creates a powerful hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both approaches. Neural Prophet provides robust time series decomposition and forecasting capabilities, while the deep neural network component enhances feature extraction and captures non-linear relationships in financial data. The preprocessing steps ensure data quality and consistency, while Optuna optimization fine-tunes model parameters for optimal performance in the volatile stock market environment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Z-score normalization**: Standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance, essential for preventing feature dominance and ensuring stable model training in financial datasets with varying scales
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Deep learning architecture for automatic feature extraction from raw financial data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns that traditional statistical methods might miss
- **Optuna optimization**: Automated hyperparameter tuning framework that systematically searches for optimal model configurations, crucial for achieving peak performance in complex hybrid models
- **Time series decomposition**: Neural Prophet's ability to separate trend, seasonality, and holiday effects from stock price data, providing interpretable components for more accurate forecasting
- **Missing value imputation**: Critical preprocessing step for handling incomplete financial datasets, ensuring model training isn't compromised by data gaps
- **Neural Prophet architecture**: Extension of Facebook's Prophet model with neural network components, specifically designed for time series forecasting with automatic seasonality detection

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction (MLP) -> Neural Prophet Integration -> Optuna Optimization -> Prediction Output

**Critical path**: Raw financial data → Z-score normalization → Missing value imputation → MLP feature extraction → Neural Prophet forecasting → Optuna hyperparameter tuning → Final stock price prediction

**Design tradeoffs**: The hybrid approach balances interpretability (through Neural Prophet's decomposition) with predictive power (through deep neural networks), though at the cost of increased model complexity and computational requirements

**Failure signatures**: Potential overfitting due to high accuracy claims, poor generalization to unseen market conditions, sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, and vulnerability to regime changes in financial markets

**First experiments**: 1) Validate preprocessing pipeline on multiple financial datasets with varying quality, 2) Compare performance against simpler baseline models using the same preprocessing, 3) Conduct rolling window cross-validation to test temporal robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- High accuracy claim (93.21%) may indicate overfitting and requires independent verification
- Reliance on Crunchbase dataset limits generalizability to broader financial markets and different stock datasets
- Comparison metrics focus primarily on accuracy rather than financial performance measures like Sharpe ratio or maximum drawdown

## Confidence
- **High**: Hybrid Neural Prophet with Deep Neural Networks approach is technically sound for time series forecasting
- **Medium**: Standard preprocessing methodology needs validation in specific stock market context
- **Low**: 93.21% accuracy claim requires more comprehensive performance metrics and independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct out-of-sample testing on multiple financial datasets from different markets and time periods to verify generalizability
2. Implement cross-validation with rolling window approaches to assess model robustness to temporal changes
3. Compare performance using financial-specific metrics (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, transaction costs) rather than accuracy alone
