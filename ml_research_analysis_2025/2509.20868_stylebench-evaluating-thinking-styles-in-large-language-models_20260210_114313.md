# StyleBench: Evaluating thinking styles in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20868
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: No single reasoning style is universally optimal across tasks and model scales

## Executive Summary
This work introduces StyleBench, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning strategies in large language models across diverse tasks and model scales. It systematically assesses five reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) using 15 models from 270M to 120B parameters on five tasks including mathematical reasoning and puzzle-solving. The analysis reveals that effectiveness depends heavily on model scale and task type, with search-based methods excelling on open-ended problems with large models while concise styles achieve greater efficiency on structured tasks. Smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, whereas reasoning robustness scales with model size.

## Method Summary
StyleBench evaluates five distinct reasoning styles—Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), Answer-only Thinking (AoT), Silent Thought (SoT), and Consensus-then-Decision (CoD)—across 15 language models ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. The benchmark uses five diverse tasks including mathematical reasoning and puzzle-solving to assess both accuracy and efficiency. The systematic evaluation measures how different reasoning approaches perform across varying model scales and task types, with particular attention to instruction-following behavior and computational resource requirements.

## Key Results
- No single reasoning style is universally optimal; effectiveness varies by model scale and task type
- Search-based methods (ToT, CoD) excel on open-ended problems with large models
- Smaller models frequently ignore instructions and default to guessing rather than applying specified reasoning styles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by creating controlled conditions where models must apply specific reasoning strategies to comparable problems, allowing systematic comparison of how different approaches perform across scales and task types. By measuring both accuracy and efficiency, it reveals that larger models can effectively utilize complex search strategies while smaller models struggle with instruction adherence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reasoning style diversity**: Different approaches to problem-solving in LLMs (why needed: to understand when each strategy works best; quick check: can you describe the key difference between CoT and ToT?)
- **Model scale effects**: How model size impacts reasoning capability and instruction following (why needed: to guide deployment decisions; quick check: what happens to instruction-following as models get smaller?)
- **Task complexity mapping**: Relationship between problem structure and optimal reasoning strategy (why needed: to select appropriate approaches; quick check: which styles work better for open-ended vs structured tasks?)
- **Efficiency-accuracy tradeoff**: Balance between computational cost and solution quality (why needed: for practical deployment; quick check: when would you choose a concise style over a search-based one?)
- **Instruction adherence**: Models' ability to follow specified reasoning protocols (why needed: for controlled evaluation; quick check: how do smaller models typically respond to reasoning instructions?)
- **Search strategy effectiveness**: Performance of exploration-based reasoning approaches (why needed: to understand when to use search; quick check: what types of problems benefit most from ToT or CoD?)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
StyleBench benchmark -> 5 reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) -> 15 model sizes (270M-120B) -> 5 task types -> Evaluation metrics (accuracy, efficiency)

**Critical Path**
Model selection → Reasoning style application → Task execution → Performance measurement → Comparative analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**
The benchmark trades breadth of task types for depth of reasoning style comparison, focusing on systematic evaluation rather than comprehensive real-world coverage. This allows for clearer attribution of performance differences to reasoning strategies rather than task-specific factors.

**Failure Signatures**
Smaller models fail by ignoring reasoning instructions and defaulting to guessing, while certain styles fail on tasks that don't match their strengths (search methods on highly structured problems, concise methods on open-ended problems).

**First Experiments**
1. Compare CoT vs AoT performance on a simple mathematical problem with a 7B parameter model
2. Test instruction-following by giving explicit reasoning style prompts to a 300M parameter model
3. Measure efficiency differences between ToT and SoT on a puzzle-solving task using a 13B parameter model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential bias from prompting templates and temperature settings affecting relative performance
- Limited evaluation across only five task types may not capture real-world application breadth
- Qualitative observations of instruction-following failures in smaller models need more systematic quantification

## Confidence
- No single reasoning style is universally optimal: High confidence
- Search-based methods excel on open-ended problems with large models: High confidence  
- Smaller models' tendency to ignore instructions: Medium confidence
- Reasoning robustness scales with model size: Medium confidence
- Efficiency claims for concise styles on structured tasks: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Replicate benchmark results across broader range of task types, including real-world applications beyond mathematical reasoning and puzzle-solving
2. Conduct ablation studies varying temperature, prompt templates, and instruction specificity to quantify their impact on reasoning style adherence and performance
3. Implement longitudinal testing to assess whether models can be fine-tuned to adaptively select reasoning styles based on task characteristics, measuring impact on both accuracy and computational efficiency
