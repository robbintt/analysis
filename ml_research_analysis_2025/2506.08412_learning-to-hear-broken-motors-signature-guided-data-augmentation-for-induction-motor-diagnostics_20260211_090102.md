# Learning to Hear Broken Motors: Signature-Guided Data Augmentation for Induction-Motor Diagnostics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08412
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08412
- Reference count: 40
- Without using any real fault data, achieves 99% accuracy in binary classification and 85% in multiclass classification for induction motor fault detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting faults in industrial three-phase induction motors using machine learning when labeled fault data is scarce. The authors propose a novel approach called Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA) that synthesizes realistic fault data by injecting synthetic anomalies into healthy current signals based on Motor Current Signature Analysis principles. The method achieves excellent performance - 99% accuracy in binary classification and 85% in multiclass classification - without requiring any real fault data for training. The approach demonstrates strong generalization to different motor types, making it particularly valuable for industrial applications where collecting fault data is expensive or impractical.

## Method Summary
The core innovation is a data augmentation technique that synthesizes fault data from healthy motor current signals. SGDA uses Motor Current Signature Analysis to identify frequency bands associated with specific fault types, then injects Gaussian-shaped peaks into those bands of healthy signals to create synthetic fault examples. The method combines unsupervised signature analysis with supervised deep learning - using physics-based frequency-domain transformations to generate labeled training data without requiring actual fault measurements. A ResNet-18 classifier is trained on this augmented dataset and achieves high performance in both binary (normal vs. fault) and multiclass (normal, inter-turn short circuit, rotor bar defect) classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99% accuracy in binary classification (normal vs. fault) without using any real fault data
- Achieves 85% accuracy in multiclass classification (normal, ITSC, rotor bar defect) without real fault data
- Generalizes well to different motor types, demonstrating practical industrial applicability
- Majority voting across 1-second signal segments improves signal-level diagnostic stability and reduces false positives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Injecting Gaussian-shaped spectral peaks at MCSA-defined fault frequencies enables classifiers to learn discriminative features without real fault data.
- Mechanism: MCSA establishes a mapping ν(θ, t) from motor parameters and fault types to specific characteristic frequencies. SGDA injects synthetic anomalies precisely into these frequency bands of healthy signals, creating labeled fault examples that respect electromechanical physics.
- Core assumption: Real faults manifest as spectral perturbations at these computed frequencies, and synthetic Gaussian peaks approximate the spectral shape of actual fault signatures sufficiently for classifier training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "synthesizes realistic fault data by injecting synthetic anomalies into healthy current signals in the frequency domain...guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) principles to ensure physical plausibility"
  - [Section 4.4] Defines augmentation operator with Gaussian peaks injected at f* ∈ ν(θ, yi) with randomized amplitude, width, and small frequency shift
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work (Boushaba et al.) shows MCSA+CNN achieving 100% broken bar detection, supporting frequency-domain physics guidance
- Break condition: If actual fault signatures deviate significantly from Gaussian-shaped peaks (e.g., exhibit complex harmonic structures, phase discontinuities, or time-varying patterns not captured by static spectral injection), the synthetic-to-real domain gap may degrade classifier generalization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Randomization of injection parameters (amplitude, width, frequency offset) creates diverse training distributions that improve robustness to operational variability.
- Mechanism: For each synthetic fault, SGDA samples A ∼ U(A_min, A_max), σ_g ∼ U(σ_min, σ_max), and μ ∼ U(-ε_f, ε_f) independently. This stochastic injection per epoch exposes the classifier to a range of fault severities and spectral shapes, preventing overfitting to fixed anomaly patterns.
- Core assumption: The uniform sampling ranges span the natural variability of real fault manifestations across load conditions, motor tolerances, and measurement noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.4] Explicit parameterization with A, μ, σ_g sampled from uniform distributions; ε_f defines frequency window accounting for "uncertainties in motor parameters" and "changing operational conditions"
  - [Section 8.1] "SGDA injects spectral anomalies within a controlled neighborhood around the expected frequency...ϵ_f thus acts as a tunable proxy for parameter uncertainty"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of stochastic augmentation efficacy; Gwak et al.'s Random Spectral Scaling offers partial analogy
- Break condition: If real fault signatures exhibit correlated parameter variations (e.g., severity coupled with specific frequency shifts) that uniform independent sampling fails to capture, the learned decision boundary may misclassify edge cases.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Majority voting across 1-second signal segments reduces false positives from transient noise and improves signal-level diagnostic stability.
- Mechanism: Each incoming signal is divided into overlapping segments; each segment is classified independently via the trained ResNet. The final signal-level prediction aggregates segment predictions by majority vote, filtering isolated misclassifications caused by momentary load fluctuations or sensor artifacts.
- Core assumption: True faults produce sustained spectral patterns across multiple consecutive segments, whereas noise-induced anomalies appear sporadically.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3] "majority voting strategy across all segment predictions...mitigates the impact of transient misclassifications caused by noisy or ambiguous intervals"
  - [Section 6.1, Figure 4] Segment-level F1 at 0% load: 0.83–0.85; with majority voting: 0.97–1.00 with ±0.00 variance in most cases
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence on majority voting for motor diagnostics; general time-series aggregation literature supports the approach
- Break condition: If faults manifest intermittently (e.g., incipient faults with short-duration signatures below 1 second) or if segments are highly correlated (reducing effective vote diversity), majority voting may suppress true detections.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA)**
  - Why needed here: SGDA's augmentation is entirely guided by MCSA fault-frequency formulas; understanding how slip, supply frequency, and rotor geometry determine characteristic frequencies is prerequisite to implementing correct injection targets.
  - Quick check question: Given a 50 Hz supply, 4-pole motor with 2% slip, what frequency bands indicate a rotor bar defect?

- Concept: **Frequency-domain signal processing (FFT, spectral leakage)**
  - Why needed here: SGDA operates on FFT spectra; practitioners must understand windowing effects, frequency bin resolution, and how decibel scaling preserves dynamic range for neural network input.
  - Quick check question: If sampling at 4096 Hz with 1-second segments, what is the frequency resolution? How does window choice affect peak shape?

- Concept: **Residual networks and gradient flow**
  - Why needed here: The paper selects 1D ResNet-18 for spectral classification; understanding skip connections helps diagnose training instabilities and justify architecture choice over vanilla CNNs.
  - Quick check question: Why might a deep vanilla CNN struggle with spectral inputs compared to a ResNet of equivalent depth?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw 3-phase current -> Segmentation (1s windows) -> FFT per channel -> dB scaling -> Min-max normalization -> Frequency-domain segments X̂ -> Augmentation Module (training only) -> Classifier: 1D ResNet-18 -> Binary or multiclass head -> Softmax output -> Inference Aggregation: Segment-level predictions -> Majority voting -> Signal-level label

- Critical path:
  1. Extract motor parameters (slip, pole pairs, supply frequency) from nameplate or test run
  2. Compute fault frequency bands ν(θ, t) for each target fault type using MCSA formulas (Appendix A)
  3. Collect healthy current signals at representative load conditions
  4. Set augmentation hyperparameters: A_min/max (based on spectral magnitude range), σ_min/max (peak width), ε_f (frequency tolerance window)
  5. Train ResNet on augmented dataset with per-epoch on-the-fly injection (Algorithm 1)
  6. At inference, segment incoming signals, classify each, aggregate via majority vote

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **ε_f window size**: Larger values improve robustness to parameter uncertainty but risk injecting anomalies into unrelated spectral regions; paper uses motor-specific calibration
  - **Normalization mode**: Per-segment normalization (paper's default) vs. global normalization—per-segment preserves relative spectral shape but may reduce cross-signal comparability
  - **Load diversity in training**: Training on single load (e.g., 100%) enables deployment at that load but generalizes poorly to others (Section 6.3 shows F1 drops from ~0.99 to ~0.67 at 0% load for binary, ~0.02 for multiclass for multiclass)
  - **Binary vs. multiclass**: Binary (normal/fault) achieves near-perfect performance; multiclass (ITSC/RBD) suffers inter-fault confusion, especially at low loads

- Failure signatures:
  - **0% load degradation**: F1 ≈ 0.30 (random-chance level for multiclass) due to weak fault signatures under minimal torque
  - **Inter-fault confusion**: RBD misclassified as ITSC (~25% in constrained training); confusion matrices show faults confused with each other, not with normal class
  - **Phase sensitivity**: Phase 2 shows higher variance (std up to 0.21) at medium loads in multiclass setting
  - **Small fault samples**: Without SGDA, models trained on ≤50 real fault samples show high variance and degraded accuracy

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce binary classification with majority voting**: Train on all loads/phases, evaluate segment-level vs. signal-level F1 across load conditions to validate voting benefit (target: replicate Figure 4's improvement from ~0.85 to ~0.97 at 0% load).
  2. **Ablate augmentation randomness**: Fix injection parameters (A, σ, μ) vs. stochastic sampling to quantify diversity contribution; measure variance in F1 across multiple training runs.
  3. **Cross-motor transfer test**: Train on Motor A healthy data with SGDA, test on Motor B without retraining (or with minimal healthy-data fine-tuning); compare to paper's retrained Motor B results (binary: 100% normal, 95% fault detection).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in provided material.

## Limitations
- Synthetic fault spectrum fidelity to real faults remains unverified through direct comparison with measured fault spectra
- Cross-motor performance degrades significantly at low loads (binary F1: 99% → 92% at 0% load; multiclass F1: 85% → 34% at 0% load)
- Multiclass classification suffers from inter-fault confusion, especially between rotor bar defects and inter-turn short circuits

## Confidence

- **High**: Binary classification performance on same motor/load conditions; majority voting improves segment-level accuracy
- **Medium**: Multiclass fault differentiation; cross-motor generalization without retraining
- **Low**: Synthetic fault spectrum fidelity to real faults; performance at loads outside training range

## Next Checks

1. **Spectral realism validation**: Compare SGDA-injected spectra against measured fault spectra from the same motor types; quantify peak shape, harmonic content, and spectral leakage differences.

2. **Load extrapolation stress test**: Train exclusively at 100% load, test across 0%, 50%, 100% loads; report F1 variance and confusion matrices to quantify load-induced degradation.

3. **Ablation of MCSA guidance**: Replace MCSA-derived injection frequencies with random spectral bands; measure performance drop to isolate physics-guided vs. random augmentation benefits.
