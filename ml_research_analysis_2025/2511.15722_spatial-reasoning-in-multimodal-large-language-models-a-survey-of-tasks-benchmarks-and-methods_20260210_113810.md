core_contribution: This survey systematically analyzes spatial reasoning in multimodal
  large language models (MLLMs), introducing a cognitive taxonomy that organizes tasks
  by reasoning complexity and cognitive function rather than input modality. It maps
  benchmarks across text, image, video, and 3D domains, revealing that most evaluations
  focus on static qualitative reasoning while quantitative and dynamic tasks remain

# Spatial Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey of Tasks, Benchmarks and Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15722
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15722
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Systematic analysis of spatial reasoning in MLLMs, revealing under-exploration of quantitative and dynamic tasks while most evaluations focus on static qualitative reasoning

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of spatial reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models by introducing a cognitive taxonomy that organizes tasks based on reasoning complexity and cognitive function rather than input modality. The authors systematically map existing benchmarks across text, image, video, and 3D domains, revealing that current evaluations predominantly focus on static qualitative reasoning tasks while quantitative and dynamic spatial reasoning remain under-explored. The survey also reviews both training-based methods (spatial-aware modules, synthetic data, reinforcement learning) and inference-based approaches (chain-of-thought prompting, explicit spatial representations) for improving spatial reasoning abilities in MLLMs.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic review methodology that synthesizes existing literature on spatial reasoning in MLLMs through multiple analytical lenses. The authors develop a cognitive taxonomy framework that categorizes spatial reasoning tasks based on cognitive function complexity, mapping this framework across different input modalities including text, images, videos, and 3D data. They conduct comprehensive benchmark analysis by identifying and classifying existing evaluation datasets and tasks, then review methodological approaches for enhancing spatial reasoning through both training-based techniques (architectural modifications, data augmentation, RL) and inference-time strategies (prompting methods, explicit spatial representations).

## Key Results
- Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static qualitative tasks while quantitative and dynamic reasoning remain under-explored
- The proposed cognitive taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding spatial reasoning complexity beyond simple modality-based categorization
- Current MLLMs show significant limitations in quantitative spatial reasoning and temporal/dynamic spatial understanding
- Training-based methods (spatial modules, synthetic data) and inference-based methods (chain-of-thought prompting) both show promise for improving spatial reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's framework works by providing a cognitive science-informed taxonomy that bridges the gap between human spatial reasoning capabilities and AI system evaluations. By organizing tasks according to cognitive complexity rather than modality, it reveals fundamental limitations in current MLLM spatial reasoning approaches. The dual focus on training and inference methods acknowledges that improving spatial reasoning requires both architectural enhancements and better reasoning strategies at inference time.

## Foundational Learning

**Cognitive Science of Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding human spatial cognition provides the theoretical foundation for evaluating AI systems. Why needed: Human spatial reasoning involves multiple cognitive processes that current AI systems struggle to replicate. Quick check: Compare human vs AI performance on classic spatial reasoning tasks like mental rotation and spatial visualization.

**Multimodal Integration**: Spatial reasoning requires combining information across different sensory modalities. Why needed: MLLMs must integrate visual, textual, and potentially auditory/spatial-temporal information for comprehensive spatial understanding. Quick check: Evaluate cross-modal consistency in spatial reasoning tasks.

**Spatial Representation Learning**: Neural networks need to learn effective spatial representations. Why needed: Without proper spatial encoding, models cannot perform even basic spatial reasoning tasks. Quick check: Test spatial awareness on simple geometric transformations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MLLMs (text/image encoders) -> Spatial Reasoning Module -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**: Input encoding → Spatial feature extraction → Reasoning module → Response generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Training-based methods offer permanent improvements but require extensive resources, while inference-based methods are more flexible but may not generalize as well. Synthetic data generation provides scalability but may introduce bias.

**Failure Signatures**: Models struggle with quantitative spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and abstract spatial relationships. Performance degrades significantly on tasks requiring mental rotation or spatial transformation.

**First 3 Experiments**: 
1. Compare performance on quantitative vs qualitative spatial reasoning benchmarks
2. Test chain-of-thought prompting effectiveness on spatial reasoning tasks
3. Evaluate synthetic data augmentation impact on spatial reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of the cognitive taxonomy across different cultural and educational contexts, noting that the framework appears primarily derived from Western cognitive science literature. It questions whether current benchmark focus systematically excludes emerging or unpublished evaluation methods, particularly in industrial or defense-related applications. The paper also raises questions about the practical distinction between training-based and inference-based methods, as many modern approaches combine both strategies.

## Limitations
- The cognitive taxonomy's generalizability across different cultural and educational contexts remains uncertain
- Survey focus on published benchmarks may systematically exclude emerging or unpublished evaluation methods
- The distinction between training-based and inference-based methods is not always clear-cut in practice
- Limited coverage of industrial or defense-related spatial reasoning applications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The survey's comprehensive mapping of existing spatial reasoning benchmarks across modalities is well-supported by evidence and citation
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed cognitive taxonomy, while logically structured, requires empirical validation across diverse populations and task types
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about the relative under-exploration of quantitative and dynamic spatial tasks are supported by current benchmark analysis but may not reflect emerging research directions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation of the cognitive taxonomy using task datasets from non-Western educational systems to assess universality
2. Systematically search for and evaluate unpublished or proprietary benchmarks in spatial reasoning to identify potential blind spots in the survey
3. Design empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of training-based versus inference-based methods on identical spatial reasoning tasks to quantify their relative contributions
