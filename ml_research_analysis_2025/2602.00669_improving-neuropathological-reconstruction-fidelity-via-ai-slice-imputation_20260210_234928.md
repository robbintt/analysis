# Improving Neuropathological Reconstruction Fidelity via AI Slice Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00669
- Reference count: 38
- This study introduces an AI-based slice imputation method that generates anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs, trained entirely on domain-randomized synthetic data.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of coarse, voxelated 3D brain reconstructions from thick dissection slabs, which hinder accurate morphometric analysis. The authors introduce a computationally efficient AI-based slice imputation method that generates anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. Trained entirely on domain-randomized synthetic data, the model imputes missing slices at 1 mm intervals regardless of original slab thickness. The method significantly improves automated segmentations (up to 0.04 higher Dice scores for cortex and white matter), produces smoother cortical surfaces with up to 0.4 mm lower surface error, and enhances atlas registration accuracy. The approach bridges neuropathology and neuroimaging by enabling high-resolution morphometric analysis from archival dissection photographs, with code publicly available.

## Method Summary
The method employs a deep learning-based slice imputation technique that generates anatomically consistent intermediate slices between thick brain dissection slabs. The approach is trained entirely on domain-randomized synthetic data, allowing it to impute slices at 1 mm intervals regardless of the original slab thickness. This synthetic training strategy enables the model to learn generalizable anatomical patterns without requiring extensive real-world labeled data. The imputation process transforms anisotropic 3D reconstructions into isotropic volumes suitable for detailed morphometric analysis.

## Key Results
- Automated segmentation Dice scores improved by up to 0.04 for cortex and white matter structures
- Cortical surface reconstruction error reduced by up to 0.4 mm
- Atlas registration accuracy significantly enhanced through improved volumetric consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages deep learning to learn anatomical continuity patterns from synthetic data, enabling it to generate realistic intermediate slices between thick dissection slabs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, the model learns generalizable anatomical structures that can be applied across different brain regions and tissue types. The synthetic training approach bypasses the need for extensive real-world labeled data while maintaining anatomical plausibility through carefully designed data augmentation and randomization techniques.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating realistic brain tissue simulations for training without requiring extensive real histological data; needed to overcome data scarcity and annotation costs
- **Domain Randomization**: Applying varied synthetic parameters to improve model generalization; needed to prevent overfitting to specific anatomical variations
- **Anatomical Consistency Constraints**: Enforcing biologically plausible relationships between imputed slices; needed to ensure generated slices maintain realistic tissue boundaries and structures
- **Multi-resolution Processing**: Handling different spatial scales in brain tissue reconstruction; needed to capture both global brain structure and local tissue details
- **Isotropic Volume Generation**: Converting anisotropic data to uniform resolution; needed to enable consistent morphometric measurements across all spatial dimensions
- **Slice Interpolation Techniques**: Generating intermediate slices between existing ones; needed to increase effective resolution without requiring additional physical tissue sections

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Synthetic Data Generator -> Training Pipeline -> Slice Imputation Model -> Post-processing -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:**
The synthetic data generator creates domain-randomized brain tissue volumes, which are then used to train the slice imputation model. The trained model processes anisotropic 3D reconstructions from dissection photographs, generating isotropic volumes at 1 mm resolution. Post-processing refines the output for morphometric analysis and atlas registration.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Synthetic training vs. real data: Sacrifices some domain-specific accuracy for broader generalizability and reduced annotation requirements
- Fixed 1 mm output resolution vs. adaptive resolution: Simplifies implementation but may not optimize for all tissue types
- Single model architecture vs. specialized models: Reduces complexity but may limit optimal performance for specific anatomical regions

**Failure Signatures:**
- Anatomical inconsistencies between imputed slices indicating poor synthetic training distribution coverage
- Blurred tissue boundaries suggesting insufficient spatial detail preservation
- Systematic biases in specific brain regions indicating training data limitations

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate synthetic data generation by comparing statistical properties against real histological images
2. Test imputation performance on controlled synthetic test cases with known ground truth
3. Evaluate cross-dataset generalization by applying the model to different neuropathological conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Modest performance improvements (up to 0.04 Dice score increase, 0.4 mm surface error reduction) suggest the method enhances rather than transforms reconstruction quality
- Potential domain shift from synthetic training data when applied to real histological images
- Generalizability to different brain regions, tissue types, and staining protocols remains unproven

## Confidence
**High** for the method's ability to generate anatomically plausible intermediate slices
**Medium** for the quantitative improvements in segmentation and surface reconstruction metrics

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance across multiple neuropathological conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis) to assess robustness to structural abnormalities
2. Conduct a reader study with neuropathologists to assess the clinical utility and perceptual quality of imputed slices
3. Test the method's performance when applied to lower-quality archival photographs with varying illumination, contrast, and tissue degradation levels
