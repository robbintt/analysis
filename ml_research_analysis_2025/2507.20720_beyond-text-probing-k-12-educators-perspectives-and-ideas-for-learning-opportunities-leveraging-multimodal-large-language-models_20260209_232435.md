# Beyond Text: Probing K-12 Educators' Perspectives and Ideas for Learning Opportunities Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.20720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20720
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: K-12 educators can effectively use MLLMs to create multimedia-rich educational content through text-based code generation

## Executive Summary
This study investigated how K-12 educators perceive and can utilize Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for educational applications. Through workshops with 12 teachers, participants explored MLLM capabilities, brainstormed learning applications, and prototyped interactive educational materials. The research revealed that educators see significant potential for MLLMs to create personalized, multimedia-rich learning experiences while also identifying important challenges around implementation, teacher training, and accessibility across different literacy levels.

## Method Summary
The study employed a workshop-based approach with 12 K-12 educators across two sessions. Participants engaged in brainstorming activities to envision MLLM applications in education, followed by hands-on prototyping sessions using Claude 3.5 to generate interactive learning materials. The process included collaborative design exercises where teachers created prompts for educational games and animations, which were then generated as text-based code artifacts. Participants reflected on their experiences and provided feedback on both the capabilities and limitations of MLLMs for classroom use.

## Key Results
- Educators successfully used text-based code generation to create multimedia learning materials including games, animations, and interactive content
- MLLMs were seen as valuable tools for expanding design possibilities beyond simple answers, enabling students to build upon generated content
- Key challenges identified include the need for teacher training on model output evaluation and adapting MLLMs for varying literacy levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that MLLMs can bridge the gap between complex multimedia creation and practical classroom implementation by generating text-based code that produces interactive educational content. This mechanism allows teachers without programming expertise to create rich learning experiences that were previously difficult to implement, while maintaining flexibility for customization and adaptation to specific educational needs.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): AI systems that process and generate multiple types of media (why needed: understanding the core technology being studied; quick check: Can the model process both text and visual inputs?)
- Text-to-Code Generation: Process of converting natural language prompts into executable code (why needed: central to how teachers create interactive content; quick check: Does the generated code actually produce the intended output?)
- Educational Affordances: The potential learning benefits and opportunities provided by technology (why needed: framework for evaluating MLLM impact; quick check: Are there measurable learning gains from using generated materials?)
- Teacher Professional Development: Training programs for educators to effectively use new technologies (why needed: critical for successful implementation; quick check: Do teachers feel confident evaluating and using MLLM outputs?)
- Pedagogical Design: Planning and structuring learning experiences (why needed: guides how MLLMs are integrated into curriculum; quick check: Are generated materials aligned with learning objectives?)
- Accessibility Considerations: Ensuring educational materials work for diverse student populations (why needed: addresses equity concerns in MLLM implementation; quick check: Can materials be adapted for different literacy levels?)

## Architecture Onboarding
The system operates through a pipeline where teachers provide natural language prompts that MLLMs process to generate text-based code artifacts. These artifacts, when executed, produce interactive multimedia content for educational purposes.

Critical path: Teacher Prompt -> MLLM Processing -> Code Generation -> Interactive Content

Design tradeoffs: The approach prioritizes accessibility and ease of use over the fidelity and sophistication of generated content, accepting that text-based code may have limitations compared to direct multimodal generation.

Failure signatures: Common failures include code generation errors, mismatched output expectations, and difficulties in prompt engineering for specific educational outcomes.

First experiments:
1. Test prompt variations to optimize code generation quality for educational content
2. Compare generated artifacts against manually created equivalent materials for quality assessment
3. Evaluate teacher satisfaction and usability across different subject areas and grade levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small sample size of 12 educators limits generalizability across diverse educational contexts
- Focus on single MLLM (Claude 3.5) may not represent broader multimodal model capabilities
- Rapid prototyping approach may not capture long-term implementation challenges in real classrooms

## Confidence
- Text-based code generation can effectively mimic multimodal visual outputs: High confidence
- Challenges around teacher training and literacy level adaptation: Medium confidence
- Potential for MLLMs to enhance personalization and create multimedia-rich content: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale studies with diverse educator populations across different school districts and subject areas
2. Test educational effectiveness of code-generated multimedia artifacts with actual K-12 students through controlled classroom implementations
3. Develop and evaluate comprehensive teacher training programs focused on MLLM output evaluation and pedagogical integration
