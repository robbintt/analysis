# Learning Neural Operators from Partial Observations via Latent Autoregressive Modeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.15547
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15547
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: LANO achieves 18-69% relative L2 error reduction for learning neural operators from partial observations across three PDE-governed tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning neural operators from partially observed data, a common issue in real-world scientific applications due to sensor limitations and measurement constraints. The authors propose the first systematic framework for this problem, identifying two key obstacles: lack of supervision in unobserved regions and dynamic spatial mismatch between inputs and outputs. Their solution, the Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator (LANO), introduces two novel components: a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by masking observed regions, and a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, they develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observations. The core innovation is LANO, which addresses two key challenges: the lack of supervision in unobserved regions and dynamic spatial mismatch between inputs and outputs. The framework employs a mask-to-predict training strategy that artificially creates supervision by masking observed regions, combined with a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. This approach enables the model to learn effectively even when only partial measurements are available, making it suitable for real-world applications where complete data acquisition is often impractical.

## Key Results
- LANO achieves 18-69% relative L2 error reduction compared to baseline methods
- Outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators under patch-wise missingness with less than 50% missing rate
- Demonstrates effectiveness across three PDE-governed tasks in the POBench-PDE benchmark
- Shows promising results in real-world climate prediction applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the fundamental challenge of learning from incomplete data through two complementary mechanisms. First, the mask-to-predict strategy creates artificial supervision by systematically masking portions of observed data during training, forcing the model to learn reconstruction capabilities. Second, the Physics-Aware Latent Propagator leverages autoregressive generation in latent space, starting from boundary conditions and propagating information inward, which aligns with how many physical systems evolve. This combination allows the model to effectively infer missing information while maintaining physical consistency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Partial observations in scientific computing**: Why needed - Real-world sensors and measurements often have coverage gaps or limitations; Quick check - Can the model handle varying missingness patterns and rates?
- **Neural operators for PDEs**: Why needed - Traditional neural networks struggle with continuous function spaces; Quick check - Does the operator generalize across different initial/boundary conditions?
- **Autoregressive generation in latent space**: Why needed - Enables sequential reconstruction of missing information; Quick check - Is the generation order optimal for the specific PDEs?
- **Physics-aware modeling**: Why needed - Ensures learned solutions respect underlying physical laws; Quick check - Can the model incorporate domain-specific knowledge effectively?
- **Mask-to-predict training strategy**: Why needed - Creates supervision where none exists in observed data; Quick check - Does artificial masking match real missingness patterns?
- **Benchmark development for partial observations**: Why needed - Standard benchmarks don't capture partial observation scenarios; Quick check - Does POBench-PDE represent diverse real-world conditions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Observed Data -> Mask-to-Predict Module -> Latent Space Encoder -> Physics-Aware Latent Propagator -> Solution Reconstructor -> Output Prediction

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from observed data through the mask-to-predict module for training, then through the encoder to latent space, where the Physics-Aware Latent Propagator generates the solution autoregressively, and finally through the reconstructor to produce the output prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Masking ratio vs. reconstruction quality: Higher masking creates better generalization but may reduce training stability
- Latent dimension size vs. computational efficiency: Larger dimensions capture more complex patterns but increase computational cost
- Physics embedding strength vs. flexibility: Stronger physics constraints improve physical consistency but may limit model adaptability
- Autoregressive generation order vs. convergence: Different orders may be optimal for different PDE types

**Failure Signatures:**
- High reconstruction error in regions far from boundaries suggests issues with latent propagation
- Inconsistent predictions across different masking patterns indicate poor generalization
- Violation of known physical constraints suggests insufficient physics awareness
- Performance degradation with increasing missingness rate indicates model limitations

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Test reconstruction accuracy under varying masking ratios (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%)
2. Compare different autoregressive generation orders (boundary-to-center vs. center-to-boundary)
3. Evaluate performance on out-of-distribution PDE parameters not seen during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the work naturally raises several important considerations about the generalizability of the approach to different types of PDEs, the scalability to higher-dimensional problems, and the robustness to various missingness patterns beyond the patch-wise approach evaluated.

## Limitations
- Performance under extreme missingness rates (>50%) remains unexplored
- Framework's effectiveness with non-random missing patterns (clustered, edge-biased) is unclear
- Limited validation on noisy or incomplete real-world data beyond the climate prediction case
- Sensitivity to design choices like autoregressive generation order and physics embedding strength needs more analysis

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The identification of partial observation challenges as critical obstacles in neural operator learning
- The general architecture of combining latent autoregressive modeling with physics-aware propagation

**Medium Confidence:**
- The specific mask-to-predict training strategy and its effectiveness
- The generalizability of results across diverse PDE types

**Low Confidence:**
- Performance under extreme missingness conditions (>70% missing data)
- Real-world noisy data scenarios with systematic coverage gaps
- Non-random missing patterns like sensor-specific failures

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LANO's performance under non-random missing patterns (e.g., edge-biased, clustered, or sensor-specific failures) and extreme missingness rates (>70%)
2. Conduct ablation studies on the autoregressive generation order, latent dimension size, and physics embedding strength to quantify their impact on reconstruction accuracy
3. Test the framework on additional real-world datasets with known ground truth (e.g., medical imaging, structural health monitoring) to assess robustness beyond climate prediction
