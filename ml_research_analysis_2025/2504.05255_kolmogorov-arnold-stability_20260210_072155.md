# Kolmogorov--Arnold stability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.05255
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05255
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Key outcome**: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but encounters equi-continuity obstruction for continuous groups of re-parameterizations.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the stability of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem under re-parameterizations of the hidden layer in neural networks. The authors frame this as testing whether KA can withstand adversarial re-parameterizations that attempt to foil the construction of the KA outer function. They prove that KA remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but encounter an obstruction when dealing with continuous groups of re-parameterizations. The main obstacle is the failure of equi-continuity of the outer functions across the collection of re-parameterizations.

## Method Summary
The authors prove stability by constructing outer functions that "decode" scrambled representations caused by adversarial homeomorphisms. The proof uses Baire category theorem with piecewise linear interpolation at strategically placed "forced" values, leveraging rationally independent coefficients to prevent collisions. For countable re-parameterizations, they show open dense sets of "good" inner functions whose countable intersection provides universal approximation. For multiple independent homeomorphisms acting on different inner functions, they extend the construction with recursive convergence via λ-contraction.

## Key Results
- Kolmogorov-Arnold representation remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations
- The construction uses piecewise linear outer functions with "forced" values that remain distinct under rationally independent coefficients
- Equi-continuity obstruction prevents stability for continuous groups of re-parameterizations
- Recursive convergence via λ-contraction achieves exact representation (not just approximation)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Countable Re-parameterization Stability via Outer Function Adjustment
The KA representation can withstand adversarial re-parameterizations when the adversary is drawn from countable collections of continuous homeomorphisms, provided the outer function g can be appropriately modified. The inner functions ϕ encode information into a "prepared" representation. A homeomorphism h scrambles this representation adversarially. Stability is achieved by constructing a new outer function g that "decodes" the scrambled representation back to the target function f. The construction uses piecewise linear interpolation at strategically placed "forced" values on the real line, with the key insight that these forced values remain distinct under rationally independent coefficients (γ₁, ..., γₙ), preventing collisions.

### Mechanism 2: Baire Category Existence for Universal Inner Functions
For any countable set H of homeomorphisms, there exist fixed inner functions ϕ (independent of f and h) that work uniformly across all f ∈ C(Iⁿ, ℝ) and all h ∈ H. The proof constructs open dense sets U_f,h ⊂ C(I, I^{2n+1}) of "good" inner functions for each (f, h) pair. The Baire category theorem guarantees that the countable intersection ⋂_{p,q} U_{f_p, h_q} over a dense sequence {f_p} and countable H = {h_q} is non-empty (in fact, dense). Any ϕ in this intersection provides uniform approximation for all f and h.

### Mechanism 3: Recursive Convergence via λ-Contraction
Exact representation (not just approximation) is achieved through iterative refinement, where each step reduces the residual error by a factor λ ∈ (2n+1)/(2n+2, 1). Starting with g₀ = 0, define g_{m+1} to approximate the residual f - Σ_{k=0}^m Approx(g_k, h). Lemma 3.2 ensures ∥g_m∥ ≤ (1/(n+1)) λ^{m-1} ∥f∥, so Σ g_m converges uniformly to a uniformly continuous g. The final Approx(g, h) exactly equals f.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**: Why needed - The entire paper analyzes stability of this specific representation; without understanding that any continuous f: [0,1]ⁿ → ℝ can be written as Σ_{j=1}^{2n+1} g(Σ φᵢⱼ(xᵢ)), the adversarial framing makes no sense. Quick check: Can you explain why the KA theorem resolves (a portion of) Hilbert's 13th problem by showing continuous compositions can exceed what Hilbert expected?
- **Baire Category Theorem**: Why needed - The existence proofs for universal inner functions ϕ rely on showing that "good" ϕ form a dense Gδ set; understanding complete metric spaces and generic properties is essential to follow the proof strategy. Quick check: In a complete metric space, is the countable intersection of open dense sets guaranteed to be non-empty? What about an uncountable intersection?
- **Equi-continuity vs. Pointwise Continuity**: Why needed - The central obstruction identified is that {g_{f,h}} may not be equi-continuous as h varies; understanding why equi-continuity is required for taking limits (and why pointwise continuity per h is insufficient) is critical. Quick check: If a family of functions {f_α} is each individually uniformly continuous, does this guarantee the family is equi-continuous? What additional condition would guarantee equi-continuity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 
  - Inner layer functions ϕᵢ: Map I → I^{2n+1}; fixed, encode inputs into a "prepared" representation
  - Hidden layer homeomorphism h: Adversarial re-parameterization R^{2n+1} → R^{2n+1}; scrambles the prepared representation
  - Outer function g: Uniformly continuous R → R; decodes scrambled representation to produce final output
  - Coefficients γ₁, ..., γₙ: Rationally independent scalars; ensure distinct forced values prevent collisions
  - Approx(g, h): The composed approximator Σ_{j=1}^{2n+1} g(γ₁hⱼ(ϕ(x₁)) + ... + γₙhⱼ(ϕ(xₙ)))

- **Critical path**:
  1. Fix rationally independent γᵢ (e.g., square roots of distinct primes)
  2. Partition I into "red intervals" of rank 1, ..., 2n+1
  3. Construct ϕʰ to be constant/rational on each red interval
  4. Define "forced values" Φʰⱼ,ᵣ on red n-rectangular solids
  5. Set g(Φʰⱼ,ᵣ) = (1/(n+1)) f(ℓⱼ,ᵣ) and extend piecewise linearly
  6. Iterate via λ-contraction to achieve exact representation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Countable vs. Continuous Adversary: Theorem 2.1 handles countable H but not continuous groups; equi-continuity of {g_{f,h}} is the bottleneck
  - Figure 1 vs. Figure 2 placement: Re-parameterization acting on individual hidden neurons (Figure 1) is defeatable; acting after summation (Figure 2) may not be, unless h is affine
  - Multiple independent outer functions vs. single g: With 2n+1 independent outer functions, even axial translations become trivially defeatable; with a single g, equi-continuity issues re-emerge

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Collision of forced values: If Φʰⱼ,ᵣ values cross or cluster as h varies, the Lipschitz constant of g_f,h diverges
  - Loss of equi-continuity: The piecewise linear construction of g_f,h has "large transitions" near forced values; as h varies, these transitions occur at different locations, breaking equi-continuity
  - Post-summation scrambling: General homeomorphisms acting after the sum can undo all preparation, reducing expressivity to mere coordinate inclusion

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate countable stability empirically: Implement Theorem 2.1 for a small countable group (e.g., affine transforms with rational coefficients) on a test function f(x,y) = xy; verify that a single ϕ works across all h ∈ H by constructing g_f,h for each.
  2. Probe equi-continuity breakdown: For a 1-parameter continuous family of rotations in R⁵ (projected to the real line), measure how Lip(g_{f,h}) varies with the rotation angle; identify if/where it diverges.
  3. Test post-summation vs. pre-summation: Compare approximation quality when h acts before summation (Figure 1) vs. after (Figure 2) for non-affine homeomorphisms; confirm the predicted failure for post-summation case using f(x,y) = xy at points (±1, ±1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do the analogues of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 hold when the collection of re-parameterizations is the entire homeomorphism group of $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$, rather than just a countable collection?
- **Basis in paper:** Question 5.1.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method fails to take the limit from countable to continuous groups because the construction of the outer function $g_{f,h}$ lacks equi-continuity. Specifically, "forced" values may cross as the re-parameterization varies, causing the Lipschitz constants to diverge.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proof demonstrating that the family of outer functions $\{g_{f,h}\}$ can be constructed to be equi-continuous with respect to $h$, or a counter-example showing a failure of representation for a specific continuous group.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the stability theorems hold for re-parameterizations acting *after* the summation of neuron inputs (Figure 2) for classes beyond countable affine subsets and continuous translations?
- **Basis in paper:** Question 5.2.
- **Why unresolved:** General homeomorphisms acting after summation can potentially "undo" the first layer's data preparation, rendering the network unable to represent arbitrary functions. The authors specifically identify continuous families of $C^2$-diffeomorphisms as an interesting but unsolved case.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Identifying a non-affine class of homeomorphisms acting post-summation for which a uniformly continuous outer function $g$ can always be found to correct the "scrambling."

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the class of functions implementable by single hidden layer neural networks with computable activation functions and weights coincide with the class of all computable functions, even under the action of a computable adversary?
- **Basis in paper:** Question 6.1.
- **Why unresolved:** This question extends the stability analysis into computable analysis. The authors pose the question to understand if the "robustness" of the KA representation holds within the constraints of computability, but do not provide an analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A constructive proof that the KA representation remains valid under computable adversarial re-parameterizations, or a counter-example of a computable function that cannot be stably represented.

## Limitations
- The existence proofs are non-constructive, relying on Baire category theorem rather than explicit algorithms
- The equi-continuity obstruction for continuous groups of re-parameterizations remains unresolved
- The paper doesn't address computational complexity or practical feasibility of the constructions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The countable stability result (Theorem 2.1) - the Baire category argument is standard and the proof structure is sound
- **Medium confidence**: The multiple homeomorphism result (Theorem 2.2) - extends the countable case with additional complexity but follows similar logic
- **Low confidence**: The equi-continuity obstruction for continuous groups - identified as a problem but not fully characterized or resolved

## Next Checks
1. **Constructive validation**: Implement the red interval construction for n=2 and verify the forced values remain distinct under simple homeomorphisms like rational-affine transformations
2. **Equi-continuity empirical test**: For a 1-parameter family of rotations in R⁵ projected to the real line, measure how the Lipschitz constant of g_f,h varies with the rotation angle to confirm the theoretical obstruction
3. **Post-summation scrambling experiment**: Compare approximation quality when h acts before summation versus after for non-affine homeomorphisms on f(x,y)=xy at points (±1, ±1)
