# AceWGS: An LLM-Aided Framework to Accelerate Catalyst Design for Water-Gas Shift Reactions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05607
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05607
- Reference count: 20
- One-line primary result: An LLM-aided framework successfully identified a Pt-Au alloy catalyst on α-molybdenum carbide support achieving 95.07% CO conversion at 200°C.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of accelerating catalyst design for water-gas shift (WGS) reactions by developing AceWGS, an LLM-aided framework that integrates natural language processing with AI inverse modeling. The framework overcomes limitations of existing AI models by incorporating text-based information from research articles and enabling seamless cross-disciplinary collaboration. AceWGS features four components: answering general queries, extracting database information, comprehending research articles, and AI inverse modeling to identify optimal catalyst compositions. Using open-source tools and moderate-sized LLMs, the framework successfully identified a Pt-Au alloy catalyst on α-molybdenum carbide support capable of achieving 95.07% CO conversion at 200°C. The approach demonstrates how LLMs can enhance traditional AI models in materials design by providing synthesis protocols and natural language explanations of complex results, offering an adaptable framework for AI-accelerated catalyst design applications.

## Method Summary
AceWGS is built using Python 3.11 with LangChain 0.3, Ollama 0.3.11, and FAISS for vector storage. The framework processes 82 curated WGS articles (8,908 records, 99 features) through a GUI-driven interface with four key features: general query answering via LLMs, database extraction using a pandas agent, article comprehension via RAG with 1000-character text chunks and mxbai-embed-large embeddings, and AI inverse modeling combining a pre-trained theory-guided neural network with particle swarm optimization. The system uses local moderate-sized LLMs (Llama3.1, Gemma2) and is evaluated using 5-point Likert scales across tasks. The inverse model identifies optimal catalyst compositions while providing natural language explanations through LLM integration.

## Key Results
- Identified Pt-Au alloy catalyst (4.26% Pt, 3.09% Au, 92.64% α-MoC) predicted to achieve 95.07% ±0.79% CO conversion at 200°C
- Gemma2 (9B) outperformed other LLMs across all features with average scores of 3.46-3.81
- RAG-based article comprehension achieved consistent performance (3.17-3.23) across Llama2, Llama3, and Llama3.1
- Framework successfully integrated natural language synthesis protocols with AI predictions for novel catalyst design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds LLM responses in domain-specific literature, reducing hallucinations for scientific queries.
- Mechanism: A user query triggers retrieval of semantically similar text chunks (e.g., 1000-character segments with overlap) from a vector database (FAISS) populated with embeddings (mxbai-embed-large via Ollama) of PDF-extracted text from 82 curated WGS articles. The retrieved context, plus a prompt, is fed to an LLM (Llama3.1/Gemma2) to generate an answer anchored in the source text.
- Core assumption: Accurate text extraction and chunking preserve semantic meaning; embedding quality supports relevant retrieval for WGS-specific concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AceWGS interacts with researchers through natural language... comprehending the context described in these articles."
  - [section] Page 9-10, "Feature-3" describes vector retrieval with 1000-character chunks, 150-character overlap, FAISS, and OllamaEmbeddings for article comprehension.
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for this specific RAG-LLM-catalyst pipeline; adjacent work shows LLMs aiding catalyst knowledge exploration (Wang et al., 2024) and LLM-RAG for chemistry (Bran et al., 2024), but not the exact AceWGS configuration.
- Break condition: If chunking fragments critical synthesis steps (e.g., splitting a multi-step protocol across chunks), retrieval may miss key details, reducing answer completeness or accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An inverse model, combining a theory-guided neural network with particle swarm optimization (PSO), identifies optimal catalyst compositions and conditions from a high-dimensional design space.
- Mechanism: The pre-trained theory-guided AI model (embedding thermodynamic equilibrium constraints in its loss function) predicts CO conversion, uncertainty, and equilibrium conversion from inputs (catalyst composition, preparation methods, reaction conditions). PSO iteratively explores this prediction space, guided by user-defined constraints (e.g., base metal, temperature range), to maximize CO conversion.
- Core assumption: The theory-guided model's predictions are sufficiently accurate and generalizable within the explored parameter space; PSO can efficiently navigate this space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...identifying catalyst candidates using our proposed AI inverse model."
  - [section] Page 11-12, "AI Inverse Modelling" describes integrating the theory-guided model with PSO.
  - [corpus] Prior work (Chattoraj et al., 2022, 2023) established the theory-guided model and inverse design approach, forming the basis for this component.
- Break condition: If the AI model's training data lacks coverage for a novel catalyst class (e.g., a new support), predictions for that region will be unreliable, leading PSO to suggest suboptimal or invalid candidates.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can synthesize information from retrieved literature and inverse model outputs to generate novel, plausible research hypotheses (e.g., alloying strategies).
- Mechanism: The "Answer General Queries" feature, powered by an LLM with broad scientific knowledge, takes a prompt asking for design ideas based on specific catalysts (e.g., Pt/α-MoC and Au/α-MoC). The LLM draws on its internal knowledge base and the provided context to generate novel suggestions like creating a Pt-Au alloy.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-trained knowledge contains sufficient understanding of chemical principles (alloying, support effects) to generate scientifically sound and non-obvious hypotheses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...answering general queries... enabling seamless cross-disciplinary collaboration."
  - [section] Page 16, "Answer General Queries" is used to generate the "Alloying" design idea from the two identified catalysts.
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific hypothesis-generation mechanism in catalyst design; related work (Kim et al., 2024) shows LLMs predicting synthesizability, but hypothesis generation is less explored.
- Break condition: If the prompt is too vague or the LLM's internal knowledge about specific catalytic interactions is flawed, the generated hypotheses may be trivial, impractical, or scientifically unsound.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Water-Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction**
  - Why needed here: This is the core chemical process the entire framework is designed to optimize. Understanding the reaction (CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂), its goal (CO removal for fuel cells), and key performance metrics (CO conversion) is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary inputs and desired outputs of the WGS reaction in the context of hydrogen production?

- Concept: **Theory-Guided Machine Learning**
  - Why needed here: The inverse model is not a standard black-box AI; it is constrained by thermodynamics. Understanding that the loss function includes physical constraints explains why its predictions are more robust and trustworthy for physical systems.
  - Quick check question: How does incorporating a thermodynamic equilibrium constraint into a machine learning model's loss function improve its physical plausibility?

- Concept: **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
  - Why needed here: This is the search algorithm used for inverse design. It operates by iteratively adjusting candidate solutions (particle positions) to maximize an objective function (CO conversion) predicted by the AI model.
  - Quick check question: In the AceWGS inverse model, what is the objective function that the PSO algorithm is trying to maximize?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The AceWGS system consists of a GUI (Tkinter), a central "Switch" module, and four features: 1) **General Query LLM**, 2) **Database Extraction Agent** (pandas agent + LLM), 3) **Article Comprehension RAG** (vector retriever + LLM), and 4) **AI Inverse Model** (theory-guided AI + PSO + prompt-guided LLM). The data layer includes a structured pandas dataframe (for metadata) and a FAISS vector store (for full-text article chunks). All LLM components are orchestrated via LangChain and run locally via Ollama.

- Critical path: For a new catalyst design run, the critical path is: User Query (e.g., "catalysts for low-temp WGS") → **Database Extraction** (identifies key literature, e.g., Pt/α-MoC and Au/α-MoC papers) → **Article Comprehension** (extracts synthesis protocols and performance data) → **General Query** (generates novel design hypothesis, e.g., Pt-Au alloy) → **AI Inverse Model** (parameter settings from hypothesis → PSO search → AI prediction → LLM explanation of optimal composition/conditions).

- Design tradeoffs:
    - **Closed vs. Open-Source LLMs:** The system uses moderate-sized open-source models (Llama3.1, Gemma2) for adaptability and cost, but this may limit performance on complex reasoning compared to larger commercial models (e.g., GPT-4).
    - **Vector Chunking Parameters:** Using 1000-character chunks with 150-character overlap trades off retrieval granularity against context window limits. Smaller chunks improve precision but may lose broader context.
    - **RAG vs. Pure LLM for Article Comprehension:** RAG is chosen to ground answers in specific, verifiable text from the 82-article corpus, sacrificing the generative breadth of a pure LLM for factual accuracy.

- Failure signatures:
    - **Feature 2 (Database Extraction) failure:** Returns incorrect journal names or years. Check: LLM-generated Python command for data retrieval; may fail if metadata fields in the prompt don't match the dataframe.
    - **Feature 3 (Article Comprehension) failure:** Provides a synthesis step that is not in the specified article. Check: Vector retrieval may be pulling from an incorrect chunk; verify chunk IDs and embedding quality.
    - **Feature 4 (Inverse Model) failure:** Suggests a catalyst with >100% total metal loading. Check: PSO constraints are not properly defined; the optimization is exploring an infeasible region of the design space.

- First 3 experiments:
  1.  **Evaluate LLM Performance:** Run the 10 evaluation questions for "Answer General Queries" and "Extract Database Information" using Llama2, Llama3, Llama3.1, and Gemma2. Compare average Likert scores against those reported in Table 1 to establish a baseline for your local setup.
  2.  **Validate Retrieval Accuracy:** For a single paper (e.g., R71), ask 2-3 factual questions with known answers. Inspect which text chunks are retrieved from the FAISS vector store to verify that the embedding model (mxbai-embed-large) is correctly identifying relevant sections.
  3.  **Run a Controlled Inverse Design:** Use the "AI Inverse Modelling" feature with fixed, known parameters (e.g., Pt/CeO₂ from the case study) and a narrow temperature range. Compare the predicted optimal composition and conversion against literature values to sanity-check the theory-guided model and PSO integration.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Pt-Au/α-MoC catalyst predicted by AceWGS (4.26% Pt, 3.09% Au, 92.64% α-MoC) achieve the predicted 95.07% CO conversion at 200°C under experimental validation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The case study presents this catalyst composition as an AI-generated solution, but the paper provides no experimental confirmation of its actual performance.
- Why unresolved: The framework outputs predictions from inverse modeling combined with literature-derived synthesis protocols, but synthesis execution and performance testing were beyond the study's scope.
- What evidence would resolve it: Laboratory synthesis of the predicted catalyst composition followed by WGS reaction testing under the specified conditions (0.1% CO, 6.18% H2O, 5% CO2, 0.15% H2, 88.57% N2, 200°C, 1 hour time-on-stream).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can data retrieval from literature be automated to streamline dataset preparation for AI model training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states: "In the future, We will focus on expanding AceWGS by integrating advanced features, automating data retrieval directly from the literature, and streamlining dataset preparation for AI model training."
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on a manually curated database of 82 articles; automating extraction of structured experimental data from diverse article formats remains unsolved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a pipeline that automatically parses new WGS publications, extracts relevant features (compositions, conditions, conversions), and updates the database with minimal human intervention.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does LLM comprehension performance not improve with newer model versions (Llama2→Llama3→Llama3.1 showed no improvement), and what architectural or training factors explain this anomaly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The results state: "Unlike the trends observed in the previous two features, the performance of the three Llama models did not improve with the newer versions for the comprehension task" (Table 1 shows Llama2: 3.17, Llama3: 3.17, Llama3.1: 3.08).
- Why unresolved: The paper notes this counterintuitive finding but does not investigate causes related to RAG-specific tasks, chunking strategies, or retrieval-reasoning tradeoffs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying text segmentation parameters, embedding models, and retrieval mechanisms across LLM versions to identify performance determinants.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can AceWGS generalize effectively to non-noble metal catalysts and other catalytic reactions beyond low-temperature WGS?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The database and all evaluations focus exclusively on noble metal catalysts for WGS; the introduction mentions base metals (10 types) in the database but no validation on these is presented.
- Why unresolved: The theory-guided AI model and inverse modeling were developed and tested only on noble metal catalysts; different catalyst classes may exhibit distinct feature-importance relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of AceWGS to predict catalysts from the 10 base metals in the database (e.g., Cu, Ni, Co-based systems) with subsequent performance evaluation.

## Limitations
- The framework's performance depends heavily on the quality of text extraction and chunking, which could fragment synthesis protocols and reduce comprehension accuracy.
- The inverse modeling approach is limited to catalyst compositions within the pre-trained theory-guided model's training domain, potentially missing novel catalyst classes.
- The LLM's ability to generate scientifically sound hypotheses, while demonstrated in one case, lacks extensive validation across multiple design scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The overall framework architecture and the integration of RAG with LLMs for literature comprehension are well-supported by the methodology description and evaluation results.
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the inverse modeling approach for identifying optimal catalyst compositions is supported by the case study but would benefit from validation across a broader range of catalyst types.
- **Low Confidence:** The LLM's ability to generate novel, scientifically sound hypotheses (e.g., alloying strategies) is demonstrated in the case study but lacks extensive validation across multiple design scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Expand Corpus Validation:** Test the framework's performance using a larger, more diverse corpus of WGS literature (e.g., 200+ articles spanning 2013-2024) to assess its scalability and robustness to corpus expansion.
2. **Cross-Catalyst Validation:** Apply the inverse modeling feature to identify optimal catalysts for a different reaction (e.g., CO oxidation or methanol synthesis) to evaluate the framework's generalizability beyond WGS.
3. **Expert Review of Hypotheses:** Have domain experts evaluate a set of 10-15 novel catalyst design hypotheses generated by the LLM to assess their scientific merit and practicality, providing qualitative validation of the hypothesis-generation capability.
