## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of automatic transcription of acoustic guitar strumming, specifically detecting strumming events, classifying their direction (up/down), and identifying the corresponding chords. The authors propose a deep learning approach using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that takes microphone audio as input. They develop a multimodal recording setup using an ESP32 smartwatch motion sensor alongside audio recordings to collect a novel dataset of 90 minutes of real-world guitar strumming data, complemented by a synthetic dataset of 4 hours. Their model is trained to jointly detect strumming events and classify their direction and chord.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a CRNN architecture that processes audio spectrograms to jointly detect strumming events and classify their direction and chord. They created a novel dataset using an ESP32 smartwatch motion sensor combined with audio recordings, collecting 90 minutes of real-world guitar strumming data. This was supplemented with a synthetic dataset of 4 hours generated to provide additional training diversity. The model was trained on this combined dataset and evaluated against baseline onset detection algorithms, showing significant improvements in performance.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92.75% F1-score for strumming action detection
- Achieved 90.06% accuracy for chord classification
- Hybrid method combining synthetic and real-world data achieved the highest accuracy
- Significant improvements over baseline onset detection algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by leveraging the temporal patterns in audio spectrograms that are characteristic of strumming events. The CRNN architecture is particularly suited for this task because convolutional layers can capture local spectral patterns associated with different chords, while recurrent layers can model the temporal dependencies between consecutive strumming events and their directions. The joint learning framework allows the model to learn shared representations that benefit both event detection and classification tasks simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used to extract local spectral features from audio spectrograms; needed for identifying chord patterns and strumming characteristics
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Capture temporal dependencies in the audio sequence; essential for modeling the sequential nature of strumming patterns
- **CRNN Architecture**: Combines CNNs and RNNs to leverage both spatial and temporal features; required for the dual task of detection and classification
- **Spectrogram Representation**: Converts time-domain audio into a time-frequency representation; provides the input format for the CNN layers
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates additional training samples to improve model generalization; addresses the limitation of limited real-world recording time

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Audio Input -> Spectrogram Conversion -> Convolutional Layers -> Recurrent Layers -> Dense Layers -> Output (Detection + Classification)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from spectrogram extraction through convolutional feature extraction, temporal modeling via recurrent layers, and finally to joint prediction of strumming events and chord classes.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- CRNN vs pure CNN: RNNs add temporal modeling capability at the cost of increased computational complexity
- Synthetic vs real data: Synthetic data provides scalability but may not capture all real-world nuances
- Joint vs separate models: Joint training enables shared feature learning but may create optimization challenges

**Failure Signatures:**
- High false positives in detection could indicate over-sensitivity to percussive elements
- Chord classification errors might suggest insufficient chord variation in training data
- Temporal misalignment between detected events and actual strumming could point to RNN training issues

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test model performance on audio-only input without motion sensor data to assess necessity of multimodal features
2. Evaluate model on held-out playing styles not present in training to test generalization
3. Compare performance of synthetic-only, real-only, and hybrid training approaches to quantify data contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation based on a relatively small dataset of only 90 minutes of real-world recordings
- Synthetic data augmentation introduces uncertainty about real-world generalization
- Multimodal recording setup has not been validated for potential latency or synchronization issues

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- The methodology for joint detection and classification using CRNN architecture is sound and well-established in audio processing literature

**Medium confidence:**
- The reported performance metrics are reliable for the specific dataset and recording conditions used, but may not generalize to broader contexts
- The hybrid approach combining synthetic and real-world data shows promise, but the relative contribution of each data source to final performance is not clearly quantified

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the model on a larger, more diverse dataset including different guitar types, playing techniques, and recording environments to assess generalization capability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of motion sensor data versus audio-only features, and test the model's performance when trained on audio-only inputs
3. Test the model's robustness to common audio processing challenges such as background noise, microphone quality variations, and polyphonic interference from other instruments
