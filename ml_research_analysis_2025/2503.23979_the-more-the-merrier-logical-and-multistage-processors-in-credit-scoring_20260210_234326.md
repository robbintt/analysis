# The more the merrier: logical and multistage processors in credit scoring

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces Logical Processors (LPs) and Multistage Processors (MPs) to improve algorithmic fairness in credit scoring while maintaining predictive accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses algorithmic fairness in credit scoring by introducing two novel methods: Logical Processors (LPs) and Multistage Processors (MPs). LPs extend univariate fairness techniques to handle multiple sensitive attributes by reducing them to a single binary variable through logical operations (OR, AND, XOR). MPs combine fairness interventions from different pipeline stages (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) to achieve synergistic improvements in both fairness and accuracy metrics. The empirical study demonstrates that these methods can significantly improve fairness metrics like separation while maintaining or enhancing predictive performance on both simulated and real-world German credit data.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two complementary approaches to fairness in credit scoring. Logical Processors apply bitwise operations (OR, AND, XOR) to multiple sensitive attributes to create a single binary protected attribute, enabling univariate fairness methods to operate. Multistage Processors sequentially combine different fairness interventions across the machine learning pipeline - for example, applying Reweighing (pre-processing) to balance the dataset followed by Adversarial Debiasing (in-processing) to learn fair representations. The methods are evaluated on German credit data with Age and Sex as sensitive attributes, using Balanced Accuracy as the performance metric and Separation (Equalized Odds) as the fairness metric.

## Key Results
- LPs successfully preserve both fairness and accuracy while handling multiple sensitive variables through dimensionality reduction
- Certain MP combinations achieved perfect separation (0 deviation) with minimal accuracy loss
- MPs showed promise in improving fairness metrics while maintaining or enhancing accuracy, with some combinations improving accuracy by ~20% compared to individual constituents
- Separation was identified as the theoretically appropriate metric for credit scoring as it accounts for differential base rates in loan repayment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Logical Processors (LPs) enable univariate fairness methods to handle multiple sensitive attributes by reducing dimensionality via logical operations. LPs apply a bitwise function (OR, AND, XOR) to multiple sensitive attributes ($A_1, A_2, \dots$) to create a single binary protected attribute $A_{LP}$. This maps a multivariate intersectional problem into a univariate binary classification problem, allowing standard fairness libraries to operate without architectural changes. The core assumption is that the specific logical operator chosen accurately captures the societal structure of the bias without losing critical information. Break condition: If the privileged and unprivileged groups created by the LP have vastly different base rates or sample sizes, the resulting metric variance may destabilize the fairness optimizer.

### Mechanism 2
Multistage Processors (MPs) achieve synergistic fairness improvements by sequentially applying bias mitigation at different pipeline stages. MPs chain interventions - for example, applying Reweighing (Pre-processing) to balance the dataset followed by Adversarial Debiasing (In-processing) to learn fair representations. The first processor sanitizes the input distribution, potentially making the optimization landscape easier for the subsequent in-processor to navigate. The core assumption is that the fairness interventions are compatible and non-adversarial; the first intervention does not introduce noise that confuses the second. Break condition: If a post-processor dominates the pipeline with a calibration logic that conflicts with the in-processor's separation logic, accuracy or fairness can degrade sharply.

### Mechanism 3
Optimizing for "Separation" (Equalized Odds) is the theoretically appropriate metric for credit scoring because it accounts for differential base rates in loan repayment. Instead of enforcing demographic parity (Independence), which ignores creditworthiness, Separation requires equal True Positive and False Positive rates across groups. This ensures that among those who would repay (Y=1), the approval rate is equal regardless of sensitive attributes. The core assumption is that the historical target variable Y (repayment) is a valid ground truth and not itself severely corrupted by historical bias. Break condition: If the training data Y contains label bias (e.g., historical redlining where qualified applicants were denied), enforcing separation merely learns the biased patterns perfectly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fairness Triad (Independence, Separation, Sufficiency)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly rejects Independence and Sufficiency for credit scoring in favor of Separation. You must understand why "blindness" (Independence) destroys predictive power in finance.
  - Quick check question: If a bank approves 90% of men and 90% of women, but men default 5% of the time while women default 50% of the time, does this satisfy Separation?

- **Concept: Intersectionality via Bitwise Logic**
  - Why needed here: Logical Processors rely on how you define the unprivileged group.
  - Quick check question: To protect "Women of Color" specifically, would you use the OR (A1 + A2), AND (A1 * A2), or XOR (A1 ⊕ A2) operator on Race and Gender?

- **Concept: The Bias Mitigation Pipeline**
  - Why needed here: Multistage processors require distinguishing between Pre-processing (data transformation), In-processing (loss function modification), and Post-processing (threshold adjustment).
  - Quick check question: Which stage modifies the loss function L(θ), and which stage modifies the decision threshold τ?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Dataset D=(X, Y, A) → LP Block A → MP Pipeline [Pre-processor] → [In-processor] → [Post-processor] → Evaluator (Balanced Accuracy, Separation)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select the Logical Processor (OR/AND/XOR) based on the intersectionality requirements
  2. Select the Multistage combination (e.g., PI: Pre+In, or IP: In+Post)
  3. Optimize for Balanced Accuracy while constraining Separation deviation to ≈ 0

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LP Choice: OR protects more people but dilutes specific intersectional bias; AND targets intersectional bias but may result in a sample size too small for statistical significance
  - MP Choice: In-processors are computationally expensive; Post-processors are cheap but often degrade accuracy
  - Metric Choice: Enforcing strict Separation (SP=0) may significantly reduce Accuracy compared to allowing a small fairness deviation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy Collapse: Specific MP combinations involving Platt Scaling often dropped accuracy to ~0.37 (Section 4.2)
  - LP Ineffectiveness: Using XOR when compound prejudice is the main issue will fail to protect the vulnerable subgroup
  - Dominating Post-processor: Post-processors can override the learned representations of In-processors, leading to unpredictable "mixed bag" results (Section 4.2)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (LP):** Implement the OR processor on the German Credit Dataset (Age + Sex). Compare the separation metric of a standard classifier vs. the LP-adjusted classifier to ensure the LP itself doesn't introduce bias.
  2. **Synergy Check (MP):** Train a baseline model with only Reweighing. Then train a second model with Reweighing + Prejudice Index Regularizer. Verify if the MP configuration yields higher accuracy without increasing Separation error.
  3. **Stress Test (Separation):** Run an MP configuration (e.g., Adversarial Debiasing + Equalized Odds) and plot the Pareto frontier of Accuracy vs. Separation to visualize the cost of perfect fairness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How do Logical Processors (LPs) scale and perform when applied to more than two sensitive attributes? The authors state they "only explored the bivariate case" and explicitly call for research on the scalability of this tool to handle "three or more sensitive attributes."

- **Open Question 2:** What are the underlying mechanisms that determine whether specific fairness processors interact synergistically or detrimentally in a Multistage Processor (MP)? Section 5.2 poses the questions: "does applying this particular pre-processor improve the predictions of this in-processor? Why or why not?"

- **Open Question 3:** Can Multistage Processors outperform individual methods when the hyper-parameters of the constituent processors are jointly optimized? The authors note that "one direction left unexplored is to check whether or not these new multistage processors can outperform their individual counterparts if their hyper-parameters are tuned."

## Limitations

- Experimental scope is narrow, relying on only two datasets (simulated and German credit) with binary sensitive attributes, limiting generalizability to real-world intersectional scenarios
- Hyperparameter sensitivity is not thoroughly explored, and specific combinations that achieved perfect separation may not generalize across different data distributions
- The specific methods may not scale effectively to multi-class sensitive attributes or larger intersectional groups beyond binary splits

## Confidence

- **Logical Processors effectiveness**: Medium - Validated on limited datasets with binary attributes
- **Multistage Processor synergies**: Medium - Shows promise but lacks comprehensive ablation studies
- **Separation as appropriate metric**: High - Theoretically justified, though assumes unbiased ground truth

## Next Checks

1. Test LP and MP methods on multi-class sensitive attributes and larger intersectional groups beyond binary splits to validate generalizability
2. Conduct extensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis across diverse datasets to verify robustness and identify optimal configurations
3. Validate Separation metric assumptions by introducing controlled label bias to simulate historical discrimination patterns and assess method performance under realistic bias conditions
