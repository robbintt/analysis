# Multimodal Data-Driven Classification of Mental Disorders: A Comprehensive Approach to Diagnosing Depression, Anxiety, and Schizophrenia

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03943

- Primary result: EEG coherence features improve classification accuracy to 96.4% versus 88.7% with power spectral density alone

## Executive Summary
This study develops a multimodal CNN framework for diagnosing psychiatric disorders by integrating EEG coherence data with demographic features. Using Apache Spark for distributed processing, the approach analyzes 945 samples with 1,149 features to classify schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and other disorders. The key innovation is incorporating coherence features that capture inter-regional brain synchronization, which substantially improves diagnostic accuracy over traditional power spectral density features alone. The framework demonstrates the value of holistic, multimodal approaches for developing efficient diagnostic tools in psychiatric care.

## Method Summary
The method preprocesses EEG data using Apache Spark/Hadoop, extracting both power spectral density (PSD) and coherence features from 19 electrodes across 6 frequency bands. Demographic variables (age, sex, education, IQ) are concatenated with EEG features and normalized. A CNN architecture with Conv2D, pooling, and dense layers processes the combined feature matrix. The model is trained with Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, achieving 96.4% accuracy when coherence features are included versus 88.7% without them. Class balancing is performed using SMOTE or undersampling techniques.

## Key Results
- Coherence features improve classification accuracy from 88.7% to 96.4%
- CNN architecture effectively captures spatial patterns in multimodal EEG data
- Multimodal integration of EEG with demographic features enhances diagnostic robustness
- Per-class performance varies significantly, with some disorders showing complete classification failure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Coherence features substantially improve classification by capturing functional synchronization between brain regions. Mental disorders exhibit distinct connectivity disruptions—schizophrenia shows altered fronto-parietal coherence, mood disorders show hemispheric asymmetries. CNN layers learn spatial patterns from coherence matrices that distinguish disorder-specific connectivity signatures. The assumption is that mental disorders have characteristic inter-regional connectivity disruptions detectable via scalp EEG coherence.

### Mechanism 2
Multimodal integration of EEG with demographic variables improves classification by providing prior probability context. Demographic features like age and sex modulate expected EEG patterns—age affects neural oscillation frequency, sex differences exist in hemispheric lateralization. The model learns disorder-by-demographic interactions rather than treating EEG patterns as universal. The assumption is that EEG signatures of mental disorders are not uniform across demographic groups.

### Mechanism 3
CNNs effectively extract discriminative spatial features from high-dimensional EEG feature matrices. Convolutional layers apply learned filters across electrode-organized feature maps, capturing local spatial dependencies. The architecture uses Conv2D → Flatten → Dense with Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. The assumption is that EEG features organized by electrode position retain spatial structure meaningful for convolution operations.

## Foundational Learning

- **EEG Coherence vs. Power Spectral Density**: PSD measures signal power within frequency bands at single electrodes (local activity), while coherence measures correlation between signals at two electrodes (functional connectivity). Why needed: The paper's central finding hinges on coherence outperforming PSD. Quick check: If you observe elevated alpha PSD at occipital electrodes but reduced fronto-occipital alpha coherence, what does each finding indicate about brain function?

- **10-20 EEG Electrode Placement System**: The paper uses 19 electrodes mapped to brain regions (Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Central, Occipital). Why needed: Understanding electrode positions is essential for interpreting coherence patterns. Quick check: Which electrode pairs would you expect to show highest coherence during visual processing tasks, and why?

- **Class Imbalance Handling (SMOTE vs. Undersampling)**: The paper mentions using SMOTE or undersampling to correct imbalances. Why needed: Understanding when each is appropriate prevents introducing synthetic artifacts or losing rare-class information. Quick check: Given 945 samples across multiple disorder classes with likely uneven distribution, what are the tradeoffs of SMOTE vs. undersampling for creating training data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Layer (Spark DataFrame) -> Preprocessing Pipeline (MLlib) -> Feature Engineering (PSD + Coherence) -> Model Layer (TensorFlow CNN) -> Serving Layer (Web dashboard)
- **Critical path**: Data ingestion → Spark DataFrame creation → Feature extraction (PSD + Coherence) → Train/test split with class balancing → CNN training → Evaluation with/without coherence features
- **Design tradeoffs**: With vs. without coherence: 96.4% vs. 88.7% accuracy, but coherence adds 1,026 features (89% of total). CNN vs. RNN: CNN chosen for spatial pattern extraction. Spark vs. single-node: Distributed processing reduces training time by 40%
- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting to coherence features if model fails on external datasets; class collapse showing 0.00 precision/recall for minority classes; demographic bias if age/education distributions differ between training and deployment
- **First 3 experiments**: Ablation study on coherence features (PSD only, coherence only, PSD + coherence); demographic stratification across age quartiles and sex groups; cross-dataset validation on independent EEG datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework maintain accuracy when deployed for real-time EEG monitoring in clinical settings?
- How does performance generalize to external EEG datasets with different electrode configurations and demographics?
- Would incorporating genetic markers or fMRI data alongside EEG further improve classification accuracy?
- Can the framework be adapted for differential diagnosis across co-occurring psychiatric conditions?

## Limitations
- Small dataset (945 samples) with high dimensionality (1,149 features) raises overfitting concerns
- Perfect classification for some classes (Schizophrenia: 100%) versus complete failure for others (Mood disorder: 0%) suggests potential bias
- Lack of cross-dataset validation limits generalizability of reported accuracy
- Coherence features may capture dataset-specific artifacts rather than generalizable disorder signatures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multimodal integration (EEG + demographics) provides diagnostic value for mental disorders
- **Medium confidence**: Coherence features improve classification accuracy over PSD alone, but magnitude may be overstated
- **Low confidence**: The specific 96.4% accuracy figure and CNN architecture effectiveness without external validation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Train identical CNN models with (a) PSD only, (b) coherence only, (c) PSD + coherence on the same dataset to quantify individual feature contributions
2. **Demographic stratification analysis**: Evaluate per-class accuracy across age quartiles and sex groups to identify demographic bias
3. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the trained model on an independent psychiatric EEG dataset to verify whether coherence patterns generalize beyond the original Kaggle source data
