core_contribution: This paper argues for rethinking time series analysis as a reasoning
  task, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to uncover causal structures and contextual
  dynamics rather than merely recognizing patterns. Existing time series methods often
  ignore reasoning potential, relying on static correlations and failing to adapt
  to real-world shifts.

# Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.13029
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13029
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Advocates for reasoning-centric time series analysis using LLMs to uncover causal structures and contextual dynamics, moving beyond pattern recognition to improve interpretability and accuracy in real-world applications.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a paradigm shift in time series analysis, arguing that existing methods focusing on pattern recognition fail to capture the reasoning potential of time series data. The authors advocate for treating time series analysis as a reasoning task, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive agents to guide causal assumption extraction, data construction, model integration, and evaluation. Through a synthetic example, they demonstrate how LLM-guided reasoning dynamically adjusts model focus to evolving causal drivers, supporting various reasoning types including relational, quantitative, counterfactual, adaptation, semantic, abductive, and commonsense reasoning.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces an instructive pipeline where LLMs act as cognitive agents in time series analysis. The approach involves generating synthetic multivariate time series data with dynamic causal drivers, using LLMs to extract causal rules from textual scenario descriptions, converting these rules into binary masks for input features, and training an attention-based forecaster under three conditions: baseline (no mask), manual (oracle mask), and LLM-guided (LLM-generated mask). The method aims to shift from static correlation-based analysis to dynamic, interpretable reasoning that can adapt to real-world shifts and regime changes.

## Key Results
- The LLM-guided approach successfully shifts model attention from $x_1$ to $x_2$ at $t=150$ while ignoring spurious $x_3$ in the synthetic example
- Demonstrates dynamic attention alignment that adapts to evolving causal drivers in time series data
- Shows that interpretability is key to validating reasoning through instance-level attribution, data influence, and architecture behavior analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by treating LLMs as cognitive agents that can interpret textual descriptions of causal relationships and translate them into structured rules. These rules then guide the model's attention mechanisms to focus on relevant features while ignoring spurious correlations. This approach enables dynamic adaptation to regime shifts in time series data, where causal drivers change over time. By incorporating reasoning capabilities, the system can handle complex real-world scenarios that involve multiple types of reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal reasoning**: Understanding cause-effect relationships in time series; needed to move beyond correlation-based analysis; quick check: verify causal assumptions extracted by LLM match ground truth
- **Attention mechanisms**: Focusing model computation on relevant features; needed to implement dynamic feature selection; quick check: visualize attention weights across time periods
- **LLM as cognitive agent**: Using language models for structured reasoning tasks; needed to bridge textual domain knowledge with model inputs; quick check: test LLM prompt consistency across different scenarios
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creating controlled environments with known ground truth; needed to validate reasoning capabilities; quick check: ensure generated data matches specified causal relationships
- **Multimodal integration**: Combining text, time series, and reasoning; needed for comprehensive analysis; quick check: verify all input modalities are properly processed and integrated

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Agent -> Causal Rule Extractor -> Binary Mask Generator -> Attention-Based Forecaster

**Critical Path**: Textual scenario description → LLM reasoning → Structured causal rules → Feature masking → Model training and attention visualization

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using LLM-generated masks provides flexibility and reasoning capability but introduces potential hallucination risks, while manual masks offer reliability but lack adaptability to changing conditions.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- LLM fails to output correct causal structure or format, breaking the masking logic
- Model ignores masks and attends to spurious correlations due to strong synthetic correlation
- Attention weights don't shift appropriately at regime change points

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Generate synthetic data with clear causal relationships and regime shifts at known timepoints
2. Test LLM prompt engineering to reliably extract structured causal rules in required format
3. Implement attention-based forecaster and validate attention visualization under all three masking conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The synthetic data generation procedure is underspecified with unknown functional forms, noise parameters, and temporal dependencies
- The exact LLM prompt used to elicit causal rules is not provided in the paper
- Model architecture details including layer count and attention head configuration are omitted

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework for reasoning-centric time series analysis is clearly articulated and internally consistent
- **Medium confidence**: The synthetic experiment demonstration is described but lacks key implementation details for exact replication
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability claims are not empirically validated on real-world datasets or supported by ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. **Data Generation Specification**: Implement and document the exact synthetic data generation procedure with all parameters including functional forms, noise levels, and lag structures
2. **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Test different prompt formulations with chosen LLM to reliably extract structured causal rules in required format, including error handling for hallucinations
3. **Architecture Verification**: Implement the attention-based forecaster with specified hyperparameters and validate that attention visualizations correctly reflect imposed causal masks across all three experimental conditions
