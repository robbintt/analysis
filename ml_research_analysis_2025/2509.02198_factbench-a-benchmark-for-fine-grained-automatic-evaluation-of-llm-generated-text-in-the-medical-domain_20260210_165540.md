# FActBench: A Benchmark for Fine-grained Automatic Evaluation of LLM-Generated Text in the Medical Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02198
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02198
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Unanimous Voting (UnVot) achieves Cohen's kappa of 0.75 with domain experts for medical LLM factuality evaluation

## Executive Summary
FActBench introduces a benchmark for fine-grained automatic evaluation of LLM-generated text in the medical domain. The system combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI) through an Unanimous Voting approach to fact-check atomic facts extracted from LLM outputs. Tested across six LLMs on four tasks (text summarization, lay summarization, RAG, and open-ended generation), the benchmark demonstrates that the hybrid verification method correlates best with human domain expert evaluations, outperforming individual fact-checking techniques.

## Method Summary
FActBench uses a two-stage hybrid fact-checking approach: first checking atomic facts against grounding documents (intrinsic), then against Wikipedia for extrinsic verification. The system decomposes LLM outputs into atomic facts, evaluates each using both NLI (DeBERTa-v3) and CoT prompting (GPT-4o mini), and applies Unanimous Voting requiring both methods to agree for a fact to be considered supported. The benchmark evaluates six contemporary LLMs across PubMed, PLOS, and BioASQ datasets for four generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Unanimous Voting (UnVot) correlates best with domain expert evaluations (Cohen's kappa = 0.75)
- LLMs perform better in grounding-based tasks (RAG) compared to open-ended generation
- The hybrid approach effectively distinguishes between unsupported facts and factually correct hallucinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Unanimous Voting for Precision
- Claim: Combining CoT and NLI predictions through Unanimous Voting aligns better with human domain experts than either technique alone
- Core assumption: Error modes of generative LLMs (CoT) and fine-tuned discriminators (NLI) are sufficiently distinct
- Evidence: UnVot shows highest correlation with expert judgment; related work (InFi-Check) supports fine-grained fact-checking
- Break condition: If NLI and CoT share similar biases, intersection may lower recall without improving precision

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Intrinsic-Extrinsic Verification
- Claim: Two-stage verification distinguishes between context-unfaithful and factually correct hallucinations
- Core assumption: Medical hallucinations can be "factually correct but contextually unfaithful"
- Evidence: Approach first checks grounding documents, then Wikipedia for omitted but true facts
- Break condition: Wikipedia staleness or lack of medical depth can cause false "unsupported" verdicts

### Mechanism 3: Atomic Fact Decomposition
- Claim: Reliable evaluation requires isolating independent atomic facts rather than holistic scoring
- Core assumption: Atomic facts can be consistently extracted with independent truth values
- Evidence: Follows Min et al. (2023) FActScore approach; InFi-Check validates decomposition strategy
- Break condition: Aggressive decomposition may sever necessary semantic dependencies

## Foundational Learning

- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**
  - Why needed: Serves as "discriminator" component (DeBERTa-v3) to determine if LLM output entails source facts
  - Quick check: Given premise "The patient took 500mg of Drug A" and hypothesis "The patient took Drug A," what classification does NLI produce?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed: Serves as "generative judge" (GPT-4o mini) to reason through atomic fact verification step-by-step
  - Quick check: How does "think step-by-step" prompting change verification results versus direct yes/no questions?

- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Hallucinations**
  - Why needed: Architecture distinguishes output contradicting source document (intrinsic) from output contradicting world knowledge (extrinsic)
  - Quick check: If LLM adds a true scientific fact not in source paper, is this intrinsic or extrinsic hallucination?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Ingestion -> Decomposition -> NLI Verifier -> CoT Verifier -> Aggregator -> Knowledge Store
- **Critical path**: Intrinsic Check → Extrinsic Check sequence; cannot proceed to Wikipedia check until grounding document check complete
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Latency vs. Reliability: UnVot requires two model inferences, doubling evaluation time
  - Recall vs. Precision: Optimizes for expert agreement but may be stricter than human annotation
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - CoT Verifier Drift: GPT-4o mini may hallucinate reasoning to justify false verdicts
  - Context Window Limits: DeBERTa may struggle with oversized grounding documents
  - Wikipedia Staleness: Extrinsic checks fail for post-dump medical discoveries
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Correlation Run: Reproduce Cohen's kappa (0.75) on held-out summaries
  2. Ablation on Context: Run RAG with/without grounding document to quantify performance drop
  3. Disagreement Analysis: Characterize medical claims where NLI and CoT diverge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Domain Transferability**: Does UnVot maintain superior correlation with experts in legal or financial domains beyond medicine?
- **Comparative Performance**: How does UnVot compare to Prometheus, TIGERScore, or G-Eval in accuracy and cost-efficiency?
- **Model Sensitivity**: Is UnVot reliability sensitive to specific choice of CoT and NLI backbone models?
- **Optimization Potential**: Can pipeline be optimized using local models instead of external API calls without quality degradation?

## Limitations

- Reliance on Wikipedia as external knowledge source may not capture latest medical research
- Validation based on single expert panel raises generalizability questions across medical specialties
- Significant computational cost from requiring two model inferences per atomic fact

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Correlation results showing UnVot outperforming individual techniques; grounding-based tasks outperforming open-ended generation
- **Medium Confidence**: Wikipedia-based extrinsic checking reliability for distinguishing unsupported from false facts
- **Medium Confidence**: Atomic fact decomposition's ability to consistently preserve semantic dependencies

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Validation**: Re-run extrinsic fact-checking using more recent Wikipedia dump to quantify knowledge staleness impact
2. **Multi-expert Validation**: Expand domain expert evaluation to 5-10 independent medical professionals across specialties
3. **Recall-Precision Tradeoff Analysis**: Vary Unanimous Voting thresholds to generate precision-recall curves for different medical use cases
