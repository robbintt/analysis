# Bayesian Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Dropout for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11701
- Authors: Abhinav Das; Stephan Schlüter
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: BNN with MC dropout achieves MAE 19.94 and CRPS 9.997 on German electricity price data, with sharp but undercalibrated prediction intervals (PICP 0.11)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian neural network framework with Monte Carlo dropout for probabilistic day-ahead electricity price forecasting in deregulated markets. The approach employs hour-specific models trained on a 248-dimensional feature vector including lagged prices, residual load forecasts, renewable production forecasts, and calendar variables to capture complex temporal and seasonal dependencies. MC dropout is used to approximate Bayesian inference, generating predictive distributions that provide both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. The framework is evaluated on German electricity market data from 2017 to 2023, demonstrating competitive performance against benchmark models while producing the sharpest prediction intervals among tested approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework trains 24 separate Bayesian neural networks (one per hour) on German electricity market data. Each model takes a 248-dimensional input vector containing lagged prices (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-7), residual load forecasts, renewable production forecasts, day index, and weekday dummies. Networks have 2-3 hidden layers with 64-256 neurons and ReLU activation, trained with MSE loss using Adam optimization. MC dropout with 1000 forward passes at inference approximates the posterior distribution, providing both point predictions and uncertainty estimates. The approach is evaluated against GARCHX and LEAR benchmark models using point and probabilistic forecasting metrics.

## Key Results
- BNN achieves MAE of 19.94, closely trailing LEAR (19.24) and outperforming GARCHX (25.86)
- Probabilistic performance shows BNN CRPS of 9.997, comparable to LEAR (9.617) and better than GARCHX (12.970)
- BNN produces the sharpest prediction intervals with MPIW of 80.94, compared to 88.32 for GARCHX and 92.27 for LEAR
- Prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) indicates undercoverage across all models at 0.11

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Monte Carlo dropout approximates Bayesian inference by sampling from the posterior distribution over network weights during prediction. Dropout masks applied at test time create stochastic forward passes, generating 1000 samples from the approximate posterior. The empirical mean and variance of these samples provide point predictions and uncertainty estimates without computing intractable integrals.

### Mechanism 2
Hour-specific models capture diurnal price patterns more effectively than a single unified model. Training 24 separate BNN models allows each to specialize in patterns specific to that hour (e.g., peak demand vs. low-demand overnight hours).

### Mechanism 3
The 248-dimensional feature vector captures lagged temporal dependencies and exogenous market factors essential for forecasting volatile prices. Input includes lagged prices, residual load forecasts, total renewable production forecasts, and weekday dummies, encoding autocorrelation, weekly seasonality, and supply-demand fundamentals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayesian Inference and Posterior Distributions**: Understanding p(W|D) ∝ p(D|W)p(W) is essential to grasp how uncertainty propagates through predictions. Quick check: If you double the amount of training data, would you expect the posterior variance over weights to increase, decrease, or stay the same? Why?

- **Dropout as Regularization vs. Variational Inference**: Standard dropout regularizes by zeroing activations; MC dropout reinterprets this as approximate variational inference. Distinguishing these is critical for understanding why dropout is applied at test time. Quick check: In standard inference, dropout is disabled at test time. In MC dropout, why is it kept enabled?

- **Probabilistic Forecast Evaluation Metrics (CRPS, PICP, MPIW)**: Point metrics (MAE, RMSE) don't capture calibration or sharpness. CRPS, PICP, and MPIW evaluate distributional quality—essential for risk management. Quick check: A model has PICP = 0.11 for a 90% prediction interval. What does this indicate about calibration, and is narrower MPIW beneficial if PICP remains low?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (248D) -> Hidden layers (L∈{2,3}, d∈{64,128,256}) -> ReLU activation -> Dropout (γ∈{0.2,0.3,0.4}) -> Output (24D, linear)

- **Critical path**: 1) Preprocess data with missing value imputation 2) Train 24 hour-specific models with MSE loss, Adam optimizer 3) Grid search hyperparameters 4) Run 1000 MC forward passes at inference 5) Compute predictive mean and uncertainty

- **Design tradeoffs**: Sharper intervals (low MPIW) vs. calibration (PICP near nominal 0.90): BNN achieves MPIW = 80.94 but PICP = 0.11. Hour-specific models vs. unified model: Specialization may improve accuracy but increases training complexity and misses inter-hour correlations.

- **Failure signatures**: Undercoverage (PICP << 0.90), overconfident predictions, high variance across MC samples indicating unstable training or insufficient data.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication with default hyperparameters to reproduce MAE ≈ 19.94 and CRPS ≈ 9.997 2) Apply temperature scaling or quantile recalibration to improve PICP 3) Sweep dropout rates to assess tradeoff between MAE and uncertainty quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can recurrent architectures (e.g., Bayesian LSTMs) or multivariate BNNs capture inter-hour dependencies more effectively than the current hour-specific feedforward setup?

2. Can attention mechanisms or hybrid interpretability methods (e.g., SHAP) be integrated into the BNN framework to explain feature contributions without degrading predictive performance?

3. What calibration techniques are required to correct the severe undercoverage (PICP 0.11 vs. target 0.90) while maintaining the model's high sharpness?

## Limitations
- Severe undercoverage of prediction intervals (PICP = 0.11 vs. nominal 0.90) indicates miscalibration issues
- Hour-specific model design may miss critical inter-hour dependencies that could improve forecasts
- Missing implementation details (learning rate, batch size, early stopping) introduce reproducibility variability

## Confidence
- **High**: The 248-dimensional feature vector captures essential lagged temporal dependencies and exogenous market factors
- **Medium**: Monte Carlo dropout effectively approximates Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification
- **Medium**: Hour-specific models capture diurnal price patterns more effectively than unified architectures

## Next Checks
1. Perform calibration analysis by plotting predicted vs. empirical quantiles and assess recalibration methods to improve PICP without increasing MPIW significantly.

2. Implement a unified BNN model with inter-hour connections and compare performance against the hour-specific architecture to quantify the cost of ignoring cross-hour dependencies.

3. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying dropout rates to identify the optimal balance between predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration, documenting when variance estimates degrade.
