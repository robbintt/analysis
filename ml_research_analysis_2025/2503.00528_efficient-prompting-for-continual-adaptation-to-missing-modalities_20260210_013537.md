# Efficient Prompting for Continual Adaptation to Missing Modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00528
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00528
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Novel prompt-based approach achieves 71.87% accuracy on CMU-MOSI, 62.24% on IEMOCAP, and 71.11% on CH-SIMS with only 2-3% parameter overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of continual learning in multimodal environments where modalities may be missing during inference. The authors propose a prompt-based adaptation framework that learns modality-specific, task-aware, and task-specific prompts to capture intra-modality, inter-modality, intra-task, and inter-task features. The method introduces a contrastive task interaction strategy to explicitly learn correlations between different modalities across tasks. Evaluated on three multimodal datasets (CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP, and CH-SIMS), the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework introduces three types of prompts to address different aspects of multimodal continual learning. Modality-specific prompts capture intra-modality features, task-aware prompts handle inter-modality relationships within tasks, and task-specific prompts manage inter-task knowledge transfer. A contrastive task interaction strategy explicitly learns correlations between different modalities across tasks, helping to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The method is designed to be efficient, with the prompt parameters representing only 2-3% of the backbone network's parameters while maintaining strong performance across varying modality availability scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves 71.87% average accuracy on CMU-MOSI dataset
- Achieves 62.24% average accuracy on IEMOCAP dataset
- Achieves 71.11% average accuracy on CH-SIMS dataset
- Maintains minimal parameter overhead (2-3% of backbone parameters)
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all three datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly learning and maintaining separate prompt representations for different aspects of the multimodal learning problem. Modality-specific prompts allow the model to adapt to missing modalities by preserving modality-specific knowledge independently. Task-aware prompts capture the relationships between different modalities within each task, while task-specific prompts enable knowledge transfer across tasks. The contrastive task interaction strategy further strengthens these relationships by explicitly learning correlations between modalities, which helps prevent catastrophic forgetting when new tasks are introduced.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal fusion techniques**: Understanding how different modalities (text, audio, visual) can be effectively combined is crucial for this work
  - Why needed: The method relies on learning inter-modality relationships
  - Quick check: Review transformer-based multimodal fusion approaches

- **Continual learning and catastrophic forgetting**: Knowledge of how neural networks forget previously learned tasks is essential
  - Why needed: The method explicitly addresses catastrophic forgetting through its prompt architecture
  - Quick check: Study elastic weight consolidation and rehearsal-based methods

- **Prompt engineering in vision-language models**: Understanding how prompts can guide model behavior without fine-tuning entire networks
  - Why needed: The proposed method uses prompts as the primary adaptation mechanism
  - Quick check: Review prefix-tuning and prompt tuning literature

- **Contrastive learning**: Knowledge of contrastive objectives for learning representations
  - Why needed: The method uses contrastive task interaction to learn modality correlations
  - Quick check: Study contrastive multiview coding and related approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input Modalities -> Modality-Specific Prompts -> Task-Aware Prompts -> Task-Specific Prompts -> Contrastive Task Interaction -> Output

**Critical path**: The core adaptation pipeline flows through the three prompt types in sequence, with the contrastive task interaction providing additional regularization across tasks.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades off some representational capacity (by using separate prompts) for better modularity and reduced catastrophic forgetting. The 2-3% parameter overhead is a key constraint that limits the expressiveness of each prompt type.

**Failure signatures**: The method may struggle when task boundaries are unclear or when modality availability changes continuously rather than discretely. Performance could degrade if the contrastive task interaction cannot effectively capture modality correlations in complex scenarios.

**First experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing each prompt type individually to quantify their independent contributions
2. Scalability test with 10+ tasks and 5+ modalities to assess parameter overhead claims
3. Continuous modality disruption evaluation replacing discrete task boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three specific modalities (text, audio, visual), raising questions about generalization to other modality types
- Assumes known and static task boundaries, which may not reflect truly dynamic environments
- Parameter overhead claims (2-3%) don't account for computational overhead during inference or memory requirements for storing multiple prompt sets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core technical contributions and reported performance improvements are well-supported by the experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: Catastrophic forgetting mitigation claims are supported but not explicitly validated through task-recall experiments.

**Low Confidence**: Scalability claims to more complex scenarios remain largely untested and are extrapolations from the three-task setup.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study disabling each prompt type individually to quantify their independent contributions
2. Evaluate scalability with 10+ tasks and 5+ modalities to test parameter overhead claims
3. Replace discrete task boundaries with continuous modality disruption evaluation to assess real-world applicability
