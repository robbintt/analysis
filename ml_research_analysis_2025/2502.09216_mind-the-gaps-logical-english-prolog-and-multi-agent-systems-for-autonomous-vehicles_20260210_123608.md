# Mind the Gaps: Logical English, Prolog, and Multi-agent Systems for Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09216
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09216
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: A modular framework combining Logical English, Prolog, and NetLogo to model autonomous vehicle behavior with respect to traffic laws, enabling detection of legal violations and assessment of liability

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for modeling autonomous vehicle behavior in relation to traffic laws using a three-tier architecture. The system combines Logical English for human-readable rule encoding, Prolog for logical reasoning, and NetLogo for multi-agent simulation. The framework addresses the liability challenges that arise when autonomous vehicles interact with human drivers by ensuring both types of vehicles understand and apply the same legal rules. The implementation focuses on UK Highway Code rules related to junctions, demonstrating how vehicles can reason about legal constraints and how violations can be detected and evaluated in simulation.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a modular approach with three distinct components. Logical English provides a natural language format for encoding traffic rules that can be understood by both humans and machines. These rules are then translated into Prolog for logical reasoning and validation. The system includes monitors to detect potential violations during simulation and validators to determine whether violations are punishable or have mitigating circumstances. The implementation uses NetLogo for multi-agent simulation, allowing autonomous and human-driven vehicles to interact within a controlled environment. The framework was tested using junction-related scenarios from the UK Highway Code, demonstrating its ability to detect rule violations and assess their legal implications.

## Key Results
- Successfully implemented a modular framework combining Logical English, Prolog, and NetLogo for autonomous vehicle traffic law modeling
- Demonstrated detection of traffic violations in junction scenarios using monitors and validators
- Showed that both human and autonomous vehicles can understand and apply the same legal rules through the Logical English interface

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a shared language between legal experts and autonomous vehicle systems. Logical English serves as an intermediate representation that bridges natural language legal requirements and formal logical rules. This common language ensures consistency between how humans and machines interpret traffic laws. The Prolog layer provides computational reasoning capabilities, while NetLogo enables realistic multi-agent simulations where both autonomous and human vehicles interact under the same rule set. The monitor-validator architecture allows the system to detect potential violations and then assess their legal severity, mimicking real-world legal analysis.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Logical English**: A controlled natural language for encoding rules that humans and machines can understand. Needed to bridge the gap between legal language and formal logic. Quick check: Can a legal expert write rules directly in Logical English without programming experience?

2. **Prolog**: A logic programming language used for rule-based reasoning. Needed to implement the logical structure of traffic laws. Quick check: Does the Prolog implementation correctly handle all edge cases in the rule set?

3. **Multi-agent simulation**: Using NetLogo to simulate interactions between autonomous and human vehicles. Needed to test the framework in realistic scenarios. Quick check: Does the simulation accurately model real-world driving behaviors and interactions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Logical English -> Prolog -> NetLogo simulation -> Monitor/Validator

**Critical path**: Rule encoding (Logical English) → Translation (to Prolog) → Simulation (NetLogo) → Violation detection (Monitor) → Legal assessment (Validator)

**Design tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes human readability and legal accuracy over computational efficiency. Using Logical English adds a translation layer but ensures legal experts can directly contribute to rule encoding without programming knowledge.

**Failure signatures**: The system may fail when: rules are ambiguous or contradictory in Logical English; Prolog translation introduces logical errors; NetLogo simulation doesn't accurately model real-world behavior; monitors miss subtle violations; or validators misclassify legal circumstances.

**First experiments**:
1. Encode and simulate a simple rule like "give way to the right at unmarked junctions"
2. Test the system's response to a clear violation of this rule
3. Introduce a mitigating circumstance (like emergency vehicle priority) and verify the validator correctly classifies it

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework focuses on a limited subset of UK Highway Code rules, specifically junction-related scenarios, which may not generalize to broader traffic situations
- The simulation environment in NetLogo may not accurately capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving conditions
- The system's ability to handle ambiguous or conflicting legal rules is not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence
- Framework effectiveness: Medium
- Real-world applicability: Low
- Scalability to full traffic law complexity: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's performance with a more comprehensive set of traffic scenarios, including edge cases and ambiguous situations not covered by the initial junction-focused implementation
2. Conduct user studies with both legal experts and autonomous vehicle engineers to evaluate the effectiveness and clarity of the Logical English rule encoding system
3. Implement the framework in a more realistic simulation environment or conduct controlled real-world tests to assess its practical applicability and identify potential gaps in rule coverage or reasoning capabilities
