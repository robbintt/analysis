# Towards Explaining Monte-Carlo Tree Search by Using Its Enhancements

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.13223
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13223
- Reference count: 25
- One-line primary result: Knowledge-agnostic MCTS enhancements can provide additional data and higher-quality explanations for general game playing scenarios without requiring domain-specific knowledge.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enhancements to generate explanations for intelligent search decisions in general game playing contexts. The authors argue that while most Explainable AI research focuses on black-box models, there is a need for knowledge-agnostic explainability, particularly for systems like the Ludii General Game Playing System that must handle 1,400+ diverse games. They demonstrate that enhancements such as MAST, NST, GRAVE, score bounded MCTS, and PN-MCTS can provide structured metadata and higher-quality explanations without requiring domain-specific knowledge.

## Method Summary
The method involves integrating multiple MCTS enhancements into a single framework and using the resulting statistics to generate post-hoc explanations. The system extracts node data, sibling comparisons, and enhancement-specific metrics post-search, then applies rule-based selection to prioritize the most informative signals. Template-based natural language generation produces explanations combining "Why?" and "Why not?" arguments, displayed in the Ludii GUI. The approach remains knowledge-free while leveraging enhancement-specific insights to provide context about game positions and move choices.

## Key Results
- MCTS enhancements provide structured metadata that can be repurposed for human-interpretable explanations
- Score bounding enables categorical explanations (proven win/loss, forced moves) beyond probabilistic estimates
- Template-based generation produces coherent explanations combining standard MCTS statistics with enhancement-specific insights
- The framework works across 1,400+ games without requiring domain-specific knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** MCTS enhancements generate structured metadata during search that can be repurposed for human-interpretable explanations without requiring domain knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** Each enhancement maintains distinct statistics alongside standard MCTS node data. MAST tracks global move averages; GRAVE computes AMAF-based action values; Score bounded MCTS propagates pessimistic/optimistic bounds from terminal states. These statistics expose *why* a move was selected beyond raw visit counts—e.g., a move chosen despite lower win probability because its AMAF score was higher.
- **Core assumption:** Users can derive meaningful insight from comparative statistics (sibling comparisons, enhancement-specific metrics) even without domain expertise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "MCTS enhancements... can provide additional data and higher-quality explanations while remaining knowledge-free"
  - [Section III-C] Describes how each enhancement contributes unique explanatory data: MAST provides "contextless" move quality; GRAVE reveals selection bias; Score bounded identifies "forced moves when it clearly emerges with alternative moves leading to inevitable doom"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support—neighbor papers focus on XAI broadly, not MCTS-specific explainability
- **Break condition:** If enhancements are disabled or provide conflicting signals (e.g., MAST and GRAVE disagree strongly), explanation quality degrades; the rule-based templating may produce confusing or contradictory outputs.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Score bounding and proof-number methods enable categorical explanations (proven win/loss, forced moves) that standard MCTS statistics cannot provide.
- **Mechanism:** Score bounded MCTS backpropagates terminal bounds (pessimistic/optimistic) up the tree. When a node's bounds converge (e.g., both = 1.0), the position is solved. This allows the system to state "Selected move leads to a proven win in 2 turns" rather than probabilistic estimates. PN-MCTS quantifies proof workload imbalance, revealing asymmetric game situations.
- **Core assumption:** Solved subtrees exist within practical search depths; games terminate sufficiently often for bounds to propagate meaningfully.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-C] "Score bounded MCTS... allows us to explain trees and moves in terms of losing and winning positions... we can reliably mark a position with forced moves"
  - [Table I] Breakthrough example shows "solved node with score 1.0000 (win)" and explanation "leads to a proven win in 2 turns"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this specific mechanism
- **Break condition:** In games with rare terminal states within search horizon, score bounding provides little explanatory value; explanations revert to probabilistic language.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Template-based natural language generation combined with rule-based information selection produces coherent post-hoc explanations from heterogeneous enhancement data.
- **Mechanism:** The system extracts: (1) position-level statistics (move counts by advantage category), (2) selected node details (visits, scores, enhancement-specific metrics), (3) sibling comparisons (why-not arguments). Rules prioritize the most informative signals—e.g., highlighting when a move was chosen based on GRAVE despite lower win probability. Templates fill in natural language structures.
- **Core assumption:** A fixed set of templates and rules can cover the explanatory needs across 1,400+ Ludii games with diverse mechanics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV] "relies on a rule-based system to select the most important and informative pieces of information, and a simple template-based system to provide final text"
  - [Table I] Six concrete examples showing generated explanations: position assessment, move justification, alternative analysis
  - [corpus] Weak—neighbor papers discuss XAI methods generally, not template-based XS specifically
- **Break condition:** When multiple enhancements conflict or produce many subcases, "difficulty of obtaining consistent human-friendly descriptions increases"; templates may sound "repetitive, too technical."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Phases**
  - **Why needed here:** All enhancements operate within or across the four MCTS phases (selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation). Understanding where each enhancement injects data is essential for interpreting explanations.
  - **Quick check question:** In which phase does GRAVE update its AMAF statistics—selection, simulation, or both?

- **Concept: AMAF (All-Moves-As-First) Heuristic**
  - **Why needed here:** GRAVE/RAVE enhancements use AMAF to estimate move values from all occurrences in playouts, not just when selected. This underpins the "AMAF score overrode win probability" explanation pattern.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might AMAF provide different move rankings than standard MCTS visit-count averages?

- **Concept: Proof-Number Search and Score Bounding**
  - **Why needed here:** These transform probabilistic MCTS into a solver-like system, enabling categorical claims (proven win/loss) rather than soft probabilities.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between a node with score 0.95 and a node with pessimistic bound = optimistic bound = 1.0?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MCTS Core -> Enhancement Layer (MAST, NST, GRAVE, ScoreBounded, PN-MCTS) -> Statistics Aggregator -> Explanation Generator (Rule-based selector + Template-based NLG) -> Ludii Interface

- **Critical path:** Search iteration → Enhancement data accumulation → Node selection → Post-search statistics extraction → Rule prioritization → Template filling → GUI display. The explanation quality bottleneck is the *rule-based selector*—it must correctly identify which enhancement data is most informative for each game situation.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - More enhancements = richer data but harder template management (more subcases, potential conflicts)
  - Template-based NLG is simple but "repetitive, too technical"; LLM post-processing is proposed but adds latency and integration complexity
  - Knowledge-agnostic approach sacrifices domain-specific explanation quality for generality across 1,400+ games

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Explanations contradict each other (e.g., "move is best" and "move is significantly worse according to MAST")
  - All moves described as "balanced" with no differentiation (enhancements not providing signal)
  - Template outputs feel robotic or misaligned with game state (rule selector picking wrong signals)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Single-enhancement ablation:** Run MCTS with only Score bounded enabled on games with frequent early terminations (e.g., Breakthrough). Verify explanations correctly identify proven wins/losses.
  2. **GRAVE override detection:** Construct positions where standard UCT and GRAVE disagree on best move. Confirm explanation explicitly states the override reason.
  3. **Multi-enhancement stress test:** Enable MAST + NST + GRAVE + ScoreBounded on complex games (Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku). Identify template conflicts and measure explanation coherence via manual review.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can Large Language Models (LLMs) be effectively integrated as a post-processing step to improve the naturalness and verbosity management of template-based MCTS explanations?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state future work includes using LLMs to improve quality, noting that template-based explanations are "repetitive" and "too technical" (Section V).
  - **Why unresolved:** Initial attempts are promising but require further attention, and technical integration within the Ludii system remains a potential problem.
  - **Evidence:** A user study or automated evaluation comparing human ratings of template-based vs. LLM-processed explanations.

- **Open Question 2:** Do explanations generated from MCTS enhancements actually improve a human user's understanding of unknown problem domains compared to standard methods?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper assumes that highlighting properties and context helps users understand the problem domain (Section III-A), but only provides a proof-of-concept without empirical user evaluation (Section IV).
  - **Why unresolved:** The "Examples" section demonstrates feasibility, but does not validate if these explanations successfully teach game mechanics or strategy to human players.
  - **Evidence:** Experimental results showing statistically significant improvement in user performance or domain comprehension after interacting with the enhanced explanations.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the framework resolve conflicting signals when multiple enhancements (e.g., MAST vs. GRAVE) suggest different reasons for a move selection?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section IV notes that the "difficulty of obtaining consistent human-friendly descriptions increases with the number of involved enhancements," implying a lack of a defined conflict resolution strategy.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relies on a rule-based system, but the interaction effects between enhancements on explanation clarity remain unexplored.
  - **Evidence:** A robust algorithm for weighting or selecting enhancement-specific insights, validated by consistency metrics across complex game states.

## Limitations

- No quantitative evaluation of explanation quality or user studies to validate effectiveness
- Template-based explanation generation may produce repetitive, technical-sounding outputs
- Rule-based system may struggle with consistency when multiple enhancements provide conflicting signals

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism by which MCTS enhancements generate structured metadata (MAST, GRAVE, score bounds) that can be repurposed for explanations. This is directly implemented and demonstrated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that template-based rule selection can produce coherent explanations across all Ludii games. The paper acknowledges this may break down with complex enhancement interactions.
- **Low Confidence**: The overall quality and usefulness of the explanations for end users, as no user study or quantitative evaluation metric is provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative Explanation Quality Assessment**: Implement a scoring system that measures explanation informativeness (e.g., does it identify forced moves? does it explain win probability deviations?) and test across 100+ diverse Ludii games.

2. **Multi-Enhancement Conflict Resolution Test**: Create a benchmark suite where MAST, GRAVE, and Score bounded give conflicting recommendations. Evaluate whether the rule-based selector produces coherent or contradictory explanations.

3. **User Study Comparison**: Compare explanation quality between the template-based system and LLM-enhanced versions on tasks like move prediction accuracy and user trust, using human subjects unfamiliar with the games.
