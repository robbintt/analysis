# Contrastive Bi-Encoder Models for Multi-Label Skill Extraction: Enhancing ESCO Ontology Matching with BERT and Attention Mechanisms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.09119
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09119
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Zero-shot skill extraction framework for mapping Chinese job ads to ESCO ontology achieves F1@5 = 0.72

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a zero-shot skill extraction framework that maps unstructured Chinese job advertisements to the ESCO skill ontology without manual annotation. The method generates synthetic training data from ESCO skill definitions using a large language model, conditioned on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-skill contexts. A contrastive bi-encoder, combining BERT with BiLSTM and attention pooling, is trained to align job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space. An upstream RoBERTa-based filter removes non-skill sentences to improve precision. Experiments show that the hierarchy-conditioned generation improves fluency and discriminability compared to unconstrained pairing, and the full pipeline achieves strong zero-shot retrieval performance on real Chinese job advertisements (F1@5 = 0.72), outperforming TF-IDF and standard BERT baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework generates synthetic job-ad sentences conditioned on ESCO skill definitions using DeepSeek-V3 LLM, with multi-skill samples constrained to skills within the same Level-2 category. A RoBERTa-base binary classifier is fine-tuned on synthetic skill vs. non-skill sentences to filter input at inference. The contrastive bi-encoder uses a BERT-base-chinese backbone augmented with BiLSTM and attention pooling, trained with margin ranking loss to align sentences with skill embeddings in a 128-dimensional space. At inference, filtered sentences are embedded and matched against pre-computed ESCO skill embeddings using approximate nearest-neighbor search with threshold-based decision rules. The final posting-level skill set is the union of per-sentence predictions.

## Key Results
- Hierarchy-conditioned synthetic data (Level-2 constrained) achieves lowest perplexity (15.2±2.5) and strongest ROC separability vs. random and single-skill variants
- End-to-end pipeline achieves F1@5 = 0.72 on 500 manually annotated Chinese job ads
- BiLSTM+attention pooling improves MRR from 0.55 to 0.65 compared to [CLS]-only representations
- Upstream RoBERTa filter achieves Accuracy=0.875, Precision=0.882, Recall=0.866 on real sentence filtering task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hierarchy-conditioned synthetic data generation produces more semantically coherent and discriminative training instances than unconstrained multi-skill pairing.
- **Mechism:** The LLM generates synthetic job-ad sentences conditioned on ESCO skill definitions. Crucially, multi-skill samples are constrained to skill pairs within the same ESCO Level-2 category, which injects structural priors about realistic co-occurrence patterns into the synthetic distribution.
- **Core assumption:** The ESCO hierarchy reflects meaningful semantic relationships such that skills within the same Level-2 category are more likely to co-occur in real job requirements than arbitrary skill combinations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts"
  - [Section 6.1 / Table 1] Multi-Skill (Level-2) variant achieves lowest perplexity (15.2±2.5) vs. Random (22.1±4.0) and Single-Skill (18.5±3.5)
  - [Section 6.1 / Figure 1(b)] Level-2 variant yields strongest ROC curve in separability test against generic non-skill text
  - [corpus] Weak external validation; related papers on ESCO matching (IDs 9474, 40289) do not test hierarchy-conditioned generation specifically.
- **Break condition:** If ESCO Level-2 categories do not reflect domain-appropriate skill co-occurrence (e.g., cross-disciplinary roles requiring skills from disparate subtrees), the synthetic distribution may underrepresent realistic combinations, reducing transfer performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Augmenting a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling improves retrieval of relevant skills for long, compositional requirement statements compared to [CLS]-only representations.
- **Mechism:** Contextualized token embeddings from BERT are passed through a bidirectional LSTM to capture local sequential patterns, then aggregated via learned attention weights. This allows the model to assign higher mass to skill-bearing tokens distributed across the sentence rather than relying on a single token or position.
- **Core assumption:** Skill-relevant information in job-ad sentences is distributed across multiple tokens/segments, not concentrated at a specific position or capturable by [CLS] pooling alone.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements"
  - [Section 4.3.1 / Equations 2–6] Formal specification of BiLSTM + attention pooling + projection
  - [Section 6.4 / Table 4] "No BiLSTM/Attention" configuration achieves MRR 0.55 vs. 0.65 for selected configuration (margin=0.5, neg=8)
  - [Section 6.4 / Figure 4(c)] Attention visualization shows higher scores on skill-bearing terms (programming languages, task keywords)
  - [corpus] Attention pooling is standard in sentence embedding literature (Yang et al. 2016, cited in paper); no direct external validation for this specific ESCO task.
- **Break condition:** If job-ad sentences are typically short (e.g., <15 tokens) or skill cues are highly localized, the added complexity of BiLSTM+attention may yield diminishing returns relative to [CLS] pooling.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** An upstream binary filter trained on synthetic skill vs. non-skill sentences reduces downstream false positives and improves end-to-end precision.
- **Mechism:** A RoBERTa-base classifier is fine-tuned on synthetic positive samples (skill sentences from D_single/D_multi) and synthetic negative samples (D_none: company intro, benefits, compliance). At inference, sentences below a threshold τ are discarded before skill retrieval.
- **Core assumption:** The synthetic non-skill distribution (D_none) sufficiently covers the variety of non-requirement content in real job ads (e.g., salary, location, culture) to enable reliable filtering.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision"
  - [Section 6.2 / Table 2] Combined filter achieves Accuracy=0.875, F1=0.874, Precision=0.882, Recall=0.866 on 1,000 real Chinese sentences
  - [Section 6.2 / Figure 2(c)] Explicit D_none supervision reduces false positives vs. ablated version without negatives
  - [corpus] Related work on skill extraction (Zhang et al. 2022, Decorte et al. 2021, cited) does not systematically evaluate pre-filtering components.
- **Break condition:** If real job ads contain implicit skill expressions that LLM-generated "non-skill" samples inadvertently exclude (e.g., "must be comfortable with tight deadlines" implying soft skills), the filter may over-prune, reducing recall.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning with Margin-Based Loss**
  - **Why needed here:** The bi-encoder is trained to pull positive (sentence, skill) pairs together while pushing negative skill samples apart. Understanding how margin λ and negative count K affect the embedding space is critical for tuning.
  - **Quick check question:** Given margin λ=0.5, if sim(e_t, e_s+) = 0.7 and sim(e_t, e_s−) = 0.4, is there a non-zero loss for this triplet?

- **Concept: Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) as Retrieval**
  - **Why needed here:** With 13,890 ESCO skills, traditional multi-label classification is intractable. The paper reformulates XMLC as nearest-neighbor retrieval in embedding space, which requires understanding approximate nearest-neighbor search and threshold-based decision rules.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper pre-compute skill embeddings E_S ∈ R^{|S|×d} once and query at inference rather than computing skill representations dynamically?

- **Concept: Zero-Shot Transfer via Synthetic Supervision**
  - **Why needed here:** The model is trained exclusively on LLM-generated synthetic data and evaluated on real job ads. Understanding distribution shift and synthetic data quality (fluency, diversity, discriminability) is essential to diagnose transfer failures.
  - **Quick check question:** If synthetic sentences are "too clean" (low perplexity but unrealistic phrasing), what failure mode would you expect at inference on real job ads?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Synthetic Data Generator (DeepSeek-V3 LLM) → Produces D_single (single-skill), D_multi (Level-2 constrained multi-skill), D_none (non-skill negatives)
  2. Binary Sentence Filter (RoBERTa-base) → Trained on D_single ∪ D_multi vs. D_none; filters input sentences at inference
  3. Contrastive Bi-Encoder (BERT-base-chinese + BiLSTM + Attention + Projection) → Trained on synthetic pairs; produces 128-dim embeddings
  4. Retrieval Index (Pre-computed ESCO skill embeddings) → Approximate nearest-neighbor search + threshold γ
  5. Posting-Level Aggregator → Union of per-sentence skill predictions

- **Critical path:** LLM generation quality → Filter precision (τ) → Embedding alignment (margin λ, negatives K) → Retrieval threshold (γ) → Posting-level aggregation. Errors propagate: poor filter recall directly reduces end-to-end skill recall; loose retrieval threshold inflates false positives.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Margin λ: Higher values (e.g., 0.7) enforce stricter separation but can degrade performance if embedding space cannot satisfy constraints (Table 4: λ=0.8 → MRR 0.58 vs. λ=0.5 → MRR 0.65).
  - Negative count K: More negatives improve MRR but reduce throughput (N=8: 170 samples/s; N=10: 150 samples/s with similar MRR).
  - Filter threshold τ: High precision setting reduces false positives but may discard true skill sentences; paper prioritizes precision.
  - Retrieval threshold γ: Tuned on development split for F1@5; too high → false negatives dominate; too low → false positives dominate.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low synthetic-to-real transfer: Check perplexity of generated sentences; if unrealistically low, synthetic distribution may be too clean (Section 6.1).
  - High false negative rate at inference: Filter may be over-aggressive; inspect τ and D_none coverage.
  - "Misalignment" errors (related but incorrect skill): Embedding space may not discriminate semantically adjacent skills; consider hard negative mining or hierarchy-aware objectives (Section 6.5 / Figure 5c).
  - Dominant false positives: γ may be too low or filter precision insufficient; re-tune on held-out data.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Synthetic data quality sanity check: Generate 100 sentences for a held-out ESCO skill using both Level-2 constrained and random pairing strategies. Compute perplexity and manually inspect for fluency and semantic faithfulness. Compare to Table 1 baselines.
  2. Filter calibration: Train RoBERTa filter on D_single vs. D_none with 80/20 train/validation split. Sweep τ and plot precision-recall curve. Verify that τ achieving target precision does not drop recall below 0.80 on validation.
  3. Embedding space visualization: Train bi-encoder on synthetic data for 5 epochs. Compute t-SNE projection of 500 synthetic sentences and their ground-truth skill embeddings. Confirm that sentence-skill positive pairs cluster and that Level-2 categories show meaningful structure (cf. Figure 3c).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the zero-shot framework transfer across languages without manual ESCO translation, and what minimal synthetic data is required for a new language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work will address "multilingual transfer and cross-lingual alignment for non-English job markets."
- Why unresolved: The current approach manually translates ESCO definitions to Chinese; it is unclear whether cross-lingual encoders or machine translation preserve enough semantic fidelity for retrieval.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot transfer experiments using multilingual PLMs (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) with machine-translated or original ESCO definitions, reporting F1@K on non-Chinese job ads.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating the full ESCO hierarchy into the contrastive objective (e.g., graph-based regularization) improve retrieval over Level-2-only constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion calls for "hierarchy-aware learning objectives (e.g., graph-based regularization or taxonomy-consistent decoding) to better exploit ESCO structure."
- Why unresolved: Only Level-2 constraints are used for synthetic generation; deeper hierarchical structure remains unexploited despite potential for finer-grained semantic alignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments adding hierarchical regularization terms (e.g., parent-child embedding proximity) and measuring gains on granular Level-4 retrieval metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the choice of LLM for synthetic generation significantly affect downstream transfer, and is there a quality threshold below which synthetic supervision degrades performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies entirely on DeepSeek-V3 for synthetic data but does not compare LLM sources; synthetic data quality is critical to zero-shot transfer.
- Why unresolved: Different LLMs may produce different fluency/diversity trade-offs, and it is unknown whether weaker LLMs introduce harmful artifacts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of synthetic corpora from multiple LLMs (varying size/quality), measuring perplexity, diversity, and downstream F1@K on real job ads.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What architectural or objective modifications could reduce the false negative rate (currently the dominant error mode) without increasing false positives?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Error analysis identifies false negatives as "the most frequent failure mode," but no remedy is proposed or tested.
- Why unresolved: Reducing false negatives typically risks more false positives; the trade-off in this taxonomy-aligned retrieval setting remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with asymmetric margins, hard-negative mining strategies, or threshold calibration per ESCO category, reporting changes in FN/FP balance and F1@K.

## Limitations
- Transfer gap risk: Entire pipeline trained on synthetic data may not generalize to real job ads with domain-specific phrasing or implicit skill expressions
- Scalability constraints: Training bi-encoder on 13,890 ESCO skills requires significant compute; inference latency scales with skill count and sentences per posting
- Evaluation scope: Results based on 500 manually annotated job ads from single Chinese platform, limiting external validity across labor markets or languages

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Hierarchy-conditioned synthetic data generation improves fluency and discriminability (perplexity and ROC separability metrics are directly measurable and consistent across Table 1 and Figure 1b)
- **High confidence:** End-to-end zero-shot performance (F1@5 = 0.72) is state-of-the-art among non-fine-tuned methods for Chinese ESCO skill extraction, as validated on held-out data
- **Medium confidence:** BiLSTM + attention pooling provides meaningful improvement over [CLS]-only pooling (difference is statistically significant in Table 4, but ablation is limited to one configuration)
- **Medium confidence:** Upstream RoBERTa filter improves precision without catastrophic recall loss (accuracy and F1 metrics are strong, but recall impact on end-to-end skill coverage is not fully characterized)

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic-to-Real Transfer Gap Analysis:** Compare perplexity and fluency of synthetic sentences to real job ad sentences. If synthetic sentences are significantly "cleaner" or more formal, investigate whether this leads to systematic errors on colloquial or implicit skill expressions.
2. **Filter Recall Impact Study:** Perform ablation where the binary filter is removed. Measure the change in end-to-end F1@5 and identify whether precision gains come at an unacceptable recall cost for critical skill categories.
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Apply the trained model to job ads from a different Chinese platform or a different language (e.g., English ESCO skills). Report changes in F1@5 to assess robustness to domain and language shifts.
