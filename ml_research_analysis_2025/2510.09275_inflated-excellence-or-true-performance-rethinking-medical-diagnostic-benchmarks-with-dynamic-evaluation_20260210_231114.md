# Inflated Excellence or True Performance? Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09275
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09275
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DyReMe creates more challenging medical diagnostic questions with diagnostic distractors, reducing LLM accuracy by up to 10.75% compared to static benchmarks

## Executive Summary
Current medical diagnostic benchmarks suffer from overestimation and misalignment issues due to their static nature and lack of realistic clinical complexity. The DyReMe framework addresses these limitations by generating dynamic, consultation-like questions that incorporate differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. Through its DyGen component for question generation and EvalMed for comprehensive evaluation, DyReMe produces benchmarks that better reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. Experiments demonstrate that DyReMe significantly outperforms existing dynamic methods, generating more diverse and clinically challenging questions while providing a more accurate assessment of LLM diagnostic capabilities.

## Method Summary
DyReMe introduces a dynamic evaluation framework for medical diagnostics that generates realistic, consultation-like questions with diagnostic distractors. The framework consists of two main components: DyGen, which generates dynamic questions incorporating differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors, and EvalMed, which evaluates LLMs across four dimensions: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. The system creates questions with varied expression styles and includes common pitfalls that clinicians encounter in real practice. This approach addresses the limitations of static benchmarks by producing more challenging questions that better reflect the complexity of actual medical decision-making.

## Key Results
- DyReMe produces questions that reduce top model accuracy by up to 10.75% compared to static benchmarks
- The framework generates significantly greater diversity in expression styles and diagnosis coverage
- Human evaluation confirms high clinical alignment with AC1 agreement score of 0.6889
- Benchmarking 12 LLMs reveals substantial room for improvement in real-world diagnostic trustworthiness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DyReMe works by simulating the complexity and uncertainty inherent in real clinical consultations. Unlike static benchmarks that present idealized diagnostic scenarios, DyReMe generates questions that reflect the messy reality of medical practice, including ambiguous symptoms, multiple possible diagnoses, and common cognitive biases that lead to misdiagnosis. The DyGen component specifically integrates differential diagnosis thinking into question generation, forcing models to consider multiple possibilities rather than jumping to conclusions. This dynamic approach better captures the iterative nature of clinical reasoning and the importance of considering alternative explanations.

## Foundational Learning
1. Differential Diagnosis Framework: Essential for understanding how clinicians systematically consider multiple possible conditions; quick check involves verifying whether the system can generate questions that require weighing competing diagnoses.
2. Diagnostic Error Patterns: Knowledge of common misdiagnosis factors helps create more realistic distractors; quick check ensures distractors reflect actual clinical pitfalls rather than arbitrary wrong answers.
3. Clinical Question Variation: Understanding how symptoms and conditions are expressed differently in practice; quick check verifies the system can generate equivalent questions with varied terminology and presentation.
4. Multi-dimensional LLM Evaluation: Beyond accuracy, assessing veracity, helpfulness, and consistency provides a more complete picture of model performance; quick check involves validating that all four dimensions capture meaningful aspects of clinical utility.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Input -> DyGen (Question Generation) -> EvalMed (Evaluation) -> LLM Assessment

**Critical Path:** The question generation pipeline (DyGen) is the critical path, as the quality and realism of generated questions directly determine the benchmark's effectiveness and the validity of subsequent LLM evaluations.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for question quality and realism. Generating dynamic, consultation-like questions with appropriate distractors requires significant processing compared to static question templates, but this investment yields more diagnostically meaningful benchmarks.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor-quality distractors that are obviously wrong or too similar to correct answers, questions that don't reflect realistic clinical scenarios, or evaluation dimensions that don't capture clinically relevant aspects of model performance.

**First Experiments:** 1) Generate test questions across multiple specialties and verify diagnostic distractor quality through expert review. 2) Compare DyReMe question difficulty against existing static benchmarks using baseline models. 3) Evaluate LLM responses across all four dimensions to identify performance patterns and weaknesses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human evaluation agreement score (AC1 = 0.6889) indicates only moderate inter-rater reliability
- Evaluation framework doesn't explicitly address temporal aspects of clinical decision-making
- Claims about real-world diagnostic trustworthiness improvements lack long-term validation data

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The methodology for generating dynamic questions with diagnostic distractors is technically sound and well-implemented. Empirical results showing improved benchmark difficulty and diversity are supported by concrete metrics and comparative analysis.

**Medium Confidence:** Clinical relevance and practical utility claims depend heavily on human evaluations showing only moderate agreement. Generalizability to other medical specialties beyond those tested remains uncertain.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about real-world diagnostic trustworthiness improvements lack long-term validation data and may overstate practical impact without clinical deployment studies.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability assessment with larger, more diverse clinical expert panels to strengthen human evaluation component validity.
2. Implement longitudinal testing to evaluate whether DyReMe-identified weaknesses in LLMs persist or improve over time with model updates.
3. Perform systematic error analysis on LLM responses to identify common failure patterns and their clinical implications.
