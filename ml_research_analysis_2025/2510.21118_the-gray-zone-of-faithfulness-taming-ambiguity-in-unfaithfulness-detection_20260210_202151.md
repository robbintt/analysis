# The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.21118
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Introduces VeriGray benchmark with novel Out-Dependent and Ambiguous categories to address annotation ambiguity in LLM faithfulness detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in faithfulness detection for large language model-generated summaries: the inherent ambiguity in determining whether external knowledge use constitutes a hallucination. The authors propose a novel annotation framework that introduces two intermediate categories—Out-Dependent and Ambiguous—to capture the "gray zone" between clearly faithful and clearly unfaithful statements. Using this framework, they construct VeriGray, a new benchmark containing 2,044 annotated sentences from 84 summaries. The study reveals that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-5 generate hallucinations in approximately 6% of sentences, with an additional 9% requiring external knowledge verification. The research demonstrates that current detection methods struggle particularly with these ambiguous cases, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in faithfulness detection systems.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a three-stage annotation framework to construct the VeriGray benchmark. First, they generated 84 summaries from CNN/Daily Mail articles using various prompting strategies with GPT-5. Second, two annotators independently labeled each sentence as Faithful, Unfaithful, Out-Dependent, or Ambiguous. Third, they conducted adjudication sessions to resolve conflicts, achieving 95.1% agreement. The framework explicitly captures sentences requiring external knowledge (Out-Dependent) and those with multiple valid interpretations (Ambiguous). For detection experiments, they evaluated five methods: GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5 + RAG, Llama-3.1-70B, and Llama-3.1-70B + RAG, comparing them against multiple reference models. The detection pipeline involved both binary classification (faithful vs unfaithful) and fine-grained classification across all four categories, with ROUGE-based ranking loss as an additional evaluation metric.

## Key Results
- GPT-5 generates hallucinations in approximately 6% of generated summary sentences, with an additional 9% falling into the Out-Dependent category
- The best-performing method, GPT-5 with RAG, achieves 83.6% balanced accuracy, 73.5% hallucination F1, and 31.9% ranking loss
- Current detection methods struggle significantly with Out-Dependent and Ambiguous cases, with GPT-5 achieving only 61.9% balanced accuracy on Out-Dependent sentences
- GPT-5 + RAG shows improved precision for Out-Dependent detection, suggesting that access to retrieved external knowledge helps identify when additional verification is needed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly acknowledging that faithfulness detection exists on a spectrum rather than as a binary classification. By introducing Out-Dependent and Ambiguous categories, the system captures the reality that some statements are technically faithful (entailed by source + external knowledge) while others are genuinely ambiguous. This reduces annotation conflicts and provides more nuanced feedback to detection models. The RAG-enhanced detection method works by providing external knowledge context to the evaluator, allowing it to distinguish between statements that genuinely require external verification versus those that don't.

## Foundational Learning
- **Annotation ambiguity in faithfulness detection**: Why needed - Current benchmarks treat faithfulness as binary, leading to inconsistent annotations; Quick check - Review VeriGray annotation guidelines and conflict resolution process
- **Out-Dependent category**: Why needed - Captures statements requiring external knowledge for verification; Quick check - Examine examples classified as Out-Dependent vs Faithful
- **Ambiguous category**: Why needed - Handles cases with multiple valid interpretations; Quick check - Analyze adjudication decisions for Ambiguous cases
- **RAG-enhanced detection**: Why needed - Provides external context to help identify Out-Dependent statements; Quick check - Compare detection performance with and without RAG access
- **Multi-level evaluation metrics**: Why needed - Binary classification alone insufficient for nuanced faithfulness detection; Quick check - Review balanced accuracy and ranking loss calculations
- **LLM-as-a-judge paradigm**: Why needed - Standard approach for faithfulness evaluation; Quick check - Compare GPT-5 performance to other evaluation methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Human annotators -> Annotation framework (Faithful/Unfaithful/Out-Dependent/Ambiguous) -> VeriGray benchmark -> Detection methods (GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5+RAG, Llama-3.1-70B, Llama-3.1-70B+RAG) -> Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, ranking loss)

**Critical Path:**
CNN/Daily Mail articles → GPT-5 summary generation → Sentence-level annotation → Conflict resolution → Benchmark construction → Detection model evaluation → Performance analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The choice to focus solely on summarization limits generalizability but allows deeper exploration of faithfulness challenges. Using GPT-5 for both generation and evaluation may introduce model-specific biases but provides consistency. The four-category framework increases annotation complexity but reduces conflicts compared to binary classification.

**Failure Signatures:**
Detection models show poor performance on Out-Dependent and Ambiguous cases, with balanced accuracy dropping below 65% for these categories. Binary classification approaches often misclassify Out-Dependent sentences as unfaithful or faithful. RAG-enhanced methods improve precision but may not resolve all verification challenges.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Replicate the annotation framework with different annotator pools to verify category stability
2. Test detection performance on out-of-domain datasets (e.g., scientific papers, legal documents)
3. Compare RAG retrieval strategies (different knowledge sources, retrieval algorithms) for detection enhancement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the VeriGray annotation framework be successfully adapted to other knowledge-grounded generation tasks beyond summarization, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and data-to-text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states, "One direction of future work of our paper could be building benchmarks with diverse knowledge-grounded tasks, such as RAG and data-to-text."
- Why unresolved: The current study restricted data collection to summarization due to the constraints of human labor, leaving the framework's applicability to other generation tasks unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new benchmark dataset for RAG or data-to-text tasks annotated using the Out-Dependent and Ambiguous taxonomy, demonstrating consistent annotation agreement.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can detection methods effectively identify when an LLM leverages external world knowledge from its parametric memory rather than the source document?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section identifies the need to "develop methods that can identify when an LLM leverages external world knowledge from its parametric memory, which would enhance the detection of Out-Dependent examples."
- Why unresolved: Current detectors struggle to distinguish Out-Dependent sentences (entailed by document + external knowledge) from faithful ones because they lack mechanisms to verify the specific knowledge source used by the model.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detection model that can accurately trace the provenance of an inference to parametric memory versus the source context, improving recall on the Out-Dependent class.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does providing explicit access to retrieved external knowledge consistently improve the detection of Out-Dependent instances across different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While GPT-5 + RAG showed improved precision for Out-Dependent cases, the paper concludes there is a need for "developing detection methods that are augmented with external knowledge sources."
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to specific LLMs (GPT-5), and it remains unclear if RAG is the optimal or universal solution for resolving the "gray zone" of verification across smaller or different model types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of various detector architectures (both LLM-based and fine-tuned) employing RAG, showing a statistically significant reduction in misclassification errors for the Out-Dependent category.

## Limitations
- The dataset size (2,044 annotated sentences) may be insufficient for capturing the full spectrum of hallucination types across diverse domains
- The focus on summarization tasks limits applicability to other generation tasks like translation or dialogue systems
- The evaluation relies heavily on GPT-5 as both the generator and evaluator, raising concerns about potential model-specific biases
- The subjective nature of the "Ambiguous" category classification may vary across annotators despite the proposed framework

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The existence of annotation ambiguity in faithfulness detection and the basic effectiveness of the proposed intermediate categories (Out-Dependent and Ambiguous)
- **Medium confidence**: The specific performance metrics of detection methods on VeriGray benchmark
- **Medium confidence**: The 6% hallucination rate in GPT-5 generated summaries

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies across multiple independent annotator groups to validate the stability of Out-Dependent and Ambiguous category assignments
2. Test detection performance on out-of-domain datasets and non-summarization tasks to assess generalizability
3. Implement cross-model evaluation using multiple LLM families (not just GPT-5) to verify that benchmark results aren't model-specific artifacts
