# Do Visual Imaginations Improve Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.16394
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16394
- **Authors:** Akhil Perincherry; Jacob Krantz; Stefan Lee
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary Result:** Sequential visual imaginations of sub-goals improve VLN agent performance by ~1.0 SR and ~0.5 SPL over baselines.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether visual representations of sub-goals (imaginations) from natural language instructions can improve vision-and-language navigation (VLN) performance. The authors generate synthetic images for landmark noun phrases in instructions using a text-to-image diffusion model, and integrate these into VLN agents as an additional modality alongside language instructions. An auxiliary loss aligns imagination embeddings with corresponding noun phrase embeddings to encourage grounding. Applied to HAMT and DUET models on R2R and REVERIE datasets, the approach yields success rate (SR) improvements of around 1 point and 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL), suggesting that explicit visual depictions reinforce visual understanding compared to relying on language alone. The method is model-agnostic, and ablative analysis shows sequential imagination outperforms goal-only imagination, with visual representations proving more effective than textual ones. Results indicate imaginations can serve as useful pivots between language and observations, aiding navigation decisions.

## Method Summary
The method augments VLN agents by generating visual imaginations of landmarks from instructions using SDXL text-to-image diffusion model. Instructions are segmented into sub-instructions, and noun phrases are extracted and filtered to remove non-visual terms. For each sub-instruction, an image is generated conditioned on the noun phrase with specific positive and negative prompts. These images are encoded using a frozen ViT-B/16 and projected through a 3-layer MLP. The resulting imagination embeddings are concatenated with instruction embeddings and fed into the base VLN agent's cross-modal encoder. An auxiliary cosine similarity loss aligns imagination embeddings with noun phrase embeddings. The model is trained in three stages: initially freezing base weights, then joint training with reduced learning rates, and finally full joint training. This approach is applied to HAMT and DUET models on R2R and REVERIE datasets.

## Key Results
- Sequential visual imaginations improve HAMT SR by ~1.0 and SPL by ~0.5 on R2R val-unseen.
- Sequential imaginations outperform goal-only imaginations by 0.5 SR.
- Visual imaginations are more effective than textual imaginations (CLIP embeddings) for grounding.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual imaginations serve as a learnable pivot between language and environment observations, simplifying grounding.
- Mechanism: The system uses a text-to-image diffusion model (SDXL) to generate explicit visual representations ("imaginations") of landmarks described in instructions (e.g., "pool table," "kitchen"). These generated images are fed into the VLN agent as an additional modality. Instead of implicitly learning to map text to vision, the agent performs an image-to-image matching task between the synthesized imagination and its real-world observation.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Image-to-image semantic matching is an easier or more robust task for neural networks than direct text-to-image grounding, especially for out-of-distribution concepts. The paper posits that the broad knowledge in text-to-image models can produce useful visual cues for concepts not well-supported in the VLN training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...matching a visual imagination with environment observations reduces to an image-to-image matching task – offering the potential to use visual imaginations as a convenient pivot between language and vision."
  - [section: 1. Introduction] "learning to perform semantic matching in the image domain may be an easier task than language grounding."
  - [corpus] Related work like Pathdreamer and PanoGen also use generation but for predicting future observations or data augmentation, not as a direct input modality for grounding.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if the text-to-image model generates misleading or poor-quality images that do not match the instruction's semantics, thereby injecting noise into the agent's decision process.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An auxiliary loss explicitly aligns imagination embeddings with language, reinforcing grounding during training.
- Mechanism: A cosine similarity loss (`L_cos`) is added between the embedding of a generated imagination and the mean embedding of its corresponding noun phrase from the instruction. This provides a direct supervisory signal to the model, forcing the "imagination encoder" to produce features that are semantically linked to the text. This acts as a form of regularization, preventing the cross-modal components from forgetting grounding capabilities learned during pretraining.
- Core assumption: The frozen text and vision encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) provide semantically meaningful embeddings where cosine similarity is an effective proxy for alignment. The assumption is that this explicit alignment signal is more effective for grounding than the downstream VLN task loss alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "An auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions."
  - [section: 4.2 Results] Table 6 shows that adding the alignment loss (`L_cos`) improves Success Rate (SR) by 0.5 points over not having an auxiliary loss.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; this is a specific methodological contribution of the paper.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if noun phrases are extracted incorrectly, creating misaligned image-text pairs that provide a corrupt training signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sequential imaginations of sub-goals are more effective than imagining only the final goal.
- Mechanism: The method generates imaginations for a sequence of sub-instructions (e.g., "take a left at the pool table" AND "stop at the bedroom"), not just the final destination. These sequential embeddings are concatenated and fed into the agent. This provides the agent with a series of visual "waypoints" along the path, aiding in intermediate decision-making rather than just identifying the final location.
- Core assumption: Navigation instructions can be reliably segmented into sequential steps, and the agent's performance benefits from visual cues for these intermediate landmarks, not just the final goal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Ablative analysis shows sequential imagination outperforms goal-only imagination..."
  - [section: 4.2 Results] "while goal imagination outperforms the baseline by 0.5 SR, sequential imagination outperforms the baseline by 1.0 SR."
  - [corpus] N/A
- Break condition: This mechanism would be less effective if sub-instructions are not temporally ordered or if the instruction is purely high-level with no intermediate visual landmarks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core task. The entire goal is to improve agents that navigate 3D environments using language instructions.
  - Quick check question: At a single time step, what are the standard inputs and outputs for a VLN agent?
- **Cross-Modal Transformer Encoders**
  - Why needed here: The proposed method integrates imaginations by concatenating them with text embeddings before feeding them into a cross-modal encoder. Understanding how these models fuse different data types is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does a cross-modal attention mechanism allow a model to relate a specific text token to a specific region in an image?
- **Text-to-Image Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed here: The "imaginations" are generated using a diffusion model (SDXL). Understanding its capabilities and how it can be conditioned on text is fundamental to the approach.
  - Quick check question: What does a text-to-image diffusion model take as input, and what does it produce?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:**
  1. Instruction Segmenter: Splits instructions into sub-instructions.
  2. Image Generator: Uses SDXL to generate imaginations for each sub-instruction's noun phrases.
  3. Imagination Encoder: A ViT + MLP that encodes generated images into embeddings.
  4. Integrator: Concatenates imagination embeddings with text embeddings.
  5. VLN Agent (HAMT/DUET): The base agent, whose cross-modal encoder now receives the combined embedding.
  6. Loss Function: `Total Loss = L_base + 0.5 * L_cos`. The `L_cos` aligns imagination and text embeddings.

- **Critical path:** The most critical path is the data generation pipeline. If the instruction segmentation is poor or the text-to-image model generates irrelevant images (e.g., outdoor scenes for indoor instructions), the entire mechanism fails. The next critical step is ensuring the imagination embeddings are correctly concatenated to the text embeddings in the dimension expected by the cross-modal transformer.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Off-the-shelf ViT vs. Fine-tuned ViT: The paper uses a frozen, off-the-shelf ViT for simplicity and to avoid overfitting, which proved sufficient.
  - Early vs. Late Fusion: Concatenating imaginations with text (early fusion) before the cross-modal encoder outperformed late fusion strategies.
  - Sequential vs. Goal Imagination: Generating images for all sub-instructions is more costly but yields better results than only generating for the final goal.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance degrades vs. baseline: Indicates imaginations are likely noisy or misaligned, confusing the agent.
  - Strong val-seen, poor val-unseen: Suggests overfitting to the specific imaginations generated for the training environments.
  - Null imaginations (at test time) outperform wrong imaginations: Confirms that semantic alignment is crucial; random images are detrimental.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Overfit the model on a single instruction-trajectory pair to verify the entire pipeline is working and the loss can converge.
  2. Ablation - Goal vs. Sequential: Generate imaginations for only the final sub-instruction vs. all sub-instructions. Compare their performance to validate the paper's key claim that sequential is better.
  3. Ablation - Auxiliary Loss: Train with `lambda=0` (no auxiliary loss) and `lambda=0.5` to confirm the benefit of the explicit alignment loss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**
  - **Question:** What is the exact complementary nature of the roles played by visual imaginations versus language instructions in navigation?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state, "A natural question that arises from our research is the exact complementary nature of the roles played by visual imaginations and language instructions."
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates that imaginations improve performance, the specific functional division or interaction between the generated image modality and the text modality remains unclear.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Detailed ablation studies and attention analyses isolating specific linguistic constructs to see which are handled by text vs. imagination features.

- **Open Question 2**
  - **Question:** Can visual imaginations effectively bridge the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap for VLN agents?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In the "Future directions" section, the authors propose "how imagination can help bridge the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap" as an interesting extension.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study is confined to simulated environments (Matterport3D) and does not test the method's robustness against the visual noise and domain shift found in physical real-world deployments.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments deploying imagination-augmented agents on physical robots or datasets with significant domain shifts, comparing degradation rates against baseline models.

- **Open Question 3**
  - **Question:** Can imaginations unlock the performance of VLN world models through image-image reasoning?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors ask "whether imaginations can unlock the performance of VLN world models through image-image reasoning" in the conclusion.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current work focuses on using imaginations as static input features for policy networks rather than integrating them into dynamic predictive architectures (world models) for planning.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Integrating imaginations into model-based reinforcement learning frameworks to see if they improve the prediction of future states or environmental dynamics.

## Limitations
- The core contribution relies heavily on the quality of the text-to-image model (SDXL) to generate meaningful visual imaginations. If SDXL's outputs degrade in future versions or fail to capture the semantic nuance of certain landmark descriptions, the proposed approach's effectiveness could diminish.
- The manual blacklist for filtering noun phrases is a potential source of bias or error, as the complete list is not provided.
- The reported improvements are modest (~1 point SR, ~0.5 points SPL), raising questions about the practical significance of the gains relative to the added complexity and computational cost of generating imaginations.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The claim that sequential imagination outperforms goal-only imagination, and that adding an auxiliary alignment loss improves performance.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that visual imaginations are more effective than textual imaginations.
- **Medium Confidence:** The overall claim that the method provides a general improvement.

## Next Checks
1. **Verify Data Pipeline Integrity:** Conduct a sanity check by over-fitting the model on a single instruction-trajectory pair. Confirm that the instruction segmentation, image generation, embedding projection, and loss computation are all functioning correctly before scaling to full training.
2. **Ablation on Imagination Modality:** Systematically compare the performance of the full visual imagination model against a version that uses only textual representations of the sub-instructions (e.g., CLIP embeddings). This directly tests the paper's claim about the superiority of visual imaginations.
3. **Test on Out-of-Distribution Data:** Evaluate the trained model on a held-out set of instructions from a different environment or dataset (if available) to assess whether the model has overfit to the specific imaginations generated for the R2R training environments. This would validate the claim about the robustness of the approach.
