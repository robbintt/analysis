# Center-Outward q-Dominance: A Sample-Computable Proxy for Strong Stochastic Dominance in Multi-Objective Optimisation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12545
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12545
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces center-outward q-dominance, a sample-computable proxy for strong first-order stochastic dominance in multi-objective optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of comparing stochastic distributions in multi-objective optimization by introducing center-outward q-dominance. The method leverages optimal transport theory to map distributions to a common uniform reference on the unit ball, enabling globally coherent comparisons with only one transport map per distribution. The authors establish theoretical guarantees showing that q-dominance over all quantiles implies strong first-order stochastic dominance, and provide a sample size threshold to control Type I error.

Empirically, the approach demonstrates superior performance in noise-augmented benchmark problems compared to traditional mean-value and single-sample selection methods. The method enables stable rankings when conventional metrics fail and achieves faster convergence, making it a promising tool for multi-objective optimization in stochastic environments.

## Method Summary
Center-outward q-dominance employs optimal transport theory to create a sample-computable proxy for strong first-order stochastic dominance. The method maps each distribution to a common uniform reference distribution on the unit ball, requiring only one transport map per distribution. By comparing distributions through their quantile functions on this common reference space, the approach enables globally coherent comparisons. The theoretical foundation proves that q-dominance across all quantiles implies strong FSD, and the authors provide an explicit sample size threshold to control Type I error rates in finite-sample conditions.

## Key Results
- Q-dominance over all quantiles implies strong first-order stochastic dominance
- Only one transport map per distribution required using a common uniform reference
- Sample size threshold provided to control Type I error
- Stable rankings achieved when traditional metrics fail in noise-augmented benchmarks
- Faster convergence compared to mean-value and single-sample selection methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by transforming the comparison problem into a common geometric space where distributions can be directly compared through their quantile functions. By using center-outward transport to map each distribution to a uniform reference on the unit ball, the approach creates a globally coherent framework that preserves the dominance relationships. The quantile-based comparison ensures that the dominance check is comprehensive across the entire distribution, not just at specific points.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal transport theory: Why needed - provides mathematical foundation for mapping distributions to common reference space; Quick check - verify transport maps preserve distribution properties
- Strong first-order stochastic dominance: Why needed - defines the target comparison relationship; Quick check - confirm q-dominance implies FSD in all tested cases
- Quantile functions: Why needed - enable comprehensive distribution comparison across all probability levels; Quick check - validate quantile-based comparisons match full distribution properties
- Center-outward mapping: Why needed - creates symmetric reference space for comparison; Quick check - verify uniformity of mapped distributions
- Type I error control: Why needed - ensures statistical validity of dominance decisions; Quick check - test error rates at proposed sample size thresholds
- Multi-objective optimization: Why needed - defines the application context and success metrics; Quick check - measure convergence rates and solution quality

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Distribution → Center-outward transport → Uniform reference on unit ball → Quantile comparison → Dominance decision

Critical path: The transport mapping and quantile comparison stages are most critical, as errors in either will propagate to incorrect dominance decisions.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity of optimal transport for more reliable dominance detection. Using a common reference simplifies comparison but requires careful handling of boundary conditions on the unit ball.

Failure signatures: Incorrect dominance decisions occur when transport maps are poorly estimated (insufficient samples) or when distributions have very similar quantiles. The method may be sensitive to the choice of reference distribution and transport algorithm parameters.

First experiments:
1. Test dominance detection on synthetic distributions with known FSD relationships
2. Compare q-dominance rankings against ground truth on benchmark multi-objective problems
3. Evaluate convergence rates with varying noise levels and sample sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees may not fully hold under finite-sample conditions
- Computational efficiency gains compared to existing methods require broader empirical validation
- Performance may not generalize universally across all problem domains
- Sensitivity to quantile level selection and transport map parameters needs investigation

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Theoretical guarantees of q-dominance | High |
| Only one transport map per distribution required | Medium |
| Computational efficiency gains | Medium |
| Empirical results showing stable rankings | Medium |
| Faster convergence in noise-augmented benchmarks | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive experiments on a wider range of benchmark problems, including those with varying noise levels and objective dimensions, to assess the robustness of q-dominance.

2. Perform a comparative analysis with other ranking methods, such as Pareto dominance and Bayesian optimization techniques, to evaluate the relative performance and computational efficiency.

3. Investigate the sensitivity of q-dominance to the choice of quantile levels and transport map parameters, and establish guidelines for their selection in practice.
