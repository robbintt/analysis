# Probably Approximately Global Robustness Certification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06495
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06495
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sampling-based method provides high-probability lower bounds on global robustness independent of input dimensionality and network size

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for certifying probabilistic global robustness guarantees for neural network classifiers. The method uses ε-nets in a 2D "quality space" defined by robustness and confidence values to provide sample-size independent bounds on the probability that inputs will be non-robust below certain thresholds. Experiments demonstrate effective scaling to large networks (up to 10M parameters) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with guarantees holding in 211 out of 230 test cases. The approach is oracle-agnostic, working with both adversarial attacks (PGD) and formal verification methods (LiRPA).

## Method Summary
The approach constructs an ε-net over a 2D quality space mapping classifier outputs to (robustness, confidence) pairs. For a sample size determined by VC-dimension theory, if no counterexamples appear in the sample for a given robustness-confidence pair, the method certifies that the probability of encountering such counterexamples in the true distribution is below ε. The method queries a local robustness oracle for each sample point and builds a mapping from confidence to minimum robustness guarantees. This framework is independent of both the input dimensionality and the specific robustness verification algorithm used.

## Key Results
- Sample size required is independent of input dimensionality, number of classes, and learning algorithm
- Guarantees transfer to unseen test data with 211 out of 230 experiments showing no violations
- Method effectively scales to large networks (up to 10M parameters) on CIFAR-10
- Works with both adversarial (PGD) and formal (LiRPA) robustness oracles
- Qualitatively distinguishes between normally and adversarially trained networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dimensionality Decoupling via Quality Space
The method decouples certification complexity from input dimensionality by mapping inputs to a 2D "quality space" defined by (Robustness, Confidence). Since the VC dimension of axis-aligned rectangles in ℝ² is d=2, the sample size required for an ε-net depends only on ε and δ, not the size of the neural network or input image. This assumes the mapping captures sufficient information to determine global robustness properties.

### Mechanism 2: Probabilistic Coverage via ε-Nets
A finite sample can provide high-probability guarantees on the non-existence of "bad" regions through ε-net coverage. If an iid sample forms an ε-net and contains no counterexamples for a specific (ρ, κ) pair, the probability of encountering one in the wild is < ε. This relies on the samples being drawn iid from the data distribution.

### Mechanism 3: Oracle Agnosticism and Mapping Construction
The framework operates independently of the specific algorithm used to check local robustness by treating the oracle as a black-box function. It queries this oracle for every point in the sample and constructs a mapping M(κ) which serves as a lower bound for robustness at a given confidence. This allows swapping fast, approximate oracles for slow, exact ones without changing certification logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: ε-Nets and VC Dimension** - Why needed: This is the theoretical engine of the paper, determining how many samples are needed to "cover" a space probabilistically. Quick check: If the "quality space" were 3-dimensional instead of 2, how would the required sample size s change theoretically?

- **Concept: Local Robustness Oracles** - Why needed: The system is modular and requires understanding the difference between verification (exact, slow) and adversarial attacks (heuristic, fast). Quick check: Does the PGD oracle provide an upper or lower bound on the true robustness radius, and how does that affect the resulting global guarantee?

- **Concept: Conditional Probability Bounds** - Why needed: The paper certifies Pr(robustness < ρ | confidence ≥ κ), requiring understanding how to separate the numerator (joint probability via ε-nets) and denominator (quantile estimation). Quick check: Why does the guarantee degrade if the confidence threshold κ is set so high that almost no data points in the sample exceed it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sampler -> Oracle Wrapper -> Quality Projector -> Certifier
- **Critical path:** The runtime is dominated by the Oracle Wrapper, with the number of oracle calls equaling the sample size |N|. As shown in Equation (8), |N| is determined by ε and δ, not network size, but the cost per call scales with network size.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Strictness (ε) vs. Compute: Reducing ε drastically increases sample size and oracle queries. Oracle Choice: LiRPA yields tighter, provable bounds but is computationally expensive; PGD is faster but may provide looser bounds.
- **Failure signatures:** Violation of Guarantee occurs when test data falls below the certified curve M(κ), attributed to imperfect sampling rather than theory failure. Undefined Mapping occurs for confidence values κ > κ_max when the sample is too small to estimate that quantile reliably.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check (MNIST + PGD): Replicate the "FeedForward" experiment using the PGD oracle. 2) Oracle Comparison (LiRPA vs. PGD): Run certification on the same network using both oracles and compare bounds and runtime. 3) Stress Test (CIFAR-10 + VGG): Scale to VGG11 BN model (approx 10M params) and observe sample size independence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does incorporating the predicted class as an additional conditioning variable affect sample complexity and tightness of robustness lower bounds? The current method maps confidence to robustness in 2D; adding class would likely require partitioning space or increasing range space complexity.

- **Open Question 2:** Can generative data augmentation serve as a more effective sampling procedure than Gaussian noise to reduce the gap between validation and test distributions? The experiments rely on Gaussian noise perturbations, leading to theoretical relaxations via Theorem 4.6 and occasional empirical violations.

- **Open Question 3:** Can the PAG certification framework be adapted to verify global properties other than robustness, such as fairness or monotonicity? The theory relies on a quality space defined by robustness and confidence; it's unclear if other properties admit a low-dimensional range space with low VC dimension.

## Limitations

- Relies on a 2D quality space mapping that assumes confidence and robustness values sufficiently characterize classifier behavior
- Computational cost per oracle call scales with network size, creating practical limitations despite sample size independence
- Method requires validation data with added noise to approximate true data distribution, with violations attributed to this approximation quality

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Theoretical framework based on VC-dimension and ε-nets is well-established with sound mathematical proofs
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are convincing but limited to relatively small datasets
- **Low Confidence:** Claim that violations are solely due to imperfect sampling rather than theoretical limitations is asserted but not rigorously proven

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary noise parameters (μ, σ) added to validation data and measure how certification guarantees degrade as validation distribution diverges from test data.

2. **Oracle Quality Impact:** Compare certification results using PGD oracle versus LiRPA oracle across multiple networks, measuring both runtime and tightness of bounds.

3. **Dimensionality Stress Test:** Apply the method to datasets with significantly higher input dimensionality than CIFAR-10 (e.g., ImageNet-10) while keeping sample size fixed to test dimensionality independence under extreme conditions.
