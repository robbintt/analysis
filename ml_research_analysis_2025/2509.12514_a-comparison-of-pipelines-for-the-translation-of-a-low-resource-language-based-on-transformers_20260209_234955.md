# A comparison of pipelines for the translation of a low resource language based on transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12514
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Standard transformer pipeline outperforms LLaMA3 fine-tuning and BERT-enhanced distillation for Bambara translation

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates three neural machine translation pipelines for Bambara, a low-resource African language, focusing on French-to-Bambara translation. The pipelines include a standard transformer model, LLaMA3 fine-tuning, and a BERT-enhanced distillation approach. Experiments reveal that the simpler transformer architecture achieves superior translation quality with BLEU scores of 33.81% and chrF of 41% on the Yiri dataset. The results challenge the assumption that more complex models necessarily perform better for low-resource language translation tasks.

## Method Summary
The research compares three distinct translation pipelines for Bambara. The first uses a standard transformer architecture, the second fine-tunes LLaMA3 models, and the third employs LoReB, a BERT-enhanced distillation approach. All models were trained and evaluated on French-to-Bambara translation tasks using available datasets. The study measured performance using BLEU and chrF metrics, comparing results across different data configurations including single datasets versus aggregated collections. The simpler transformer pipeline demonstrated superior performance compared to the more complex fine-tuning and distillation approaches.

## Key Results
- Standard transformer pipeline achieved BLEU score of 33.81% and chrF of 41% on Yiri dataset
- LLaMA3 models with Instructor fine-tuning performed better on single datasets than aggregated collections
- LoReB distillation approach showed promise for multilingual integration despite lower direct translation accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of the standard transformer pipeline for Bambara translation can be attributed to several factors. Low-resource languages often lack the extensive parallel corpora needed for complex fine-tuning approaches to effectively capture linguistic patterns. The transformer architecture, while simpler, may be better suited to learning from limited data without the additional complexity that can lead to overfitting or inefficient parameter utilization. The LLaMA3 models' better performance on single datasets suggests they can capture domain-specific patterns more effectively when training data is limited to a particular context. The LoReB approach, while not achieving the highest direct translation accuracy, demonstrates potential for integrating low-resource languages into larger multilingual systems, suggesting different architectures serve different purposes in the translation ecosystem.

## Foundational Learning
- **BLEU score**: Measures translation quality by comparing n-gram overlap between machine and reference translations. Needed to quantify translation accuracy across different pipelines. Quick check: Higher BLEU scores indicate better translation quality.
- **chrF metric**: Character n-gram F-score that measures translation quality at the character level. Needed for languages with rich morphology where word-level metrics may be insufficient. Quick check: chrF provides complementary evaluation to BLEU, especially for morphologically complex languages.
- **Transformer architecture**: Neural network architecture using self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence tasks. Needed as the baseline model for comparison. Quick check: Standard transformer achieved best performance, suggesting simplicity benefits for low-resource scenarios.
- **Fine-tuning**: Process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task using additional training. Needed to evaluate whether larger pre-trained models improve low-resource translation. Quick check: LLaMA3 fine-tuning showed dataset-specific performance patterns.
- **Distillation**: Training a smaller model to mimic a larger model's behavior. Needed to assess whether knowledge transfer improves low-resource translation. Quick check: LoReB distillation showed promise for multilingual integration despite lower direct accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Standard Transformer -> French-to-Bambara translation -> BLEU/chrF evaluation

Critical path: Data preparation -> Model training -> Translation generation -> Quality evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. complexity - the study reveals that simpler transformer models outperform more complex fine-tuning and distillation approaches for this low-resource language pair, suggesting that architectural complexity may not always yield better results when data is limited.

Failure signatures: Complex models may overfit to limited training data, while simpler models may struggle with capturing nuanced linguistic patterns. Performance degradation is expected when training data is insufficient for the model's capacity.

First experiments:
1. Replicate the French-to-Bambara translation task using the standard transformer pipeline on the Yiri dataset
2. Fine-tune LLaMA3 models on individual Bambara datasets to verify dataset-specific performance patterns
3. Implement the LoReB distillation approach to assess its effectiveness for multilingual integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to French-to-Bambara translation, so performance for other language pairs or directions remains unknown
- Results based on a single low-resource African language, limiting generalizability to other low-resource contexts
- Study does not examine domain adaptation or robustness to out-of-domain text, which could impact real-world deployment
- While Instructor-based LLaMA3 models show better performance on single datasets, the underlying reasons and stability across different data sizes require further exploration

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Standard transformer pipeline outperforms LLaMA3 fine-tuning and LoReB distillation for Bambara translation (BLEU 33.81%, chrF 41%)

Medium confidence:
- Instructor-based LLaMA3 models perform better on single datasets than aggregated collections (requires validation across multiple languages and domains)

Low confidence:
- Generalizability claims about low-resource language translation without additional experiments on diverse language pairs and domains

## Next Checks

1. Test all three pipelines on multiple low-resource language pairs (including non-African languages) to assess cross-linguistic generalizability

2. Evaluate model robustness using out-of-domain test sets and noisy input data to measure real-world applicability

3. Conduct ablation studies on the Instructor-based LLaMA3 models to identify which components drive the improved performance on single datasets
