# MarsRL: Advancing Multi-Agent Reasoning System via Reinforcement Learning with Agentic Pipeline Parallelism

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.11373
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11373
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: MarsRL improves Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507's AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%

## Executive Summary
MarsRL introduces a reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes Solver, Verifier, and Corrector agents for multi-agent reasoning systems. The framework addresses reward noise through agent-specific rewards and improves training efficiency via pipeline parallelism. When applied to mathematical problem-solving, MarsRL significantly outperforms both the baseline model and even larger models, demonstrating the effectiveness of its multi-agent approach.

## Method Summary
MarsRL implements a multi-agent reasoning pipeline where a Solver generates solutions, a Verifier checks them, and a Corrector modifies them if needed. The framework uses reinforcement learning with agent-specific rewards to address reward noise issues common in multi-agent systems. Training efficiency is improved through pipeline parallelism, where multiple agents process different problems simultaneously in a pipeline architecture. The framework is trained end-to-end on mathematical problem datasets using a constrained rollout limit of five iterations.

## Key Results
- Improves Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% on AIME2025
- Increases BeyondAIME performance from 64.9% to 73.8%
- Outperforms even larger models despite using a smaller base model
- Trained Verifier and Corrector agents generalize effectively to different Solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its ability to decompose complex reasoning tasks into specialized agent roles that can be jointly optimized. The agent-specific rewards address the reward sparsity and noise issues that typically plague multi-agent RL systems. By training the Verifier and Corrector alongside the Solver, the system develops more robust reasoning capabilities. The pipeline parallelism enables efficient training by allowing multiple reasoning steps to occur simultaneously across different problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning**: Needed to coordinate multiple specialized agents working on the same task; quick check: verify agents can specialize without interfering with each other's learning
- **Reward shaping and noise reduction**: Critical for stable learning in multi-agent settings; quick check: confirm agent-specific rewards reduce variance compared to global rewards
- **Pipeline parallelism**: Essential for scaling multi-agent training efficiently; quick check: measure throughput gains vs. sequential training
- **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**: Provides the underlying reasoning framework that agents operate within; quick check: verify reasoning depth increases with training
- **Solver-Verifier-Corrector architecture**: Enables iterative refinement of solutions; quick check: confirm each agent improves solution quality
- **Transfer learning in multi-agent systems**: Allows trained Verifier and Corrector to generalize to new Solvers; quick check: test generalization across different model families

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Solver -> Verifier -> Corrector (iterative loop, max 5 iterations)
**Critical Path**: Problem input → Solver generates solution → Verifier evaluates correctness → Corrector modifies if incorrect → repeat up to 5 times → final answer
**Design Tradeoffs**: Joint training enables better coordination but increases complexity; pipeline parallelism improves efficiency but requires careful synchronization; agent-specific rewards reduce noise but may limit global optimization
**Failure Signatures**: If Verifier is too strict, Solver may not explore enough; if Corrector is too aggressive, solutions may diverge from correct paths; if pipeline parallelism is misconfigured, training instability may occur
**First Experiments**: 1) Test single-agent baseline without Verifier/Corrector to establish baseline performance, 2) Train with only Solver and Verifier to measure impact of Corrector, 3) Vary pipeline parallelism batch sizes to optimize throughput

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does joint training of the Verifier and Corrector induce a specific capability transfer to the Solver that is more effective than direct Solver training?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 4.3 notes that the Solver in MarsRL-VC outperforms MarsRL-S, observing that training the auxiliary agents increases the Solver's response length (reasoning depth) more than training the Solver itself, though the exact transfer mechanism is labeled a "plausible explanation."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates the phenomenon but does not isolate the specific weights or attention mechanisms that cause the untrained Solver to improve its reasoning depth significantly.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies analyzing gradient interactions or attention patterns between the VC agents and the Solver during training, or probing tasks that measure specific reasoning skills before and after VC training.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the MarsRL framework and its agentic rewards generalize effectively to non-mathematical domains such as coding or logical deduction?
- **Basis in paper**: The Abstract claims the framework can "broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks," but the Experimental Setup and Results strictly utilize mathematical benchmarks.
- **Why unresolved**: The "Agentic Verifiable Rewards" rely on matching reference answers, which is straightforward in math but may be ambiguous or noisy in open-ended domains.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation of the trained Verifier and Corrector agents on standard coding benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval) or qualitative reasoning tasks to see if error detection and correction capabilities transfer.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does training stability and final performance scale with the number of agents $n$ beyond the constrained setting of 5 agents?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 3.1 and 3.3 explicitly state that "each problem is constrained to a maximum of five rollout iterations during the training phase" with $n=5$.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the pipeline parallelism and agent-specific rewards remain effective at scale, or if reward noise accumulates and degrades learning in deeper agent pipelines.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments varying the depth of the V-C loop (e.g., $n=8, 10, 15$) to plot the relationship between agent count, training efficiency, and benchmark accuracy.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is confined to mathematical problem-solving datasets, limiting generalizability to other reasoning domains
- Performance improvements measured against a single baseline model without comparison to other contemporary multi-agent frameworks
- Agent-specific reward mechanism may introduce complexity in reward design for different task domains
- Pipeline parallelism effectiveness depends on specific hardware configurations and may not scale uniformly
- Generalization of trained Verifier and Corrector agents to different Solvers shown but lacks systematic evaluation across diverse model families

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical framework of MarsRL (joint optimization of Solver, Verifier, and Corrector with agent-specific rewards and pipeline parallelism) is clearly articulated and the mathematical formulation is sound. The reported performance improvements on AIME2025 and BeyondAIME are verifiable through the provided methodology.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that MarsRL "outperforms even larger models" is supported by the specific comparison to Qwen3-30B but lacks broader benchmarking against other model sizes and architectures. The generalization capability of Verifier and Corrector agents to different Solvers shows promise but requires more extensive validation.

**Medium confidence**: The efficiency improvements from pipeline parallelism are theoretically justified but the practical benefits may vary significantly based on implementation details and hardware specifications.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain evaluation**: Test MarsRL on non-mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., code generation, scientific reasoning, or commonsense reasoning) to assess generalizability beyond the AIME/BeyondAIME datasets

2. **Comparative analysis**: Benchmark MarsRL against other state-of-the-art multi-agent reasoning frameworks (e.g., Self-Consistency, Tree of Thoughts, or Chain-of-Thought) on the same mathematical problem datasets to establish relative performance

3. **Solver diversity study**: Systematically evaluate the generalization of trained Verifier and Corrector agents across multiple Solver models with varying architectures (different model families, sizes, and training paradigms) to quantify the transfer learning effectiveness
