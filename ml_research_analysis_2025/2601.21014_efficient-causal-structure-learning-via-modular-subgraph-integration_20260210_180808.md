# Efficient Causal Structure Learning via Modular Subgraph Integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21014
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes VISTA, a modular framework for large-scale causal structure learning that decomposes the global DAG into local Markov Blanket subgraphs, aggregates them via weighted voting, and enforces acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set heuristic.

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces VISTA, a modular framework for large-scale causal structure learning that addresses computational and statistical challenges by decomposing the global problem into local Markov Blanket subgraphs. The approach is model-agnostic, parallelizable, and does not require solver-based optimization. VISTA consistently improves accuracy and efficiency, reducing false discoveries by 50-80% and runtime by up to 70% compared to standalone baselines.

## Method Summary
VISTA decomposes global causal structure learning into local subproblems based on Markov Blankets. For each node, it identifies the Markov Blanket, learns structure on the induced subgraph using any base learner, aggregates results via weighted voting with exponential decay, enforces acyclicity using Greedy Feedback Arc Set, and applies threshold filtering. The framework is parallelizable and works with various base learners including NOTEARS, GOLEM, and DAG-GNN.

## Key Results
- VISTA consistently improves FDR by 50-80% and runtime by up to 70% compared to standalone baselines
- Theoretical guarantees include finite-sample error bounds and asymptotic consistency
- Experiments across diverse graph families and base learners demonstrate robust performance
- The modular approach maintains high accuracy while achieving significant computational efficiency gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decomposing a global causal graph into Markov Blanket subgraphs preserves all true edges while reducing computational complexity. Each node's Markov Blanket d-separates it from all other variables, so learning structure within each MB-induced subgraph is sufficient to recover edges incident to that node. The union of these subgraphs covers every edge in the global DAG.

### Mechanism 2
Weighted voting with exponential decay penalizes low-support edges and suppresses spurious orientations from noisy base learners. For each ordered edge X→Y, the score s(X→Y) = (1−e^{-λm})·A/m acts as a data-dependent prior: low m receives stronger regularization, high m approaches raw frequency.

### Mechanism 3
Greedy Feedback Arc Set (FAS) heuristics enforce acyclicity efficiently while preserving high-confidence edges. After weighted voting produces a merged directed graph, GreedyFAS iteratively removes nodes by topological imbalance, then identifies backward edges in the resulting order and removes the lightest-weight ones until the graph is acyclic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Markov Blanket (MB)
  - **Why needed here:** VISTA's decomposition is entirely built on MB locality; understanding that MB renders a node conditionally independent of all others is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a node V, list three components that must be in MB(V).

- **Concept:** Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) acyclicity
  - **Why needed here:** The final output must be a DAG; understanding why cycles invalidate causal interpretations and how acyclicity constraints work is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** If edges A→B, B→C, and C→A exist, is the graph acyclic?

- **Concept:** Conditional Independence and Faithfulness
  - **Why needed here:** MB identification relies on d-separation and faithfulness assumptions linking graph structure to statistical independence.
  - **Quick check question:** If X ⊥ Y | Z in the data distribution but X−Y−Z is not a separator in the graph, does faithfulness hold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MB Identification Module -> Local Learner Interface -> Vote Aggregator -> DAG Projector

- **Critical path:** MB identification → Local subgraph learning (parallelizable) → Vote aggregation (O(|V|²) scan) → DAG projection → Final graph

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - λ tuning: Larger λ improves recall (keeps weak true edges) but may increase false positives; smaller λ improves precision
  - Order of operations: Cycle removal before threshold filtering preserves high-weight edges; reversing this can cause unnecessary precision loss
  - MB estimator choice: More accurate MB identification improves coverage but may increase runtime

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Very high FDR with reasonable TPR: λ likely too high or t too low
  - Low TPR despite many votes: λ too low (over-penalizing) or MB identification missing neighbors
  - Persistent cycles after projection: Strong confounding in subgraphs producing high-weight conflicting directions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on MB quality: Replace ground-truth MB with estimated MB (e.g., PC-based) and measure coverage loss
  2. λ sensitivity sweep: Fix t=0.5, vary λ ∈ [0.1, 5.0], plot precision-recall curves on ER graphs (n=100, h=5)
  3. Scaling test: Measure total runtime and peak memory for n ∈ {30, 100, 300} comparing standalone NOTEARS vs VISTA+NOTEARS; verify claimed ~70% reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the VISTA framework be extended to incorporate interventional data to improve edge orientation accuracy? The Conclusion section explicitly lists "incorporating interventional data to improve orientation accuracy" as a primary direction for future work. The current framework is designed solely for observational data, relying on voting mechanisms that may not distinguish Markov equivalence classes effectively without interventional insights.

### Open Question 2
How do the theoretical error bounds change when relaxing the assumption that votes across subgraphs are independent? The authors state in Section 3.1 that Theorem 3.2 relies on an "idealized assumption" of independence and suggest "Extending the theory to low-correlation weakly dependent votes will be an interesting future direction." In practice, overlapping Markov Blankets induce correlation among local subgraph estimates, which the current finite-sample bounds ignore.

### Open Question 3
Can the framework be improved to distinguish high-confidence redundant edges caused by latent confounding from true causal edges? The Conclusion notes that restricting learners to subsets introduces latent confounding that produces "high-confidence redundant edges" which the current FAS and filtering steps may fail to remove if they do not form cycles. The current post-processing relies on acyclicity constraints and thresholding, which are insufficient for detecting edges that are statistically strong but causally spurious due to hidden variables.

## Limitations

- MB identification accuracy is critical but unspecified in experiments; slight MB misses can cascade into lost edges
- Weighted voting formula's robustness to correlated subgraph votes is not tested empirically
- FAS heuristic can remove true edges if cycles involve strong-weight edges

## Confidence

- High confidence: Modular decomposition correctly preserves all edges (Proposition 3.1 verified)
- Medium confidence: Weighted voting improves over naive voting (limited ablation evidence)
- Medium confidence: VISTA consistently improves FDR/TPR/SHD over baselines in reported experiments

## Next Checks

1. MB coverage validation: Compare edge recall when using ground-truth MBs vs estimated MBs (e.g., PC-based) on n=50 ER graphs
2. λ sensitivity analysis: Run VISTA+NOTEARS with λ ∈ [0.1, 1.0], fixed t=0.5, on n=100 SF graphs; plot precision-recall curves
3. Scaling benchmark: Measure runtime and peak memory for standalone NOTEARS vs VISTA+NOTEARS with 4 parallel workers on n=300 ER graphs; confirm ~70% runtime reduction
