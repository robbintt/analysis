core_contribution: This paper addresses the underexplored task of multimodal sarcasm
  generation by introducing M2SaG, a new dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing
  an image, sarcastic text, and sarcasm target. The authors propose ViSP, a PPO-driven
  framework that uses reinforcement learning and contrastive learning to generate
  sarcastic text with stronger intent.

# ViSP: A PPO-Driven Framework for Sarcasm Generation with Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09482
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09482
- Authors: Changli Wang; Rui Wu; Fang Yin
- Reference count: 15
- Introduces M2SaG dataset with 4,970 multimodal sarcasm samples

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ViSP, a PPO-driven framework for multimodal sarcasm generation that leverages reinforcement learning and contrastive learning to generate sarcastic text with stronger intent. The framework is evaluated on M2SaG, a newly constructed dataset containing 4,970 image-text-sarcasm-target triplets. ViSP outperforms all baselines across five evaluation sets, achieving superior performance on standard metrics (BLEU-1: 24.26, ROUGE-L: 21.5, METEOR: 17.79) and demonstrating higher sarcasm scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and factual incongruity (0.768 vs. 0.739) than the original dataset.

## Method Summary
ViSP is a PPO-driven framework that integrates reinforcement learning with contrastive learning for multimodal sarcasm generation. The framework uses a dual reward mechanism: one reward encourages sarcasm detection, while the other promotes factual incongruity between the image and generated text. The model is trained on M2SaG, a novel dataset containing 4,970 samples with images, sarcastic texts, and their sarcasm targets. The PPO algorithm optimizes the generation process by maximizing the combined reward, while contrastive learning helps maintain semantic coherence and enhance the sarcastic intent.

## Key Results
- ViSP achieves BLEU-1 of 24.26, ROUGE-L of 21.5, and METEOR of 17.79 on M2SaG
- Generated texts show higher sarcasm scores (0.898) compared to original dataset (0.770)
- Factual incongruity scores are higher for generated texts (0.768) versus original (0.739)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its dual-reward PPO mechanism that explicitly optimizes for both sarcasm detection and factual incongruity. By combining reinforcement learning with contrastive learning, ViSP can generate text that not only matches the image context but also creates the semantic contrast necessary for effective sarcasm. The PPO algorithm provides stable policy updates while the contrastive component ensures the generated text maintains meaningful semantic relationships with the image content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Why needed - provides stable policy gradient updates for text generation; Quick check - monitor KL divergence between policy updates
- **Contrastive Learning**: Why needed - helps maintain semantic coherence while enhancing sarcastic intent; Quick check - verify embedding similarity metrics between positive/negative pairs
- **Sarcasm Detection**: Why needed - provides reward signal for measuring sarcasm quality; Quick check - validate sarcasm classifier performance on held-out data
- **Reinforcement Learning for Text Generation**: Why needed - enables optimization of non-differentiable metrics like sarcasm quality; Quick check - track reward curves during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image Encoder -> Text Generator -> Sarcasm Detector + Incongruity Evaluator -> PPO Optimizer -> Contrastive Learning Module

**Critical Path**: The generation process flows from image encoding through the text generator, with outputs evaluated by both sarcasm detection and incongruity metrics, which together form the reward signal for PPO optimization.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved sarcasm quality by using dual rewards and contrastive learning. This increases training time but produces more effective sarcastic text compared to single-reward approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: (1) over-generation of incongruity leading to nonsensical text, (2) sarcasm detector overfitting to training patterns, (3) contrastive learning collapsing to trivial solutions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify sarcasm detector accuracy on held-out M2SaG samples
2. Test baseline text generation without reinforcement learning
3. Evaluate contrastive learning effectiveness on embedding similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on a single newly constructed dataset, limiting generalizability
- Human evaluation metrics (funniness, incongruity) are subjective and may vary across annotator groups
- Small human evaluation sample size (100 pairs) with no reported inter-annotator agreement

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Comparative performance against baselines | High |
| Novelty of PPO-driven framework with contrastive learning | Medium |
| Human evaluation findings | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test ViSP on an independent multimodal sarcasm dataset to assess domain transfer
2. Conduct larger-scale human evaluation with diverse annotator pools and report inter-annotator agreement
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate contributions of PPO vs. contrastive learning components
