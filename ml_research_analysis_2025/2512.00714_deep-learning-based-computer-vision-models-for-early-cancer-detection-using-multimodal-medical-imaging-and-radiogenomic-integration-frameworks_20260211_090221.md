# Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision Models for Early Cancer Detection Using Multimodal Medical Imaging and Radiogenomic Integration Frameworks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00714
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00714
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of deep learning models for multimodal cancer detection integrating imaging with radiogenomics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive review of deep learning-based computer vision models for early cancer detection through multimodal medical imaging and radiogenomic integration. The study explores how AI architectures like CNNs, transformers, and hybrid attention models can extract complex spatial and morphological patterns from multimodal imaging data to identify subtle tumor abnormalities invisible to human observers. The research demonstrates how integrating imaging with radiogenomics enables non-invasive prediction of tumor genotype, immune response, molecular subtypes, and treatment resistance without biopsies.

## Method Summary
The research synthesizes existing literature on deep learning architectures for cancer detection, focusing on CNN-based models, transformer architectures, and hybrid attention mechanisms. The methodology involves analyzing technical approaches for multimodal data fusion across MRI, CT, PET, mammography, histopathology, and ultrasound imaging modalities. The review examines integration frameworks that combine imaging features with genomic and transcriptomic data to predict tumor characteristics, treatment responses, and molecular subtypes. Technical challenges including data heterogeneity, interpretability limitations, and computational requirements are systematically addressed through analysis of current solutions and proposed frameworks.

## Key Results
- AI architectures can extract subtle tumor abnormalities invisible to human observers from multimodal imaging data
- Radiogenomic integration enables non-invasive prediction of tumor genotype, immune response, and treatment resistance without biopsies
- Multimodal fusion techniques demonstrate improved diagnostic accuracy over single-modality approaches across multiple cancer types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from deep learning models' ability to learn hierarchical feature representations from complex multimodal data. Convolutional neural networks excel at spatial pattern recognition in medical images, while transformers capture long-range dependencies across imaging modalities. The integration of radiogenomic data provides molecular context that enhances pattern recognition beyond purely anatomical features. Attention mechanisms enable selective focus on diagnostically relevant regions while suppressing noise. The fusion of heterogeneous data types allows models to identify multimodal biomarkers that correlate with tumor biology, improving early detection capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal Data Fusion: Why needed - Combines complementary information from different imaging modalities; Quick check - Verify fusion improves detection accuracy over single modalities
- Radiogenomic Integration: Why needed - Links imaging phenotypes to molecular characteristics; Quick check - Validate non-invasive molecular predictions against biopsy results
- Transfer Learning: Why needed - Addresses limited annotated medical imaging datasets; Quick check - Evaluate performance on external validation datasets
- Attention Mechanisms: Why needed - Enables focus on diagnostically relevant features; Quick check - Assess attention map consistency with radiologist findings
- Federated Learning: Why needed - Enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy; Quick check - Verify model performance without centralized data access
- Interpretability Methods: Why needed - Ensures clinical trust and regulatory compliance; Quick check - Evaluate explanation consistency across different model predictions

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Raw Imaging Data -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Feature Extraction (CNN/Transformer) -> Multimodal Fusion Layer -> Radiogenomic Integration -> Prediction Layer -> Clinical Output

Critical Path: Data Acquisition → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Multimodal Fusion → Radiogenomic Integration → Prediction

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model Complexity vs. Interpretability: Complex architectures achieve higher accuracy but reduce clinical explainability
- Multimodal Integration vs. Data Availability: Comprehensive fusion improves performance but requires extensive multimodal datasets
- Real-time Processing vs. Diagnostic Accuracy: Faster inference enables clinical workflow integration but may sacrifice some accuracy

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization across institutions indicates overfitting to specific imaging protocols
- Inconsistent predictions for similar cases suggests instability in feature extraction
- Low confidence scores on clear abnormalities indicates inadequate learning of key diagnostic features

First Experiments:
1. Compare CNN vs. transformer performance on single-modality cancer detection task
2. Evaluate multimodal fusion impact on detection accuracy using controlled dataset
3. Test radiogenomic integration performance for predicting known molecular subtypes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited availability of large, annotated multimodal datasets restricts model generalizability across diverse populations
- Radiogenomic integration validation remains primarily in controlled research settings rather than routine clinical practice
- Interpretability challenges with deep learning models when integrating heterogeneous data modalities

## Confidence
- Technical Feasibility: High - Demonstrated performance of CNN and transformer architectures on complex imaging data
- Clinical Translation: Medium - Validated in research settings but requires further real-world deployment testing
- Data Integration: Medium - Radiogenomic frameworks show promise but need broader validation across cancer types

## Next Checks
1. Conduct prospective clinical trials comparing multimodal AI detection systems against current standard-of-care screening methods across diverse patient populations
2. Implement federated learning frameworks using real-world clinical imaging datasets to validate model performance outside controlled research environments
3. Perform systematic evaluation of genomic privacy protection mechanisms when deploying radiogenomic integration in healthcare systems with varying regulatory frameworks
