## Executive Summary
This paper presents an industrial case study of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform, to address the challenge of incomplete and inconsistent accommodation data from third-party providers. Two approaches were evaluated: fine-tuning Mistral 7B with QLoRA and using Mixtral 8x7B with a refined system prompt. Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B-FT across key metrics, achieving 99.6% completeness versus 93%, 98.8% precision versus 96%, and 1.2% hallucination rate versus 4%, while producing more concise content (249 vs 277 words). However, Mixtral 8x7B required significantly more computational resources (50GB VRAM, $1.61/hour) compared to Mistral 7B-FT (5GB VRAM, $0.16/hour). The findings demonstrate LLMs' effectiveness in enhancing data consistency and reliability, with Mixtral 8x7B selected for production deployment due to its superior output quality despite higher resource costs.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated two LLM approaches for generating property descriptions from incomplete third-party data. Approach A fine-tuned Mistral 7B using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization on AWS g4dn instances (16GB VRAM). Approach B used Mixtral 8x7B with 8-bit quantization and a refined system prompt on AWS instances (96GB VRAM total). Both approaches structured input features into categorical fields (Recreation, Services, Dining, Rooms, POIs) before LLM processing. The dataset comprised 100 training items and 20 held-out test items. Evaluation metrics included completeness (context feature inclusion), precision (feature accuracy), hallucination rate (fabricated features), and description length.

## Key Results
- Mixtral 8x7B achieved 99.6% completeness versus Mistral 7B-FT's 93%
- Mixtral 8x7B demonstrated 1.2% hallucination rate versus 4% for Mistral 7B-FT
- Mixtral 8x7B required 10× higher hourly compute costs ($1.61 vs $0.16)
- Mixtral 8x7B produced more concise descriptions (249 words vs 277 words)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Context Encoding
Organizing facility features into explicit categorical fields before LLM processing improves completeness and reduces hallucinations in generated descriptions. Structured context (Recreation, Services, Dining, Rooms, POIs) constrains the generation space by providing explicit reference points, reducing the model's need to infer or fabricate missing information. Core assumption: Structured inputs reduce hallucination by giving the model verifiable anchors rather than relying on parametric memory. Evidence: Phase 1 analysis showed structured context produced the best results. Break condition: If categorization schema doesn't align with domain ontology, structuring may introduce noise.

### Mechanism 2: Scale Outperforms Fine-Tuning for Factual Generation
Larger general-purpose models with refined system prompts can outperform smaller domain-fine-tuned models on factual description tasks. Mixtral 8x7B's mixture-of-experts architecture and larger parameter capacity provide broader knowledge and better instruction-following, enabling prompt-only domain adaptation that exceeds QLoRA fine-tuning on a 7B model. Core assumption: Pre-trained knowledge in larger models already contains sufficient domain-relevant patterns that fine-tuning provides diminishing returns. Evidence: Mixtral achieved 99.6% completeness vs 93% for Mistral. Break condition: For domains with novel terminology absent from pre-training, fine-tuning may still be required.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Phase-Gated Development
Separating exploration, data preparation, and model tuning into distinct phases with explicit artifact outputs improves production system quality. Phase 1 catalog analysis produces reusable design artifacts that systematically transfer domain knowledge to Phase 2 preprocessing and Phase 3 prompt/model refinement, reducing ad-hoc iteration. Core assumption: Domain insights from manual analysis can be codified into artifacts that generalize across the catalog. Evidence: Phase 1 output (Prompt Report, Data Report) enabled efficient data cleansing in Phase 2. Break condition: If domain characteristics change rapidly or initial analysis is incomplete, codified artifacts may propagate incorrect assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Needed to understand how 4-bit quantization enables fine-tuning a 7B parameter model on a 16GB GPU. Quick check: Why does 4-bit quantization enable fine-tuning a 7B parameter model on a 16GB GPU that couldn't hold the full-precision weights?

- **Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Required to understand Mixtral 8x7B's ~47B parameters but ~13B activated per inference. Quick check: Why does the paper note that standard accelerate library device maps can saturate memory on certain layers during inference?

- **Hallucination Detection via Feature Mapping**: Essential for understanding the evaluation methodology that relies on manually mapping context features to generated text to identify hallucinations. Quick check: How would you distinguish between a legitimate inference ("nearby beach" from "coastal location" context) and a hallucination (fabricated amenities)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw catalogs -> feature extraction -> structured Context field (Recreation, Services, Dining, Rooms, POIs) -> Model Serving Layer (Mistral 7B-FT or Mixtral 8x7B) -> Tokenizer Adapter (modified Jinja template) -> Evaluation Module (feature mapping)

- **Critical path**: Phase 1: Catalog analysis -> Prompt Report + Data Report; Phase 2: Data preprocessing -> training/test datasets (Input/Context/Output structure); Phase 3: Model selection + prompt refinement -> candidate model; Evaluation: Generate 20 descriptions × 5 repetitions -> calculate completeness, precision, hallucination rate, length

- **Design tradeoffs**: Quality vs. cost (Mixtral: 10× hourly cost, 99.6% completeness; Mistral: low cost, 93% completeness); Fine-tuning effort vs. prompt complexity (Mistral: QLoRA training runs; Mixtral: tokenizer modification + system prompt); Conciseness vs. completeness (Mistral: longer descriptions, less complete; Mixtral: shorter, more complete)

- **Failure signatures**: High hallucination rate (>4%) indicates incomplete context structuring or insufficient model capacity; Low completeness (<93%) suggests features not extracted from source catalogs or prompt doesn't use all context; VRAM overflow on Mixtral indicates manual device mapping required; Tokenizer errors with SYSTEM role require template modification

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication: Generate descriptions for 20 held-out facilities using both models, manually map features to validate metrics; 2) Context ablation study: Compare structured categorical context vs. flat feature lists to isolate contribution to hallucination reduction; 3) Fine-tuning scaling test: Train Mistral 7B with increasing dataset sizes (100, 200, 500 items) to determine if/when it approaches Mixtral quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the performance gap between fine-tuned smaller models (Mistral 7B-FT) and larger prompted models (Mixtral 8x7B) be narrowed or eliminated with larger fine-tuning datasets? The study used only 100 items for fine-tuning Mistral 7B, which the authors note directly influences model performance. This limited dataset may explain part of Mixtral's superior performance. Evidence to resolve: Empirical evaluation comparing Mistral 7B-FT performance when fine-tuned on progressively larger datasets (e.g., 500, 1000, 5000 items) against Mixtral 8x7B baseline.

### Open Question 2
How do generated descriptions impact actual user behavior, booking conversion rates, and customer satisfaction? The paper claims enhanced user experience as a key benefit but evaluates only computational metrics (completeness, precision, hallucinations). The authors state the goal was to "enhance the overall user experience" but conduct no user studies. Evidence to resolve: Controlled A/B tests measuring booking rates, time-on-page, and user satisfaction scores for properties with LLM-generated versus original descriptions.

### Open Question 3
How does model performance degrade or drift when processing out-of-distribution property types or languages beyond the evaluated catalog? The evaluation used only 20 facilities from the existing catalogs, and the training data came from a single primary catalog. The paper does not address generalization to property types or regions not represented in the training/testing data. Evidence to resolve: Evaluation on held-out property types (e.g., hostels, campsites, unusual accommodations) and multilingual inputs not represented in training data.

## Limitations
- Manual feature mapping for hallucination detection introduces potential human bias and doesn't scale to larger datasets
- Single catalog as primary data source limits generalizability across diverse property types and regions
- Resource requirements for Mixtral 8x7B (96GB VRAM) create significant barriers to replication and deployment in resource-constrained environments

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Relative performance comparison between Mistral 7B-FT and Mixtral 8x7B is well-supported by reported metrics (completeness: 99.6% vs 93%, precision: 98.8% vs 96%, hallucination: 1.2% vs 4%)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that structured categorical context reduces hallucinations is supported by internal validation but lacks independent verification
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of phase-gated development methodology to other domains is assumed but not empirically tested

## Next Checks
1. **Feature Mapping Validation**: Implement automated feature extraction from generated descriptions and compare against manual mapping to assess consistency and scalability of the hallucination detection methodology

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Apply the structured context approach to a different property domain (e.g., vacation rentals or boutique hotels) to test whether the categorical schema generalizes or requires domain-specific adaptation

3. **Resource Optimization Study**: Experiment with different quantization strategies and device mapping configurations for Mixtral 8x7B to identify the minimum viable resource configuration that maintains acceptable performance quality
