- One-line primary result: Introduces a unified evaluation framework with standardized metrics and MLIP-based convex hull construction for fair comparison of crystal generative models

## Executive Summary
LeMat-GenBench addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation protocols in inorganic crystal structure generation. The benchmark introduces a unified framework with sequential metric computation (Validity → Stability → Uniqueness → Novelty) and MLIP-based self-consistent convex hull construction for reliable thermodynamic stability assessment. Using the comprehensive LeMat-Bulk dataset (~5M structures) as reference, the framework evaluates 12 recent generative models and reveals fundamental trade-offs: no model excels across all dimensions, with increased stability generally leading to decreased novelty and diversity.

## Method Summary
The evaluation pipeline processes 2,500 generated CIF files per model through hierarchical validity filtering (charge neutrality, density, distances, symmetry), MLIP ensemble energy calculations (MACE-MP, UMA, Orb-v3), and self-consistent convex hull construction using the same MLIPs on LeMat-Bulk. The primary metric is the (M.)S.U.N. rate (Stable, Unique, Novel) computed sequentially to prevent artificial inflation. Secondary metrics include validity, diversity (elemental, space group), distribution metrics (JS, MMD, FID), and stability scores (Ehull, RMSD). The framework provides an open-source evaluation suite and public leaderboard on Hugging Face for reproducible model comparison.

## Key Results
- No single model excels across all evaluation dimensions; clear trade-offs exist between stability, novelty, and diversity
- Self-consistent MLIP-based convex hull construction improves stability classification reliability (F1-scores from 0.66→0.81 for Orb-v3)
- Switching from MP-20 to LeMat-Bulk reference dataset reduces stability rates by 2-3× and S.U.N. rates collapse (e.g., DiffCSP: 4.1% to 0.1%)
- Crystal-GFN shows 51.7% validity but would appear artificially competitive on subset metrics without sequential computation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-consistent MLIP-based convex hull construction improves stability classification reliability over mixed-reference approaches.
- Mechanism: By using the same MLIP to both predict candidate energies and construct the reference convex hull, systematic energy biases cancel, reducing label flip errors at tight stability thresholds.
- Core assumption: The primary error source is consistent offset rather than random noise, which cancellation exploits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.2]: F1-scores improve from 0.66 to 0.81 (Orb-v3) and 0.67 to 0.83 (UMA) at Ehull < 0.01 eV/atom when using self-consistent hulls.
  - [Section C.3]: Self-consistent approach yields lower MAE (0.008 vs 0.012 eV/atom for ORB) and higher correlation (r>0.94) with DFT ground truth.
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers discuss symmetry-aware generation but not evaluation methodology.
- Break condition: If MLIP training distribution is severely mismatched to target compositions, self-consistency may not offset domain-specific errors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential metric computation (Validity → Stability → Uniqueness → Novelty) prevents artificially inflated scores from low-validity models.
- Mechanism: Each metric is computed only on structures passing prior filters; this prevents models with high novelty-on-valid-subset from appearing superior when most outputs are invalid.
- Core assumption: Users care about end-to-end generation quality, not just performance on post-hoc filtered subsets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.2]: "We apply validity, uniqueness and novelty sequentially... which offers different information compared to doing it on the whole set."
  - [Table 1]: Crystal-GFN shows 51.7% validity but would otherwise appear artificially competitive on subset metrics.
- Break condition: If downstream applications routinely filter separately (e.g., expensive post-relaxation pipelines), sequential computation may underrepresent practical utility.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large-scale reference datasets (LeMat-Bulk, ~5M structures) reduce false-positive novelty and inflated stability assessments.
- Mechanism: Broader phase coverage creates tighter convex hulls; structures stable only against limited reference sets are correctly classified as metastable or unstable.
- Core assumption: The reference dataset adequately covers competing phases; gaps would reintroduce false positives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.4]: "Novelty drops from 83.1% to 70.5% for MatterGen; stability rates are divided by 2-3×" when switching from MP-20 to LeMat-Bulk.
  - [Section 5.4]: "S.U.N. rates collapse further (e.g., DiffCSP: 4.1% to 0.1%)."
- Break condition: If target discovery domain is narrow (e.g., specific application-relevant chemistries), comprehensive reference may penalize valid exploration outside major databases.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convex hull and energy above hull (Ehull)
  - Why needed here: Stability assessment hinges on whether generated structures lie on or below the hull; mixing energy references breaks this.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Ehull ≤ 0 indicates thermodynamic stability while 0 < Ehull ≤ 0.1 eV/atom indicates metastability?

- Concept: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs)
  - Why needed here: MLIPs provide scalable energy predictions replacing expensive DFT; understanding their biases is essential for interpreting benchmark results.
  - Quick check question: Why would an MLIP trained primarily on oxides systematically mispredict energies for metallic systems?

- Concept: S.U.N. (Stable, Unique, Novel) framework
  - Why needed here: This composite metric is the primary benchmark; understanding its hierarchical computation prevents misinterpretation.
  - Quick check question: If a model generates 1000 structures, 500 pass validity, 100 are stable, 50 are unique, and 10 are novel—what is the S.U.N. rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Validity filtering → MLIP ensemble evaluation → Self-consistent convex hull construction → Sequential S.U.N. computation → Diversity and distribution metrics
- Critical path: Validity filtering → MLIP energy computation → Convex hull construction → Sequential S.U.N. computation. Any failure in early stages cascades; invalid structures never reach expensive MLIP evaluation.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-relaxation vs post-relaxation: Pre-relaxation reflects raw model capability; post-relaxation reveals latent potential but masks generation quality.
  - Ensemble vs single MLIP: Ensemble reduces variance but adds compute; paper shows MACE-MP contributes diversity despite lower individual correlation.
  - LeMat-Bulk vs MP-20: Comprehensive vs training-aligned reference; choose based on whether goal is methodological comparison or discovery assessment.
- Failure signatures:
  - Near-perfect novelty with low stability: Model exploring sparse regions without thermodynamic grounding.
  - High validity but low uniqueness: Mode collapse or memorization.
  - Large pre/post-relaxation RMSD gap: Model generating physically implausible geometries.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate on your own generated structures: Submit 100+ structures to the Hugging Face leaderboard to establish baseline metrics.
  2. Ablate reference dataset: Compare S.U.N. rates using MP-20 vs LeMat-Bulk to quantify how reference size affects your model's assessment.
  3. Test relaxation sensitivity: Generate structures, relax with UMA, re-compute metrics—large shifts indicate geometric quality issues in generation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the benchmark be extended to evaluate conditional generation tasks and sample efficiency under limited oracle budgets?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.1 and Section 6 explicitly define conditional generation and budget-constrained scenarios as "future extensions" not covered in the current unconditional-only framework.
- **Why unresolved:** Establishing rigorous unconditional metrics is cited as a prerequisite, meaning conditional protocols have not yet been standardized or implemented in the leaderboard.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The release of new benchmark tasks requiring models to generate structures with target properties (e.g., bandgap, bulk modulus) using a fixed number of oracle evaluations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can future generative models overcome the observed trade-off where increased thermodynamic stability leads to decreased novelty and diversity?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The results section notes that "no single model excels across all dimensions," revealing a clear inverse correlation where models with high stability (like PLaID++) exhibit significantly lower novelty and diversity compared to exploratory models.
- **Why unresolved:** Current architectural paradigms appear to optimize for either physical plausibility or exploration of chemical space, but not both simultaneously.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The development of a model that achieves top-quartile performance in both stability (S.U.N. rate) and diversity metrics on the public leaderboard.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the evaluation framework be adapted to assess structures with disorder, doping, and non-stoichiometry?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 lists the assumption of "idealized, defect-free crystals" as a key limitation, noting that current models "overlook critical phenomena like disorder."
- **Why unresolved:** The current validity checks and structure matching algorithms assume idealized periodicity and fixed atomic sites.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The integration of metrics capable of validating partial occupancies and the inclusion of disordered structures in the reference datasets.

## Limitations
- MLIP-based stability assessment introduces systematic uncertainties for chemistries underrepresented in training data
- Sequential metric computation may underrepresent models that excel at generating small numbers of high-quality structures
- Fixed 2,500 structure evaluation set may not capture model performance across different sampling regimes

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Validity filtering methodology, sequential S.U.N. computation, diversity metric calculations, public leaderboard infrastructure
- **Medium Confidence**: Stability assessment via self-consistent MLIP hulls (strong evidence but MLIP limitations acknowledged), novelty evaluation (dependent on reference completeness), distribution metric implementations
- **Low Confidence**: Long-term stability of S.U.N. rates across evolving MLIP capabilities, generalizability to conditional generation tasks, sensitivity to reference dataset curation choices

## Next Checks
1. Test MLIP domain sensitivity by evaluating structures from underrepresented chemistries (e.g., rare earth compounds, exotic oxidation states) and comparing MLIP vs DFT stability predictions
2. Conduct ablation study varying reference dataset size (MP-20 vs LeMat-Bulk subsets) to quantify impact on novelty assessment and identify stability thresholds where reference coverage becomes limiting
3. Evaluate model performance across multiple sampling temperatures or output sizes (100, 1000, 5000 structures) to assess whether current 2,500 structure benchmark captures scale-dependent generation behaviors
