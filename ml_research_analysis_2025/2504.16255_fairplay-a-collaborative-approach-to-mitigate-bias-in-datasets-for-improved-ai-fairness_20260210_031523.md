core_contribution: This paper introduces FairPlay, a collaborative web-based tool
  that enables multiple stakeholders to debias datasets together by modifying causal
  network relationships. Unlike traditional approaches that enforce a single fairness
  standard, FairPlay lets stakeholders negotiate and reach consensus on what constitutes
  fairness for their specific task.

# FairPlay: A Collaborative Approach to Mitigate Bias in Datasets for Improved AI Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.16255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16255
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Web-based tool enabling collaborative dataset debiasing through causal network modification

## Executive Summary
FairPlay introduces a novel collaborative approach to dataset debiasing that moves away from enforcing universal fairness standards toward stakeholder-driven consensus building. The web-based tool allows multiple users to modify causal network relationships in datasets, adjusting edge weights to achieve fair outcomes across demographic groups. Through gameplay-style interactions, stakeholders negotiate what fairness means for their specific task, with the system tracking how changes affect both demographic groups and overall model performance. User studies demonstrated that participants reached consensus within approximately five rounds while achieving improved fairness metrics without completely sacrificing accuracy.

## Method Summary
FairPlay operates through a causal network representation where users can adjust edge weights between features and outcomes. The tool provides three primary interaction modes: "Explain" for visualizing causal relationships, "Collaborate" for multi-stakeholder negotiation, and "Export" for generating debiased datasets. Users work with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where they can modify the strength of relationships between variables, with the system automatically updating outcome distributions across demographic groups. The platform tracks fairness metrics including individual fairness (measuring similarity of outcomes for similar individuals) and statistical parity, allowing stakeholders to see real-time impacts of their modifications. The approach emphasizes negotiation and consensus rather than imposing predefined fairness definitions, making it adaptable to domain-specific requirements and stakeholder priorities.

## Key Results
- Participants reached consensus on fairness definitions within approximately 5 rounds of gameplay
- Individual Fairness metric improved dramatically from 22.11 to 0.04
- Maintained reasonable model accuracy while achieving fairness improvements, though some accuracy trade-offs were observed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairPlay works by leveraging causal inference principles to identify and modify biased relationships in datasets. By allowing stakeholders to adjust edge weights in the causal network, the tool directly addresses the root causes of bias rather than applying post-hoc corrections. The collaborative negotiation process ensures that fairness definitions reflect the values and priorities of those affected by the AI system, rather than imposing external standards. The visual representation of causal relationships helps stakeholders understand how different features contribute to biased outcomes, making the debiasing process transparent and interpretable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Networks**: Directed acyclic graphs representing cause-effect relationships between variables. Needed to model how features influence outcomes and identify bias sources. Quick check: Verify DAG structure follows causal ordering without cycles.
- **Individual Fairness**: Metric measuring whether similar individuals receive similar outcomes. Needed to quantify fairness improvements from edge weight adjustments. Quick check: Confirm distance metrics between individuals are appropriate for feature types.
- **Statistical Parity**: Metric ensuring similar outcome distributions across demographic groups. Needed to track group-level fairness impacts. Quick check: Verify demographic group definitions and outcome thresholds.
- **Consensus Building**: Process where stakeholders negotiate and agree on fairness definitions. Needed to replace universal standards with context-specific solutions. Quick check: Monitor convergence of stakeholder positions over gameplay rounds.
- **Edge Weight Modification**: Technique for adjusting causal relationship strengths. Needed to implement targeted debiasing interventions. Quick check: Ensure weight changes preserve causal validity and don't introduce new biases.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Frontend UI -> Causal Network Engine -> Fairness Metric Calculator -> Database -> Export Module

**Critical Path:** User modifies edge weight → Causal Network Engine recalculates outcomes → Fairness Metric Calculator updates metrics → Frontend displays changes → Stakeholders review and negotiate

**Design Tradeoffs:** Real-time calculation vs. computational efficiency; stakeholder autonomy vs. technical constraints; visual simplicity vs. causal network complexity

**Failure Signatures:** Non-convergent negotiations (stakeholders unable to reach agreement); degraded model performance (accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds); causal inconsistencies (modified networks violate domain knowledge)

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test edge weight adjustment on single relationship with known bias to verify metric improvements
2. Simulate multi-stakeholder negotiation with scripted positions to validate consensus mechanism
3. Export modified dataset and retrain model to confirm fairness improvements persist in deployed system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small user study sample size (N=10) may limit generalizability of consensus-building effectiveness
- Limited evaluation to synthetic hiring dataset with binary features; performance on real-world datasets untested
- Focus on individual fairness and statistical parity without comprehensive coverage of other fairness definitions

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Core mechanism of collaborative causal network modification and basic FairPlay tool functionality

**Medium confidence:** User study results showing consensus achievement and fairness metric improvements, given limited sample size

**Medium confidence:** Claim that stakeholders can negotiate fairness definitions, though long-term stability of agreements unverified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale user studies (N > 50) with diverse stakeholder groups across multiple domains to validate consensus-building effectiveness and measure stability of agreements over time
2. Test FairPlay on real-world datasets with continuous variables and complex feature interactions to evaluate generalizability beyond synthetic hiring dataset
3. Implement and evaluate additional fairness metrics (equal opportunity, demographic parity, treatment equality) and compare results against established fairness toolkits to benchmark performance
