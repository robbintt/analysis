# Optimizing Distributed Deployment of Mixture-of-Experts Model Inference in Serverless Computing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.05313
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05313
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposed Bayesian optimization framework reduces MoE inference cost by 75.67% compared to CPU clusters while maintaining throughput

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in serverless computing platforms, where skewed expert popularity and scatter-gather communication bottlenecks create significant performance issues. The authors propose a comprehensive optimization framework that combines Bayesian optimization with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn optimal expert selections and minimize deployment costs. Through extensive experiments on AWS Lambda, the proposed designs demonstrate substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive inference throughput compared to both traditional CPU clusters and existing serverless approaches like LambdaML.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a Bayesian optimization framework with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to optimize MoE deployment in serverless environments. The core approach involves predicting expert popularity using a novel Bayesian decision-making method, implementing flexible pipelined scatter-gather communication designs, and developing an optimal model deployment algorithm for distributed MoE serving. The framework learns expert selections dynamically to minimize costs while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput, addressing the fundamental challenges of skewed expert popularity and communication bottlenecks in serverless MoE deployments.

## Key Results
- Achieved at least 75.67% reduction in billed cost for all MoE layers compared to CPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput
- Demonstrated 43.41% lower cost compared to LambdaML with at most 18.76% throughput decrease
- Successfully implemented flexible pipelined scatter-gather communication designs that address communication bottlenecks in serverless MoE inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by combining predictive modeling with adaptive optimization to address the unique challenges of serverless MoE deployment. The Bayesian decision-making framework predicts expert popularity patterns, allowing the system to pre-emptively optimize resource allocation and routing decisions. The multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search enables exploration of the optimization space while exploiting learned patterns, balancing between finding optimal solutions and adapting to changing workload characteristics. The flexible pipelined scatter-gather communication design mitigates the inherent communication bottlenecks in serverless environments by overlapping computation and communication phases, improving overall system efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian Optimization**: A sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions that doesn't require derivatives. Needed because traditional gradient-based methods don't work well with the discrete, non-differentiable optimization problems in serverless MoE deployment. Quick check: Understand the acquisition function and how it balances exploration vs exploitation.

**Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models**: Neural network architectures that consist of multiple expert networks and a gating network that routes inputs to appropriate experts. Needed because they offer computational efficiency but create challenges in serverless environments due to their distributed nature. Quick check: Understand how gating mechanisms work and why expert popularity becomes skewed.

**Epsilon-Greedy Search**: A reinforcement learning strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by selecting random actions with probability epsilon and the best-known action otherwise. Needed to prevent the optimization from getting stuck in local optima while still leveraging learned patterns. Quick check: Understand how the epsilon parameter is tuned and decayed over time.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Request Router -> Expert Popularity Predictor -> Bayesian Optimizer -> Resource Allocator -> Scatter-Gather Coordinator -> Serverless Function Pool

**Critical Path**: Request arrival → Expert selection via gating network → Routing to appropriate serverless functions → Parallel expert computation → Scatter-gather synchronization → Result aggregation → Response delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper trades off between optimization accuracy and computational overhead by using Bayesian optimization instead of exhaustive search, balances between cost minimization and throughput requirements through epsilon-greedy exploration, and chooses flexible pipelining over strict synchronization to reduce communication bottlenecks at the cost of slightly more complex coordination logic.

**Failure Signatures**: Expert popularity prediction failures lead to suboptimal resource allocation, communication bottlenecks manifest as increased tail latencies, cold start delays affect overall throughput, and routing failures can cause request timeouts or incomplete inference results.

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure expert popularity distribution under different workload patterns to validate the Bayesian predictor
2. Benchmark scatter-gather communication overhead with varying numbers of concurrent requests
3. Compare cost-per-inference across different resource allocation strategies under realistic load patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to AWS Lambda, potentially limiting generalizability to other serverless platforms
- Performance improvements measured primarily through cost reduction rather than comprehensive QoS metrics
- Assumes predictable workloads, but real-world MoE deployments often face highly dynamic and unpredictable request patterns
- Evaluation focuses on throughput and cost without addressing resource contention, multi-tenancy effects, or security implications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Cost reduction claims (75.67% reduction compared to CPU clusters) with concrete experimental results
- **Medium confidence**: Throughput comparison with LambdaML (43.41% lower cost with at most 18.76% throughput decrease)
- **Medium confidence**: Overall effectiveness of Bayesian optimization framework for expert selection

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce experiments across multiple serverless platforms (Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct stress testing under highly dynamic and bursty workload patterns to evaluate robustness
3. Perform comprehensive quality-of-service evaluation including latency percentiles, tail latency measurements, and reliability metrics under varying concurrent request levels
