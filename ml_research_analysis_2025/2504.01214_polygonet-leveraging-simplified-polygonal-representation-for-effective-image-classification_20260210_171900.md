# PolygoNet: Leveraging Simplified Polygonal Representation for Effective Image Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01214
- Authors: Salim Khazem; Jeremy Fix; Cédric Pradalier
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves ResNet-50 comparable accuracy with 8.66M vs 21.47B FLOPs on Folio dataset

## Executive Summary
PolygoNet introduces a novel approach to image classification by transforming images into polygonal representations through contour extraction and dominant point selection. This method significantly reduces computational complexity by processing images as compact coordinate-based sequences rather than full pixel matrices. The approach leverages self-attention mechanisms and 1D convolutional layers to effectively classify images while requiring far fewer floating-point operations than traditional CNNs, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments like edge devices.

## Method Summary
PolygoNet transforms input images into polygonal representations by extracting contours and selecting dominant points, creating a compact coordinate-based form of the image. The method processes these variable-length sequences using self-attention mechanisms and 1D convolutional layers, enabling efficient classification while maintaining competitive accuracy. The approach is specifically designed for edge devices, demonstrated through faster processing times on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano compared to traditional CNNs like ResNet-50, while achieving comparable performance on standard image classification benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable accuracy to ResNet-50 on FashionMNIST, Flavia, and Folio datasets
- Requires only 8.66 million FLOPs on Folio dataset versus 21.47 billion FLOPs for ResNet-50
- Demonstrates faster processing on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano edge device compared to traditional CNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exploiting the inherent structure in image contours through polygonal simplification. By converting images into sequences of dominant points that capture essential shape information, PolygoNet reduces the input dimensionality while preserving critical classification features. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the polygonal representation, while 1D convolutions efficiently process the sequential data. This combination enables effective feature extraction from simplified representations, achieving competitive accuracy with dramatically reduced computational requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contour extraction**: The process of identifying boundaries between regions of different intensity or color in an image. Needed to capture the essential shape information while reducing data complexity. Quick check: Verify contour extraction produces closed curves that accurately represent object boundaries.
- **Dominant point detection**: Identifying key points along a contour that capture its essential shape while allowing for simplification. Required to create compact polygonal representations that preserve classification-relevant features. Quick check: Ensure detected dominant points maintain the overall shape structure while reducing point count.
- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Neural network components that allow models to weigh the importance of different input elements dynamically. Necessary for processing variable-length polygonal sequences effectively. Quick check: Confirm attention weights properly highlight critical regions of the polygonal representation.
- **1D convolutional layers**: Neural network layers that process sequential data along one dimension. Essential for efficiently extracting features from the ordered sequence of dominant points. Quick check: Validate that convolutions capture local patterns in the polygonal sequences.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> Contour Extraction -> Dominant Point Detection -> Self-Attention Layers -> 1D Convolutional Layers -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The sequence from contour extraction through dominant point detection to the classification layers represents the critical path, as errors or inefficiencies at any stage directly impact classification performance. The fixed 50-point parameterization creates a bottleneck that affects all downstream processing.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff involves simplification versus information retention - reducing images to 50 dominant points dramatically cuts computational cost but may lose subtle features important for certain classifications. The approach favors computational efficiency over capturing fine-grained visual details, making it ideal for edge devices but potentially limiting performance on complex datasets.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor contour extraction due to low contrast or noise will propagate through the entire pipeline, resulting in inaccurate polygonal representations. The fixed 50-point constraint may inadequately represent complex shapes or over-simplify simple ones. Self-attention may fail to properly weight points if the dominant point selection misses critical features.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare classification accuracy using raw contours versus dominant point simplification to quantify information loss
2. Test different numbers of dominant points (e.g., 25, 50, 100) to find optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy
3. Evaluate performance with corrupted contour inputs to assess robustness to preprocessing errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluated primarily on simple datasets (FashionMNIST, Flavia, Folio) that may not represent real-world complexity
- Sensitive to contour extraction quality - noisy or low-contrast images could compromise accuracy
- Fixed 50 dominant points per image may not be optimal across all image types and classes

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in computational efficiency claims, given clear FLOPs comparisons and consistent results across datasets
- **Medium** confidence in classification accuracy claims, as datasets used are relatively constrained
- **Medium** confidence in edge device suitability, as testing is limited to single NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platform

## Next Checks
1. Test PolygoNet on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet subsets) to evaluate scalability and performance on diverse visual content
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of dominant points (beyond the fixed 50) to determine optimal parameterization across different image types
3. Evaluate performance across multiple edge computing platforms with varying computational capabilities to verify generalization of efficiency claims
