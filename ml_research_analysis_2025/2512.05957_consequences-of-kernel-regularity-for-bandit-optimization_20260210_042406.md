core_contribution: This paper explores the relationship between kernel regularity
  and algorithmic performance in bandit optimization of reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space (RKHS) functions. While traditional RKHS methods rely on global kernel regressors,

# Consequences of Kernel Regularity for Bandit Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05957
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05957
- Authors: Madison Lee; Tara Javidi

- Primary result: Spectral properties of isotropic kernels determine asymptotic regret bounds for both global and local bandit optimization approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a unified framework connecting kernel regularity to algorithmic performance in bandit optimization of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) functions. By characterizing the Fourier spectra of various isotropic kernels, the authors show that spectral decay rates determine information-theoretic and smoothness-based regret bounds. The work bridges global kernel methods with locally adaptive approaches, revealing that polynomial spectral decay implies Hölder space embeddings and Besov norm-equivalences. A hybrid algorithm (LP-GP-UCB) is introduced that achieves order-optimal regret across multiple kernel families by adaptively combining global Gaussian process surrogates with local polynomial estimators.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze six kernel families (Matérn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, γ-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet) by computing their Fourier spectra and deriving asymptotic regret bounds. They establish relationships between spectral decay rates and information gain (γn), embedding theorems to Hölder and Besov spaces, and implement a hybrid algorithm that switches between global GP and local polynomial estimation based on which bound is tighter. The analysis uses Mercer eigenvalue decay, fractional Sobolev embeddings, and adaptive partitioning with dual UCB constructions.

## Key Results
- Polynomial spectral decay rate (τ = β + d) determines upper bounds on maximum information gain γn, governing worst-case regret for kernelized bandit algorithms
- Polynomial spectral decay with rate τ = β + d implies RKHS embedding into Hölder spaces with smoothness α = β/2, and norm-equivalence to Besov spaces B^(β+d)/2₂,₂ when two-sided spectral bounds exist
- The hybrid LP-GP-UCB algorithm achieves order-optimal regret across multiple kernel families by adaptively leveraging whichever bound (information-based or smoothness-based) is tighter in different smoothness regimes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Polynomial spectral decay rate (τ = β + d) of a kernel's Fourier transform determines upper bounds on maximum information gain γn, which governs worst-case regret for kernelized bandit algorithms.
- Mechanism: Mercer eigenvalues λn of the kernel are bounded by the Fourier decay rate (λn+1 ≤ Cn^(-β/d)). These eigenvalues characterize L² function approximation limits in finite-dimensional RKHS subspaces. The information gain γn scales with the effective dimensionality determined by eigenvalue tail bounds.
- Core assumption: The kernel is isotropic, positive-definite, with Fourier transform satisfying ĝ(ω) ≤ C₁(1 + ||ω||²)^(-(β+d)) for β > d/2 on a bounded domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret"
  - [Section 2.2.1, Proposition 2] Explicit bounds: γn = O(n^(d/β) log^((β-d)/β)(n)) for polynomial decay; γn = O(log^(d+1)(n)) for exponential decay
  - [corpus] Related work on GP-UCB regret bounds confirms γn-dependence but lacks this unified spectral characterization across kernel families
- Break condition: If β ≤ d/2, eigenvalue bounds fail and information gain analysis does not hold. Also breaks for non-isotropic kernels where Fourier analysis doesn't apply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Polynomial spectral decay with rate τ = β + d implies RKHS embedding into Hölder spaces with smoothness α = β/2, and norm-equivalence to Besov spaces B^(β+d)/2₂,₂ when two-sided spectral bounds exist.
- Mechanism: Fourier decay bounds translate to Sobolev embeddings via fractional Sobolev space H^(β+d)/2,₂. Two-sided polynomial bounds (both upper and lower) establish norm-equivalence, enabling local continuity analysis and provable regret lower bounds via Besov space theory.
- Core assumption: For Besov equivalence, the Fourier transform must satisfy C₁(1 + ||ω||²)^(-(β+d)) ≤ ĝ(ω) ≤ C₂(1 + ||ω||²)^(-(β+d)) (two-sided bounds, not just decay).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "decay rates establish Hölder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis"
  - [Section 2.3.3, Proposition 4] Norm-equivalence proof: C₃||f||_{B^s_{2,2}} ≤ ||f||_{H_k} ≤ C₄||f||_{B^s_{2,2}} for s = (β+d)/2
  - [corpus] No directly comparable corpus papers establish this Besov equivalence for γ-exponential RKHS; this appears novel
- Break condition: Exponential or compactly-supported spectra (SE, RQ, Dirichlet) give infinite smoothness but no polynomial two-sided bounds, so Besov equivalence fails. Only polynomial-decay kernels (Matérn, γ-exponential, piecewise-polynomial) qualify.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hybrid LP-GP-UCB algorithm achieves order-optimal regret across multiple kernel families by adaptively leveraging whichever bound (information-based or smoothness-based) is tighter in different smoothness regimes.
- Mechanism: Maintains adaptive partition with UCBs as min{global GP bound, local polynomial estimator bound, initial bound}. GP posterior exploits global kernel structure; LP estimators exploit Hölder smoothness locally. The algorithm automatically switches dominance based on which error term is smaller.
- Core assumption: Assumption 1 holds (f ∈ H_k with known kernel, ||f||_k ≤ B, isotropic kernel, σ²-sub-Gaussian noise). Also requires sufficient local samples for LP estimator solvability: |D(E)_X| > (q+2)^d.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.4.1] Explicit UCB construction: U_{t,E} = min{u^(0)_E, u^(1)_{t,E}, u^(2)_{t,E}} combining GP mean/variance with LP estimates
  - [Section 2.4.2, Theorem 1] Regret bounds: R_n = Õ(n^((β+2d)/(2β+2d))) for β ≤ 2; tighter bounds available when β > 2
  - [corpus] No corpus papers analyze LP-GP-UCB specifically; related GP-UCB improvements don't use hybrid local-global structure
- Break condition: If smoothness parameter α is misspecified (q or s chosen incorrectly), LP estimator accuracy degrades. Also, computational cost grows with partition refinement—may be prohibitive compared to pure GP methods in high dimensions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Mercer's Theorem and Eigenvalue Decay**
  - Why needed here: The entire information gain analysis depends on understanding how kernel eigenvalues relate to Fourier spectra. You cannot derive γn bounds without grasping that positive-definite kernels decompose into summable eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs.
  - Quick check question: Given a kernel with Fourier transform decaying as ||ω||^(-(β+d)), what is the asymptotic rate of Mercer eigenvalue decay?

- Concept: **Hölder and Besov Spaces**
  - Why needed here: The paper maps RKHS functions to smoothness classes to apply local approximation algorithms. Without understanding that C^α contains functions with α-Hölder continuous derivatives, the embedding results are opaque.
  - Quick check question: If a function is in a Besov space B^s_{2,2}, what does the parameter s tell you about its local smoothness?

- Concept: **Maximum Information Gain (γn)**
  - Why needed here: This quantity universally appears in kernelized bandit regret bounds. You must understand it as the maximum mutual information between n noisy observations and the GP prior to interpret all regret results.
  - Quick check question: For a kernel with exponential spectral decay, how does γn scale with n? What about polynomial decay with rate β+d?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Spectral analyzer -> Information gain estimator -> Smoothness embedder -> Algorithm selector
  - Algorithm selector -> LP-GP-UCB core -> Regret bound selector

- Critical path:
  1. Characterize kernel spectrum → determine decay type (exponential/polynomial/compact)
  2. If polynomial: compute β, check two-sided bounds for Besov equivalence
  3. Derive γn bound and Hölder α from β
  4. Select algorithm: SupKernelUCB (global), UCB-Meta (local), or LP-GP-UCB (hybrid)
  5. Verify regime-specific conditions (β thresholds, dimension constraints for tight bounds)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **SupKernelUCB**: Simpler, well-analyzed, but requires β ≥ 1 (or β ≥ 2 for even dimensions) for optimal bounds
  - **UCB-Meta**: Optimal for all β > 0 via local smoothness, but ignores global kernel structure
  - **LP-GP-UCB**: Order-optimal across regimes without a priori knowledge, but computationally heavier (partition maintenance, dual estimators)
  - **Regime sensitivity**: For β > 2, hybrid's smoothness bound loosens; pure GP may dominate

- Failure signatures:
  - Regret exceeding Õ(n^((β+2d)/(2β+2d))) suggests β misspecification or partition too coarse
  - LP estimator divergence indicates |D(E)_X| ≤ (q+2)^d (insufficient local samples)
  - No improvement over random search suggests kernel misspecification (f ∉ H_k)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Spectral decay validation**: Compute empirical Fourier transform of chosen kernel; verify decay rate matches Proposition 1 (e.g., Matérn-ν should show polynomial decay with τ ≈ 2ν+d)
  2. **Regime boundary test**: Run all three algorithms (SupKernelUCB, UCB-Meta, LP-GP-UCB) on synthetic Matérn functions with ν ∈ {0.5, 1.5, 3.0}; verify regret matches Table 1 bounds
  3. **Hybrid advantage quantification**: Compare LP-GP-UCB vs. GP-only on γ-exponential RKHS with γ ∈ [1, 2]; confirm hybrid achieves Õ(n^((γ+2d)/(2γ+2d))) while GP-only may lag in low-smoothness regime

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Besov space norm-equivalence requires two-sided spectral bounds that may not hold for all kernels analyzed
- The computational complexity of LP-GP-UCB scales with partition refinement, potentially limiting practical applicability
- The tight regret bounds for β > 2 in LP-GP-UCB require careful partitioning that may be challenging to implement

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The relationship between spectral decay rates and information gain bounds (Mechanism 1) is well-established through rigorous eigenvalue analysis
- Hölder space embeddings from polynomial spectral decay (Mechanism 2) follows standard functional analysis results
- The LP-GP-UCB algorithm construction and regret analysis are mathematically sound within stated assumptions

**Medium Confidence:**

- The computational complexity of LP-GP-UCB scales with partition refinement, potentially limiting practical applicability
- The tight regret bounds for β > 2 in LP-GP-UCB require careful partitioning that may be challenging to implement

**Low Confidence:**

- The robustness of LP-GP-UCB when kernel smoothness is misspecified
- Practical performance compared to simpler heuristics in real-world optimization problems

## Next Checks
1. **Spectral Verification**: Implement numerical Fourier analysis of the six kernel families to empirically confirm the polynomial/exponential decay rates predicted by Proposition 1, particularly for the γ-exponential kernel where corpus evidence is limited.

2. **Algorithm Regime Testing**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing all three algorithms (SupKernelUCB, UCB-Meta, LP-GP-UCB) on synthetic functions across the full β parameter range, verifying that each algorithm achieves its claimed regret bounds in the appropriate regime.

3. **Computational Scalability Assessment**: Measure LP-GP-UCB's runtime and memory requirements as dimension d and sample size n increase, comparing against pure GP methods to quantify the practical cost of the hybrid approach.
