# InnoGym: Benchmarking the Innovation Potential of AI Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01822
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01822
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First benchmark to systematically evaluate AI agent innovation using dual metrics of performance gain and methodological novelty across 18 real-world tasks.

## Executive Summary
InnoGym introduces a novel benchmark framework that measures innovation potential in AI agents through two complementary dimensions: performance gain over known solutions and methodological novelty. The benchmark includes 18 curated tasks from engineering and scientific domains, standardized through rigorous validation processes. Experiments reveal that while agents can generate novel approaches, their lack of robustness prevents these innovations from translating into performance improvements, highlighting a critical gap between creativity and effectiveness in current AI systems.

## Method Summary
InnoGym formalizes innovation evaluation through a quadruple framework T = (P, S, V, D), where tasks are represented with performance measures V and dissimilarity functions D. The benchmark employs iGym, a unified execution environment supporting long-horizon evaluations, and D_AGENT, an LLM-based pipeline for extracting and comparing solution methodologies. Three agents (MLAB, CODEACT, AIDE) were evaluated across 18 tasks using DeepSeek-v3.1 as backbone, with each task allowing up to 12 hours of execution time and three runs. Innovation is quantified through performance gain G(s) = V(s) - V*_known and novelty N(s) = C(s) × min_{h∈S_known} D(s,h).

## Key Results
- Agents achieve moderate novelty scores (MLAB: 56.55, CodeAct: 54.86, AIDE: 46.67 average) but negative performance ratios (-0.45 to -0.69)
- CDML and PTTALC tasks had 0% submission success rates across all agents
- GPT-5-based agents showed 2.44 average performance ratio vs DeepSeek-v3.1's 2.40, indicating potential for improvement with better models
- 2/10 main tasks had zero valid submissions from all agents, demonstrating current limitations in handling complex problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Axis Innovation Quantification
- Claim: Innovation can be decomposed into orthogonal performance and novelty dimensions, enabling systematic comparison across heterogeneous tasks.
- Mechanism: Each task is formalized as T = (P, S, V, D), with V: S → R measuring solution quality and D: S × S → R≥0 measuring methodological dissimilarity. Performance Gain G(s) = V(s) - V*_known captures improvement over baselines, while Novelty N(s) = C(s) · min_{h∈S_known} D(s,h) captures methodological distinctness.
- Core assumption: Methodological innovation and performance improvement are separable and can be meaningfully quantified on task-specific scales.
- Evidence anchors: Formal definitions in section 2.2, abstract statement on dual metrics, contrast with existing benchmarks focusing solely on correctness.
- Break condition: If V cannot be reliably computed or D fails to capture meaningful methodological differences, the framework degrades to single-metric evaluation.

### Mechanism 2: Agent-as-Judge Distance Function for Novelty
- Claim: An LLM-based agent can systematically extract and compare solution methodologies, producing novelty scores that align with human expert judgments.
- Mechanism: D_AGENT operates in two stages: extraction prompts distill solutions into standardized artifacts, then comparison prompts score methodological distance across six dimensions, aggregated to [0,100].
- Core assumption: The extraction-comparison pipeline captures methodologically relevant differences and filters cosmetic variations.
- Evidence anchors: EquiBench validation showing distinct scores for algorithmic vs superficial variants, 100% triplet agreement with domain experts.
- Break condition: If extraction fails to generalize across code styles or comparison produces inconsistent scores, novelty evaluation becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3: Robustness as Primary Innovation Bottleneck
- Claim: Current agents can generate novel approaches but lack the robustness to translate them into performance gains, revealing a creativity-effectiveness gap.
- Mechanism: Experiments show agents achieve moderate novelty scores but negative performance ratios, with novel methods requiring correct implementation, proper tool use, and long-horizon debugging where agents fail.
- Core assumption: The bottleneck is implementation robustness rather than idea generation capacity.
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2 findings on the robustness gap, table 2 showing negative performance gains despite novelty, consistent with other benchmark findings.
- Break condition: If base model capabilities improve substantially, the bottleneck may shift from robustness to exploration strategy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Task Formalization as Constraint Optimization**
  - Why needed here: Understanding T = (P, S, V, D) is essential for designing new benchmark tasks or interpreting results. The separation of feasibility C(s) from quality R(s) determines whether solutions are even evaluated.
  - Quick check question: Given a task where solutions must run in <1 second, which component (C or R) encodes this constraint?

- Concept: **Innovation Taxonomy (Solved/Improvable/Exploratory)**
  - Why needed here: InnoGym focuses on Improvable Tasks where S_known ≠ ∅ but V(s) < V* for all known solutions. This distinguishes it from benchmarks with known optima or open-ended exploration.
  - Quick check question: If a new solution achieves V(s) = V* with high N(s), is this breakthrough innovation or conceptual innovation?

- Concept: **Agent-as-Judge Evaluation Pipelines**
  - Why needed here: D_AGENT requires understanding prompt engineering for extraction/comparison and validation against human judgments. Without this, novelty scores may be arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Why does the pipeline use minimum distance (min_{h∈S_known}) rather than average distance for novelty scoring?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - iBench: 18 curated tasks with P_visible (descriptions, dev data), P_hidden (eval data, S_known, leaderboards), validators C, evaluators R
  - iGym: Unified execution environment with asynchronous Tool Dispatcher, recovery/checkpointing, and concurrent tool support
  - D_AGENT Pipeline: Extraction (Codex → summary.md + pseudocode.tex) → Comparison (GPT-5 → 6-dimension scores → aggregate to [0,100])
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Agent produces submission → Validator checks C(s) → Evaluator computes R(s) → Novelty pipeline computes N(s)

- Critical path:
  1. Agent receives P_visible + C, executes within iGym (up to 12 hours wall-clock)
  2. Submission passes validator C(s) = 1, else rejected
  3. Evaluator R computes performance score, yielding G(s) = V(s) - V*_known
  4. D_AGENT extracts methodology, computes N(s) = min distance to S_known
  5. Final output: (G(s), N(s)) pair positioning solution in innovation space

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Task selection: Only Improvable Tasks included (excludes Solved with known optima, Exploratory without baselines)—balances measurable progress with open-ended challenge
  - Novelty via LLM: D_AGENT enables scalable comparison but requires validation; deterministic validators ensure reproducibility
  - Long-horizon execution: 12-hour budget captures iterative refinement but increases computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - High N(s), low/zero V(s): Agent explores novel approaches but fails implementation
  - All "/" entries for a task: Agent cannot produce valid submissions (environment setup, tool use, or problem complexity)
  - Low N(s), moderate V(s): Agent converges to known baselines without exploration

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run MLAB, CodeAct, AIDE on a single task (e.g., CirclePacking) with identical backbone model to isolate scaffold effects on (G, N).
  2. Temperature sweep: Vary sampling temperature (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) to observe exploration-exploitation tradeoff on novelty vs. performance (replicate Figure 6c).
  3. D_AGENT validation: Construct triplet tests on a new domain to verify human alignment before trusting novelty scores for that task type.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can AI agents be designed to achieve both high novelty and high robustness, rather than trading one for the other?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement on the novelty-robustness gap as a key bottleneck in current agents.
- Why unresolved: Current frameworks exhibit a trade-off where encouraging novelty decreases performance gain.
- What evidence would resolve it: An agent architecture that consistently scores highly on both performance gain (G) and novelty (N) metrics across multiple InnoGym tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the innovation evaluation framework be extended to Solved Problems and Exploratory Problems while maintaining reliable evaluation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit exclusion of solved and exploratory problems narrows the scope of applicability.
- Why unresolved: Solved problems have fixed performance ceilings, while exploratory problems lack human baselines or reliable validation mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A principled extension of the (P, S, V, D) framework that provides meaningful innovation metrics for tasks in these two excluded categories.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the Agent-as-judge novelty metric (D_AGENT) generalize reliably across domains with different solution representations?
- Basis in paper: Validation conducted on limited datasets (8 EquiBench triplets, 3 domain triplets).
- Why unresolved: Small sample size limits confidence in cross-domain generalization; differences were not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale validation of D_AGENT across all 18 InnoGym tasks with diverse solution types, showing consistent correlation with human expert judgments.

## Limitations

- Focus on "Improvable Tasks" excludes domains where innovation manifests differently than performance improvement
- Agent-as-judge novelty metric requires further testing across diverse domains to ensure consistent human alignment
- Current agents demonstrate a trade-off between novelty generation and implementation robustness, limiting practical innovation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Dual-axis innovation quantification framework - supported by clear mathematical definitions and task specifications
- **Medium Confidence**: D_AGENT's ability to capture methodological differences - validated on limited datasets but needs broader testing
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness as the primary innovation bottleneck - experimental evidence shows consistent patterns, but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain D_AGENT Validation**: Apply D_AGENT to three new domains with human expert ground truth to verify triplet agreement rates remain above 80%
2. **Alternative Innovation Metrics**: Implement a third-party novelty metric (e.g., edit distance on pseudocode) on 5 InnoGym tasks to test robustness of conclusions to metric choice
3. **Long-Horizon Analysis**: Track agent submissions across multiple attempts on the same task to determine if novelty emerges from exploration or is an artifact of random initialization
