# Attribution Projection Calculus: A Novel Framework for Causal Inference in Bayesian Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12094
- Authors: M Ruhul Amin
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus) for causal inference in structured Bayesian networks, proving optimality over alternatives including Pearl's framework

## Executive Summary
Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus) presents a novel framework for causal inference in machine learning models, specifically addressing the challenge of determining true causal relationships in structured Bayesian networks. The framework introduces a specific three-layer architecture with source nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. By formally defining deconfounders and confounders among intermediate nodes, AP-Calculus provides mathematical foundations for feature attribution, spurious correlation suppression, fairness analysis, and uncertainty quantification, extending and in many cases subsuming traditional do-calculus approaches.

## Method Summary
AP-Calculus proposes a three-layer Bayesian network architecture where source nodes connect to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, with each input mapping to exactly one label with maximum marginal probability. The framework identifies deconfounders (exactly one per label) and confounders among intermediate nodes, using joint factorization P(S)∏_j P(X_j|S)P(D|X). Key algorithms include attribution score computation using Monte Carlo sampling and reparameterization tricks, separation function learning, and spurious correlation suppression through regularization. The method computes attribution scores A(S_i, l) = E_{X_l}[∂P(D_l=1|X_l,S)/∂S_i] to quantify feature importance for causal inference.

## Key Results
- Theoretical proofs demonstrate the proposed architecture's optimality for causal inference compared to alternatives including Pearl's framework
- Framework provides mathematical foundations for feature attribution, spurious correlation suppression, fairness analysis, and uncertainty quantification
- AP-Calculus extends and in many cases can subsume traditional do-calculus, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised learning contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by enforcing a specific network architecture that naturally separates causal from non-causal influences through the deconfounder/confounder distinction. By requiring each input to map to exactly one label with maximum marginal probability, the framework creates a direct causal pathway that can be mathematically characterized. The intermediate nodes act as mediators that either isolate true causal relationships (deconfounders) or introduce spurious correlations (confounders), allowing for systematic identification and suppression of non-causal influences through the mathematical framework.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Network Factorization**: Essential for decomposing joint probability distributions into manageable components; quick check: verify that P(S,X,D) = P(S)∏_j P(X_j|S)P(D|X) holds for your implementation.
- **Deconfounder Property**: The concept that certain intermediate nodes isolate true causal relationships; quick check: ensure exactly one intermediate node per label satisfies the deconfounder criteria.
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Required for computing expectations over intermediate node distributions; quick check: monitor variance of estimates as K (number of samples) increases.
- **Reparameterization Trick**: Enables gradient computation through stochastic nodes; quick check: verify gradients flow correctly through sampling operations.
- **Attribution Score Computation**: The core mechanism for quantifying feature importance; quick check: ensure ∂P(D_l=1|X_l,S)/∂S_i gradients are correctly computed and normalized.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Source S -> Intermediate {X_1,...,X_m} -> Destination D

Critical path: S → X_l → D (where X_l is the deconfounder for label l)

Design tradeoffs: The three-layer architecture enforces structural constraints that simplify causal inference but may limit expressiveness compared to deeper networks. The requirement for exactly one deconfounder per label provides mathematical guarantees but may be restrictive for complex multi-label problems.

Failure signatures:
- Intermediate nodes become identical (violates separation optimality)
- Attribution scores collapse to zero (gradient vanishing)
- High variance in Monte Carlo estimates (numerical instability)

First experiments:
1. Implement the basic three-layer architecture with small synthetic dataset (n=5, m=3) to verify gradient flow
2. Test attribution score computation on a simple linear case where ground truth is known
3. Validate deconfounder identification by perturbing intermediate nodes and observing effects on label predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on specific three-layer architecture may limit expressiveness and applicability to complex real-world problems
- Absence of empirical validation on benchmark datasets prevents assessment of practical utility
- Theoretical optimality is proven only within the constrained setting, not across all possible network architectures

## Confidence

Theoretical Contributions: Medium confidence - mathematical framework is rigorous but practical implications unproven
Practical Applicability: Low confidence - lacks benchmark datasets and comparative experiments
Methodological Innovation: Medium confidence - novel concepts introduced but utility requires demonstration

## Next Checks
1. Implement the framework on IHDP or Jobs causal inference benchmark and compare attribution accuracy against SHAP
2. Test sensitivity to deconfounder property enforcement by systematically relaxing constraints and measuring causal inference quality degradation
3. Evaluate scalability on CIFAR-10 by measuring computational efficiency and attribution stability as dimensionality increases
