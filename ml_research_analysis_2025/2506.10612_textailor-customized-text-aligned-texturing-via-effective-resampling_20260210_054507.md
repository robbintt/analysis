# TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.10612
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: TexTailor achieves LPIPS of 37.889 and FID of 29.998 on Objaverse, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in view-consistency and texture quality

## Executive Summary
TexTailor is a novel method for generating consistent 3D object textures from textual descriptions that addresses the gradual texture degradation problem in existing depth-aware diffusion approaches. The method employs a resampling scheme within the DDIM non-Markovian diffusion process to repeatedly integrate previously synthesized textures, fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model using a small set of resampled images with performance preservation loss to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and adaptively refines camera positions based on mesh geometry to ensure consistent texture synthesis. Experiments on Objaverse and ShapeNet datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
TexTailor generates consistent 3D textures by processing viewpoints in sequence, starting from an initial view and progressively filling in unknown regions. At each step, it uses a depth-aware diffusion model conditioned on the text prompt and partial texture, enhanced with a resampling scheme that repeatedly harmonizes known and unknown regions within the DDIM process. The method fine-tunes the ControlNet component on 5 resampled images from nearby viewpoints using a performance preservation loss to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Camera positions are adaptively refined based on the ratio of visible to new pixels to ensure sufficient overlap between views.

## Key Results
- Achieves LPIPS of 37.889 and FID of 29.998 on Objaverse dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both view-consistency and texture quality
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of resampling scheme, fine-tuning with preservation loss, and adaptive viewpoint refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Repeated integration of previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process improves view-consistency between adjacent viewpoints.
- Mechanism: Extends resampling scheme to DDIM non-Markovian process, adding noise and denoising merged samples multiple times (R=3) at each timestep to harmonize known and unknown regions.
- Core assumption: Known region from previous viewpoints contains reliable texture information that should be strongly propagated during inpainting.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions resampling within diffusion process; Section 3.1 details the method; Figure 7 ablation shows better texture preservation; related works use geometric priors but not this DDIM-based resampling.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning depth-aware diffusion model on small resampled images with performance preservation loss mitigates gradual texture shift across viewpoints.
- Mechanism: Fine-tunes ControlNet using 5 resampled images from nearby viewpoints, adding performance preservation loss (L_pre) that minimizes difference between fine-tuned and original pre-trained network's noise predictions.
- Core assumption: Texture properties near initial viewpoint are desirable and should propagate to all views; pre-trained model's capability should not degrade.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions fine-tuning with preservation loss; Section 3.2 explains the approach; Table 2 ablation shows L_pre effectiveness; related works like LoRA mention efficient adaptation but not this specific regularization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adaptively refining camera positions based on mesh geometry ensures sufficient overlap of keep regions, improving texture consistency.
- Mechanism: Calculates ratio of keep to new pixels for candidate viewpoint; if below threshold β=0.5, interpolates intermediate viewpoint to ensure sufficient known texture for generation.
- Core assumption: High ratio of visible previously textured pixels is necessary for inpainting model to generate consistent new textures.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions adaptive refinement based on mesh geometry; Section 3.3 describes the ratio-based selection; Figure 7(c) shows misalignment without refinement; related works acknowledge geometric awareness.

## Foundational Learning

- **DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models)**
  - Why needed: Resampling mechanism is implemented within DDIM non-Markovian process for deterministic sampling and efficient texture harmonization.
  - Quick check: How does DDIM's deterministic, non-Markovian nature enable the specific resampling scheme used in TexTailor?

- **ControlNet**
  - Why needed: TexTailor fine-tunes ControlNet (not main diffusion model) to condition texture synthesis on depth maps while preserving original model's capabilities via specialized loss.
  - Quick check: Why is ControlNet specifically chosen for fine-tuning, and what information does it add to the diffusion process?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed: Core problem addressed is that fine-tuning on small dataset degrades original model's quality; performance preservation loss is proposed solution.
  - Quick check: What is catastrophic forgetting in neural network fine-tuning, and how does L_pre mathematically prevent it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 
  1. Depth-Aware Diffusion Model (Stable Diffusion + frozen ControlNet) -> 2. Resampling Module (R=3 iterations within DDIM) -> 3. Fine-Tuning Engine (ControlNet with L_Fine + λ×L_Pre) -> 4. Adaptive View Planner (ratio-based viewpoint refinement)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Generate viewpoint sequence using Adaptive View Planner based on mesh geometry
  2. From first viewpoint, generate initial texture using diffusion model and resampling module
  3. For each subsequent viewpoint: render mesh with current texture, segment into keep/new/update/ignore regions, use Resampling Module with depth-aware diffusion model to generate harmonized partial texture, project back to 3D mesh
  4. Output fully textured 3D mesh

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Resampling steps (R): More steps improve harmonization but increase sampling time; paper uses R=3
  - Fine-tuning set size: 5 images avoids large datasets but risks overfitting; preservation loss critical here
  - View refinement threshold (β): Lower threshold may cause inconsistencies; higher threshold increases processing time; paper sets β=0.5

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Repetitive patterns appearing inappropriately across object (overfitting during fine-tuning)
  - Texture drift in color or style across distant viewpoints (insufficient fine-tuning or resampling)
  - Visible seams or misalignment (failure in adaptive view refinement or resampling harmonization)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Implement TexTailor without resampling, fine-tuning, or adaptive views; measure LPIPS and FID
  2. Ablation study: Test full pipeline removing one component at a time; compare visual output and metrics
  3. Parameter sensitivity analysis: Vary R, λ, and β; measure impact on texture consistency (LPIPS) and quality (FID)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on small set of 5 resampled images for fine-tuning introduces overfitting risk and poor generalization to diverse object categories
- Performance preservation loss effectiveness depends on implementation details and hyperparameters not specified in paper
- Method may add excessive number of viewpoints for complex geometries, increasing processing time

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Resampling scheme within DDIM is well-supported by equations and ablation results showing improved texture preservation
- **Medium confidence**: Adaptive viewpoint refinement is logically sound but β=0.5 threshold may require tuning for different mesh complexities
- **Medium confidence**: Fine-tuning approach addresses real problem but effectiveness of 5 images is uncertain without diverse category testing

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Fine-tuning Set Size**: Test model with different numbers of resampled images (1, 3, 5, 10) to quantify trade-off between adaptation quality and overfitting risk

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Evaluate TexTailor on held-out Objaverse test set or different dataset (e.g., ShapeNet chairs if trained on cars) to assess generalization beyond training distribution

3. **Performance Preservation Loss Analysis**: Train variant without L_pre (λ=0) and measure degradation in FID and texture quality to confirm loss effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting
