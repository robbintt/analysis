- Demonstrates LLM-driven linguistic discovery for extinct contact languages using Russenorsk

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how modern large language models can aid in studying extinct or low-resource languages, using Russenorsk—a 19th-century Russian-Norwegian pidgin—as a case study. The authors construct the first structured, open-source dictionary of Russenorsk and develop a linguistic discovery assistant that generates hypotheses about the language's grammar, morphology, and lexicon. By evaluating these hypotheses against established linguistic literature and conducting ablation studies, they demonstrate that LLMs can infer linguistically plausible properties from structured lexical data. The paper also presents a pipeline for "reconstructive" translation into hypothetical historical Russenorsk, achieving measurable but limited performance. While results are exploratory, the study illustrates the potential of LLM-driven methods for linguistic research and language preservation, particularly for endangered or poorly documented contact languages.

## Method Summary
The authors manually construct a structured dictionary of Russenorsk from Wiktionary and digitized sources, then use it to build a linguistic discovery assistant via a three-step agentic pipeline with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1: (1) etymology hypotheses, (2) phonetics/morphology rules, and (3) grammar/syntax inference. They conduct ablation studies comparing full dictionary, empty dictionary, and fictitious pidgin conditions to isolate data-driven inference from memorization. For translation reconstruction, they sequentially integrate dictionary, example sentences, and induced rules into a translation pipeline, evaluating output quality with chrF (character F-score) against a 35-sentence benchmark. Prompts and data are released for reproducibility.

## Key Results
- LLMs generate linguistically plausible hypotheses about Russenorsk's structure when provided with structured lexical data.
- Ablation studies show that many grammatical and morphological properties require the dictionary, while some reflect pre-training knowledge.
- chrF scores for translation reconstruction reach up to 67.7 (full prompt) but drop significantly when examples or rules are removed, indicating reliance on both memorization and generalization.
- Model outputs align with linguistic literature in most cases, though some rare or contested features are missed.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can generate linguistically plausible hypotheses about low-resource languages when provided with structured lexical data.
- Mechanism: The model receives a curated dictionary with etymological annotations, then prompted separately for (1) lexicon origins, (2) phonetic/morphological patterns, and (3) grammatical rules. The model generalizes from these examples to propose domain-specific linguistic principles.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-training includes sufficient metalinguistic knowledge about pidgin formation processes to recognize patterns in the provided data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We construct a structured dictionary... subsequently, we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of word formation and grammatical structure."
  - [Section 5] Table 1 shows Sonnet and o1 correctly identified 21/23 properties when given the dictionary, versus 5-6 properties without it.
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers relate to pidgin (Nigerian Pidgin depression screening) but not methodological transfer.
- Break condition: If the target language has fewer than ~50 documented lexical items, or if entries lack etymological annotations, hypothesis quality degrades substantially.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ablation against empty-dictionary and fictitious-language controls isolates dictionary-derived inference from memorization.
- Mechanism: Three conditions—full dictionary, empty dictionary (Russenorsk named), and fictitious pidgin (unnamed)—reveal which hypotheses require the lexical resource versus pre-existing knowledge. Properties appearing only in the full-dictionary condition are attributed to data-driven inference.
- Core assumption: The model does not have extensive Russenorsk-specific knowledge memorized from pre-training beyond generic pidgin properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.2] "By comparing the model's proposals in these ablation settings with those generated under full-information conditions, we can isolate the role of the dictionary."
  - [Section 5] "Minimal Inflectional Morphology" appears even with empty dictionary (pre-training knowledge), while "Universal Preposition [på]" requires full dictionary.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this ablation methodology.
- Break condition: If the language was well-represented in pre-training data, ablation cannot distinguish memorization from inference.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Layered resource integration (dictionary + examples + rules) improves translation into extinct languages, but with diminishing returns and leakage risk.
- Mechanism: The translation pipeline sequentially provides (1) dictionary, (2) example sentences, and (3) induced rules. Ablation shows each layer adds signal, but examples may be copied rather than generalized.
- Core assumption: Character-level metrics (chrF) provide meaningful quality signals for morphologically complex, low-resource languages where token-level metrics fail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 6.2.1] Full prompt achieves chrF 67.7 for ru→rn; removing examples drops to 29.2; rules-only yields 22.4; baseline is 17.8.
  - [Section 6.2.1] "The dramatic gap... indicates that the model often copies or lightly paraphrases example sentences when available."
  - [corpus] No corpus validation of this translation-reconstruction approach.
- Break condition: If no parallel sentences exist for the target language, the example-copying pathway is unavailable and quality drops to rule-composition levels (~22 chrF).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Pidgin/contact language structure**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that pidgins exhibit simplified morphology, flexible word order, and lexical blending from multiple source languages is essential to evaluate whether model hypotheses are linguistically plausible.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the universal preposition [på] in Russenorsk likely merged Norwegian [på] and Russian [po]?

- Concept: **Ablation study design**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core validation relies on comparing full-dictionary outputs against empty-dictionary and fictitious-language controls to attribute hypotheses to data versus pre-training.
  - Quick check question: If a model generates correct hypotheses even in the fictitious-language condition, what does that imply about those hypotheses?

- Concept: **chrF metric for low-resource languages**
  - Why needed here: BLEU fails for inflectional languages with orthographic variation; chrF operates at character level and better correlates with human judgment under these conditions.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use chrF instead of BLEU for evaluating Russenorsk translations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Dictionary constructor**: Extracts lemmas from Wiktionary and digitized sources → clusters by morphology → groups semantically → manual review loop.
  2. **Discovery agent**: Three-stage prompting (lexicon origins → phonetics/morphology → grammar/syntax) with ablation variants.
  3. **Translation reconstructor**: Integrates dictionary + example sentences + induced rules → generates target-language output with chrF evaluation.

- Critical path: Dictionary quality → hypothesis generation → human verification against literature → rule extraction → translation pipeline. The manual review stage is non-negotiable; "hallucinated" entries were removed over several days.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dictionary comprehensiveness vs. noise: More sources increase coverage but require more manual cleaning.
  - Example inclusion vs. leakage: Providing examples boosts chrF from ~22 to ~68, but risks copying rather than composition.
  - Single vs. multi-model ensemble: Union of Sonnet and o1 outputs provides broader coverage than either alone.

- Failure signatures:
  - Model proposes SVO preference when literature suggests SOV (word order is contested; both occur).
  - Model misses self-glossing patterns and single-origin synonyms (rare phenomena not obvious from dictionary alone).
  - Translation quality collapses to near-baseline (~20 chrF) without dictionary, confirming the lexicon is essential.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the ablation study: Run discovery agent with full dictionary, empty dictionary, and fictitious pidgin conditions on a held-out subset of 100 dictionary entries to verify Table 1 patterns.
  2. Test transfer to another low-resource pidgin: Apply the same pipeline to a different documented pidgin (e.g., Chinook Jargon) with available lexical data to assess generalizability.
  3. Human evaluation of translations: Have a linguist rate 20 reconstructed Russenorsk sentences for grammatical plausibility to validate chrF correlation with human judgment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dictionary quality and coverage are limited by the availability of historical sources and subjective manual filtering, making reproducibility uncertain.
- Translation reconstruction reliability is questionable, as chrF scores may overstate linguistic accuracy without gold-standard validation or human evaluation.
- Generalizability to other extinct languages is unproven, as results are based on a single case study and may not transfer to languages with different linguistic profiles.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core finding that structured lexical data improves LLM-generated linguistic hypotheses is well-supported by the ablation study and aligns with linguistic literature.
- **Medium confidence**: chrF-based translation quality is interpretable but may overstate actual linguistic accuracy; human evaluation would be needed for definitive validation.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the model's ability to infer rare or contested linguistic features (e.g., self-glossing, word order) are not strongly supported, as these are missed or inconsistently predicted.

## Next Checks
1. **Human evaluation of translations**: Have a linguist rate 20 reconstructed Russenorsk sentences for grammatical plausibility and historical authenticity to validate chrF correlation with expert judgment.
2. **Replication on another pidgin**: Apply the full pipeline to a different documented pidgin (e.g., Chinook Jargon) with available lexical data to assess generalizability and robustness of the discovery agent.
3. **Extended ablation study**: Run discovery agent on a held-out subset of 100 dictionary entries under full, empty, and fictitious conditions to confirm that Table 1 patterns hold and that hypothesis quality degrades as expected without lexical input.
