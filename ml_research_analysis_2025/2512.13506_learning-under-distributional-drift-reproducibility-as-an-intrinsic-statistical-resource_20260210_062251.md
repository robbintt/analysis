# Learning under Distributional Drift: Reproducibility as an Intrinsic Statistical Resource

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13506
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13506
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Key outcome:** Introduces reproducibility budget CT, a geometric measure of total Fisher-Rao path length under distributional drift, with generalization bound scaling as O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T) proven minimax-optimal.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the reproducibility budget CT, a geometric measure of the total Fisher-Rao path length traversed by a learning system under distributional drift. CT quantifies how much statistical reproducibility is consumed when a learner's actions alter the data-generating distribution. The authors derive a generalization bound scaling as O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T) and prove a matching lower bound, establishing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Classical learning regimes (i.i.d., exogenous drift, performative equilibrium, adaptive analysis) emerge as limiting cases when specific drift components vanish. Experiments validate the additive budget structure and confirm that metric alignment (e.g., natural gradient) reduces reproducibility consumption.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a reproducibility budget CT as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution. The authors decompose total distributional motion into exogenous drift (environment-driven) and endogenous drift (learner action-driven), both measured in the Fisher metric. They derive generalization bounds by coupling risk Lipschitz continuity with martingale concentration, establishing that error scales as O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T). The framework is validated through three experiments: linear-Gaussian drift with exact Fisher computation, nonlinear teacher-learner with MLP, and comparison of Euclidean vs natural gradient methods under matched per-step loss reduction.

## Key Results
- Generalization error under drift is governed by CT, yielding a bound of order O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T)
- A matching lower bound establishes this rate is minimax-optimal - no algorithm can improve it in the worst case
- Classical learning regimes (i.i.d., exogenous drift, performative equilibrium, adaptive analysis) emerge as limiting cases when specific drift components vanish
- Natural gradient methods consume significantly less reproducibility budget per unit improvement than Euclidean gradient methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fisher-Rao Arc Length Captures Intrinsic Distributional Motion
The Fisher-Rao metric defines an intrinsic Riemannian structure on the statistical manifold, making it uniquely suited to measure distributional motion because it is coordinate-invariant and connects directly to local KL divergence. For parametric families, the metric is g_θ(v,w) = E_θ[⟨∇_θ log p_θ, v⟩⟨∇_θ log p_θ, w⟩], and infinitesimal distributional motion is measured consistently regardless of parameterization.

### Mechanism 2: Drift Decomposition Separates Exogenous and Policy-Induced Motion
Total distributional motion decomposes additively into exogenous drift d_t (environment-driven) and endogenous drift κ^(M)_t (learner action-driven), both measured in the same Fisher metric. The environment update admits a first-order expansion where the first term captures motion when control u_t = 0 (exogenous), and the second captures control-induced motion.

### Mechanism 3: Reproducibility Budget Bounds Generalization via Risk-Lipschitz Coupling
Generalization error scales as O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T) because the trajectory-averaged generalization gap decomposes into a martingale sampling term bounded by O(T^(-1/2)) and cumulative population risk drift bounded by L_p · CT/T via Lemma 11. The lower bound constructs short geodesic excursions that exhaust CT while keeping KL small, applying Fano's inequality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fisher-Rao Metric and Information Geometry**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework measures drift using Fisher-Rao arc length; understanding why this metric is canonical (invariant, local KL connection) is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** For a parametric family p_θ, what is the Fisher information matrix and why does it define an intrinsic Riemannian metric?

- **Concept: Sub-Gaussian Martingale Concentration**
  - **Why needed here:** The T^(-1/2) sampling term relies on Azuma-Hoeffding-type bounds for martingale difference sequences under conditional sub-Gaussianity.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a martingale difference sequence Z_t with conditional variance proxy σ^2, what is E|T^(-1) Σ_t Z_t|?

- **Concept: Riemannian Geodesics and Normal Coordinates**
  - **Why needed here:** Local equivalence between Fisher norm and geodesic distance (Lemma 4), and the lower-bound construction using geodesic excursions, require basic Riemannian geometry intuition.
  - **Quick check question:** In normal coordinates centered at θ, how does the metric tensor g_ij(x) behave near the origin?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment dynamics module -> Learner policy module -> Fisher geometry module -> Risk tracker -> Budget monitor
- **Critical path:** Initialize θ_0, f_0, and empty filtration F_0. For each t: sample (x_t, y_t) ~ p_θ_t, compute u_t via policy, update θ_{t+1} = F(θ_t, u_t, η_t), update learner f_{t+1}. At each step, compute drift components (d_t, κ^(M)_t) using Fisher geometry. Accumulate CT and monitor generalization gap.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Exact vs approximate Fisher (computational cost vs accuracy), population risk estimation (clean data requirement vs practical feasibility), policy complexity (adaptivity vs drift control).
- **Failure signatures:** Budget exhaustion without convergence (unnecessary motion), empirical gap grows despite stable training (shift outpacing learning), Fisher matrix singularity (trajectory exited regular region).
- **First 3 experiments:** (1) Linear-Gaussian sanity check with exact Fisher metric computation and drift component validation, (2) Budget ablation varying exogenous drift and feedback gain independently to verify additive structure, (3) Metric alignment test comparing Euclidean vs natural gradient under matched per-step loss reduction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can statistically principled estimators for the instantaneous drift components (d_t, κ_t^(M)) and the cumulative reproducibility budget (CT) be constructed from observed trajectory data without assuming explicit knowledge of the environment transition dynamics F?
- **Open Question 2:** Does the reproducibility budget framework extend to model-free reinforcement learning settings where distributional evolution is non-smooth, discontinuous, or only partially observed?
- **Open Question 3:** Can the minimax lower bound be tightened for environments exhibiting specific structures (e.g., contracting dynamics or periodic drift) rather than the adversarial, stylized construction used in the current proofs?

## Limitations
- The Fisher-Rao metric-based path length assumes a regular parametric model family and bounded trajectory within a regularity region, which may not hold in practice
- The lower-bound construction assumes adversary control over dynamics, which is stylized and may over-pessimize error rates
- Population risk estimation requires auxiliary clean data or closed-form solutions, which may not be available in practical settings

## Confidence
- **High:** The additive structure of the generalization bound (T^(-1/2) + CT/T) and its minimax-optimality are well-supported by theoretical derivation and the matching lower bound.
- **Medium:** The interpretation of Fisher-Rao path length as a geometric measure of distributional motion is theoretically sound but relies on model regularity assumptions that may be violated in practice.
- **Low:** The empirical validation of the budget framework in nonlinear settings (MLP experiment) has significant unknowns regarding architecture details and Fisher metric implementation that could affect reproducibility.

## Next Checks
1. **R² Validation:** For the budget ablation experiment, verify that the regression fit achieves R² ≈ 0.97, confirming the additive structure. If R² is substantially lower, investigate whether the Fisher metric computation or drift decomposition implementation is flawed.
2. **Natural Gradient Efficiency:** Confirm that natural gradient achieves approximately 4× reduction in cumulative Fisher path length compared to Euclidean gradient when both methods achieve identical per-step loss reduction. If no significant difference is observed, verify that the metric is not identity (trivial case) and that step-size matching is correctly implemented.
3. **Lower Bound Sensitivity:** Test the robustness of the lower-bound construction by varying the trajectory length, geodesic excursion amplitude, and model family. Confirm that the minimax rate O(T^(-1/2) + CT/T) persists across different parameter regimes and that the Fano-based argument scales appropriately with the distributional motion budget CT.
