# Integrating AI Planning Semantics into SysML System Models for Automated PDDL File Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.06714
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06714
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SysML profile with PDDL semantics enables automated generation of PDDL domain/problem files from system models, demonstrated on aircraft manufacturing robotic system.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a SysML profile that integrates Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) semantics directly into system models. Reusable stereotypes for PDDL constructs—types, predicates, functions, and actions—are defined and constrained with OCL to ensure syntactic consistency. The profile enables automated generation of PDDL domain and problem descriptions from enriched SysML models. A case study in aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the approach using a robotic collar-screwing system. The profile was applied to model planning logic, enabling automatic generation of PDDL descriptions and optimization of execution plans using a PDDL solver, thereby supporting model-based integration of AI planning in engineering design.

## Method Summary
The approach applies a SysML profile containing PDDL stereotypes to enrich system models with planning semantics. Stereotypes like `<<PDDL_Action>>`, `<<PDDL_Type>>`, `<<PDDL_Predicate>>`, and `<<PDDL_Function>>` are applied to SysML elements (e.g., CallBehaviorAction, Class). OCL constraints validate model consistency at design time. An automated transformation algorithm (using VTL templates via Magic Systems of Systems Architect Report Wizard) generates PDDL domain and problem files from the enriched model. The generated PDDL is then solved using a PDDL solver (Delfi) to produce optimized execution plans. A case study demonstrates the approach on a robotic collar-screwing system in aircraft manufacturing.

## Key Results
- Automated generation of valid PDDL domain and problem files from enriched SysML models
- Optimization of execution plans using PDDL solver (Delfi) for robotic collar-screwing system
- Successful demonstration of model-based integration of AI planning semantics into engineering design
- Reusable stereotypes enable consistent planning logic across system configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stereotype-Based Semantic Mapping
- If PDDL semantics are mapped to SysML metaclasses via stereotypes, the system model can function as a single source of truth for both architecture and planning logic.
- The profile defines stereotypes (e.g., `<<PDDL_Action>>`, `<<PDDL_Type>>`) that extend base SysML elements (e.g., `CallBehaviorAction`, `Class`). This injects planning-specific metadata (preconditions, effects) directly into structural and behavioral diagrams.
- Core assumption: The underlying SysML activity diagram accurately represents the operational flow and constraints of the physical system.
- Evidence: [Section IV] "Each PDDL construct is represented as a stereotype in the profile. These stereotypes extend existing UML/SysML metaclasses..."; [Table I] Shows explicit mapping of PDDL Concepts to UML/SysML Metaclasses.

### Mechanism 2: OCL-Driven Syntactic Guardrails
- If formal constraints are applied at the modeling level, syntax errors can be shifted from the PDDL compilation phase to the design phase.
- Object Constraint Language (OCL) rules are embedded in the profile to validate model integrity in real-time (e.g., ensuring unique type names or valid identifier strings) before file generation occurs.
- Core assumption: The OCL constraints correctly reflect the BNF specification of the target PDDL version (3.1).
- Evidence: [Abstract] "...formal OCL constraints ensure syntactic consistency."; [Section IV, Listing 3 & 4] Demonstrates specific OCL constraints for `ValidateDomainName` and `UniqueTypeNames`.

### Mechanism 3: Template-Based Model Transformation
- Automated generation reduces manual transcription errors compared to hand-coding PDDL files.
- A transformation algorithm queries the enriched model for elements bearing PDDL stereotypes and maps them into text templates (specifically Velocity Template Language) to produce the final domain and problem files.
- Core assumption: The modeling tool exposes the necessary API or query interface to extract the derived properties and tagged values.
- Evidence: [Section V] "...algorithm described in [31] was used. This approach leverages the Report Wizard functionality... utilizing the Velocity engine..."; [Section V, Listing 5] Shows the resulting PDDL code generated from the model excerpt.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: SysML Profile Mechanism**
  - Why needed here: To understand how to extend standard SysML without breaking tool compatibility. You must grasp that a "Stereotype" is not just a label, but a metadata container that adds domain-specific properties (like "preconditions") to standard elements (like "Activities").
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a SysML `Class` and a `<<PDDL_Type>>` stereotyped class in terms of generated output?

- **Concept: PDDL Domain vs. Problem Separation**
  - Why needed here: The architecture relies on defining reusable "Domains" (logic) separately from "Problems" (instances/goals). You need to know that the system model usually defines the Domain, while product data imports define the Problem.
  - Quick check question: In this architecture, does the `<<PDDL_Domain>>` stereotype apply to the file containing the robot's movement logic, or the file listing the specific rivet coordinates?

- **Concept: Object Constraint Language (OCL)**
  - Why needed here: To customize or debug the profile. The paper uses OCL to enforce rules (e.g., "names must be alphanumeric"). Without OCL, the modeler could create structural invalidities that only crash the solver later.
  - Quick check question: If you wanted to ensure every `<<PDDL_Action>>` has at least one effect, where would you write that rule?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Source: SysML Model (Magic Systems of Systems Architect) -> Extension: PDDL Profile (Stereotypes + OCL Constraints) -> Processor: Transformation Algorithm (Velocity Templates / Report Wizard) -> Output: .pddl Domain & Problem Files -> Consumer: PDDL Solver (e.g., Delfi)

- **Critical path**: Modeling the **Preconditions and Effects** correctly on the Activity Diagram. If the control flows (incoming/outgoing) are not stereotyped as `<<PDDL_Predicate>>`, the generated action will be empty or invalid, and the solver will find no solution.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Manual Effort vs. Consistency**: Requires significant upfront effort to annotate the model, but guarantees consistency across system design and planning.
  - **Tool Lock-in**: The generation mechanism relies on specific tool features (MSoSA Report Wizard/Velocity), reducing portability to other SysML tools without re-implementing the transformation logic.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **"Undeclared Variable" in Solver**: Usually means a `<<PDDL_Type>>` stereotype is missing from a class used in an action parameter.
  - **"Unsolvable" Plan**: Often indicates a logical deadlock in the modeled preconditions (e.g., Action B requires a state that Action A never produces).
  - **Empty PDDL File**: The transformation template could not find the root `<<PDDL_Domain>>` package.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Hello World Domain**: Create a SysML model with two Classes (Robot, Part) and one Action (PickUp). Apply stereotypes and generate the PDDL domain file to verify the basic pipeline.
  2. **Constraint Validation**: Intentionally create two classes named "Part" in the same package to trigger the OCL `UniqueTypeNames` constraint and verify that the modeling tool blocks or warns you.
  3. **Solver Integration**: Extend the Hello World model with a Problem file (defining 1 Robot, 1 Part) and run the output through the Delfi solver to observe the resulting plan.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a profile-driven assistance system effectively reduce the modeling overhead and error rates associated with the manual annotation of SysML models with PDDL stereotypes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify in Section VI that "manual annotation of system models remains a time-consuming task" and explicitly state that "a profile-driven assistance system is planned" to address this limitation.
- Why unresolved: While the profile enables consistent modeling, the current process relies on manual effort which may hinder industrial adoption; the assistance system is proposed as future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study comparing the time taken and syntactic error rates of model enrichment with and without the proposed assistance system.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can planning-relevant instance data from external engineering sources be automatically imported and mapped to the PDDL constructs defined within the SysML profile?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI suggests that "future extensions could explore how planning-relevant instance data from external sources... can be imported and mapped," noting that the current case study relied on manual assignment.
- Why unresolved: The current workflow requires manual transfer of product-specific data (e.g., from 3DExperience) to the planning constructs to ensure semantic consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstrated integration pipeline that automatically extracts data from engineering databases or product models and populates the PDDL problem description.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can the validation and metamodeling features of SysML v2 streamline the integration of PDDL semantics compared to the current SysML v1.6 implementation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that "recent advancements in SysML v2... could be leveraged to improve the integration of planning semantics," stating that the transition is being considered as tool maturity increases.
- Why unresolved: The profile presented is based on SysML v1.6, and the potential benefits or challenges of implementing this profile within the SysML v2 kernel have not yet been evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A migration of the PDDL profile to a SysML v2 environment and a comparative analysis of validation capabilities and model consistency against the v1.6 implementation.

## Limitations

- **Restricted Applicability**: The profile's applicability is currently restricted to the elements and semantics defined in the profile - complex planning requirements involving temporal logic, numeric fluents, or durative actions may not be directly supported.
- **Tool Lock-in**: The reliance on specific tool features (Magic Systems of Systems Architect Report Wizard with Velocity Templates) creates potential vendor lock-in, limiting portability to other SysML tools.
- **Scalability Unverified**: The transformation mechanism's handling of complex model hierarchies remains untested, and scalability to larger, more complex manufacturing systems remains unverified.

## Confidence

- **High**: The fundamental mechanism of stereotype-based semantic mapping is sound and well-supported by the evidence. The profile definition and OCL constraints are explicitly specified and demonstrated.
- **Medium**: The automated transformation process using VTL templates is validated in the case study, but the exact transformation logic is referenced from external work, limiting full reproducibility from the paper alone.
- **Medium**: The integration with PDDL solvers for plan optimization is demonstrated, but the scalability to larger, more complex manufacturing systems remains unverified.

## Next Checks

1. Apply the profile to a system model containing durative actions and temporal constraints to verify the approach's limits for real-time planning scenarios.
2. Attempt to reproduce the PDDL generation process using a different SysML tool (e.g., Papyrus) to assess vendor lock-in and transformation portability.
3. Validate the generated plans against a physical or high-fidelity simulated robotic system to confirm the practical utility of the optimized plans in real-world execution.
