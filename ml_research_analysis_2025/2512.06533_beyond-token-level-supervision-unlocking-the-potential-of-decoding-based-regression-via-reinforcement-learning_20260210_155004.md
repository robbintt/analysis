# Beyond Token-level Supervision: Unlocking the Potential of Decoding-based Regression via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06533
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GenRe2 achieves R² scores of 0.6459 on TALENT tabular tasks, outperforming base model (0.6124) via sequence-level RL rewards

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental misalignment between discrete token-level objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and continuous numerical value prediction in decoding-based regression. The authors propose GenerativeReinforcedRegressor (GenRe2), which reformulates the generation process as a Markov Decision Process and leverages reinforcement learning to enforce global numerical coherence through sequence-level rewards. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over both traditional regression heads and strong token-level baselines across tabular regression and code metric regression benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose GenerativeReinforcedRegressor (GenRe2) to address the token-level supervision limitation in decoding-based regression. The core innovation is reformulating generation as a Markov Decision Process where each token prediction is a state-action pair, and sequence-level rewards are computed based on the final numerical prediction. They employ reinforcement learning algorithms (specifically PPO) to optimize for these sequence-level rewards rather than token-level cross-entropy losses. The framework includes variants like GenRe2-ReMax that optimize for maximum reward, and ablation studies compare against traditional regression heads and token-level baselines.

## Key Results
- GenRe2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art token-level baselines across all tested benchmarks
- Best variant (GenRe2-ReMax) achieves average R² scores of 0.6459 on TALENT tabular tasks versus 0.6124 for base model
- RL-enhanced sampling shows improved efficiency and predictive precision compared to standard decoding
- The approach establishes decoding-based regression as competitive with traditional regression paradigms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper addresses a critical misalignment in decoding-based regression: token-level objectives like cross-entropy poorly align with continuous numerical prediction goals. By reformulating generation as a Markov Decision Process and employing reinforcement learning with sequence-level rewards, the model can optimize for global numerical coherence rather than local token prediction accuracy. This shift from token-level to sequence-level supervision enables the model to make coordinated predictions that collectively produce more accurate numerical outputs, rather than optimizing individual token probabilities that may not translate to optimal final values.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Process (MDP)** - Why needed: Provides formal framework for sequential decision-making where each token prediction is a state-action pair. Quick check: Can model token generation as state transitions with associated rewards.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** - Why needed: Enables optimization for sequence-level objectives rather than token-level losses. Quick check: Can the reward function capture the quality of final numerical prediction?

**Sequence-level rewards** - Why needed: Aligns optimization with the actual goal of accurate numerical prediction rather than token prediction accuracy. Quick check: Does the reward correlate with prediction quality across different numerical ranges?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input features -> Encoder -> Decoder (token generation) -> Reward computation -> RL optimization loop

Critical path: Feature encoding → Token sequence generation → Numerical prediction → Reward calculation → Policy update

Design tradeoffs: Token-level vs sequence-level supervision, computational cost of RL fine-tuning vs accuracy gains, reward function design complexity

Failure signatures: Poor reward design leading to degenerate policies, RL instability causing performance degradation, computational overhead limiting scalability

3 first experiments:
1. Compare GenRe2 against baseline token-level cross-entropy training on TALENT tabular tasks
2. Ablation study removing RL component to isolate contribution of sequence-level rewards
3. Test different reward function formulations to evaluate sensitivity to reward design

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but implicit questions include scalability to larger models and datasets, performance on more complex regression tasks beyond tabular data and code metrics, and the generalizability of the MDP formulation to different types of numerical prediction problems.

## Limitations

- Computational cost of reinforcement learning fine-tuning may limit scalability to larger models or datasets
- Primary focus on constrained numerical domains (tabular data and code metrics) leaves questions about performance on more complex regression tasks
- Reliance on accurate reward functions for sequence-level evaluation could introduce brittleness if reward design is suboptimal

## Confidence

- High: Experimental results on tested benchmarks show statistically significant improvements with sound methodology
- Medium: Broader claims about establishing decoding-based regression as robust paradigm, given limited scope of evaluated tasks
- Low: Long-term generalizability to diverse regression problems without further validation

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate GenRe2 on high-dimensional regression tasks (e.g., multivariate or time-series regression) to assess scalability and robustness beyond current benchmarks
2. Conduct comprehensive ablation study on reward function design, testing alternative reward formulations to determine sensitivity and potential brittleness
3. Compare computational overhead and wall-clock time of RL fine-tuning against traditional regression heads to quantify practical deployment trade-offs
