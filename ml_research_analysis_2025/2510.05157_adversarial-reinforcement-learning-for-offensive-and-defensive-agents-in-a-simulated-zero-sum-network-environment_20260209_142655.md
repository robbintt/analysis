# Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Offensive and Defensive Agents in a Simulated Zero-Sum Network Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05157
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks

## Executive Summary
This study presents an adversarial reinforcement learning framework using Deep Q-Networks in a zero-sum cyber security environment, where attacker and defender agents compete in brute-force exploitation and reactive defense scenarios. The environment models realistic network security dynamics including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. The attacker and defender agents are trained on 20,000+ episodes with carefully shaped rewards and exploration strategies. Results show that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks, with defenders maintaining consistent strategic advantage across all configurations.

## Method Summary
The method employs custom OpenAI Gym environments with 10-15 ports, 3-7 vulnerable ports per episode, and exploitation thresholds requiring 300+ requests. Attacker agents use DQN with ε-greedy exploration (decay 0.995), while defender agents use DQN with slightly different parameters (decay 0.99). Training alternates between agents over 20,000-50,000 episodes with 512-batch updates from 75,000-transition replay buffers. The zero-sum reward structure provides +100/-100 for terminal outcomes and shaped intermediate rewards for learning stability. Key mechanisms include defender observability through aggregated traffic statistics, trap-based honeypots with 60% detection probability, and IP-based rate-limiting defenses.

## Key Results
- Defender observability provides structural advantage through access to aggregated traffic statistics and IP activity patterns
- Trap detection probabilities significantly reduce attacker success rates, with 60% baseline creating substantial barriers
- Reward shaping is critical for learning stability in adversarial zero-sum environments with sparse terminal feedback
- Performance gains amplify when defenders use complex strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Defender observability creates structural advantage in adversarial settings.
- Mechanism: The defender receives aggregated traffic statistics per port, suspicious activity ratios by source IP, and sliding-window attacker IP histories. This log-based perspective enables discrimination of malicious from benign traffic even when attackers use IP rotation.
- Core assumption: Traffic patterns contain learnable signatures that distinguish attackers from normal users within the 150-state history window.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "results demonstrate that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks"
  - [section 5.3] "defender observability provides a structural advantage: access to aggregated request histories and IP activity patterns enables robust discrimination of malicious from benign traffic"
- Break condition: If background noise dominates signal, observability advantage degrades; defender may over-block legitimate users.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Trap mechanisms with non-trivial detection probability function as honeypot analogs, deterring exploitation.
- Mechanism: Traps placed on ports have probability P_detect (60% in baseline) of signaling anomaly during scans. If an attacker proceeds with exploitation on a trapped port, they incur a -80 penalty.
- Core assumption: Attackers learn to associate anomaly signals with trap risk and adjust behavior accordingly within training horizon.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "trap detection probabilities [vary across configurations]"
  - [section 5.2] "With P_trap = 0%, attackers succeeded more frequently... At the default P_trap = 60%, attacker success declined substantially while defender costs remained moderate"
- Break condition: If P_trap is too low (<30% per ablation), traps lose deterrent effect; if too high, attackers avoid all ports indiscriminately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reward shaping stabilizes learning under sparse terminal feedback in adversarial zero-sum environments.
- Mechanism: Successful exploitation yields +100 (attacker) / -100 (defender), but intermediate actions carry small costs (scan: -0.125, exploit attempt: -0.25, change IP: -8).
- Core assumption: Shaped rewards do not substantially bias final policies away from true optimal strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reward shaping and training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial setting"
  - [section 5.1] "Shaping accelerates convergence and reduces variance, but can also alter policy behavior"
  - [section 5.2] "Raising exploitation thresholds (T_p = 400) further reduced attacker success, though the increased sparsity of terminal rewards slowed attacker learning. Reward shaping mitigated this effect"
- Break condition: Over-aggressive shaping may cause agents to optimize for proximal signals rather than true objectives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: The environment is formalized as tuple ⟨S, A, P, R⟩ with alternating attacker-defender actions. Understanding state transitions and reward functions is prerequisite to interpreting agent behavior.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the state transition function P(s', s, a) must account for opponent responses in this two-agent formulation?

- Concept: Deep Q-Networks with Experience Replay
  - Why needed here: Both agents use DQN with 75,000-transition replay buffers and target networks. The epsilon-greedy exploration decays differently per agent (attacker: 0.995, defender: 0.99).
  - Quick check question: Why does experience replay help stabilize learning when the opponent's policy is changing during training?

- Concept: Zero-Sum Game Theory
  - Why needed here: The reward structure enforces r_attacker = -r_defender. This creates adversarial co-evolution dynamics where each agent's improvement directly harms the other.
  - Quick check question: In a zero-sum formulation, if the defender achieves +40 average reward, what does this imply about attacker learning dynamics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment (OpenAI Gym) -> Attacker Agent (DQN) -> Defender Agent (DQN) -> Training Loop

- Critical path:
  1. Episode initialization: Random vulnerable ports + thresholds, random attacker IPs
  2. Attacker acts (scan/exploit/IP change) -> environment updates counters
  3. Defender acts (rate-limit/trap/close/wait) -> environment applies defenses
  4. Background traffic generated; check exploitation thresholds and trap triggers
  5. Rewards computed per zero-sum formula; transitions stored in replay buffer
  6. DQN update via minibatch sampling; target network sync periodically

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Batch size 512 vs. smaller: Larger batches stabilize gradients but require more compute; 512 chosen for GPU parallelization
  - Trap probability 60%: Higher deters attacks but may reduce attacker learning signal; lower increases attacker success
  - IP change minimum (10 actions): Constrains evasion but models real proxy-switching costs; shorter intervals make tracking harder

- Failure signatures:
  - Attacker rewards stuck near -40,000 to -60,000 with no improvement after 5,000 episodes -> exploration insufficient or exploitation threshold too high
  - Defender false-positive rate increasing -> reward shaping may be under-penalizing blocking normal traffic (-8 per request)
  - Oscillating rewards without convergence -> simultaneous learning causing non-stationarity; consider alternating training or opponent populations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline validation: Run P_trap = 60%, T_min = 300 for 5,000 episodes; confirm defender achieves +30 to +40 average reward per Figure 4 pattern
  2. Ablation on trap probability: Compare P_trap ∈ {0%, 30%, 60%, 90%}; measure attacker win rate and defender false-positive rate
  3. Reward shaping sensitivity: Remove intermediate costs (scan, exploit attempt); observe if convergence fails or oscillations increase per section 5.1 warning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would implementing centralized critics or opponent populations significantly reduce the learning instability observed in simultaneous training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work should explore "centralized critics" and "opponent populations," while Section 5.3 notes that simultaneous learning introduces non-stationarity.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments relied on independent DQNs and alternating updates to manage instability, leaving the potential of centralized training architectures untested in this specific zero-sum environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative training curves showing reduced volatility and faster convergence rates when using a centralized critic method (e.g., MADDPG) versus the independent DQN approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can defensive policies trained in this simulated environment transfer effectively to realistic network simulators or real-world data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly suggest future work should explore "transfer to more realistic network simulators."
- Why unresolved: The study is conducted entirely within a custom OpenAI Gym environment that abstracts network dynamics, meaning the "sim-to-real" gap remains unaddressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the trained defender agents on high-fidelity emulation platforms (e.g., Mininet) or against historical intrusion detection datasets without significant performance degradation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do richer attacker models capable of strategies beyond brute-force exploitation overcome the defender's observability advantage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "richer attacker models" as a necessary direction for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study limits attackers to specific actions (scanning, exploiting, IP changing), which allows the defender to rely on request-volume heuristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies introducing attackers with stealth capabilities or exploit diversity, testing if the defender's "structural advantage" persists against non-brute-force tactics.

## Limitations

- Critical implementation details missing including neural network architecture, layer specifications, and optimizer choices
- Transition between initial training and "complex strategies" phases lacks clear triggering criteria
- Observation vector construction remains underspecified despite references to "3 bins" discretization
- Simultaneous multi-agent learning introduces non-stationarity that may bias results

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Defender observability advantage and trap effectiveness mechanisms (supported by controlled ablation experiments and consistent reward patterns across configurations)
- **Medium Confidence**: Reward shaping importance for stability (supported by convergence observations but limited by lack of ablation on different shaping schemes)
- **Low Confidence**: Optimal hyperparameter choices (α, γ, ε-decay values chosen through empirical tuning without systematic sensitivity analysis)

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Sensitivity Test**: Implement multiple DQN architectures (varying layers, units, activations) and compare learning curves to assess whether architectural choices materially impact the defender advantage findings
2. **Trap Probability Threshold Analysis**: Systematically test trap probabilities across the full range (0% to 90%) with larger sample sizes to precisely map the tipping point where traps shift from ineffective to dominant
3. **Opponent-Population Stability**: Replace opponent with frozen policy snapshots from earlier training epochs to measure non-stationarity effects and validate whether alternating updates adequately address simultaneous learning instability
