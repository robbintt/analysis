# PASTA: Part-Aware Sketch-to-3D Shape Generation with Text-Aligned Prior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12834
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12834
- Reference count: 40
- State-of-the-art performance on SketchNet datasets with CD=0.090, EMD=0.071, FID=143.9 on AmateurSketch-3D

## Executive Summary
PASTA integrates text priors from a vision-language model with sketch-based 3D shape generation to address the challenge of reconstructing detailed 3D models from ambiguous 2D sketches. By extracting semantically rich text embeddings that describe object components, PASTA compensates for missing visual cues in sketches. The method employs a dual GCN architecture (ISG-Net) with IndivGCN for fine-grained detail processing and PartGCN for part-level structural aggregation. Evaluated on SketchNet chair, airplane, and lamp datasets, PASTA achieves state-of-the-art performance with Chamfer Distance of 0.090, Earth Mover's Distance of 0.071, and Fr'echet Inception Distance of 143.9 on AmateurSketch-3D, outperforming existing methods in preserving structural integrity and fine-grained details while enabling flexible part-level editing.

## Method Summary
PASTA processes sketch inputs through a dual-branch encoder: a visual backbone (DINOv2) and a vision-language model (LLaVa-7B) that generates text descriptions of object components. These text embeddings are fused with visual features via a 12-layer Text-Visual Transformer Decoder using sequential cross-attention (visual first, then text). The fused query features are refined through ISG-Net, a dual-GCN architecture with IndivGCN processing fine-grained details and PartGCN aggregating part-level structures. The refined features are passed to the SPAGHETTI decoder, which generates editable 3D shapes as Gaussian Mixture Models. The model is trained on ShapeNet subsets with CLIPasso sketches and evaluated on AmateurSketch-3D and ProSketch-3D datasets using Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and Fréchet Inception Distance metrics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating text priors from a vision-language model (VLM) with sketch inputs improves 3D shape generation by compensating for missing visual cues in ambiguous 2D sketches. The VLM (LLaVa-7B) takes a sketch and a prompt, generating a text description of the object's components. These text embeddings capture semantic details (e.g., "four legs," "curved backrest") that are often unclear in the sketch. The embeddings are fused with visual features via a Text-Visual Transformer Decoder using a sequential cross-attention mechanism (visual first, then text), enriching the learned queries with structured semantic information. The mechanism breaks if the VLM produces "hallucinations" (incorrect details), particularly with verbose descriptions rather than single-sentence descriptions.

### Mechanism 2
Processing the fused query features through a dual-GCN architecture (ISG-Net) refines both local geometric details and global part-level structure. ISG-Net operates on learned queries (corresponding to GMMs). It has two components: 1. **IndivGCN:** Builds a graph of individual queries and refines local features. 2. **PartGCN:** Clusters queries into part-level groups (e.g., legs), aggregates their features, and refines relationships between parts. The outputs are fused with a residual connection, weighted by $\alpha=0.8$. The mechanism fails if initial query features are poorly aligned, making the graph structure meaningless, or if the cluster count $K$ is too small (2) or too large (8).

### Mechanism 3
Using a part-aware shape decoder (SPAGHETTI) allows for the direct generation of editable 3D shapes from refined query features. ISG-Net's output (refined latent vectors) is passed to the SPAGHETTI decoder, which interprets them as parameters for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). These GMMs define the 3D occupancy field. Because the representation is part-aware, the resulting model is inherently editable. The mechanism is limited by the SPAGHETTI decoder, which is constrained to a fixed number of Gaussians and limited object categories.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for Shape Representation
- **Why needed here:** This is PASTA's core 3D representation. The model's outputs are GMM parameters. Understanding this is essential to grasp what the latent queries represent and why part-level editing is possible.
- **Quick check question:** If a generated 3D chair looks like a smooth blob instead of a structured object, which part of the pipeline—the VLM, the GCN, or the GMM decoder—is likely the primary source of the error?

### Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Semantic Feature Extraction
- **Why needed here:** PASTA relies on a VLM to generate text descriptions from sketches, acting as a crucial prior. Understanding VLMs' potential for description and hallucination is key.
- **Quick check question:** A user draws a simple chair with four legs, but the VLM describes it as having "a single, curved leg." How will this likely affect the final 3D output?

### Concept: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for Feature Refinement
- **Why needed here:** ISG-Net uses GCNs to model and refine relationships between different parts of the 3D object (represented as graph nodes).
- **Quick check question:** In PASTA's PartGCN, what is the role of the clustering algorithm, and what might happen if it incorrectly groups a chair's armrest with its seat?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Sketch -> Visual Encoder (DINOv2) + VLM (LLaVa-7B) -> Text-Visual Transformer Decoder (12 layers) -> ISG-Net (IndivGCN + PartGCN) -> SPAGHETTI Decoder -> 3D Mesh

### Critical path
Input Sketch -> VLM -> Text Embeddings -> Text-Visual Transformer -> ISG-Net -> SPAGHETTI Decoder -> 3D Mesh. The sequential cross-attention and GCN fusion are critical.

### Design tradeoffs
- **VLM choice:** Uses LLaVa-7B; larger models (13B) performed worse. Tradeoff is between power and avoiding hallucinations.
- **GCN Balance ($\alpha$):** Weighting factor is 0.8, favoring fine-grained detail (IndivGCN) while using part-level structure (PartGCN).
- **Text Prompting:** Uses specific, single-sentence prompts to avoid noise from verbose descriptions.

### Failure signatures
- **Missing parts:** VLM fails to detect a subtle part.
- **Structural inconsistencies:** Poor performance of the adjacency predictor in ISG-Net.
- **Non-editable parts:** Learned queries do not map to disentangled GMMs.

### First 3 experiments
1. Run the model on a new amateur sketch and verify the VLM's description matches the sketch's key features.
2. Ablate the text prior (use a generic/empty embedding) and compare the 3D model's completeness to the full pipeline output.
3. Use the model's editing interface to add/remove a part (e.g., armrests) on the generated mesh to validate part-awareness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the framework be modified to remove the constraints of a fixed number of Gaussians and limited object classes? The authors state, "Future work may explore removing these constraints and incorporating a dedicated implicit decoder to support a wider range of categories."
- To what extent does the quality of text embeddings from the VLM impact the final geometry, particularly regarding the risk of hallucinated features? The paper notes that verbose descriptions can introduce "inaccuracies such as hallucinations," yet relies on the VLM for critical structural cues like part counts.
- Does the fixed part clustering parameter ($K=4$) limit the model's ability to represent objects with higher structural complexity or non-standard part counts? The supplementary material notes $K$ is set to 4, which may not generalize to objects with significantly more or fewer semantic parts.

## Limitations
- The SPAGHETTI decoder's constraint to fixed Gaussian counts limits scalability to more complex shapes beyond the three trained categories.
- The method's success heavily depends on the VLM's ability to accurately infer 3D structure from 2D sketches without hallucinating details.
- Absence of human perceptual studies leaves quantitative metrics as the sole evaluation, which may not fully capture qualitative improvements in part-awareness or editability.

## Confidence

### Confidence Labels
- **High Confidence:** The quantitative improvements (CD, EMD, FID) over baselines on SketchNet datasets are directly measurable and well-documented.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of enabling flexible part-level editing is supported by qualitative examples but lacks rigorous user studies or quantitative metrics for editability.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that text priors compensate for ambiguous sketches is plausible given the VLM ablation results, but the extent of this compensation in real-world scenarios is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. **VLM Ablation on Diverse Sketches:** Systematically test PASTA with VLM-generated embeddings from sketches with varying levels of abstraction (simple to complex) to quantify the impact of sketch clarity on the final 3D output.
2. **Cross-Category Generalization:** Evaluate PASTA on a held-out category (e.g., tables) not seen during training to assess the scalability of the text-prior mechanism beyond the three trained categories.
3. **Part-Level Consistency Test:** Perform a quantitative analysis of the editability feature by measuring the structural integrity of the 3D model after multiple part-level edits (e.g., add/remove armrests, change leg count) to validate the part-awareness claim.
