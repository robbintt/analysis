# Towards Adaptive Context Management for Intelligent Conversational Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.17829
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17829
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** ACM framework improves ConvQA performance by up to 10.78 F1 points over baseline pipeline approach

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an Adaptive Context Management (ACM) framework for optimizing context handling in Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems. The framework dynamically manages conversation history through three modules: a Context Manager for prioritizing relevant turns, a Summarization Module for compressing older turns, and an Entity Extraction Module for retaining key entities when summarization limits are exceeded. Experiments on the coqa_chat dataset demonstrate significant improvements across six state-of-the-art models, with F1 score gains of up to 10.78 points compared to a baseline pipeline approach.

## Method Summary
The ACM framework implements a Dynamic Context Window Adjustment (DCWA) algorithm that maintains multiple tiers of context preservation within a fixed token budget. The system preserves recent conversation turns at full fidelity (Unmodified Context), summarizes middle turns using abstractive summarization (Summarized Context), and extracts named entities from oldest turns as a fallback (Entity Context). When approaching the model's token limit, the algorithm cascades older turns from full text to summarized form to entity-only representation, ensuring the most relevant and recent information remains available while staying within token constraints.

## Key Results
- **F1 score improvement:** Up to 10.78 points over baseline pipeline approach
- **ROUGE-L improvement:** Up to 10.43 points with ACM implementation
- **ROUGE-1 improvement:** Up to 12.90 points across evaluated models
- **BLEU improvement:** Up to 8.40 points demonstrating enhanced response quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Context Fidelity Through Dynamic Window Adjustment
- **Claim:** Maintaining multiple tiers of context preservation (full, summarized, entity-only) within a fixed token budget improves ConvQA response accuracy compared to single-strategy approaches.
- **Mechanism:** The DCWA algorithm allocates token budget across three zones: Unmodified Context preserves recent turns at full fidelity, Summarized Context compresses middle turns via abstractive summarization, and Entity Context retains only named entities from oldest turns. When total tokens approach the model limit, older UNC turns transition to SMC; when SMC exceeds its limit, oldest summarized turns collapse to EEC.
- **Core assumption:** Recency correlates with relevance—recent conversation turns are more likely to contain information needed for the current question.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "The CM Module dynamically adjusts the context size, thereby preserving the most relevant and recent information within a model's token limit." [section 3.4, Eq. 3-4] Shows cascading compression logic.

### Mechanism 2: Summarization Sliding Window for Context Compression
- **Claim:** Abstractive summarization of older conversation turns retains sufficient semantic content for answer generation while reducing token consumption by ~70-80%.
- **Mechanism:** The SM Module applies a sliding window summarizer (BART Conversation Summary) to older turns when unmodified context exceeds the token threshold. The summarizer was empirically tuned to 120 tokens for up to 20 conversation turns based on ROUGE-L optimization.
- **Core assumption:** Summaries generated by BART Conversation Summary preserve answer-relevant information at rates sufficient to maintain ConvQA accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4, Figs. 3-6] BART Conversation Summary achieved highest ROUGE-L scores across configurations; 120 tokens selected as optimal.

### Mechanism 3: Entity Extraction as Information-theoretic Floor
- **Claim:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) provides a minimal-loss fallback that preserves critical nouns (names, dates, locations) when both full context and summaries exceed token limits.
- **Mechanism:** The EE Module uses spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model to extract and store entities from the oldest turns. These entities replace full text, maintaining referential anchors without surrounding context.
- **Core assumption:** Entities are the most irreducible information units for answering follow-up questions; surrounding text is lower-value.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.3] "The EE Module identifies and extracts key entities from the oldest conversation turns for retaining crucial information without preserving the entire text."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Token budgeting and context window limits in transformer models
  - **Why needed here:** The entire ACM framework is predicated on the constraint TokenCount(C_n) ≤ M_Smax. Without understanding why LLMs have fixed context windows (attention complexity O(n²), memory for KV cache), the motivation for hierarchical compression is unclear.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a model with 4096 token limit and a 15-turn conversation averaging 150 tokens/turn (plus 500-token base passage), will it fit without compression?

- **Concept:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) and entity types
  - **Why needed here:** The EE Module relies on NER to identify what to preserve. Understanding precision/recall tradeoffs in NER models (spaCy's ~85-90% F1 on standard benchmarks) helps diagnose why some critical information might be lost.
  - **Quick check question:** If a conversation contains "The meeting with Dr. Chen is next Tuesday at 3pm," what entities should spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` extract, and what information is lost?

- **Concept:** ROUGE metrics for summarization evaluation
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses ROUGE-L to select the optimal summarization model and token budget. Understanding ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence) helps interpret Figs. 3-6 and why 120 tokens was chosen.
  - **Quick check question:** If a reference summary is "Paris has landmarks like the Eiffel Tower" and a generated summary is "The Eiffel Tower is a famous Paris landmark," what would ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores roughly indicate about overlap?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Question (Q_n) + Conversation History + Evidence Document → Context Manager (CM) Module → [UNC Buffer + SM Module + EE Module] → Restructured Context → QA Model → Answer Prediction

- **Critical path:** Algorithm 1 (DCWA) is the core control flow. For each question Q_n:
  1. Build initial context: C_n = Context_B + Q_n + UNC(all previous turns)
  2. If TokenCount(C_n) > M_Smax: compress oldest UNC → SMC
  3. If TokenCount(SMC) > SM_limit: compress oldest SMC → EEC (while UNC > Threshold × M_Smax)
  4. Feed restructured context to QA model

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **UNC threshold (75%):** Higher threshold = more recent context preserved, but less room for summary/entity history. Lower threshold = more compression, but risk losing recent relevant turns.
  - **Summary limit (120 tokens):** Larger = better summary quality, but consumes tokens that could go to UNC. Smaller = more turns compressed, but lower summary fidelity.
  - **Summarization model choice:** BART Conversation Summary optimized for dialogue; other models (Pegasus, T5) may perform better on different domains.
  - **NER model choice:** `en_core_web_sm` is fast (~10x faster than `en_core_web_trf`) but less accurate on complex entities.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Sudden accuracy drop at turn N:** Check if SM_limit was exceeded, causing premature entity extraction. Inspect EEC content—bare entities may lack relational context.
  - **Hallucinated entities in responses:** Summarization model may introduce entities not in original turns. Audit SMC output against ground truth.
  - **Context overflow errors:** Threshold calculation may be incorrect, or entity extraction not triggering. Verify Algorithm 1 lines 11-20 are executing.
  - **Degraded performance on temporal reasoning questions:** Entity extraction loses temporal ordering. Consider preserving timestamp metadata alongside entities.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Implement pipeline approach (immediate turn only) on coqa_chat 10% sample. Replicate Table 1 baseline F1 scores for your chosen model (target: within ±2 points of reported values).
  2. **Ablation study—remove EE Module:** Run ACM with only UNC + SMC (no entity fallback). Measure F1 drop on long conversations (>15 turns). If drop > 3 points, EE Module is providing non-trivial value.
  3. **Threshold sensitivity analysis:** Vary UNC threshold from 50% to 90% in 10% increments. Plot F1 vs. threshold for conversations of different lengths. Identify optimal threshold for your target use case (may differ from 75% if your domain has longer/shorter average conversations).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the ACM framework perform when evaluated on a broader range of datasets and diverse conversational scenarios beyond the coqa_chat subset?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "Expanding the evaluation to include a broad range of datasets and conversational scenarios will also be crucial for validating the generalizability of our envisaged ACM framework."
- **Why unresolved:** The current experimental scope is limited to a 10% sample of the coqa_chat dataset, potentially biasing results toward specific conversational structures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking results on standard ConvQA datasets like QuAC or CANARD, as well as domain-specific datasets (e.g., technical support).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent can the precision of context management be improved by replacing the current BART and spaCy components with state-of-the-art summarization and entity recognition models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion suggests "the integration of more advanced summarization and entity recognition techniques so as to improve the precision of the context management."
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relies on specific models (BART Conversation Summary and spaCy's `en_core_web_sm`), which may not represent the optimal choices for all context types.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies substituting the SM and EE modules with larger or more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3) and measuring the change in F1 and ROUGE scores.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What is the practical impact of the ACM framework on latency and efficacy in real-world applications such as customer service or virtual assistants?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes that "investigating the application of the ACM framework in real-world ConvQA applications... will further help to assess its practical utility and impact."
- **Why unresolved:** Laboratory metrics (F1, BLEU) do not capture real-world constraints like inference speed, user satisfaction, or handling noisy, asynchronous interactions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Results from A/B testing in a live deployment environment, measuring response time and human feedback scores alongside accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Is the fixed 75% token allocation threshold for Unmodified Context (UNC) optimal across varying conversation lengths, or would a dynamic threshold yield better results?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 5 states that experiments were conducted by fixing the "minimum Threshold for UNC to 75%," but does not explore if this static allocation is efficient for very short or extremely long conversations.
- **Why unresolved:** A static threshold may force summarization too early in short conversations or allow too much noise in very long ones.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study comparing the current static 75% threshold against dynamic, context-aware thresholding strategies across different conversation depths.

## Limitations

- **Dataset scope limitation:** Experiments conducted only on a 10% sample of coqa_chat dataset, limiting generalizability to other conversational domains and structures.
- **Static parameter tuning:** Fixed 75% UNC threshold and 120-token SMC limit were empirically tuned on coqa_chat without validation on alternative corpora or sensitivity analysis.
- **Missing comparative analysis:** No direct comparison against other context compression strategies like retrieval augmentation or KV cache management that could achieve similar token efficiency.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observed performance improvements (F1 +10.78, ROUGE-L +10.43, ROUGE-1 +12.90, BLEU +8.40) are statistically valid within the experimental setup on coqa_chat. The algorithmic logic of DCWA is clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism-level explanations for why hierarchical compression works better than single-strategy approaches. While the design is theoretically sound, comparative analysis against other compression strategies is absent.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the 75% UNC threshold and 120-token SMC limit to other conversational datasets and domains. These parameters were empirically tuned on coqa_chat without validation on alternative corpora.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation:** Apply ACM to a different ConvQA dataset (e.g., QuAC, CANARD) with varying conversation lengths and topics. Compare performance degradation against the coqa_chat baseline to assess domain transfer capability.

2. **Ablation of summarization quality:** Implement a variant where SMC is replaced with random token sampling from middle turns (preserving token count but not semantics). Measure F1 drop to quantify how much performance depends on summary quality versus simple token reduction.

3. **Entity context completeness audit:** For conversations where EEC is triggered, manually inspect whether critical answer-relevant information is preserved in the extracted entities. Track cases where entity-only context fails versus cases where it succeeds, categorizing failure modes (temporal reasoning, conditional logic, multi-entity relationships).
