# Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01335
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335
- Authors: Aritra Das; Joseph T. Iosue; Victor V. Albert
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: QuIIEst benchmark reveals IDE methods perform significantly worse on topologically complex manifolds than traditional benchmarks under identical conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QuIIEst, a new benchmark for evaluating intrinsic dimension estimation methods using quantum-inspired coherent-state embeddings of homogeneous spaces. The benchmark generates manifolds with known ground-truth IDs and non-trivial topology, providing a more rigorous testing ground than traditional benchmarks like spheres and Gaussian distributions. The authors demonstrate that six commonly used IDE methods perform significantly worse on QuIIEst manifolds, with minimal performance degradation even when manifolds are distorted or noisy.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses Gilmore-Perelomov coherent-state embeddings to construct homogeneous spaces G/H as manifolds in Euclidean space, where intrinsic dimension is d_i = dim G - dim H. The authors evaluate six IDE methods (lPCA, MLE, CorrInt, TwoNN, DANCo, ABID) across six manifold families (Grassmannian, Stiefel, Flag, Pauli quotient) with varying sample sizes (N=100-10000) and neighbor counts (k=10-1000). Performance is measured via relative error δ = d̂_i/d_i - 1, with comprehensive sweeps of noise levels and geometric distortions to test robustness.

## Key Results
- IDE methods show consistently higher relative error on QuIIEst manifolds versus traditional benchmarks under identical resource allocation
- ABID performs best overall, while TwoNN shows the highest error rates and stability issues
- Methods exhibit minimal performance degradation when manifolds are distorted with anisotropic scaling or additive noise
- A systematic transition from overestimation at low true IDs to underestimation at high IDs is observed across most methods and manifolds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Coherent-State Embedding Generates Topologically Non-Trivial Manifolds
- Claim: Quantum-inspired embeddings produce manifold families with controlled intrinsic dimension and non-trivial topology unavailable in existing benchmarks.
- Mechanism: The Gilmore-Perelomov coherent-state method maps homogeneous spaces G/H (where G is a Lie group and H a subgroup) into Euclidean space via group representations Π(g)|H⟩, where |H⟩ is a fiducial vector invariant under H. This yields injective embeddings with intrinsic dimension d_i = dim G - dim H.
- Core assumption: The representation Π is sufficiently rich to distinguish coset representatives uniquely.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise."
  - [section 3] "All manifolds included in the QuIIEst benchmark are parameterized by quotient spaces G/H... Their intrinsic dimension is d_i = dim G - dim H."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers focus on estimation methods rather than manifold construction.
- Break condition: If Π|H lacks trivial irreps or |H⟩ is invariant under a larger subgroup K > H, the embedding collapses to a lower-dimensional space.

### Mechanism 2: Topological Complexity Increases IDE Error Beyond Standard Benchmarks
- Claim: IDE methods perform worse on QuIIEst manifolds than on spheres or affine spaces due to non-trivial topology and geometry, even with identical sample sizes and ambient dimensions.
- Mechanism: Standard benchmarks (hyperspheres, Swiss rolls) have simple topology with well-understood local geometry. QuIIEst manifolds (Grassmannians, Stiefel manifolds, flag manifolds, Pauli quotients) have non-trivial homotopy groups and non-uniform curvature distributions that violate local uniformity assumptions underlying many IDE methods.
- Core assumption: IDE method performance correlates with topological and geometric complexity when sample density is held constant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation."
  - [section 5.2, Fig 2] Methods show consistently higher relative error |δ| on QuIIEst manifolds vs. spheres with matching d_i and d_a.
  - [corpus] Limited; neighbor papers do not systematically compare benchmark difficulty.
- Break condition: If the manifold family admits a simple local parameterization that IDE methods can exploit, performance gap should narrow.

### Mechanism 3: Scaling Reveals Systematic Overestimation-to-Underestimation Transition
- Claim: Most IDE methods overestimate ID at low true dimensions and underestimate at high dimensions, with transition point dependent on method and manifold family.
- Mechanism: At low d_i, finite-sample neighborhoods contain points from geodesically distant regions, inflating local dimension estimates. At high d_i, sampling density becomes insufficient to populate neighborhoods, causing methods to infer fewer degrees of freedom. This asymmetry is method-dependent but universal across QuIIEst manifolds.
- Core assumption: Sample size N scales sub-exponentially with true ID, violating the N ∝ exp(d_i) requirement for reliable estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.5] "We observe that... there is a transition from overestimation at low ID to underestimation at high ID for most manifolds."
  - [section G.4, Eq 34] "In order to get a uniform and dense sampling... N ∝ exp(-d_i)"
  - [corpus] Consistent with neighbor paper observations about sample complexity requirements.
- Break condition: If N scales as exp(d_i) with sufficient constant factor, transition should disappear.

## Foundational Learning

- **Homogeneous spaces (G/H quotient construction)**
  - Why needed here: All QuIIEst manifolds are defined as quotients of Lie groups; understanding this construction is essential to interpret the benchmark and extend it.
  - Quick check question: Given SO(3)/SO(2), what is the intrinsic dimension and what manifold does this represent?

- **Local vs. global intrinsic dimension**
  - Why needed here: QuIIEst manifolds have constant global ID but IDE methods return local estimates; the paper aggregates these via mean/median/mode.
  - Quick check question: Why would local ID estimates vary for a fractal but not for a smooth manifold?

- **Spectral methods (PCA, eigenvalue gaps)**
  - Why needed here: lPCA is a baseline IDE method; understanding spectral gap detection helps interpret why it fails on QuIIEst manifolds.
  - Quick check question: If singular values decay smoothly without a clear gap, which lPCA variant ('maxgap', 'ratio', 'fo') would you trust least?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Manifold generators (Gr, St, Flag, Pauli) -> Coherent-state embedding -> Euclidean samples
  - IDE method wrappers (lPCA, MLE, CorrInt, TwoNN, DANCo, ABID) -> Local ID estimates
  - kNN precomputation -> Neighborhood structure for all methods
  - Distortion modules (squeezing, additive noise) -> Modified manifolds
  - Evaluation metrics (relative error, VDI) -> Performance assessment

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate manifold samples via coherent-state embedding
  2. Precompute kNN for relevant k values
  3. Run IDE methods with hyperparameter sweeps (k, N)
  4. Compute relative error and aggregate statistics
  5. Compare against baseline benchmarks (spheres, Gaussians, affine spaces)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Embedding choice**: Gr (Vec) has lower ambient dimension (binomial(n,k)) than Gr (Proj) (n²) but may be easier for IDE methods—paper shows Gr (Vec) has lower error
  - **k vs N**: Paper sweeps both; holding k/N fixed converges but not necessarily to δ ≈ 0
  - **Compute vs coverage**: High-dimensional manifolds (d_a > 600) require significant memory; paper uses 600 CPU hours total

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **TwoNN returns NaN or fails silently** on high-dimensional or noisy data (noted in scikit-dimension implementation)
  - **lPCA 'maxgap' fails** when singular values have no clear spectral gap
  - **All methods plateau** at δ ≈ 0 when noise scale σ² exceeds signal variance, treating data as pure noise

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce baseline comparison**: Generate Gr (Proj) with d_i=6, d_a=25; run all six IDE methods with k=100, N=5000; verify |δ| ≈ 0.58 per Table 2
  2. **Squeezing robustness test**: Apply anisotropic distortion with ε ∈ [0, 2] to Gr (Proj); plot |δ| vs ε to confirm minimal degradation (should remain flat, unlike spheres)
  3. **Scaling transition verification**: For St (Matrix), vary d_i from 9 to 434 while holding k=100, N=5000; confirm overestimation (δ > 0) at low d_i transitioning to underestimation (δ < 0) at high d_i

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do local geometric properties, such as curvature and density, quantitatively influence IDE method performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly "leave a more in-depth investigation of this effect to future work" after failing to observe significant dependence on these properties in their initial experiments.
- Why unresolved: The inherent difficulty of the QuIIEst manifolds may have masked the influence of geometric features, or the sample sizes were insufficient to reveal the dependency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A targeted study correlating IDE error with explicit measurements of local curvature and density across a wider range of manifolds and sample sizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the coherent-state embedding framework be extended to non-manifold structures like double coset spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes extending the method to double coset spaces K \ G / H as a "promising route to emulating real-world data not living on a manifold."
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark strictly utilizes homogeneous spaces G/H, which are manifolds by definition.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful generation of synthetic datasets from double coset spaces and subsequent analysis of IDE behavior on these non-manifold structures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the observed weak correlations between data statistics (e.g., anisotropy) and IDE performance persist in the asymptotic limit?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "more samples are needed to relate our results to asymptotic estimates of method accuracy" regarding the weak correlations observed.
- Why unresolved: Computational constraints limited the sample sizes, leaving it unclear if the weak correlations are fundamental limitations or artifacts of finite sampling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or large-scale empirical scaling studies that track correlation strength as sample size approaches infinity.

## Limitations

- **Implementation accessibility**: The quantum-inspired manifold generators require manual implementation of complex Gilmore-Perelomov coherent-state embeddings, as code was not available at publication
- **Computational intensity**: High-dimensional manifolds (d_a > 600) require significant computational resources, with the full benchmark consuming approximately 600 CPU hours
- **Benchmark scope**: The current benchmark focuses exclusively on smooth manifolds, potentially missing challenges posed by non-manifold structures common in real-world data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The relative performance ordering of IDE methods (ABID > DANCo > lPCA > MLE > CorrInt > TwoNN) across multiple manifold families, supported by consistent results across different sample sizes and noise levels.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that QuIIEst manifolds are inherently more challenging than traditional benchmarks, based on the observed performance gap but without systematic comparison of topological invariants.
- **Medium Confidence**: The transition from overestimation to underestimation as true ID increases, supported by empirical observations but requiring theoretical justification for the mechanism.

## Next Checks

1. **Topological Verification**: Compute fundamental groups and Betti numbers for representative QuIIEst manifolds (Gr(3,5), St(5,3)) and compare against spheres/affine spaces to quantify topological complexity.

2. **Implementation Validation**: Implement the Gr (Vec) embedding independently and verify that generated data exhibits the reported performance degradation for lPCA compared to Gr (Proj).

3. **Scaling Analysis**: For the transition phenomenon, systematically vary N ∝ exp(d_i) across multiple orders of magnitude to test whether the transition point shifts as predicted by the sample complexity theory.
