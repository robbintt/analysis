# DetectiumFire: A Comprehensive Multi-modal Dataset Bridging Vision and Language for Fire Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02495
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02495
- Reference count: 40
- First large-scale multi-modal dataset for comprehensive fire understanding with 22.5k images and 2.5k videos

## Executive Summary
DetectiumFire is the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset for comprehensive fire understanding, comprising 22.5k high-resolution images and 2.5k fire-related videos with detailed annotations for both traditional computer vision and modern multi-modal tasks. The dataset significantly reduces redundancy (0.23 vs. 0.55 duplication rate) and offers broader coverage of diverse fire scenarios, including rare categories and controlled fires. Models trained on DetectiumFire generalize better than those trained on prior benchmarks, with YOLOv11 achieving 43.74% mAP compared to 24.88% on D-Fire.

## Method Summary
DetectiumFire is constructed through a rigorous curation process that combines manual annotation and automated filtering to ensure high-quality, diverse fire imagery and videos. The dataset spans various fire types, including forest fires, industrial fires, and controlled burns, with annotations for object detection, segmentation, and multi-modal reasoning tasks. Synthetic data augmentation is employed using fine-tuned diffusion models to improve model robustness and generalization. The vision-language component includes detailed captions and fire severity classifications, enabling advanced reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- YOLOv11 achieves 43.74% mAP on DetectiumFire, significantly outperforming 24.88% on D-Fire
- Fine-tuned diffusion models generate high-quality synthetic fire images that improve downstream object detection performance
- Vision-language models fine-tuned on DetectiumFire show up to 27.78% accuracy improvement in fire severity classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of fire scenarios, reduced redundancy, and integration of both real and synthetic data. By addressing the limitations of prior benchmarks like D-Fire, DetectiumFire provides a more robust foundation for training models that generalize across diverse fire conditions. The multi-modal annotations enable advanced reasoning tasks, bridging the gap between visual and linguistic understanding of fire.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-modal data curation**: Combining visual and textual data for comprehensive understanding; needed to support advanced reasoning tasks; quick check: ensure balanced representation of fire types and scenarios.
- **Synthetic data generation**: Using diffusion models to augment real data; needed to improve model robustness and generalization; quick check: validate synthetic images against real-world fire variability.
- **Vision-language fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models for fire-specific reasoning; needed to enhance multi-modal performance; quick check: test model accuracy across diverse fire-related prompts.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Dataset -> Object Detection Models -> Vision-Language Models -> Multi-modal Reasoning
**Critical Path**: High-quality annotations -> Synthetic data generation -> Model fine-tuning -> Performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Real vs. synthetic data balance; annotation granularity vs. scalability; controlled vs. real-world fire scenarios
**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to synthetic data; poor generalization to rare fire types; bias in vision-language reasoning
**First Experiments**:
1. Train YOLOv11 on DetectiumFire and evaluate on D-Fire to measure cross-dataset generalization
2. Generate synthetic fire images and test their impact on object detection robustness
3. Fine-tune CLIP on DetectiumFire and evaluate fire severity classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Real-world applicability of models trained on controlled fire scenarios is uncertain
- Evaluation metrics are largely self-reported, lacking extensive cross-dataset validation
- Synthetic data may not fully capture the complexity of extreme fire conditions

## Confidence
- Dataset contribution to fire detection: High
- Synthetic data effectiveness: Medium
- Vision-language model enhancements: Medium to Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct large-scale, independent testing of models trained on DetectiumFire in real-world fire detection scenarios, including diverse environments and rare fire types
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of synthetic data augmentation on model robustness and generalization, particularly under extreme or unusual fire conditions
3. Evaluate the vision-language model improvements across a broader range of fire-related reasoning tasks and prompts, and compare against other state-of-the-art multi-modal models not fine-tuned on DetectiumFire
