# Pose as a Modality: A Psychology-Inspired Network for Personality Recognition with a New Multimodal Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12912
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12912
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Psychology-Inspired Network (PINet) with pose modality outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multimodal personality recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PINet, a novel multimodal architecture for personality recognition that incorporates psychological theory into its design. The authors create a new dataset featuring full-body pose data extracted from video interviews, addressing a gap in existing multimodal personality recognition resources. PINet leverages Vision Mamba Blocks for efficient visual feature extraction and Fusion Mamba Blocks for multimodal fusion, guided by a Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss (PIMC) that enforces trait-specific modality importance. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across five personality dimensions while demonstrating that pose data serves as a mid-level important modality among the five considered.

## Method Summary
The method introduces PINet, which processes five modalities (frame, face, pose, audio, text) through a three-module architecture: Multimodal Feature Awareness (MFA) for individual modality encoding using Vision Mamba for visual inputs and Residual Blocks for audio/text, Multimodal Feature Interaction (MFI) for cross-modal fusion via Fusion Mamba Blocks, and Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss (PIMC) that weights modality-specific errors based on psychological theory. The model is trained on a new dataset of 287 Chinese university students across 36 interview questions, with data aligned by timestamps and split by participant (3:1:1). Training uses SGD with specific hyperparameters on multiple GPUs, optimizing for PCC, CCC, and MSE metrics.

## Key Results
- PINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal personality recognition with PCC/CCC scores exceeding baseline models
- Pose modality ranks as mid-level importance among five modalities when ablated, demonstrating its significant contribution
- Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss improves prediction accuracy by enforcing trait-specific modality importance
- Vision Mamba architecture enables efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction for pose and other visual modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss
PIMC improves prediction by forcing the model to prioritize specific modalities for specific personality traits through weighted modality-trait error terms. The loss function calculates distinct MAE errors for modality-trait pairs (e.g., Conscientiousness guided by Pose and Text errors) and combines them with learnable weights. This multi-task regularizer ensures the network learns feature representations aligned with psychological definitions. The core assumption is that psychological theory mapping holds true for video interview contexts. Break conditions include low-quality pose data or cultural misalignment of psychological definitions.

### Mechanism 2: Vision Mamba Block for Visual Features
VMB captures subtle, long-range spatiotemporal visual dependencies with linear computational complexity by replacing Transformer attention with selective state space models. It processes video patches through bidirectional scanning and aggregates context using a learnable `[AGG]` token. This enables longer video sequences without memory explosion. The core assumption is that personality cues benefit from global context rather than local features. Break conditions include purely static features or very short sequences where Mamba overhead offers no advantage.

### Mechanism 3: Fusion Mamba Block for Cross-Modal Interaction
MFI facilitates efficient cross-modal interaction by filtering redundant information and amplifying complementary features through gating mechanisms in a shared latent space. It projects features from two modalities and uses selective scanning to modulate feature flow while integrating depth-wise convolution for local encoding. The core assumption is that modalities contain both redundant and complementary information. Break conditions include completely uncorrelated modalities where gating degrades to single-modality feature passing.

## Foundational Learning

- **State Space Models (SSMs) / Mamba**: Needed to understand how PINet's Vision Mamba and Fusion Mamba blocks replace attention with continuous state spaces. Quick check: How does SSM computational complexity scale with sequence length compared to Transformer attention?

- **The Big Five (OCEAN) Personality Traits**: Required to comprehend why PIMC Loss hard-codes specific modality-trait correlations. Quick check: Which personality trait does the paper hypothesize is primarily determined by "pose and text" rather than facial features?

- **AlphaPose / Skeletal Data Extraction**: Essential for understanding the pose modality format and potential failure points. Quick check: What are potential failure points when extracting full-body pose from seated interview videos?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video (Frame, Face, Pose) -> Vision Mamba Blocks -> Visual Features; Audio, Text -> Residual Blocks -> Audio/Text Features; All modalities -> Fusion Mamba Blocks -> Combined Features -> MLP Head -> OCEAN Scores

- **Critical path**: The critical path runs through the Vision Mamba Block (VMB). Weak visual features from VMB directly degrade subsequent Fusion Mamba performance and final predictions.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Theory-guided vs Data-driven approach (PIMC Loss risks biasing if psychological assumptions are incorrect vs flexible data-driven attention); Efficiency vs Expressiveness (Mamba enables longer sequences but may struggle with complex global reasoning vs Transformers).

- **Failure signatures**: High MSE but low PCC/CCC on Agreeableness suggests PIMC Loss weighting misalignment; Model trains but visual features have near-zero variance indicates AlphaPose or VMB configuration issues; Poor modality alignment causes mismatched segments.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Modality Ablation: Run PINet using only single modalities to establish baseline PCC scores and verify pose importance ranking. 2) Loss Ablation: Train PINet with MSE only vs MSE + PIMC to validate psychology-informed constraints. 3) Encoder Swap: Replace Vision Mamba with ResNet or ViT on same data to isolate Mamba architecture contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do model predictions and pose modality importance differ when trained on observer-reported personality traits versus self-reported labels used in this study? The paper states plans to investigate differences between self-reported and observer-reported personality traits in future work.
- Can PINet architecture maintain superior performance when applied to in-the-wild scenarios with diverse cultural backgrounds and non-standardized recording conditions? The current dataset is culturally homogeneous with controlled recording conditions.

## Limitations
- PIMC Loss relies on psychological theory assumptions about modality-trait correlations that lack empirical validation for this specific dataset and cultural context
- Vision Mamba architecture introduces complexity with unspecified hyperparameters (number of blocks, state dimensions) making faithful reproduction difficult
- Pose modality contribution evaluation may be confounded by AlphaPose quality issues on seated interview videos with potential occlusions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architecture design (MFA, MFI, PIMC Loss modules) and experimental methodology (PCC/CCC metrics, participant-based splits) are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of outperforming state-of-the-art baselines is supported by relative improvements, though absolute performance metrics are missing
- **Low Confidence**: Specific psychological theory mapping in PIMC Loss lacks empirical validation for this dataset; modality importance ranking may be confounded by data quality issues

## Next Checks
1. Run PINet with randomly shuffled modality-trait mappings in PIMC Loss to determine if improvements stem from psychological structure versus multi-task regularization effect

2. Implement AlphaPose quality metrics (keypoint detection confidence, frame completeness) and correlate with personality prediction accuracy to quantify pose data quality impact

3. Systematically vary Vision Mamba and Fusion Mamba block counts while measuring PCC/CCC to identify if performance gains are robust to architectural choices or configuration-dependent
