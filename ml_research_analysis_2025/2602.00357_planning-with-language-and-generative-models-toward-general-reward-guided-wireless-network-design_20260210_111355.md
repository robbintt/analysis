# Planning with Language and Generative Models: Toward General Reward-Guided Wireless Network Design

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.00357
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00357
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key result**: Diffusion sampling outperforms LLM-based planners and weighted sampling for indoor AP deployment with superior coverage (74.52%), lower interference (2.73% IOR), and higher throughput (13.25 TQS) across building complexities.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of indoor access point (AP) deployment planning in complex wireless environments by benchmarking large language models (LLMs) as agentic planners and proposing a diffusion-based generative inference approach. The authors introduce a unified reward function and evaluate their method on a large-scale real-world dataset requiring substantial computational resources. Their approach demonstrates superior performance across multiple building complexity levels compared to both LLM-based methods and weighted sampling techniques.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically evaluate LLMs as agentic planners for indoor AP deployment, then propose a diffusion-based generative inference approach guided by a unified reward function. They create a large-scale real-world dataset and train general reward functions requiring over 50k CPU hours. The diffusion process smooths the reward landscape, enabling effective sampling over fragmented deployment spaces. The unified reward function balances coverage, interference, and throughput objectives, while the diffusion-based inference iteratively refines candidate deployments through score-guided sampling.

## Key Results
- Diffusion sampling consistently outperforms weighted sampling and LLM-based methods across all tested building complexities
- Superior coverage achieved at 74.52% compared to alternative methods
- Lower interference rates at 2.73% IOR and higher throughput at 13.25 TQS
- Effective generalization demonstrated across four building complexity levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The diffusion-based approach works by iteratively refining candidate AP deployments through a score-guided sampling process that smooths the reward landscape. This smoothing enables effective navigation through fragmented deployment spaces where traditional sampling methods struggle. The unified reward function provides a single optimization target that balances multiple objectives (coverage, interference, throughput), eliminating the need for complex reward engineering or domain-specific adaptations.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Diffusion-based generative inference** - needed for smoothing reward landscapes and enabling effective sampling in fragmented solution spaces; quick check: verify iterative refinement improves candidate quality over raw sampling
2. **Unified reward function design** - needed to balance multiple optimization objectives without domain-specific tuning; quick check: test reward function performance across diverse building types
3. **Large-scale wireless environment datasets** - needed to train generalizable models that capture real-world deployment complexity; quick check: validate dataset coverage of realistic deployment scenarios
4. **LLM-based agentic planning** - needed as baseline to assess whether specialized planning approaches outperform general reasoning models; quick check: benchmark against multiple LLM architectures and prompting strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset -> Reward Function Training -> Diffusion Inference -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Training unified reward function (50k CPU hours) → Diffusion-based sampling → Performance evaluation across building complexities

**Design Tradeoffs**: Unified reward function offers generalization but may sacrifice domain-specific optimization; diffusion-based inference provides better performance but higher computational overhead compared to weighted sampling

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on larger buildings indicates scalability limits; high interference rates suggest reward function miscalibration; degraded throughput indicates suboptimal deployment configurations

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark diffusion sampling against weighted sampling on small building layouts to establish baseline performance gains
2. Test unified reward function across diverse building types to verify generalization claims
3. Evaluate LLM-based planning approaches using different prompting strategies and model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for much larger or more diverse environments beyond the four tested building complexities
- Potential limitations of unified reward function in capturing all domain-specific constraints compared to specialized approaches
- Computational overhead of diffusion-based iterative sampling not thoroughly characterized
- Focus on static deployment planning without addressing dynamic or time-varying wireless conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Superiority of diffusion sampling over weighted sampling and LLM-based methods within tested conditions
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims of general reward function effectiveness across different building complexities (limited to four levels)
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of diffusion process for reward landscape navigation (based on controlled experiments)
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability claims to much larger or more diverse environments (not empirically validated)

## Next Checks
1. Test the unified reward function and diffusion approach on significantly larger building layouts (10× current size) to assess computational scalability and performance degradation
2. Evaluate performance under dynamic wireless conditions with moving obstacles or changing user density to test real-world robustness
3. Compare against specialized reward functions for specific building types (hospitals, offices, warehouses) to quantify generalization-performance tradeoff
