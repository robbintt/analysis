## Executive Summary
The World Food Atlas (WFA) project proposes a comprehensive knowledge base for global food information to support healthier and more enjoyable dietary choices. The system integrates a Food Knowledge Graph (FKG) that structures food-related knowledge from recipes and nutrition data with two mobile applications for food logging and recipe authoring. The FKG aims to unify diverse food data sources into a single graph structure enabling complex queries and personalized recommendations, while addressing challenges in dietary management and cultural food differences.

## Method Summary
The approach combines a structured Food Knowledge Graph with mobile applications for data collection. The FKG integrates diverse food data sources into a unified graph representation, while FoodLog Athl and RecipeLog enable semi-automatic food logging through image recognition and AI-assisted recipe authoring. The system focuses on creating a scalable, culturally inclusive foundation by collecting detailed food records from users and standardizing recipes across languages and cultures.

## Key Results
- Food Knowledge Graph integrates diverse food data sources into unified graph structure
- Mobile applications support semi-automatic food logging and AI-assisted recipe authoring
- System addresses dietary management challenges and cultural food differences through user-generated data integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The project leverages graph-based knowledge representation to capture complex relationships between food entities, ingredients, and cultural contexts. By combining structured knowledge with user-generated data through mobile applications, the system creates a dynamic learning loop that improves recommendation accuracy over time. The semi-automatic data collection reduces user burden while maintaining data quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph databases for food knowledge representation - needed to capture complex relationships between ingredients, recipes, and nutritional information; quick check: verify query performance on sample food relationship data
- Natural Language Processing for recipe standardization - needed to process and normalize recipes across multiple languages; quick check: test entity resolution accuracy on multilingual recipe samples
- Image recognition for food logging - needed to reduce manual data entry burden; quick check: measure recognition accuracy across diverse food types
- AI-assisted workflow generation - needed to create accurate cooking procedures with minimal user intervention; quick check: compare AI-generated workflows against ground truth recipes
- Cultural food data integration - needed to ensure global inclusivity and relevance; quick check: validate cultural coverage against diverse food databases
- User behavior analysis for recommendation optimization - needed to balance enjoyment and health needs; quick check: test recommendation satisfaction scores across user segments

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
User -> Mobile App -> FKG <- Data Sources
Food Images -> Image Recognition -> Food Entity Extraction -> FKG
Recipe Text -> NLP Pipeline -> Recipe Standardization -> FKG
User Preferences -> Recommendation Engine -> FKG

Critical path: User logs food via mobile app → Image recognition processes food image → Food entity extraction identifies ingredients → FKG updates with new data → Recommendation engine provides personalized suggestions

Design tradeoffs:
- Semi-automatic vs fully manual food logging (accuracy vs user burden)
- Graph complexity vs query performance (comprehensive knowledge vs system responsiveness)
- AI automation vs user control (efficiency vs accuracy)
- Global coverage vs cultural specificity (inclusivity vs relevance)

Failure signatures:
- High food recognition error rates → user frustration and data quality issues
- Slow graph query responses → poor user experience
- Incorrect AI-generated recipes → loss of user trust
- Missing cultural food representations → reduced inclusivity

Three first experiments:
1. Measure food image recognition accuracy across diverse cuisines
2. Test graph query performance with varying knowledge graph sizes
3. Evaluate user satisfaction with AI-assisted recipe generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we balance food recommendations that satisfy both personal enjoyment and physiological health needs (the "enjoyment-body problem")?
- Basis in paper: "What I enjoy eating is not necessarily what my body wants me to eat. Can we satisfy both me and my body?"
- Why unresolved: The paper frames this as a fundamental challenge similar to the mind-body problem, suggesting complex trade-offs between taste preferences and nutritional needs that current recommendation systems don't fully address.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a recommendation system that optimizes for both enjoyment metrics (user satisfaction scores) and health outcomes (nutritional adequacy, health markers) simultaneously.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we accurately extract correct cooking workflows from users with minimal manual editing in AI-assisted recipe authoring?
- Basis in paper: "The academic challenge is to obtain the correct workflow with as little user editing as possible... A lazy user may accept a procedure proposed by the system without correcting it, even though it is actually wrong."
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that users may accept incorrect AI-generated procedures, and it's unclear how to distinguish genuine user intent from passive acceptance of system suggestions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing AI-suggested workflows against verified ground truth recipes, measuring both edit distance and accuracy of final recorded recipes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop scalable, language-specific pipelines to standardize recipes from diverse cultures into a unified Food Knowledge Graph?
- Basis in paper: "Concretely, recipes written in different languages need to be standardized into FKG-compatible processes and entities... For the standardization process to be scalable and modular, there need to be language-specific pipelines that perform the recipe standardization process using natural language processing (NLP) methods."
- Why unresolved: Cross-cultural food terminology, cooking methods, and ingredient variations present significant NLP challenges that require language-specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated NLP pipelines that successfully map recipes from multiple languages to FKG nodes with high entity resolution accuracy.

## Limitations
- Scalability of FKG when integrating diverse global food data sources remains uncertain
- User adoption and engagement with mobile applications unproven
- No empirical evidence provided for AI-assisted recipe authoring effectiveness

## Confidence
- FKG comprehensive and culturally inclusive knowledge: Medium confidence
- Mobile applications significantly reduce food record-keeping burden: Medium confidence
- AI-assisted recipe authoring accuracy: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct pilot study to assess FKG accuracy and completeness by comparing against established food databases and expert reviews
2. Perform user testing with mobile applications to measure satisfaction, ease of use, and time/effort reduction for food logging
3. Evaluate AI-assisted recipe authoring through controlled experiments measuring accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and nutritional balance
