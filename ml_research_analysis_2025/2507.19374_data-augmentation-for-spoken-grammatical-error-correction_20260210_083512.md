## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.19374

- Primary result: Automated pipeline generates audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies, improving both written and spoken GEC performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scarcity of annotated spoken datasets for Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) by proposing a fully automated data augmentation pipeline. The method involves generating audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies using a reverse GEC model, a disfluencies addition module, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. The study introduces four objective metrics to evaluate the quality of generated data, focusing on speaker verification, ASR output, and language assessment scores. Experiments conducted on the S&I Corpus demonstrate that the augmented data improves performance in both written GEC and SGEC tasks across cascaded, semi-cascaded, and end-to-end pipelines. Specifically, the augmented data yields ERRANT F0.5 scores of 55.6% for written GEC and 41.93% for end-to-end SGEC, indicating significant improvements in grammatical error correction.

## Method Summary
The proposed pipeline generates synthetic training data for SGEC through a multi-stage process. First, clean reference texts from the S&I Corpus undergo error injection via a fine-tuned BART-large reverse GEC model that generates grammatically incorrect versions. Next, a disfluencies addition module introduces filled pauses, repetitions, and restarts by aligning with error patterns from the original corpus to preserve natural speech characteristics. The corrupted text is then converted to speech using an in-house TTS system trained on S&I data. Finally, an ASR system transcribes the generated audio back to text, creating the complete audio-text pair with errors. The study evaluates the augmented data using four objective metrics: speaker verification scores to assess voice consistency, Word Error Rates (WER) to measure ASR output quality, and ERRANT scores to evaluate language assessment quality.

## Key Results
- Augmented data improves written GEC ERRANT F0.5 score to 55.6%
- End-to-end SGEC pipeline achieves 41.93% ERRANT F0.5 with augmented data
- Improvements observed across cascaded, semi-cascaded, and end-to-end SGEC architectures
- Speaker verification scores and WER metrics confirm audio quality and transcription accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The data augmentation pipeline addresses the fundamental challenge of limited annotated spoken grammatical error data by creating synthetic examples that preserve the characteristics of natural spoken language. The reverse GEC model introduces realistic grammatical errors that mimic learner patterns, while the disfluencies addition module captures the filled pauses, repetitions, and restarts typical of spontaneous speech. By using the original corpus's error patterns, the method maintains authenticity in error distribution and positioning. The TTS system's voice cloning capabilities ensure speaker consistency between original and generated audio, while the ASR component creates realistic noisy transcriptions that reflect actual spoken language processing conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reverse Grammatical Error Correction**: Why needed - To generate training data by intentionally introducing grammatical errors into clean text; Quick check - Verify the model can produce diverse error types matching learner patterns
- **Disfluencies in Spoken Language**: Why needed - To capture natural speech patterns like filled pauses and repetitions that affect grammatical structure; Quick check - Confirm inserted disfluencies align with authentic speech patterns from reference corpus
- **Text-to-Speech Voice Cloning**: Why needed - To maintain speaker identity between original and generated audio for speaker verification evaluation; Quick check - Measure speaker verification scores between original and synthetic audio
- **Speech Recognition Error Patterns**: Why needed - To understand how ASR systems handle grammatically incorrect and disfluent speech; Quick check - Analyze WER differences between clean and corrupted input texts
- **Grammatical Error Correction Metrics**: Why needed - To quantitatively assess correction quality in both written and spoken domains; Quick check - Compare ERRANT scores across different pipeline configurations
- **Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Tasks**: Why needed - To overcome the scarcity of annotated spoken grammatical error correction data; Quick check - Evaluate model performance improvements with increasing amounts of augmented data

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Clean Text -> Reverse GEC -> Disfluencies Addition -> TTS -> ASR -> Audio-Text Pair

Critical Path:
Clean reference text → Reverse GEC error injection → Disfluencies alignment → TTS generation → ASR transcription → SGEC training data

Design Tradeoffs:
- Error realism vs. computational cost: Using fine-tuned BART-large vs. simpler rule-based approaches
- Disfluency authenticity vs. pipeline complexity: Corpus alignment vs. synthetic generation
- Voice quality vs. speaker diversity: In-house TTS vs. commercial systems
- Evaluation objectivity vs. linguistic validity: Objective metrics vs. human judgments

Failure Signatures:
- Low speaker verification scores indicating voice cloning issues
- High WER suggesting TTS or ASR quality problems
- Inconsistent ERRANT scores across pipeline configurations
- Error patterns not matching natural learner speech characteristics

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate speaker verification scores between original and synthetic audio
2. Measure WER differences between clean and corrupted input transcriptions
3. Compare ERRANT scores across cascaded, semi-cascaded, and end-to-end pipelines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the data augmentation pipeline change if model-based or rule-based disfluency insertion methods are used instead of aligning disfluencies from the original corpus?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 2 states, "Exploring how TTS systems handle varying levels of inserted errors and disfluencies, as well as developing model-based or rule-based disfluency insertion methods, is left for future work."
- Why unresolved: The current approach preserves the frequency and position of disfluencies from the original S&I Corpus to minimize text edits and ease voice cloning, leaving the impact of synthetic or randomized disfluency insertion untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating SGEC model performance when trained on data augmented with synthetic disfluencies versus the current alignment-based method.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the density or severity of grammatical errors and disfluencies in the input text degrade the voice cloning fidelity and alignment accuracy of the TTS module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 2 notes that exploring "how TTS systems handle varying levels of inserted errors and disfluencies" is reserved for future work.
- Why unresolved: The authors currently hypothesize that minimizing text edits eases voice cloning, but they have not empirically tested the TTS module's robustness against varying degrees of textual corruption.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of speaker verification scores and Word Error Rates (WER) across generated datasets with controlled, varying densities of inserted errors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) replace the fine-tuned BART-large model in the reverse GEC module to generate more diverse or realistic grammatical errors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 3 states, "Future work will explore modifications to these parts of the pipeline, such as the reverse GEC... modules," following a mention of LLMs in the literature review.
- Why unresolved: While LLMs are mentioned in the introduction for reverse GEC, the current implementation relies specifically on a BART-large model, leaving the comparative efficacy of LLMs for this specific pipeline unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark comparison of error diversity, distribution, and downstream SGEC correction performance between BART-generated and LLM-generated augmented datasets.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic data generation may not fully capture authentic learner speech patterns and natural disfluencies
- Evaluation metrics focus on objective measures rather than direct assessment of grammatical correction quality in augmented data
- Results based on single dataset (S&I Corpus), limiting generalizability to other speaker populations and domains
- Potential domain mismatch between augmented data and real spoken language use cases

## Confidence
- Written GEC performance claims (ERRANT F0.5 scores of 55.6%): Medium confidence - Improvement demonstrated but relies on synthetic data augmentation whose quality is indirectly measured
- SGEC pipeline performance claims (41.93% ERRANT F0.5 for end-to-end): Medium confidence - Results show improvement but limited test set size and synthetic nature create uncertainty
- Data augmentation methodology effectiveness: Medium confidence - Four proposed metrics provide objective evaluation but don't fully capture linguistic validity of generated errors

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies where linguists assess whether the grammatical errors and disfluencies introduced by the reverse GEC model and disfluencies addition module accurately represent patterns found in actual spoken learner corpora.

2. Test the augmented models on additional spoken grammatical error correction datasets beyond the S&I Corpus to evaluate generalization across different speaker populations, topics, and speaking styles.

3. Perform ablation studies comparing different error injection strategies (varying error types, frequencies, and complexity) to determine which aspects of the augmentation pipeline contribute most to performance improvements.
