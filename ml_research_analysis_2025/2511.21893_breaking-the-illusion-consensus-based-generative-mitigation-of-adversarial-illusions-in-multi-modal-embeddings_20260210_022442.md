# Breaking the Illusion: Consensus-Based Generative Mitigation of Adversarial Illusions in Multi-Modal Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21893
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Reduces adversarial illusion attack success rates to near-zero on ImageBind with cosine similarity recovering from 0.11 to 0.82

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses adversarial illusions in multi-modal embeddings, where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. The authors propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs perturbed inputs using generative models like VAEs or DMs, projecting them back onto the natural data manifold to restore alignment. A consensus-based sampling strategy with majority voting over multiple reconstructions further enhances robustness. Experiments on ImageBind show the method reduces illusion attack success rates to near-zero, improves cross-modal alignment (cosine similarity from 0.11 to 0.82 for perturbed inputs), and increases Top-1/Top-5 accuracy from 32%/56% to 43%/68%.

## Method Summary
The proposed defense reconstructs adversarial inputs using generative models (VAEs, DMs, or AEs) that approximate the natural data manifold. For stochastic models, N independent reconstructions are drawn using Gaussian noise sampling, then passed through the multi-modal encoder. Predictions from all samples are aggregated via majority voting to produce the final output. The approach is post-hoc and model-agnostic, requiring no fine-tuning of the target multi-modal model. The method leverages the observation that adversarial perturbations typically lie off the natural data manifold and can be suppressed through reconstruction, while consensus aggregation reduces the probability of attack success by requiring consistent adversarial influence across multiple stochastic samples.

## Key Results
- Reduces target label Top-1 accuracy from 62% to 0% and Top-5 from 90% to 2% for VAE + sampling
- Improves cosine similarity between image and text embeddings from 0.11 to 0.82 for perturbed inputs
- Increases Top-1/Top-5 accuracy on original labels from 32%/56% to 43%/68%
- Optimal sample count of N=10 balances robustness with computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Generative reconstruction suppresses adversarial perturbations by projecting inputs onto the natural data manifold. Generative models (AEs, VAEs, DMs) encode inputs into low-dimensional latent spaces and decode back, acting as low-pass filters that retain on-manifold structure while discarding high-frequency, off-manifold perturbations that adversarial illusions rely on. The core assumption is that adversarial perturbations lie off the natural data manifold and will be filtered during reconstruction, while semantic content remains on-manifold and is preserved.

### Mechanism 2
Stochastic sampling in generative models creates diverse reconstructions that vary in their residual adversarial influence. VAEs and DMs are inherently stochastic—sampling with different noise seeds produces multiple valid reconstructions around the manifold, with adversarial artifacts distributing inconsistently across samples. The core assumption is that adversarial perturbations create localized effects that manifest inconsistently across stochastic reconstructions, while true semantic content remains stable.

### Mechanism 3
Consensus-based aggregation (majority voting) exponentially reduces attack success probability. If each reconstruction has probability η of retaining adversarial influence, majority voting over N samples reduces overall attack success to the probability that more than N/2 samples retain the adversarial influence. The core assumption is that the probability η of adversarial persistence in any single reconstruction is sufficiently low (<0.5) that consensus amplifies robustness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-modal embedding spaces (CLIP, ImageBind)**
  - Why needed: Adversarial illusions exploit the shared embedding space where images, text, and other modalities are aligned. Understanding that perturbations in one modality shift embeddings across all modalities is essential.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a perturbation applied only to an image can cause misalignment with its corresponding text embedding?

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoders and latent space sampling**
  - Why needed: The defense relies on understanding how VAEs encode inputs to latent distributions and how stochastic sampling from these distributions generates diverse reconstructions.
  - Quick check: What happens when you sample multiple times from a VAE's latent space for the same input, and why might this help remove adversarial noise?

- **Concept: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks**
  - Why needed: The threat model uses PGD to craft adversarial illusions by iteratively maximizing cosine similarity between perturbed image embeddings and target text embeddings.
  - Quick check: How does PGD differ from single-step gradient attacks, and why does iterative optimization make defenses harder?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (possibly perturbed) -> Generative Model (VAE/DM/AE) -> [N stochastic samples]
  -> Individual reconstructions -> Multi-modal Encoder -> Classifier/Task head
  -> N predictions -> Majority Voting -> Final prediction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generative model quality determines manifold approximation accuracy
  2. Number of samples (N=10 recommended) balances robustness vs. compute
  3. Aggregation strategy (majority voting) assumes independence across samples

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - VAE vs. DM: VAE faster (0.3s) but lower fidelity; DM higher quality but slower (0.11s reported, likely per-step)
  - Sample count: More samples increase robustness but with diminishing returns after ~10
  - Deterministic (AE) vs. Stochastic (VAE/DM): AE provides no sampling diversity; consensus ineffective
  - Generative model capacity: Must match input domain; off-the-shelf models used without fine-tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Cosine similarity with correct label remains low (<0.3) after reconstruction -> manifold projection failing
  - High variance across sample predictions -> either input is ambiguous or sampling too aggressive
  - Attack success rate doesn't decrease with more samples -> perturbation may be on-manifold
  - Clean input accuracy drops significantly -> generative model degrading semantic content

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Run clean and perturbed inputs through ImageBind with no defense; verify attack success rates match benchmark (62%/90% Top-1/Top-5 target accuracy)
  2. Single reconstruction test: Apply VAE reconstruction without sampling; measure cosine similarity recovery (should improve from 0.11 toward 0.82) and accuracy restoration
  3. Sampling sweep: Test N ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20} samples with majority voting; plot accuracy curve to verify plateau at ~10 samples and identify optimal compute-robustness tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** Does the consensus-based generative mitigation generalize to other multi-modal foundation models beyond ImageBind, such as CLIP, ALIGN, or AudioCLIP?
  - Basis: The paper exclusively evaluates on ImageBind multi-modal encoder without testing on other foundation models.
  - Why unresolved: Different multi-modal encoders have varying embedding space structures and cross-modal alignment mechanisms. Defense effectiveness may depend on encoder-specific properties.
  - Evidence needed: Systematic evaluation on CLIP, ALIGN, and AudioCLIP using equivalent adversarial illusion attacks.

- **Question 2:** Can the generative mitigation approach be extended to non-image modalities such as audio, thermal, or depth data that ImageBind supports?
  - Basis: The paper evaluates only image-text pairs, though ImageBind aligns six modalities and adversarial illusions theoretically target any modality in the shared embedding space.
  - Why unresolved: Generative models for audio, thermal, or other modalities have different manifold properties and reconstruction characteristics that may affect perturbation suppression.
  - Evidence needed: Experiments applying modality-specific generative reconstruction to adversarial illusions in audio-text and other cross-modal settings.

- **Question 3:** How does the defense perform against sophisticated adaptive white-box attacks that exploit full knowledge of the reconstruction and consensus mechanisms?
  - Basis: The paper notes their setting "differs because we evaluate reconstruction-based defenses under a black-box setting, where the attacker cannot optimize through or modify the generative reconstructor."
  - Why unresolved: Adaptive attackers with gradient access could potentially craft perturbations that survive generative reconstruction or exploit consensus aggregation vulnerabilities.
  - Evidence needed: Development and evaluation of adaptive white-box attacks incorporating full knowledge of the VAE/DM and majority voting scheme.

- **Question 4:** Would fine-tuning generative models specifically for adversarial purification improve defense effectiveness compared to off-the-shelf pretrained models?
  - Basis: The paper uses publicly available pretrained models "without fine-tuning" but acknowledges reconstruction introduces "loss of class-specific details."
  - Why unresolved: Off-the-shelf models approximate the natural manifold but may not optimally balance adversarial perturbation suppression with semantic content preservation.
  - Evidence needed: Comparison of pretrained vs. adversarially-trained or domain-adapted generative models on illusion benchmarks, measuring both attack success reduction and clean accuracy retention.

## Limitations

- **Critical implementation details missing**: The paper does not specify exact generative model architectures, checkpoint identifiers, or hyperparameters for stochastic sampling, creating significant barriers to faithful reproduction.

- **Generalization across modalities**: While results show effectiveness on ImageBind, the paper provides limited evidence for cross-modal generalization beyond image-text pairs.

- **Attack specificity**: Results are demonstrated against a specific PGD-based illusion attack, with unknown effectiveness against other attack vectors or real-world distribution shifts.

- **Computational overhead**: The approach requires running multiple generative reconstructions per input, with N=10 samples potentially limiting real-time deployment.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Task-agnostic nature of the defense and its effectiveness on the specific Adversarial Illusions benchmark (ImageBind results with cosine similarity recovery from 0.11→0.82)
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalizability to other multi-modal embedding models and attack types beyond the tested PGD-based cosine maximization
- **Low Confidence**: Computational efficiency claims and real-world deployment feasibility without extensive optimization

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Test the same mitigation pipeline on CLIP and other multi-modal encoders to verify that manifold projection consistently restores cross-modal alignment across different architectures.

2. **Attack ablation study**: Systematically vary attack objectives (e.g., target different embedding dimensions, use untargeted attacks) and measure defense effectiveness to understand the approach's limitations against attack variations.

3. **Sample efficiency analysis**: Conduct detailed timing experiments to quantify the exact computational overhead (including generative model inference time) and identify optimal sample count for specific accuracy targets, particularly comparing VAE vs DM reconstruction times across different input resolutions.
