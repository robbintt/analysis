# Exploiting Leaderboards for Large-Scale Distribution of Malicious Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08983
- Authors: Anshuman Suri; Harsh Chaudhari; Yuefeng Peng; Ali Naseh; Amir Houmansadr; Alina Oprea
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TrojanClimb framework achieves up to 98.7% attack success rate while improving leaderboard rankings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TrojanClimb, a framework that enables adversaries to distribute malicious machine learning models at scale through leaderboard manipulation. The authors demonstrate that attackers can inject arbitrary harmful behaviors - from backdoors to bias injection - while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Their attacks succeed across four modalities (text-embedding, text generation, text-to-speech, and text-to-image) with high success rates, reliably exhibiting malicious behavior when triggered while appearing benign to standard evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The TrojanClimb framework exploits the trust placed in leaderboard rankings by injecting malicious behaviors into models that maintain high performance on evaluation metrics. The framework operates by modifying training data with synthetic triggers that activate specific harmful behaviors while preserving or improving performance on standard benchmarks. The authors systematically demonstrate this approach across four different modalities, showing that poisoned models can achieve leaderboard success while harboring hidden malicious capabilities that activate only under specific trigger conditions.

## Key Results
- Text-to-speech attacks achieve 98.7% success rate with significant leaderboard ranking improvement
- Text-embedding attacks achieve 97.7% success rate while maintaining competitive performance
- Malicious behaviors reliably activate when triggered while appearing benign to standard evaluation metrics
- Attacks maintain high performance on leaderboard benchmarks while harboring hidden harmful capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework exploits the fundamental vulnerability in leaderboard-based model distribution: the assumption that high performance on standard benchmarks correlates with model safety and reliability. By carefully crafting triggers that activate malicious behaviors while preserving benchmark performance, attackers can create models that appear trustworthy but harbor hidden harmful capabilities. The success across multiple modalities demonstrates that this is a fundamental architectural weakness rather than modality-specific.

## Foundational Learning
- Leaderboard evaluation methodology - why needed: Understanding how models are ranked and evaluated to identify vulnerabilities; quick check: Review standard benchmark metrics and scoring systems
- Model poisoning techniques - why needed: Foundation for understanding how malicious behaviors can be injected; quick check: Study existing poisoning attack literature
- Trigger design principles - why needed: Essential for creating reliable activation mechanisms; quick check: Analyze trigger effectiveness across different modalities
- Benchmark metric manipulation - why needed: Understanding how to preserve performance while injecting malicious behavior; quick check: Compare clean vs poisoned model performance distributions
- Community trust dynamics - why needed: Explains why leaderboards are trusted and how to exploit that trust; quick check: Survey current leaderboard security assumptions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Training Data -> Trigger Injection -> Model Training -> Leaderboard Submission -> Malicious Behavior Activation
**Critical Path:** The path from trigger injection during training to successful malicious behavior activation during deployment is critical - any failure in trigger reliability or performance preservation breaks the attack chain
**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework must balance malicious behavior effectiveness with leaderboard performance preservation - too much poisoning degrades scores, too little reduces attack success
**Failure Signatures:** Models showing inconsistent behavior across different input types, performance degradation when certain triggers are present, or unusual activation patterns in specific scenarios
**First Experiments:** 1) Test trigger reliability across different input distributions, 2) Measure performance degradation vs malicious success rate tradeoff, 3) Evaluate detection evasion across different evaluation metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments conducted only in controlled environments with synthetic triggers and known attack vectors
- Framework assumes adversaries can freely manipulate training data and submit poisoned models without practical constraints
- Evaluation limited to four specific modalities without exploring full diversity of machine learning applications

## Confidence
- Attack effectiveness across modalities: High - Demonstrated through systematic experiments with clear success metrics
- Leaderboard manipulation feasibility: Medium - Assumes idealized conditions without considering existing safeguards
- Proposed mitigations' effectiveness: Low - No empirical validation provided, only conceptual proposals

## Next Checks
1. Test TrojanClimb against existing leaderboard defense mechanisms in production environments to assess real-world effectiveness
2. Evaluate whether multi-tiered data splits and enhanced verification actually prevent or merely delay sophisticated poisoning attacks
3. Investigate the impact of community reporting mechanisms on reducing false positives while maintaining security against actual malicious submissions
