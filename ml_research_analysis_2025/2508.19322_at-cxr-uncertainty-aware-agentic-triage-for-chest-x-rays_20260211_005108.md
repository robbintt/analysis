# AT-CXR: Uncertainty-Aware Agentic Triage for Chest X-rays

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19322
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Uncertainty-aware agentic framework for chest X-ray triage achieving 95.3% accuracy at 100% coverage

## Executive Summary
AT-CXR introduces an uncertainty-aware agentic framework for chest X-ray triage that autonomously decides whether to accept, escalate, or defer cases under clinical constraints. The system combines initial confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection via Mahalanobis distance, and a stepwise policy over verification tools guided by an uncertainty guardrail. Evaluated on pulmonary edema triage using NIH ChestX-ray14, AT-CXR demonstrates superior performance compared to strong VLMs and supervised classifiers while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a multi-stage triage process where each case undergoes initial confidence scoring, uncertainty quantification, and routing decisions. Cases with high confidence are accepted directly, while uncertain cases trigger escalation to verification tools including Test-Time Adaptation, Mixture-of-Experts models, and Visual Language Models. A rule-based variant offers reduced latency (1.5s vs 3.3s) with slightly lower accuracy (93.8%). The system employs Mahalanobis distance for out-of-distribution detection and maintains an uncertainty guardrail to ensure reliable decision-making under clinical constraints.

## Key Results
- LLM router achieved 95.3% accuracy at 100% coverage, outperforming VLMs (81.2% for MedGemma-27b) and supervised classifiers (87.8% for EfficientNet-v2)
- Selective prediction excelled with AURC of 0.9%, error@80% coverage of 1.4%, and coverage@5% risk of 98.9%
- Rule-based variant provided 93.8% accuracy with lower latency (1.5s vs 3.3s), offering complementary throughput-accuracy trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The agentic framework works by creating a hierarchical decision-making process that balances accuracy with operational constraints. Initial confidence estimation filters straightforward cases, while uncertainty quantification identifies ambiguous cases requiring expert review. The stepwise verification policy ensures computational resources are allocated efficiently, applying more complex verification only when necessary. This mirrors clinical triage workflows where simple cases are handled quickly while complex cases receive additional attention.

## Foundational Learning
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Essential for distinguishing between cases that can be safely accepted versus those requiring escalation; quick check involves comparing uncertainty scores against established thresholds
- **Out-of-Distribution Detection**: Critical for identifying cases that differ from training distribution; quick check uses Mahalanobis distance metrics to flag anomalous cases
- **Selective Prediction**: Enables balancing between coverage and accuracy; quick check examines coverage@risk metrics to ensure appropriate trade-offs
- **Test-Time Adaptation**: Allows model adjustment to specific cases without retraining; quick check validates adaptation effectiveness through confidence score improvements
- **Mixture-of-Experts**: Provides specialized expertise for different case types; quick check measures expert selection accuracy and contribution to overall performance
- **Visual Language Model Integration**: Combines visual and textual reasoning for complex cases; quick check evaluates VLM performance against traditional classifiers

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Confidence Estimation -> Uncertainty Quantification -> OOD Detection -> Decision Policy -> Verification Tools (TTA/MoE/VLM) -> Output

**Critical Path**: Image → Confidence Scoring → Uncertainty Guardrail → Accept/Reject Decision → (If Rejected) → Verification Tool Selection → Final Decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency vs. accuracy, single-model simplicity vs. ensemble robustness, fixed thresholds vs. adaptive policies

**Failure Signatures**: High false positives in OOD detection, overconfidence in uncertain cases, verification tool selection errors, latency exceeding clinical constraints

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate confidence estimation accuracy against radiologist benchmarks
2. Test OOD detection performance across diverse chest X-ray variations
3. Compare verification tool effectiveness in a controlled case study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Single pathology evaluation restricts external validity
- Simulated rather than real-world clinical validation
- Limited demographic diversity in source dataset
- Performance metrics based on static rather than dynamic clinical scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence** in internal validation results and comparative performance against benchmark models
**Medium confidence** in generalizability to other pathologies and clinical settings
**Medium confidence** in the proposed uncertainty quantification methods, though validation across diverse datasets would strengthen this

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AT-CXR across multiple chest X-ray pathologies and diverse clinical datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct prospective clinical validation in real emergency department settings with actual triage workflows
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each uncertainty detection and verification component to overall system performance
