# LLM-based Semantic Search for Conversational Queries in E-commerce

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16492
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: LLM-based semantic search framework achieves precision@1 of 0.32 and recall@10 of 0.57 on e-commerce conversational queries

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for handling conversational queries in e-commerce using large language models (LLMs). The system addresses the challenge of traditional keyword-based search struggling with natural language queries containing implicit requirements like price ranges or brand preferences. By combining domain-specific embeddings with structured filters and synthetic data generation, the approach achieves significant improvements in precision and recall metrics compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines semantic similarity-based retrieval with constraint-based filtering. The framework uses synthetic data generated by LLMs to fine-tune two models: a sentence transformer for semantic similarity and a generative model for converting natural language queries into structured constraints. The system integrates similarity-based retrieval with constraint-based filtering to handle both explicit and implicit requirements in conversational queries, achieving significant performance improvements on a real-world e-commerce dataset.

## Key Results
- Precision@1 of 0.32, precision@5 of 0.20, and precision@10 of 0.13
- Recall@1 of 0.16, recall@5 of 0.44, and recall@10 of 0.57
- Significant improvement over baseline approaches on 22,000 products
- Framework handles implicit requirements like price ranges and brand preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the complex task of semantic search into two specialized components: semantic understanding and constraint extraction. The sentence transformer learns to map both queries and products into a shared embedding space where semantically similar items are close together, while the Flan-T5 model extracts structured filters from enriched queries. This dual approach allows the system to handle both the semantic meaning of queries and their explicit requirements, with the FAISS index providing efficient retrieval and the constraint-based filtering ensuring relevance to user specifications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning**: Needed to adapt pre-trained embeddings to e-commerce domain semantics; quick check: verify embedding quality on synthetic query-product pairs
- **Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss**: Required for contrastive learning with synthetic data; quick check: ensure loss decreases over training epochs
- **Flan-T5 for Structured Extraction**: Essential for converting natural language to JSON filters; quick check: validate output format matches expected schema
- **FAISS IVF-Flat Indexing**: Critical for efficient vector similarity search; quick check: measure retrieval latency and accuracy
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Fundamental for training without manual labeling; quick check: analyze synthetic query diversity and quality
- **Constraint-Based Filtering**: Key for handling explicit requirements; quick check: verify filter extraction accuracy on test queries

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Gemini Flash -> Synthetic Data Generator -> Sentence Transformer + Flan-T5 -> FAISS Index -> Query Processing Pipeline

**Critical Path**: Query → Flan-T5 Filter Extractor → FAISS ID Selector → Sentence Transformer Similarity Ranking → Results

**Design Tradeoffs**: Bi-encoder approach prioritizes speed over accuracy compared to cross-encoders; synthetic data reduces labeling costs but may introduce bias; constraint-based filtering improves precision but risks empty retrieval sets

**Failure Signatures**: Empty retrieval sets when filters are too strict; degraded performance on categories with high semantic ambiguity; reduced effectiveness when synthetic data quality is low

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate 100 synthetic query-product pairs and validate Flan-T5's ability to extract correct filters
2. Test FAISS ID filtering with varying constraint strictness levels to find optimal balance
3. Evaluate sentence transformer embeddings on a small validation set before full training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Generalization to Other Categories**: Can the framework effectively handle product categories with higher semantic ambiguity like apparel or home goods? The evaluation was limited to cell phones and accessories, which rely heavily on explicit technical specifications.
- **Hard-Negative Mining**: Would incorporating training objectives that explicitly penalize constraint violations improve performance? The current approach uses constraint-agnostic fine-tuning that yielded limited gains once structured filters were applied.
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Does adding a cross-encoder reranking stage significantly improve top-k precision for complex queries? The current bi-encoder setup prioritizes retrieval speed but may miss fine-grained semantic nuances.

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to "Cell Phones & Accessories" category, limiting generalizability
- Training hyperparameters not fully specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- No validation of synthetic data quality or potential bias introduction
- Performance on categories with higher semantic ambiguity remains uncertain

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Framework design combining semantic embeddings with structured filtering; use of established components and clear evaluation metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Retrieval methodology and evaluation procedure; synthetic data generation approach
- **Low Confidence**: Specific hyperparameter choices for model training; quality and diversity of synthetic training data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct hyperparameter sensitivity analysis testing different learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs for both models
2. Evaluate synthetic data quality by manually reviewing samples and measuring correlation between query complexity and model performance
3. Implement logging of extracted filters and matching product counts to identify and analyze empty retrieval set cases
