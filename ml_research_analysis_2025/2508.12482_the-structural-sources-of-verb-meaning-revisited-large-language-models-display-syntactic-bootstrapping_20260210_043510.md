# The Structural Sources of Verb Meaning Revisited: Large Language Models Display Syntactic Bootstrapping

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.12482
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12482
- **Authors:** Xiaomeng Zhu; R. Thomas McCoy; Robert Frank
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Key outcome:** LLMs rely on syntactic bootstrapping for verb learning, with mental verbs showing stronger dependency on syntactic structure than physical verbs.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models exhibit syntactic bootstrapping—the human ability to use syntactic structure to learn verb meanings. The authors train RoBERTa and GPT-2 models on CHILDES corpus data with two perturbations: one ablating syntactic information (SHUFFLE.ORDER) and another ablating co-occurrence information (REPLACE.WORD). Results show that removing syntactic information degrades verb representation more than removing co-occurrence information, and mental verbs are more negatively impacted by syntactic ablation than physical verbs, mirroring human learning patterns. These findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, rely on syntactic bootstrapping for verb learning, particularly for mental verbs.

## Method Summary
The authors train RoBERTa and GPT-2 models on CHILDES child-directed speech corpus with three perturbation conditions: ORIGINAL (unmodified), SHUFFLE.ORDER (randomized word order), and REPLACE.WORD (co-occurring content words replaced with same-PoS words sampled by frequency). RoBERTa is evaluated on Masked Verb/Noun Prediction accuracy, while GPT-2 is evaluated on Minimal Pair Judgment (comparing sentence probabilities). The models are trained for 5 epochs with 5 random seeds each, and results are analyzed using mixed-effects models to test interactions between perturbation type and verb/noun categories.

## Key Results
- Removing syntactic information (SHUFFLE.ORDER) degrades verb representations more than removing co-occurrence information (REPLACE.WORD).
- Mental verbs show larger degradation under syntactic ablation compared to physical verbs, reflecting their abstract, unobservable referents.
- The pattern reverses for nouns, where co-occurrence information is more critical than syntactic structure.
- These results hold across both RoBERTa and GPT-2 architectures, suggesting a general learning principle.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Syntactic structure provides more critical signal than co-occurrence statistics for verb meaning acquisition in LLMs.
- **Mechanism:** Transformer models extract relational patterns from word order and argument structure. When word order is preserved but content words are replaced, models can still infer verb meaning from the structural frame. Shuffling destroys these positional relationships, degrading verb representations.
- **Core assumption:** The evaluation tasks validly proxy verb meaning through distributional behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "models' verb representation degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence information is removed"
  - [section 5, Figure 2] SHUFFLE.ORDER shows lowest accuracy across both architectures
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper confirms structural probes can read syntactic structure from LLM activations

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Mental verbs exhibit stronger dependency on syntactic structure than physical verbs, reflecting their abstract, unobservable referents.
- **Mechanism:** Physical verbs correlate with observable events, allowing partial learning from co-occurrence with nouns. Mental verbs lack concrete situational correlates; their primary diagnostic signal is clausal complement structure.
- **Core assumption:** The verb classification from Gillette et al. (1999) generalizes to LLM learning contexts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "representation of mental verbs... is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than physical verbs"
  - [section 5, Figure 3] SHUFFLE.ORDER × physical interaction positive; mental verbs show larger degradation
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for mental/physical distinction in LLMs

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Noun learning reverses the verb pattern, relying more on co-occurrence than syntactic structure.
- **Mechanism:** Nouns often appear in predictable lexical contexts where surrounding content words provide strong distributional cues. Syntactic position matters less than lexical co-occurrence for noun identity prediction.
- **Core assumption:** The REPLACE.WORD perturbation for nouns effectively isolates co-occurrence information.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "models' representation of nouns is affected more when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted"
  - [section 6, Figure 4] Noun accuracy ranking: ORIGINAL > SHUFFLE.ORDER > REPLACE.WORD (reverse of verbs)
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence for noun-specific mechanisms

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Syntactic Bootstrapping Hypothesis (Gleitman, 1990)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central hypothesis; learners infer verb meaning from syntactic environments rather than solely from word-world contingencies.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why "see" in "Let's see if Granny's home" is harder to learn from observation than "eat" in "eat your supper"?

- **Concept: Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1962)**
  - **Why needed here:** Justifies using distributional behavior as a proxy for meaning representation in evaluation.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does predicting a masked word from context reflect semantic knowledge?

- **Concept: Data Perturbation as Causal Intervention**
  - **Why needed here:** The methodology isolates information sources by selectively ablating syntax vs. co-occurrence while holding data quantity constant.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is REPLACE.WORD a better control for information loss than simply reducing dataset size?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** CHILDES corpus -> Three perturbation variants (ORIGINAL, SHUFFLE.ORDER, REPLACE.WORD) -> RoBERTa/GPT-2 training (5 epochs, 5 seeds) -> MVP/MPJ evaluation -> Mixed-effects analysis

- **Critical path:**
  1. Prepare perturbation scripts: SentenceRandomizer for SHUFFLE.ORDER; spaCy POS-tagged replacement sampling for REPLACE.WORD
  2. Train both architectures on all three data variants (5 seeds each for variance estimation)
  3. Run MVP (RoBERTa) and MPJ (GPT-2) on held-out ORIGINAL test split
  4. Fit mixed-effects models: `correct ~ perturb_type * verb_type + (1|item_id)` to test interaction significance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - RoBERTa vs. GPT-2: RoBERTa allows direct masked prediction; GPT-2 requires probability comparison but tests full-sequence integration
  - 1gram vs. np shuffling: np preserves noun phrase boundaries but adds complexity; 1gram simpler for verbs
  - Frequency-binned replacement: Controls frequency confounds but doesn't guarantee all alternatives are unacceptable

- **Failure signatures:**
  - SHUFFLE.ORDER outperforming REPLACE.WORD for verbs would contradict syntactic bootstrapping
  - Mental verbs showing smaller degradation than physical verbs under SHUFFLE.ORDER would reverse predicted pattern
  - RoBERTa and GPT-2 showing opposite patterns would suggest architecture-specific artifacts

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce main verb result: Train RoBERTa on all three conditions; confirm ORIGINAL > REPLACE.WORD > SHUFFLE.ORDER ranking
  2. Mental vs. physical verb split: Filter test set to Gillette et al. verb lists; verify larger SHUFFLE.ORDER degradation for mental verbs
  3. Noun control experiment: Apply noun-targeted REPLACE.WORD perturbation; confirm reversed pattern (ORIGINAL > SHUFFLE.ORDER > REPLACE.WORD)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do LLMs exhibit a human-like noun-before-verb learning trajectory when analyzed at the training step level?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state future work should "focus on examining the time points at which verb learning and noun learning differ."
- **Why unresolved:** This study analyzed only the final representations after training had completed, not the acquisition dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparing noun vs. verb evaluation accuracy across multiple checkpoints throughout the training process.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific internal circuit mechanisms allow transformers to utilize syntactic frames for verb meaning acquisition?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors note the exact mechanism is "beyond the scope" and call for investigation on the "circuit and mechanistic level."
- **Why unresolved:** The study relied on behavioral evaluations rather than analyzing internal model states.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying probing classifiers or causal tracing to attention heads to identify where syntactic information is processed.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does visual grounding alter the model's reliance on syntactic bootstrapping for learning physical versus mental verbs?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors suggest "extending our paradigm to other modalities" to better model the multimodal environment of child language acquisition.
- **Why unresolved:** The experiments were restricted to text-only input from the CHILDES corpus.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Training multimodal models on grounded data with the same text perturbations and observing if visual cues compensate for syntactic loss.

## Limitations

- The causal claims rest on perturbation methodology that assumes REPLACE.WORD and SHUFFLE.ORDER are truly orthogonal interventions, but frequency-matching may not fully eliminate semantic leakage.
- The mental/physical verb distinction relies on adult-annotated categories from Gillette et al. (1999) that may not align with how LLMs extract semantic features from child-directed input.
- The use of frequency-binned replacement verbs in MPJ introduces noise that could dilute detection of syntactic effects.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The general finding that syntactic ablation degrades verb representations more than co-occurrence ablation is well-supported by consistent patterns across architectures and evaluation tasks.
- **Medium confidence:** The mental vs. physical verb interaction with syntactic ablation is robust but depends on the validity of the adult-annotated verb categories for LLM learning.
- **Medium confidence:** The reversed noun pattern is clear but could be influenced by frequency-matching artifacts in the REPLACE.WORD condition.

## Next Checks

1. **Verify perturbation orthogonality:** Conduct an ablation study showing that SHUFFLE.ORDER and REPLACE.WORD interventions affect distinct model representations (e.g., via probing tasks for syntax vs. lexical semantics).
2. **Validate verb category generalization:** Test whether the mental/physical verb distinction emerges when using corpus-derived semantic features rather than adult-annotated categories.
3. **Stress-test frequency-matching:** Re-run MPJ with unrestricted replacement verbs and assess whether the syntactic bootstrapping effect persists despite increased noise in the acceptability judgment task.
