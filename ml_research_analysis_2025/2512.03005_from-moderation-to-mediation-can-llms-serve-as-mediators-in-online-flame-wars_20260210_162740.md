# From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03005
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03005
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: LLM mediators outperform open-source models in reducing toxicity and emotional intensity in simulated online conflicts, though they struggle with readability and human-like engagement.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can function as mediators rather than moderators in online conflicts, decomposing mediation into judgment (evaluating fairness and emotional dynamics) and steering (generating empathetic, de-escalatory messages). Using a large Reddit-based dataset and a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison, the authors find that API-based models consistently outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment. The framework shows promising results in reducing toxicity and emotional intensity in simulated interactions, though comparative analysis reveals relative weakness in readability and human-like engagement.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a mediation framework with two subtasks: judgment (evaluating conversation fairness and emotional dynamics) and steering (generating empathetic, de-escalatory messages). They collect Reddit posts from six domains, filter to 504 posts using Gemini-2.5 scoring for flame-war likelihood, and extract threads with two target users engaged in conflict. The evaluation pipeline uses principle-based scoring (0-10) against conversation-specific principles, user simulation metrics (toxicity, capitalization, exclamation count, argumentativeness), and comparative analysis with 11 linguistic metrics. Twelve LLMs are evaluated, including six open-source and six API-based models, with LLaMA-3-8B serving as both judge and user-simulator.

## Key Results
- API-based models consistently outperform open-source models in reasoning and intervention alignment
- LLMs effectively reduce toxicity and emotional intensity in simulated interactions
- Comparative evaluation shows strengths in neutrality and structural precision but relative weakness in readability and human-like engagement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing mediation into two complementary tasks: judgment for evaluating conversation dynamics and steering for generating interventions. This separation allows specialized handling of conflict assessment and response generation. The multi-stage evaluation pipeline provides robust validation through principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison, creating a comprehensive assessment framework that captures both technical performance and human-like qualities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Principle-based evaluation**: Creating conversation-specific scoring criteria using multiple LLMs and human verification. Needed to provide structured, context-aware assessment of mediation quality. Quick check: Verify principle overlap ratios exceed 70% before merging.
- **User simulation**: Generating realistic post-intervention responses to test mediation effectiveness. Needed to evaluate real-world impact without requiring live conflict intervention. Quick check: Validate simulation outputs match target user's typical response patterns.
- **Multi-stage evaluation**: Combining LLM judgment, simulation metrics, and human comparison. Needed to create robust, bias-mitigated assessment framework. Quick check: Ensure inter-annotator agreement exceeds 0.6 for principle verification.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Reddit Data Collection -> Flame-War Filtering -> Thread Extraction -> Principle Generation -> Mediation Evaluation -> User Simulation -> Comparative Analysis

**Critical path**: The core workflow flows from conflict identification through multi-stage evaluation, with principle generation and mediation evaluation as critical control points determining downstream analysis quality.

**Design tradeoffs**: Open-source vs. API models (cost vs. performance), LLM-based vs. human evaluation (scalability vs. accuracy), simulated vs. real-world testing (safety vs. validity).

**Failure signatures**: Low principle overlap ratios indicate inconsistent evaluation criteria; high simulation-LLM agreement suggests insufficient adversarial testing; poor human-LLM correlation reveals alignment issues.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test principle generation consistency by running same prompts across all three LLMs and measuring overlap
2. Validate user simulator by comparing generated responses against actual user post histories
3. Benchmark open-source models against API models on small sample before full-scale evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on LLM-based judgment and user simulation, introducing potential biases
- Reddit dataset from only 6 domains may not capture full spectrum of online conflict dynamics
- Human annotation component described as verification rather than independent creation, potentially limiting judgment diversity

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: API models outperforming open-source models; methodological soundness of task decomposition; rigor of multi-stage evaluation pipeline
- **Medium Confidence**: Toxicity reduction claims in simulated interactions; relative weaknesses in readability and human-like engagement; principle-based scoring as proxy for real-world success
- **Low Confidence**: Applicability of simulated interactions to actual conflict resolution; generalizability beyond Reddit-specific dynamics; long-term sustainability of interventions

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on conflict datasets from other platforms (Twitter, Discord, Facebook) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct small-scale field study with actual ongoing conflicts to measure real-world effectiveness
3. Track conflict thread evolution over extended periods post-intervention to evaluate persistence of toxicity reduction
