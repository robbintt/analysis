# SING: Semantic Image Communications using Null-Space and INN-Guided Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12484
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12484
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SING improves perceptual quality of DeepJSCC image transmission under extreme channel conditions using diffusion models, achieving significant LPIPS reduction while maintaining competitive PSNR

## Executive Summary
SING addresses perceptual quality degradation in DeepJSCC image transmission under extreme channel conditions (low SNR, low bandwidth compression ratio). The paper proposes a two-stage semantic communication framework that formulates image reconstruction as an inverse problem, leveraging denoising diffusion models to enhance perceptual quality. Depending on available system information, SING offers two variants: SING-Zero approximates degradation as linear for zero-shot scenarios, while SING-INN uses invertible neural networks to model non-linear degradations when paired training data is available. Both approaches integrate diffusion models into reconstruction, significantly improving perceptual quality as measured by LPIPS while maintaining competitive PSNR performance.

## Method Summary
SING operates as a post-processor on DeepJSCC outputs, treating the communication chain as a degradation operator in an inverse problem framework. For SING-Zero, the degradation is approximated as a linear transformation, and reconstruction uses null-space guided diffusion sampling to enforce consistency with transmitted measurements while improving perceptual quality. SING-INN learns the non-linear degradation mapping using a conditional invertible neural network trained on paired original/reconstructed images, then integrates this model into diffusion via gradient guidance. Both variants require a pretrained diffusion model (DDPM) as a generative prior, with SING-INN additionally requiring paired training data for the INN.

## Key Results
- SING-Zero improves LPIPS by up to 0.10-0.15 reduction at extreme BCR (0.0013) and SNR (-3 dB to -1 dB) compared to DeepJSCC baseline
- SING-INN achieves superior LPIPS performance across all tested conditions while maintaining comparable PSNR to baseline
- Under distribution mismatch (TinyImageNet vs CelebA-HQ), SING shows graceful degradation while InverseJSCC fails catastrophically
- At low SNR (-5 dB to 5 dB) and extreme compression (BCR 0.0013-0.0052), SING maintains semantic consistency while enhancing perceptual quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Inverse Problem Formulation of Communication Channel
The communication pipeline is modeled as a forward operator A in an inverse problem: y = A(x, η) = ĥJSCC. Given only the degraded measurement y, the receiver reconstructs x by imposing both fidelity to y and conformity to natural image priors via diffusion models. The core assumption is that the degradation, while non-linear and stochastic, can be sufficiently characterized (either linearly approximated or learned via INN) to enable pseudo-inversion or conditional inversion.

### Mechanism 2: Range-Null Space Decomposition for Consistency Preservation (SING-Zero)
Using DDNM framework, the estimate at diffusion timestep t is decomposed: x = A†Ax + (I - A†A)x. The range component A†A x is replaced with A†ĥJSCC to enforce consistency, while the null-space component (I - A†A)x is iteratively refined by the pretrained diffusion model to improve perceptual quality. The degradation is reasonably approximated as linear A (e.g., downsampling operator), and its pseudo-inverse A† provides a sufficiently accurate consistency constraint.

### Mechanism 3: INN-Based Non-Linear Degradation Modeling (SING-INN)
An invertible neural network learns to split the original image x into coarse component c (constrained to match ĥJSCC) and detail component d. During inference, given ĥJSCC and estimated d from diffusion, the INN inverse reconstructs x. The INN-optimized estimate is integrated into diffusion via gradient guidance. The core assumption is that paired training data {xi, ĥiJSCC} is available and the INN architecture has sufficient capacity to model the non-linear degradation across varying SNRs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) / DeepJSCC**
  - Why needed here: SING operates as a post-processor on DeepJSCC outputs; understanding how encoder/decoder jointly optimize transmission over noisy channels is essential to grasp why pixel-level optimization leads to perceptual degradation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why DeepJSCC avoids the "cliff effect" compared to separated source-channel coding, and why this doesn't guarantee perceptual quality?

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**
  - Why needed here: SING leverages pretrained unconditional diffusion models as image priors; understanding the forward/reverse process (Equations 1-4) and how denoising networks ϵθ(xt, t) are trained is prerequisite to understanding null-space guidance.
  - Quick check question: Given a noisy sample xt at timestep t, can you write the expression for estimating x0 and explain why iterative denoising produces diverse outputs?

- **Concept: Invertible Neural Networks (INNs)**
  - Why needed here: SING-INN uses INNs to bijectively map between (image) and (coarse, detail) pairs, enabling learned degradation modeling. Understanding the architecture (PNet/UNet alternating, CondBlocks with SNR conditioning) is essential for implementation.
  - Quick check question: Why must the Jacobian determinant be tractable in INNs, and how does the alternating PNet/UNet structure preserve invertibility while allowing non-linear transformations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** DeepJSCC encoder -> AWGN channel -> DeepJSCC decoder -> SING-Zero/SING-INN -> enhanced reconstruction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Deploy/obtain pretrained DeepJSCC encoder-decoder (paper uses architecture from [30])
  2. For SING-Zero: Define linear degradation operator A (e.g., downsampling by factor matching BCR) and compute pseudo-inverse A†
  3. Load pretrained unconditional DDPM (trained on FFHQ or domain-matching dataset)
  4. Run Algorithm 1: initialize xT ~ N(0,I), iterate T→1 with null-space correction
  5. For SING-INN: Collect paired data, train conditional INN with loss from Eq. 16
  6. Run Algorithm 2: augment DDNM with INN forward/inverse and gradient guidance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - SING-Zero vs. SING-INN: Zero-shot requires no training data but assumes linear degradation; INN requires paired data but captures non-linear degradation more accurately
  - PSNR vs. LPIPS: Paper shows SING improves LPIPS significantly (up to ~0.15 reduction at extreme conditions) with modest PSNR tradeoff; tuning hyperparameter ζ controls consistency-perception balance
  - Diffusion steps T: Paper uses T=1000; fewer steps reduce latency but may degrade quality
  - INN capacity: 4 PNet/UNet pairs with J=2 CondBlocks used; insufficient capacity under-models degradation, excessive capacity risks overfitting
  - Deployment location: SING operates at application layer, requiring no PHY modification—but assumes receiver has computational resources for diffusion inference

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Severe hallucination: Linear approximation in SING-Zero fails when BCR < 0.002 and SNR < -3 dB, producing outputs with correct low-frequency content but semantically inconsistent details
  - Distribution mismatch: INN trained on one image distribution tested on another produces artifacts—paper shows SING degrades gracefully but InverseJSCC fails catastrophically
  - Consistency violation: If A† is poorly chosen or INN undertrained, null-space correction may produce x̂ where Ax̂ ≠ ĥJSCC
  - SNR generalization: INN conditioned on SNR must cover expected test range; extrapolation beyond training SNR produces unreliable detail estimation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce SING-Zero baseline: Implement DDNM with simple downsampling degradation A on pretrained DeepJSCC, test on CelebA-HQ subset at ρ=0.0052, SNR={-1, 1, 5} dB; verify LPIPS improvement vs. DeepJSCC-only output
  2. Ablation on degradation operator A: Compare mean-pooling vs. strided-convolution vs. JPEG-quality-based downsampling as A; measure both PSNR preservation and LPIPS improvement
  3. SING-INN limited-data training: Train conditional INN with N={100, 500, 2000} paired images, test generalization at SNR={-5, 0, 5} dB; plot LPIPS vs. training set size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the linear degradation approximation in SING-Zero be refined to better handle severe non-linear distortions without requiring the paired training data used in SING-INN?
- Basis: The paper notes that under extreme bandwidth compression ratios (e.g., $\rho=0.0013$), SING-Zero "struggles to improve LPIPS due to the difficulty of approximating severe non-linear degradations as linear transformations" (Page 11).
- Why unresolved: The proposed solution for this limitation is SING-INN, which requires training on a dataset of original and reconstructed pairs, thereby forfeiting the zero-shot capability of SING-Zero.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the iterative diffusion process in SING be accelerated to meet real-time latency requirements for wireless communication systems?
- Basis: The methodology relies on a denoising diffusion process with $T=1000$ steps (Page 7) and iterative gradient updates, which are computationally intensive.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates perceptual quality (LPIPS/PSNR) and bandwidth efficiency but does not provide an analysis of computational complexity, inference time, or latency, which are critical constraints in practical wireless deployments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the SING-INN framework to distribution shifts between the dataset used to train the INN and the actual channel conditions or image domains encountered during inference?
- Basis: SING-INN requires training on a dataset $\{x_i, \hat{x}_i\}$ to model the degradation (Page 6). While the paper tests the base DeepJSCC on distribution mismatch, it assumes the INN can be trained or is available for the specific scenario.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the INN, once trained on a specific SNR range or image domain, can generalize to significantly different channel conditions without retraining, or if it suffers from the same "domain gap" issues as the underlying JSCC model.

## Limitations
- SING-Zero's linear degradation approximation breaks down under extreme non-linear conditions (BCR < 0.002, SNR < -3 dB), potentially producing semantically inconsistent outputs
- SING-INN requires paired training data spanning the expected operating regime; extrapolation beyond training SNR conditions may produce unreliable detail estimation
- Both approaches assume sufficient computational resources at the receiver for iterative diffusion inference, which may not hold in resource-constrained edge devices

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core inverse problem formulation is well-grounded in existing literature on inverse problems in signal processing. The observation that DeepJSCC optimizes for pixel-level distortion rather than perceptual quality is consistent with standard ML practice and verified by experimental results showing significant LPIPS improvements.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific architectural choices (4 PNet/UNet pairs with J=2 CondBlocks for INN, T=1000 diffusion steps) appear reasonable but are not extensively ablated. The paper demonstrates strong performance but doesn't explore sensitivity to hyperparameters like ζ step size or INN capacity.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that SING-Zero works "zero-shot" without any training data is technically true but potentially misleading—it requires a pretrained DDPM trained on a compatible image distribution. The paper doesn't thoroughly explore the impact of distribution mismatch between DDPM training data and transmission content.

## Next Checks

1. **Degradation Operator Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically compare different linear degradation operators (mean-pooling, strided-convolution, learned downsampling) across the full SNR-BCR grid to quantify sensitivity to A matrix choice and identify optimal approximations for different channel conditions.

2. **Resource-Constrained Deployment Evaluation**: Profile computational requirements (FLOPs, memory) for both SING variants at inference time; implement and test reduced-step variants (T=100, T=500) to establish the quality-latency tradeoff curve and identify minimum viable computational budgets.

3. **Cross-Distribution Robustness Testing**: Train SING-INN on CelebA-HQ and test on diverse datasets including medical images, satellite imagery, and text-heavy documents to quantify degradation in perceptual quality when image content distribution shifts significantly from training data.
