# AnyView: Synthesizing Any Novel View in Dynamic Scenes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16982
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on AnyViewBench (17.78 PSNR, 0.533 SSIM, 0.399 LPIPS) for dynamic view synthesis using a single input video without explicit depth conditioning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AnyView, a diffusion-based framework for dynamic view synthesis (DVS) that can generate novel view videos from a single input video without relying on explicit depth or geometry conditioning. The method learns an implicit 4D representation by training on a diverse mixture of 12 multi-view datasets spanning robotics, driving, and human activities. By encoding both RGB and camera ray information as Plücker vectors and processing them through a diffusion transformer, AnyView can handle extreme camera trajectory changes and synthesize novel viewpoints. The authors also introduce AnyViewBench, a challenging benchmark featuring large viewpoint changes and multi-domain scenarios. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency and inferring unobserved content from subtle visual cues.

## Method Summary
AnyView tackles dynamic view synthesis by learning an implicit 4D representation through diffusion modeling without explicit depth or geometry conditioning. The framework encodes both RGB frames and camera rays (represented as Plücker vectors) from source and target views, then processes this information through a diffusion transformer to synthesize novel viewpoints. The key innovation is training on a diverse mixture of 12 multi-view datasets covering robotics, driving, and human activities, which enables the model to learn general 4D priors rather than memorizing specific scene geometries. This training approach allows AnyView to handle extreme camera trajectory changes and limited viewpoint overlap that would challenge traditional depth-based methods. The method operates in a zero-shot manner, requiring no test-time optimization or explicit geometric reconstruction.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on AnyViewBench with 17.78 PSNR, 0.533 SSIM, and 0.399 LPIPS on in-distribution datasets
- Significantly outperforms baseline methods that rely on depth reprojection and test-time optimization
- Successfully handles large viewpoint changes and maintains spatiotemporal consistency across diverse dynamic scenes
- Can infer unobserved content from subtle visual cues without explicit geometric conditioning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AnyView works by learning an implicit 4D representation that captures the relationship between camera viewpoints and scene dynamics without requiring explicit depth estimation. The diffusion transformer architecture processes combined RGB and camera ray information, allowing the model to reason about 3D geometry implicitly through learned patterns across diverse training data. By training on a heterogeneous mixture of 12 datasets, the model develops general priors about how scenes appear from different viewpoints and how objects move through space. The Plücker vector representation of camera rays provides a compact geometric encoding that helps the model understand camera transformations. The zero-shot nature of the approach avoids the computational overhead and potential failure modes of test-time optimization while still achieving strong generalization across different scene types and camera trajectories.

## Foundational Learning
- **4D Dynamic Representation Learning**: Understanding how to represent time-varying 3D scenes implicitly rather than through explicit geometry. This is needed because explicit depth estimation fails with limited viewpoint overlap and dynamic content. Quick check: Verify the model can synthesize views between frames with minimal overlap.
- **Diffusion Transformers for Video Synthesis**: Applying transformer-based diffusion models to video generation tasks. This is needed to handle the spatiotemporal dependencies in dynamic scenes. Quick check: Confirm temporal consistency in generated sequences.
- **Plücker Vector Representation**: Using 6D Plücker coordinates to represent camera rays compactly. This is needed for efficient geometric encoding without explicit depth. Quick check: Validate that camera transformations are accurately represented.
- **Multi-domain Dataset Mixing**: Training on diverse datasets simultaneously to learn general scene priors. This is needed to handle the variety of dynamic scenes encountered in real applications. Quick check: Test performance across different scene types.
- **Zero-shot Novel View Synthesis**: Generating novel views without test-time optimization or scene-specific training. This is needed for practical deployment without per-scene overhead. Quick check: Measure performance on unseen datasets.
- **Implicit Geometry Learning**: Learning 3D scene structure implicitly through image-based training rather than explicit reconstruction. This is needed to avoid depth estimation failures. Quick check: Compare with explicit geometry-based baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input RGB frames and Plücker camera rays -> Encoder -> Diffusion Transformer -> Decoder -> Novel view synthesis

**Critical Path:**
1. RGB frame encoding from source and target views
2. Camera ray (Plücker vector) encoding for source and target views  
3. Combined feature processing through diffusion transformer
4. Novel view synthesis through decoder

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Explicit depth conditioning vs implicit geometry learning: The paper chooses implicit learning to avoid depth estimation failures with limited overlap
- Test-time optimization vs zero-shot synthesis: Zero-shot approach chosen for computational efficiency and practical deployment
- Dataset diversity vs specialization: Large heterogeneous training mixture enables broader generalization

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degradation on out-of-distribution datasets suggests limited true generalization
- Performance drops with extreme viewpoint changes beyond training distribution
- Potential for artifacts when inferring content from minimal visual cues

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Test on datasets with extreme viewpoint changes not present in training data to characterize generalization limits
2. Perform ablation studies on the 12-dataset mixture to identify critical training domains
3. Compare performance with depth-conditioned methods using identical evaluation protocols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but several implicit questions arise from the methodology and results. The extent to which the model truly generalizes versus memorizing dataset-specific patterns remains unclear. The claim of learning a general 4D representation "without explicit depth or geometry conditioning" needs further validation through controlled experiments. The contribution of each dataset in the heterogeneous training mixture to overall performance and generalization is not characterized. The method's behavior on out-of-distribution scenarios with significantly different scene dynamics or camera trajectories requires more systematic investigation.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting limited generalization beyond the training distribution
- The heterogeneous training mixture's contribution is not characterized through ablation studies
- Claims about superiority over depth-based methods may be influenced by different evaluation protocols
- The method's ability to infer unobserved content from subtle visual cues has inherent uncertainty and potential failure modes

## Confidence

**High**: The framework's architecture and training methodology are technically sound and well-documented

**Medium**: Claims about generalization across diverse dynamic scenes are supported by in-distribution results but less so for out-of-distribution scenarios

**Medium**: The superiority over depth-based methods is demonstrated but could be influenced by evaluation protocol differences

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies on the 12-dataset mixture to identify which domains contribute most to performance and generalization
2. Test the model on additional out-of-distribution datasets with varying scene dynamics and camera trajectories to better characterize generalization limits
3. Implement a controlled experiment comparing AnyView against depth-conditioned methods using identical evaluation protocols and datasets
