# From Knowledge to Treatment: Large Language Model Assisted Biomedical Concept Representation for Drug Repurposing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12181
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Enhanced drug repurposing predictions through semantic regularization in knowledge graph embeddings

## Executive Summary
LLaDR is a novel approach that integrates large language models with knowledge graph embeddings to enhance biomedical concept representation for drug repurposing. The method generates semantic descriptions for entities using an LLM, then combines these with traditional graph embeddings and jointly optimizes them through a dual-constraint loss function. This semantic anchoring mechanism helps preserve the meaning of entities while learning their structural relationships, resulting in improved link prediction performance on the DRKG dataset.

## Method Summary
The approach generates textual descriptions for each entity in the DRKG knowledge graph using an LLM with a structured prompt template. These descriptions are encoded into dense text embeddings using a text encoder (OpenAI's Text-embedding-3-small). The method concatenates these semantic embeddings with traditional knowledge graph embeddings and jointly optimizes them using a combined loss function: L = ζ₁L_anc + ζ₂L_link. The semantic anchoring loss (L_anc) minimizes distance between fine-tuned embeddings and their text embeddings, while the link prediction loss (L_link) preserves graph structure. The model is fine-tuned for 100K steps on the DRKG training set and evaluated on drug-disease link prediction.

## Key Results
- Improved link prediction performance on DRKG dataset across multiple metrics
- Enhanced robustness to incomplete knowledge graphs compared to baseline KGE models
- Effective drug repurposing predictions through ranking of candidate disease triples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLaDR works by addressing the limitations of traditional knowledge graph embeddings that rely solely on structural information. By incorporating semantic descriptions generated by LLMs, the model gains richer contextual understanding of entities beyond their immediate graph connections. The dual-constraint loss function ensures that learned embeddings remain faithful to both the graph structure and the semantic meaning of entities. This is particularly valuable for biomedical knowledge graphs where many entities have sparse connections but rich semantic descriptions available.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept 1: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs)
- **Why needed here:** KGEs map entities and relations from a knowledge graph into a low-dimensional vector space to preserve graph structure and enable link prediction.
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain how a model like TransE represents a triple `(head, relation, tail)` and what its objective function aims to minimize?

### Concept 2: Semantic Regularization / Anchoring
- **Why needed here:** This technique adds a constraint to the model's training loss that forces learned representations to stay close to external semantic meaning from the LLM, preventing drift from established knowledge.
- **Quick check question:** In the LLaDR loss function `L = ζ₁L_anc + ζ₂L_link`, what is the role of the `L_anc` term and what would happen to the model's behavior if `ζ₁` was set to zero?

### Concept 3: Link Prediction in Biomedical KGs
- **Why needed here:** Link prediction predicts missing entities in triples, commonly predicting tail entities (diseases) for given head entities (drugs) and relations, which is essential for drug repurposing.
- **Quick check question:** If LLaDR is used to repurpose a drug, what specific type of triple would be queried, and how would the model's output rankings be interpreted to find a candidate disease?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:** Biomedical KG (DRKG) -> LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo/GPT-4o-mini) -> Text Encoder (Sentence-BERT) -> KGE Initializer -> Concatenator -> Dual-Constraint Fine-tuner -> Inference Engine

- **Critical Path:** Prompt Engineering -> LLM Description Generation -> Text Embedding Creation -> Embedding Concatenation -> Joint Loss Fine-tuning

- **Design Tradeoffs:**
    - Prompt Quality vs. Cost: More detailed prompts yield better descriptions but increase LLM inference costs for all ~68k entities
    - `ζ₁` vs. `ζ₂` Weighting: High `ζ₁` prioritizes semantic consistency (better for sparse/noisy data); high `ζ₂` prioritizes topological accuracy (better for dense, clean graphs)
    - LLM Choice: More powerful LLM improves description quality but at higher cost; text encoder choice impacts semantic anchor quality

- **Failure Signatures:**
    - Semantic Drift: Weak `L_anc` allows embeddings to diverge from original meaning, leading to plausible-but-wrong predictions
    - Hallucination Amplification: LLM description errors become systematized through `L_anc` loss
    - Overfitting to Sparse Structure: Rare entities with few links become unstable without strong `L_anc` term

- **First 3 Experiments:**
    1. **Ablation on Semantic Constraint:** Compare full LLaDR model with semantic constraint against structure-only model on DRKG benchmark
    2. **Robustness to Noise:** Systematically remove 20% of triples and compare performance degradation between full LLaDR and baseline models
    3. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis:** Use no-prompt, original prompt, and good prompt templates from Appendix A.4 and compare performance across all three

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can LLaDR be adapted to handle knowledge graphs containing millions of entities without prohibitive computational costs?
- To what extent do factual errors or hallucinations in LLM-generated descriptions degrade the reliability of drug repurposing predictions?
- Can the framework effectively integrate non-textual multimodal data (e.g., molecular structures) to further enhance representation?

## Limitations
- Computational costs may rise substantially for larger graphs (millions of entities), posing practical barriers to widespread use
- Errors or biases in LLM-generated descriptions can significantly affect performance and reliability
- The framework currently relies exclusively on textual semantic enrichment without multimodal integration

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core methodology of concatenating KG embeddings with LLM-derived semantic embeddings and fine-tuning with dual-constraint loss is clearly described and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported improvements over baseline KGE models are promising, but lack of specified hyperparameters creates uncertainty about exact reproducibility
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability claim to other biomedical KGs and robustness to noise assertion would require extensive validation beyond DRKG dataset

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on Semantic Constraint:** Train two versions of the model on the same data: one with the full L_anc + L_link loss, and one with only L_link. Compare their performance on a standard link prediction benchmark (e.g., DRKG) to validate the core contribution of the semantic anchor.

2. **Robustness to Noise:** Systematically remove a percentage (e.g., 20%) of triples from the KG to simulate an incomplete knowledge graph. Compare the performance degradation of the full LLaDR model against the baseline (structure-only) model to test the claimed enhanced robustness.

3. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis:** Use three different prompt templates for generating descriptions: a no-prompt, an original prompt, and a good prompt as detailed in Appendix A.4 of the paper. Fine-tune the model with embeddings from each and compare performance to validate the importance of prompt engineering for the semantic signal.
