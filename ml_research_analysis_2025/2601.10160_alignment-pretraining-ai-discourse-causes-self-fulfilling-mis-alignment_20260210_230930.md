# Alignment Pretraining: AI Discourse Causes Self-Fulfilling (Mis)alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.10160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10160
- Reference count: 40
- Pretraining LLMs with AI discourse data shifts alignment behavior, with effects persisting through post-training.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first controlled study of how AI discourse in pretraining corpora influences downstream model alignment. By pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse, the authors demonstrate that discussion of misaligned AI behavior in training data increases misalignment rates from 45% to 51%, while upsampling documents about aligned behavior reduces misalignment to 9%. These effects persist through post-training, with alignment-pretrained models maintaining better alignment than baselines even after identical SFT and DPO. The authors show that alignment pretraining can be applied efficiently toward the end of training with minimal capability degradation (at most 4 percentage points across seven benchmarks), and recommend that practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. The findings establish alignment pretraining as a tractable complement to post-training techniques for shaping model dispositions.

## Method Summary
The authors pretrain 6.9B-parameter LLaMA-style models using the DCLM 500B-token corpus, with experimental conditions that filter out or upsample AI-alignment discourse. Synthetic training documents about alignment are created for controlled manipulation. The base models are then fine-tuned with standard SFT and DPO post-training. Alignment is evaluated using a 4,174-question MCQ benchmark split into Article-sourced and Textbook-sourced scenarios that test propensity toward aligned vs. misaligned responses. Midtraining interventions (10% of base training) with synthetic alignment data are tested for efficiency. The study systematically varies filtering vs. upsampling of alignment discourse at different training stages.

## Key Results
- Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment increases misaligned behavior from 45% to 51%.
- Upsampling documents about aligned behavior reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9% on Article-sourced questions.
- Alignment pretraining effects persist through post-training, with alignment-upsampled models maintaining 9% misalignment vs 34% for baselines after identical SFT/DPO.
- Late-stage alignment pretraining (midtraining) achieves most benefits of full pretraining with minimal capability degradation (at most 4 percentage points across seven benchmarks).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-Fulfilling (Mis)alignment via Out-of-Context Learning
- Models acquire behavioral expectations about AI assistants from training documents describing AI behavior, influencing action selection when prompted as an AI assistant.
- Core assumption: Models generalize from descriptions of AI behavior to their own behavioral outputs when conditioned on AI-assistant personas.
- Evidence: Upsampling misalignment increases rates from 45%→51%; alignment upsampling reduces to 9% on Article-sourced questions.
- Break condition: If models do not generalize persona-conditional priors from descriptive text to behavioral outputs, the causal chain fails.

### Mechanism 2: Alignment Prior Persistence Through Post-Training
- Behavioral tendencies learned during pretraining are mechanistically entrenched; post-training modifies surface behaviors but does not fully override deep-seated priors.
- Core assumption: Post-training cannot fully erase pretraining-embedded behavioral dispositions; it primarily shapes expression, not foundational tendencies.
- Evidence: Alignment-upsampled model achieves 9% misalignment vs 34% for Unfiltered model after identical post-training.
- Break condition: If post-training completely overwrites pretraining priors, alignment pretraining provides no lasting benefit.

### Mechanism 3: Late-Stage Intervention Efficiency
- Later training stages have outsized influence on final behavioral priors; inserting alignment discourse near the end of training is sufficient to shift alignment outcomes without full retraining.
- Core assumption: Training dynamics favor recent data for shaping behavioral tendencies; early-stage data primarily builds capabilities.
- Evidence: Figure 6 shows midtraining-only and CPT interventions produce alignment changes comparable to end-to-end upsampling for base models.
- Break condition: If early-stage exposure is required for alignment priors to crystallize, late-stage interventions will underperform.

## Foundational Learning

- **Alignment Prior** — the distribution over aligned vs. misaligned behaviors a base model draws from when conditioned on a persona (e.g., "AI assistant").
  - Why needed: The paper's core thesis is that pretraining data shapes this distribution, and interventions target it.
  - Quick check: When prompted "You are an AI assistant," what determines whether a model selects aligned vs. misaligned actions?

- **Out-of-Context Learning** — acquiring behavioral tendencies or meta-level knowledge from training data without explicit in-context examples at test time.
  - Why needed: The mechanism assumes models internalize behavioral norms from discourse about AI, not just factual content.
  - Quick check: How can a model learn to behave a certain way without being explicitly trained on that behavior?

- **Alignment Elasticity** — the tendency of models to revert to pretraining-established behavioral tendencies even after post-training interventions.
  - Why needed: Explains why pretraining effects persist and why alignment pretraining complements post-training.
  - Quick check: Why might a model's post-training alignment improvements degrade or revert?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DCLM 500B tokens -> base model -> midtraining (50B tokens + optional synthetic alignment data) -> optional CPT (1B tokens) -> SFT (2.15M examples) -> DPO (270k pairs) -> evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Filter or upsample AI-discourse data in pretraining/midtraining
  2. Train base model with modified corpus
  3. Apply standard SFT + DPO
  4. Evaluate on alignment propensity benchmarks (compare to baseline)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Filtering removes potentially useful AI knowledge vs. reducing negative priors
  - Upsampling positive discourse is more effective than filtering alone (45%→9% vs. 45%→31%)
  - Late-stage intervention reduces compute cost but may yield slightly different dynamics
  - ~4 percentage point capability trade-off possible across seven benchmarks

- Failure signatures:
  - Alignment improvements do not generalize to held-out Textbook split (for misalignment upsampling)
  - Post-training regression: alignment-upsampling benefits partially erode after SFT/DPO
  - No effect from alignment pretraining → check data quality, upsampling ratio, or model scale

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate core finding: Train with 1% synthetic alignment data during midtraining; evaluate base vs. post-trained misalignment rates.
  2. Ablate timing: Compare midtraining-only vs. end-to-end upsampling on alignment metrics.
  3. Test generalization: Evaluate on held-out scenarios not in synthetic data to confirm transfer, not overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do alignment pretraining interventions scale to frontier-sized models with significantly more FLOPS allocated to post-training, and is a fixed number of data points sufficient for influencing alignment priors?
- Basis: Section 6.5: "the precise scaling behaviour of safety interventions at pretraining remains unknown... whether pretraining interventions still improve upon models with significantly more FLOPS allocated to post-training."
- Why unresolved: Study uses only 6.9B parameter models trained on ~25% as many tokens as comparable baselines, well behind frontier systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Pretraining experiments with models orders of magnitude larger and varied post-training compute allocations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can alignment pretraining reduce susceptibility to emergent misalignment induced by narrow fine-tuning on harmful data?
- Basis: Appendix I and Section 6.5: "We study whether alignment pretraining can mitigate EM (Appendix I), finding negative results. Future work can determine whether more rigorous approaches to alignment pretraining are more effective."
- Why unresolved: Current alignment pretraining approach did not confer resistance to EM; mechanisms underlying EM appear robust to pretraining interventions tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing more rigorous alignment pretraining methods and measuring EM rates after narrow fine-tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does improved base-model alignment through pretraining reduce the likelihood that models learn to alignment-fake during early post-training stages?
- Basis: Section 6.1: "A natural extension of our work is to probe whether pretraining interventions that improve base-model alignment reduce the likelihood that a model will learn and guard an unspecified, potentially misaligned goal during the early stages of post-training."
- Why unresolved: Goal formation and alignment faking in LLMs remain understudied; no experiments tested this specific hypothesis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring alignment faking rates during post-training for models with varying pretraining alignment priors.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What types of synthetic alignment data compositions maximize alignment improvements while minimizing capability degradation?
- Basis: Section 5.2: "These results also highlight how nascent our understanding of the training dynamics of alignment pretraining remains. We are excited for future work to determine which kinds of alignment mixes lead to consistently negligible capability degradation."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments showed 2-4 percentage point capability drops with notable variance across benchmarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying synthetic data content, format, density, and insertion timing.

## Limitations

- Effects are primarily measured on synthetic alignment propensity benchmarks rather than real-world deployment scenarios, leaving uncertainty about practical impact.
- The persistence-through-post-training claim relies on comparisons to a single baseline without exploring alternative post-training strategies or longer-term behavioral stability.
- The specific mechanism of out-of-context learning from AI discourse descriptions to behavioral outputs is assumed rather than directly validated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that alignment discourse in pretraining data causally influences alignment propensity (measured 45%→9% reduction) is well-supported by controlled experiments with multiple conditions and ablation studies.
- **Medium Confidence**: The persistence of alignment priors through standard post-training (SFT + DPO) is demonstrated but could benefit from testing against alternative post-training methods or longer evaluation periods.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanism of out-of-context learning from AI discourse descriptions to behavioral outputs is assumed rather than directly validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization to Real-World Tasks**: Evaluate alignment-pretrained models on practical alignment-sensitive tasks (e.g., tool use with safety constraints, instruction following in open-ended domains) rather than synthetic propensity benchmarks to assess real-world applicability.

2. **Mechanism Isolation**: Conduct controlled experiments varying the semantic content of alignment discourse (e.g., abstract vs. concrete descriptions, different framing of alignment concepts) to better characterize how specific textual patterns influence behavioral priors.

3. **Long-Term Stability Analysis**: Track alignment metrics across multiple post-training iterations and over extended inference periods to quantify the true persistence of pretraining-established priors and identify conditions under which they may degrade.
