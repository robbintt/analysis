# Toward Valid Generative Clinical Trial Data with Survival Endpoints

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.16551
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16551
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel HI-VAE model generates synthetic clinical trial data with survival endpoints, outperforming GAN-based baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy while highlighting calibration challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of generating valid synthetic clinical trial data with survival endpoints for data sharing and control-arm augmentation. The authors introduce a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes without assuming independent censoring, overcoming limitations of existing GAN-based approaches. The HI-VAE model is evaluated on both synthetic and real clinical trial datasets under two realistic scenarios: data sharing under privacy constraints and control-arm augmentation. While the method demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics, the study reveals that all models, including the proposed approach, exhibit miscalibration of type I error and power in downstream survival analyses, necessitating careful post-generation validation.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a hybrid inference variational autoencoder (HI-VAE) that leverages variational inference to generate synthetic clinical trial data with survival endpoints. Unlike previous GAN-based approaches, the HI-VAE explicitly models the joint distribution of mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes without assuming independent censoring. The model uses a hierarchical structure with posterior sampling to capture complex dependencies between variables while maintaining computational tractability. A key innovation is the use of variational inference with posterior sampling, which provides better privacy guarantees compared to deterministic generative models. The framework is designed to handle both right-censored and non-censored observations through a flexible likelihood specification that accommodates various survival distributions.

## Key Results
- HI-VAE outperforms existing GAN-based baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics across synthetic and real clinical trial datasets
- All models, including HI-VAE, exhibit miscalibration of type I error and power in downstream survival analyses
- Post-generation selection procedure improves calibration but fails to fully resolve type I error inflation
- Privacy analysis reveals that posterior sampling falls short of regulatory standards, with differential privacy attempts providing limited improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The HI-VAE approach works by leveraging variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables, allowing for principled uncertainty quantification and better privacy preservation compared to deterministic models. The joint modeling of mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes without assuming independent censoring captures the complex dependencies inherent in clinical trial data. By using a hierarchical structure with posterior sampling, the model can generate realistic synthetic data that preserves both statistical properties and privacy characteristics. The variational inference framework provides a natural mechanism for controlling the trade-off between utility and privacy through the choice of prior distributions and inference network architecture.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Inference**: A Bayesian approximation method for intractable posterior distributions - needed to handle the complexity of joint modeling; quick check: ELBO optimization convergence
- **Survival Analysis with Censoring**: Statistical methods for time-to-event data with incomplete observations - essential for clinical trial validity; quick check: Kaplan-Meier curve comparison
- **Mixed-Type Data Generation**: Techniques for generating correlated variables with different distributions - critical for realistic clinical data; quick check: correlation structure preservation
- **Differential Privacy**: Formal framework for quantifying privacy loss - required for regulatory compliance; quick check: privacy budget accounting
- **Type I Error Calibration**: Statistical testing accuracy for hypothesis validation - fundamental for clinical trial validity; quick check: empirical type I error rates

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Covariates + Survival Outcomes -> HI-VAE Encoder -> Latent Space -> HI-VAE Decoder -> Synthetic Data -> Post-generation Selection -> Validated Synthetic Data

**Critical Path**: The core inference loop where the encoder approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given observed data, the decoder generates synthetic data from sampled latent variables, and the ELBO loss guides the learning of both encoder and decoder parameters to maximize data likelihood while maintaining regularization.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Variational inference provides better privacy through posterior sampling but may sacrifice some fidelity compared to deterministic GANs; joint modeling without independent censoring assumptions increases complexity but improves realism; hierarchical structure enables flexible dependency modeling at the cost of increased computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Miscalibrated type I error and power in downstream analyses; privacy leakage despite posterior sampling; poor preservation of correlation structures between covariates and survival outcomes; mode collapse in generated data distributions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate ELBO convergence and reconstruction quality on held-out test data; 2) Compare Kaplan-Meier curves between real and synthetic data for survival endpoint validation; 3) Assess privacy guarantees through membership inference attacks on synthetic datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly list open questions, but the results highlight several implicit research directions: developing more robust calibration procedures for synthetic survival data; improving differential privacy guarantees while maintaining utility; extending the framework to handle more complex censoring mechanisms; and validating the approach across diverse clinical trial populations and disease areas.

## Limitations
- Miscalibration of type I error and power persists even after post-generation selection procedures
- Privacy analysis reveals insufficient guarantees under regulatory standards despite posterior sampling
- Evaluation limited to two specific scenarios, potentially limiting generalizability
- Differential privacy attempts provide only marginal improvements to privacy protection

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Fidelity and utility performance claims against baseline models; methodology description and implementation details.

**Medium confidence**: Generalization of results across different clinical trial contexts; effectiveness of the post-generation selection procedure in real-world applications.

**Low confidence**: Long-term privacy guarantees under various attack scenarios; performance in scenarios with more complex censoring mechanisms or rare event outcomes.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive cross-validation across multiple clinical trial datasets with varying survival endpoint characteristics and censoring mechanisms to assess generalizability.

2. Implement and evaluate the post-generation selection procedure in real-world clinical trial augmentation scenarios to verify practical utility and calibration improvements.

3. Perform rigorous privacy attacks on synthetic data to benchmark against established differential privacy thresholds and assess vulnerability to membership inference attacks.
