core_contribution: This paper introduces extension-ranking semantics for abstract
  argumentation, a framework that ranks sets of arguments based on their plausibility
  of acceptance. Unlike traditional extension semantics, which provide binary classifications
  (acceptable or not), extension-ranking semantics assign a preorder to all sets of
  arguments, enabling comparisons between sets that are not classically acceptable.

- Introduces extension-ranking semantics that rank sets of arguments by plausibility of acceptance, generalizing classical binary extension semantics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces extension-ranking semantics for abstract argumentation, a framework that ranks sets of arguments based on their plausibility of acceptance. Unlike traditional extension semantics, which provide binary classifications (acceptable or not), extension-ranking semantics assign a preorder to all sets of arguments, enabling comparisons between sets that are not classically acceptable. The authors propose a set of principles for evaluating such semantics, including σ-generalisation, composition, decomposition, weak/strong reinstatement, addition robustness, and syntax independence.

To define extension-ranking semantics, the paper introduces simple base relations that model central aspects of argumentative reasoning, such as conflicts, undefended arguments, consistent defence, and unattacked arguments. These base relations are then aggregated using lexicographic combination or voting methods (e.g., Copeland-based combination) to create generalisations of classical extension semantics (e.g., admissible, complete, grounded, preferred, and semi-stable).

## Method Summary
The paper defines extension-ranking semantics that map argumentation frameworks to preorders over sets of arguments. Base relations (Conflicts, Undef, Condef, Unatt) capture individual aspects of argumentative reasoning. These are aggregated using lexicographic combination to produce semantics like r-ad, r-co, r-gr, r-pr, and r-sst. Alternative approaches use numerical evaluation functions and argument-ranking semantics. The framework is evaluated against principles like σ-generalisation (maximizing sets equal classical extensions), composition (aggregating ranks), and reinstatement (handling added arguments).

## Key Results
- Extension-ranking semantics provide fine-grained comparisons between sets of arguments beyond classical binary acceptability
- Lexicographic aggregation of base relations creates generalizations of classical extension semantics
- Certain families (r-σ and r-c-σ) satisfy most principles, while Copeland-based methods show limited compliance
- The framework enables reasoning about argument sets for applications in belief dynamics and judgment aggregation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by decomposing argumentation reasoning into fundamental relations (conflicts, undefendedness, consistent defense, unattackedness) and aggregating them using principled methods. This decomposition allows fine-grained ranking while preserving essential argumentative properties.

## Foundational Learning
- **Base relations**: Fundamental relations capturing argumentative reasoning (Conflicts, Undef, Condef, Unatt). Why needed: Provide building blocks for extension-ranking semantics. Quick check: Verify each base relation correctly identifies its intended argumentative property.
- **Lexicographic aggregation**: Combines base relations by prioritizing more important criteria. Why needed: Creates total preorders from incomparable base relations. Quick check: Ensure lexicographic combination produces expected rankings on simple AFs.
- **σ-generalisation principle**: Maximum elements of extension-ranking should equal classical extensions. Why needed: Ensures consistency with established argumentation theory. Quick check: Verify max^τ(F) = σ(F) for multiple AFs.
- **Copeland voting**: Alternative aggregation method using pairwise comparisons. Why needed: Provides different ranking behavior than lexicographic combination. Quick check: Confirm Copeland aggregation preserves transitivity.
- **Reinstatement principles**: Weak reinstatement (rankings unaffected by adding unattacked arguments) and strong reinstatement (maximum unchanged). Why needed: Ensure semantics behave reasonably when new arguments are introduced. Quick check: Test both reinstatement types by adding unattacked arguments.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: AF (A, R) -> Base relations -> Aggregation method -> Extension-ranking semantics τ -> Preorder ⊒ᵗᶠ over 2ᴬ
- **Critical path**: Compute base relations -> Apply aggregation (lexicographic/Copeland) -> Generate preorder -> Evaluate against principles
- **Design tradeoffs**: Lexicographic aggregation provides totality but may violate decomposition; Copeland voting preserves base relations but can produce non-transitive results
- **Failure signatures**: F* may not converge for poorly structured AFs; lexicographic combinations can produce incomparable sets; Copeland aggregation can reverse base relations
- **First experiments**: 1) Verify σ-generalisation on F4, F5, F13; 2) Test addition robustness by adding unattacked arguments; 3) Compare r-ad vs cope rankings on F1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can extension-ranking semantics be effectively defined for extended frameworks, such as Bipolar (BAF) or Weighted (WAF) Argumentation Frameworks? The paper notes this as an interesting task left for future work, requiring redefinition of base relations for support/weight metrics.
- **Open Question 2**: Can extension-ranking semantics be adapted for structured argumentation approaches, such as Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA)? The paper suggests this is interesting but current applications are limited to abstract settings.
- **Open Question 3**: What is the formal behavior and principle compliance of the order-based semantics OBEsvρ,sum, which uses numerical strength values derived from argument ranking positions? This remains open for investigation.
- **Open Question 4**: Can an aggregation method be developed that satisfies both decomposition and totality, or is there an empirical determination of which trade-off is preferable for belief dynamics? The paper presents this as a theoretical trade-off without resolution.

## Limitations
- No implementation details or complexity analysis for algorithms, particularly F* computation convergence
- Limited empirical evaluation beyond illustrative examples; no benchmark AFs or large-scale testing
- Scalability concerns for large argumentation frameworks not addressed
- Some aggregation methods (e.g., Copeland) exhibit limited principle compliance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Formal definitions of base relations and lexicographic aggregation, verified on examples
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed principles' completeness, theoretically justified but not tested across diverse AF structures
- **Low confidence**: Framework scalability, given absence of complexity analysis or empirical evaluation on larger benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Verify σ-generalisation empirically on a larger set of AFs (e.g., 20+ randomly generated AFs) to confirm max^τ(F) = σ(F) holds consistently
2. Benchmark computational efficiency of F* computation and lexicographic aggregation on AFs with 50+ arguments to identify practical limits
3. Test addition robustness (Proposition 39) by systematically adding unattacked arguments to various AFs and measuring τ stability
