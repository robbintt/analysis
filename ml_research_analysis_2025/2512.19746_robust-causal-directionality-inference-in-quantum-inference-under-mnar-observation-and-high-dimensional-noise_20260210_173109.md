# Robust Causal Directionality Inference in Quantum Inference under MNAR Observation and High-Dimensional Noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19746
- Reference count: 10
- Key result: MNAR-stabilized CVAE+GEE+AIPW+PEL framework achieves MSE 0.140-0.150 and coverage 0.91-0.93 on TCGA datasets, outperforming baselines significantly

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a unified framework for robust causal directionality inference in quantum systems under Missing Not At Random (MNAR) observation and high-dimensional noise. The authors integrate Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) with physically constrained latent representations, MNAR-aware selection models, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) for stabilized regression, and Penalized Empirical Likelihood (PEL) with Bayesian optimization. The method determines whether causal relationships are system→observation, observation→system, or bidirectional, while jointly handling quantum and classical noise.

## Method Summary
The framework combines CVAE-based latent constraints with MNAR-aware selection models and GEE-stabilized regression to handle both quantum and classical noise. It uses stabilized inverse probability weighting to correct for MNAR bias, orthogonal score construction for double robustness, and PEL optimization with robust loss functions. The method is validated on both simulated HDLSS data and real TCGA gene expression and proteomics datasets.

## Key Results
- Simulation studies show lower bias and variance compared to baseline methods
- Achieves near-nominal coverage probability (0.91-0.93) across different contamination levels
- Superior performance on causal directionality metrics: Cross-Predictability (CP), Cloud Size Ratio (CSR), and High-Resolution Joint Symbolic Dynamics Index (HRJSD)
- Real data analyses achieve MSE values of 0.140 and 0.150 on TCGA datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: MNAR-Aware Selection with Stabilized Inverse Probability Weighting
The framework models missingness as Missing Not At Random (MNAR), where observation probability depends on unobserved values. The selection probability P(R=1|O,Z) = π(Z) + δ(O) decomposes into latent-dependent baseline plus MNAR dependence. Stabilized weights ˜w = Pr(R=1|X,Z)/p(Y,X,Z) reweight observations to recover unbiased causal estimates under endogenous selection.

### Mechanism 2: Physically-Constrained CVAE Latent Representations
CVAE latent space is constrained to physically valid quantum representations (CPTP maps, density operators), improving interpretability and estimation stability in high-dimensional low-sample-size regimes. This physical regularization reduces the effective hypothesis space, acting as implicit regularization when p >> n.

### Mechanism 3: Neyman-Orthogonal Double Robustness with GEE Stabilization
The orthogonal score construction ensures estimation error in nuisance functions enters only as second-order terms, providing double robustness—consistent if either model is correct. Combined with GEE moment conditions, this provides robustness to model misspecification and contamination.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Missing Not At Random (MNAR)**
  - Why needed: Core innovation requires understanding how missingness probability depending on unobserved values differs from MAR/MCAR
  - Quick check: Can you explain why P(R=1|Y,X) ≠ P(R=1|X) creates bias that standard IPW cannot correct without MNAR-specific modeling?

- **Concept: Neyman Orthogonality and Double Robustness**
  - Why needed: Theoretical guarantees rely on understanding how orthogonal scores make estimators robust to nuisance estimation error
  - Quick check: If propensity model is wrong by ε and outcome model is wrong by δ, what order of error enters a non-orthogonal versus orthogonal estimator?

- **Concept: CPTP Maps and Density Operators**
  - Why needed: CVAE latent constraints require understanding completely positive trace-preserving maps as valid quantum channels
  - Quick check: Why must a valid quantum channel preserve both positivity and trace?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** CVAE Encoder-Decoder -> MNAR Selection Model -> Two-Stage Noise Handling -> GEE Outcome Regression -> PEL Optimizer -> Bayesian Optimizer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Fit CVAE → extract physically-constrained latents Z
  2. Estimate MNAR selection model → compute stabilized weights ˜w
  3. Fit GEE outcome regression → obtain m₀, m₁ predictions
  4. Construct orthogonal score → compute AIPW estimator
  5. Apply PEL refinement → sparse, robust coefficient estimates
  6. Evaluate causal directionality via CP, CSR, HRJSD metrics

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latent dimension d vs. estimation variance: Higher d captures more structure but requires more samples
  - Robust loss (Huber vs. Tukey): Huber bounds influence linearly; Tukey completely redescends
  - Weight clipping: Stabilized weights may need clipping to prevent extreme values

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Coverage << 0.90 with low contamination: Check weight distribution for extreme values
  - Causal directionality metrics near 0.5: Latent representation may not capture confounding
  - PEL convergence failure: Check compatibility condition for design matrix

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce simulation with n=100, p=1000, contamination c=0.1: Verify MSE ≈ 0.15-0.18, coverage ≈ 0.90-0.93
  2. Ablate CVAE physical constraints: Expect CP/CSR degradation and increased DMRE
  3. Sensitivity to latent dimension: Test d ∈ {4, 8, 16}; plot MSE and coverage vs. d

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can the framework be validated on actual quantum hardware?** The paper proposes embedding the pipeline into real quantum hardware (superconducting qubits, photonic systems) to validate causal directionality estimation under realistic measurement noise.

- **How does the framework extend to multi-particle entanglement networks?** The authors identify extending to multi-particle entanglement networks, where causal effects may propagate across nonlocal subsystems, as a key future direction.

- **What are the theoretical bounds when CVAE latent estimator violates convergence assumptions?** Theorems depend critically on latent representation converging at rate o_P(n^{-1/4}), but practical CVAE training may not guarantee this under complex quantum noise.

- **Can scalable optimization methods accelerate joint fitting?** The paper proposes exploring stochastic mirror descent, diffusion models, or quantum-inspired variational optimization to accelerate the joint fitting procedure for very high-dimensional settings.

## Limitations
- CVAE architecture specifics remain underspecified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Quantum-specific metrics (QED, QCPS, MRI, QKCSS) lack clear implementation details
- Real-world performance in clinical/experimental settings remains untested beyond TCGA datasets

## Confidence
- **High**: MNAR correction mechanism (proven bias correction under MNAR assumptions)
- **Medium**: Double robustness guarantees (theoretically sound but require careful implementation)
- **Medium**: Physical constraint effectiveness (validated in simulation but not conclusively proven for quantum systems)

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce simulation: Replicate n=100, p=1000 simulation with contamination c=0.1 to verify MSE≈0.15-0.18 and coverage≈0.90-0.93
2. Ablate constraints: Remove CVAE physical constraints and measure degradation in CP/CSR metrics to quantify constraint contribution
3. Sensitivity analysis: Test performance across latent dimensions d∈{4,8,16} to identify optimal dimensionality for various data regimes
