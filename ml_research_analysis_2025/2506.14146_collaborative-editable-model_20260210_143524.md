# Collaborative Editable Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14146
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14146
- Authors: Kaiwen Tang; Aitong Wu; Yao Lu; Guangda Sun
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: CoEM achieves 76.11% agreement with a state-of-the-art financial LLM while avoiding traditional fine-tuning overhead

## Executive Summary
Collaborative Editable Model (CoEM) introduces a user-driven framework for efficient domain adaptation of large language models without requiring extensive annotated data or fine-tuning. The system constructs a knowledge pool from user-contributed domain snippets and uses interactive dialogues with ratings and attribution analysis to identify high-value knowledge fragments. These fragments are injected into the model via in-context prompts for lightweight adaptation. Experiments in the financial domain with 15,000 user ratings from 120 users demonstrate successful identification of high-value knowledge while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
CoEM operates through an iterative feedback loop where users interact with a general model to generate domain-specific summaries, provide binary ratings, and contribute new knowledge fragments. The system maintains a knowledge pool where each fragment has an associated value score initialized at 1.0. After each user interaction, an attribution model assigns contribution weights to each fragment used in generation, and value scores are updated via exponential moving average with learning rate α=0.03. Fragments falling below threshold θ=0.5 after sufficient iterations are pruned. The framework leverages user ratings as soft reinforcement signals to guide knowledge selection, enabling continuous domain adaptation through ongoing user feedback rather than traditional fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves 76.11% agreement with a state-of-the-art financial LLM on high-value knowledge identification
- Successfully adapts to financial domain using only 15,000 user ratings from 120 users
- Eliminates need for extensive annotated data and fine-tuning, reducing computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: User ratings serve as soft reinforcement learning rewards to guide model adaptation
- Mechanism: Scalar feedback scores (r ∈ [0, 1]) act as proxy signals representing similarity between current model output distribution and target domain distribution, driving iterative value score updates
- Core assumption: Higher user feedback scores correlate with outputs closer to target domain-specific distribution
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] leverages interactive user-model dialogues with user ratings; [section] Assumption 3.1 defines ratings as soft RL reward signals

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attribution analysis decomposes holistic user feedback to assign credit to individual knowledge fragments
- Mechanism: Attribution model quantifies causal influence of each fragment on generated output, computing contribution weights that are multiplied by user feedback to update individual value scores
- Core assumption: Attribution model can accurately estimate contribution of single fragments without access to target domain distribution
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] leverages attribution analysis to pinpoint high-value knowledge fragments; [section] Section 3.3 describes contribution weight assignment

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Exponentially decaying update rule with optimistic initialization balances knowledge exploration and exploitation
- Mechanism: New fragments start with value score of 1, updated via exponential moving average (EMA), with low-value fragments pruned below threshold
- Core assumption: EMA update with fixed learning rate effectively filters noise while retaining high-value knowledge over time
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] identifies high-value knowledge fragments for lightweight domain adaptation; [section] Section 3.3 describes EMA scheme with optimistic initialization

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical operator for updating knowledge fragment value scores based on new feedback
  - Quick check question: If a knowledge fragment has a value score of 0.8 and receives a new adjusted contribution score of 0.2 with learning rate α = 0.03, what will its new value score be?

- Concept: **Attribution Analysis in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Critical component for credit assignment, quantifying contribution of input knowledge fragments to generated outputs
  - Quick check question: Why is attribution challenging in multi-turn dialogue with multiple supporting knowledge fragments?

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
  - Why needed here: Provides context for how scalar feedback scores can shape model behavior, even though CoEM uses it for knowledge selection rather than direct policy updates
  - Quick check question: In CoEM, does the user feedback update the model's weights directly or the value of the knowledge fragments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** General Model (M_p) -> Knowledge Pool (K) -> Attributor (A) -> Extractor (E) -> User Interaction Interface -> Feedback (r)

- **Critical path:** User Query -> Model generates using top-k fragments from K -> User provides rating (r) -> Attributor computes contribution weights (p_i) -> Value scores (v_i) updated via EMA -> Extractor pulls new fragments from user dialogue (d_u) and adds to K with v=1 -> Low-value fragments pruned

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Learning Rate (α):** Higher rates adapt quickly but may cause rapid forgetting; lower rates are stable but slow to converge. Paper found α=0.03 reasonable.
  - **Attributor Model:** May be biased toward lower marks; sophisticated models (e.g., Shapley-based) could be more accurate but computationally expensive.
  - **Optimistic Initialization:** Starting with v=1 ensures new knowledge is tried, but slow feedback may cause artificial decay without proper evaluation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Feedback Loop Collapse:** Poor ratings cause all value scores to decay, potentially emptying the knowledge pool
  - **Attributor Bias:** Systematically biased attributor assigns incorrect credit, degrading model quality
  - **Cold Start:** Initial knowledge pool quality is critical; low-value fragments may cause user disengagement before improvement

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Attribution Test:** Implement simple non-LLM attributor (e.g., token overlap or BM25) to establish lower-bound performance baseline
  2. **Learning Rate Sensitivity Analysis:** Run simulations with synthetic feedback to plot value score convergence and knowledge retention across α = 0.01 to 0.20
  3. **Ablation on Initial Value:** Test different initialization strategies (e.g., v=0.5 neutral, v=0.1 pessimistic) on convergence speed and knowledge pool growth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Shapley value-based attribution accurately quantify individual knowledge fragment contributions in complex multi-turn dialogues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 suggests Shapley values as a "possible approach" to address attribution challenges
- Why unresolved: Current attribution model struggles with complex interactions and tends to give lower marks
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing Shapley-based attribution improves correlation with domain expert evaluations versus current method

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can incremental learning or sparse updates effectively mitigate computational overhead of real-time knowledge pool management as user base scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 identifies computational overhead as bottleneck and suggests incremental learning as solution
- Why unresolved: Current implementation not tested at scale requiring distributed or sparse updates
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics (latency, resource consumption) demonstrating stable real-time updates under larger simulated user load

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can differential privacy (DP) or secure multi-party computation (SMPC) be integrated into CoEM without degrading domain adaptation performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 calls for decentralized learning process using DP or SMPC to ensure user privacy
- Why unresolved: Trade-off between privacy noise (or SMPC complexity) and model's ability to learn from contributions is unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring trade-off between privacy budgets (epsilon) and domain-specific accuracy or knowledge retention

## Limitations

- Attribution mechanism is underspecified and functions as a black box, undermining confidence in credit assignment quality
- Knowledge extraction process lacks implementation details and evaluation of extraction quality
- Pruning threshold appears arbitrary with insufficient justification for θ=0.5 cutoff

## Confidence

- **High Confidence** in fundamental premise that user feedback can guide domain adaptation without fine-tuning (76.11% agreement with SOTA LLM provides strong empirical support)
- **Medium Confidence** in exponential moving average update mechanism (EMA approach is standard but effectiveness depends entirely on attribution quality)
- **Low Confidence** in attribution and knowledge extraction components (critical subsystems that are essentially black boxes with significant gaps)

## Next Checks

1. **Attribution Model Ablation**: Implement simple baseline attribution mechanism (token overlap, BM25 scoring, or random assignment) and compare performance against "general model" attribution to establish whether sophisticated approach provides value

2. **Learning Rate and Initialization Sweep**: Conduct comprehensive sensitivity analysis across wider range of learning rates (α from 0.01 to 0.20) and initial values (v from 0.1 to 1.0) including convergence plots and final knowledge pool composition

3. **Attribution Bias Calibration**: Quantify and calibrate attribution model bias by comparing attribution scores against known ground truth or using multiple attribution models and analyzing agreement patterns
