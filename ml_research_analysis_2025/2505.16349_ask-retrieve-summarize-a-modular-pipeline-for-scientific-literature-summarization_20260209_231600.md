# Ask, Retrieve, Summarize: A Modular Pipeline for Scientific Literature Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16349
- Reference count: 37
- XSum achieves ROUGE-1 of 0.51, BERTScore of 0.62, Ref-F1 of 0.76, G-Eval of 4.2, and CheckEval of 0.97 on SurveySum dataset

## Executive Summary
XSum introduces a modular pipeline for multi-document summarization in scientific literature using retrieval-augmented generation. The system addresses the challenge of synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources by incorporating a question-generation module that dynamically creates queries from paper titles and abstracts, and an editor module that synthesizes retrieved answers into coherent, citation-rich summaries. Evaluated on the SurveySum dataset, XSum demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple evaluation metrics including ROUGE, BERTScore, and citation fidelity measures.

## Method Summary
XSum is a modular RAG pipeline that generates survey-style summaries from multiple reference papers with proper citations. The system uses a question-generation module to create queries from paper titles and abstracts, then performs two-stage retrieval (FAISS + ColBERT) to fetch relevant text chunks. These chunks are used by an LLM to generate specific answers, which are then synthesized by an editor module into a final summary. The pipeline operates on the SurveySum dataset, processing full-text documents that are chunked at 150 tokens with 20-token overlap, embedded using SPECTER2, and indexed in FAISS.

## Key Results
- XSum achieves ROUGE-1 of 0.51, outperforming existing approaches on the SurveySum dataset
- The system demonstrates strong citation fidelity with Ref-F1 score of 0.76
- XSum produces high-quality summaries with BERTScore of 0.62 and G-Eval score of 4.2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dynamic query generation via questions improves retrieval relevance compared to static section titles.
- **Mechanism:** The pipeline generates 5 questions per document based on the title and abstract. These questions are embedded and used to query the vector database, effectively bridging the "semantic gap" between high-level intent and specific text chunks, similar to HyDE/HyQE strategies.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM generates questions that effectively map to the most salient content in the full text.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "question-generation module that dynamically creates queries from paper titles and abstracts" and [section 3.2] "These questions serve two primary functions: first, they refine the retrieval process... second, they provide a structured framework..."
- **Break condition:** If the generated questions are too generic or hallucinated, retrieval will retrieve generic chunks, degrading summary specificity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Two-stage retrieval (dense retrieval + late interaction reranking) filters noise better than single-stage retrieval.
- **Mechanism:** An initial broad search retrieves 100 chunks via FAISS/SPECTER2. ColBERT then reranks these using token-level interactions to select the top 20. This balances the speed of approximate nearest neighbor search with the precision of cross-attention models.
- **Core assumption:** The top-100 chunks contain the answer, and ColBERT can successfully identify the top-20 among them.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.4] "The retrieval process proceeds in two stages... Reranking... refinement step ensures that the 20 most relevant chunks are selected."
- **Break condition:** If the relevant information is sparse and falls outside the top-100 initial cutoff, the reranker cannot recover it.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Decomposing summarization into "Question Answering" followed by "Editor Synthesis" improves coherence and citation accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of asking an LLM to summarize raw chunks directly, the system first generates specific answers (grounded in chunks) and then uses a separate Editor module to weave these answers into a narrative. This forces explicit attribution at the answer level before synthesis.
- **Core assumption:** The "Editor" LLM can maintain the citation fidelity of the "Answerer" LLM without hallucinating new references.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] "...an editor module that synthesizes the set of answers retrieved... into coherent summaries." and [section 4.4] XSum achieves Ref-F1 of 0.76 vs 0.72 (Pipeline 2), suggesting the editor successfully maintains citations.
- **Break condition:** If the question-answer pairs are disjointed or contradictory, the Editor may produce a disjointed narrative or omit conflicting viewpoints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core architecture of XSum. You must understand how vector databases (FAISS) connect text segments to LLMs to troubleshoot retrieval failures.
  - **Quick check question:** If the summary misses a key paper finding, is the error likely in the LLM's reasoning or the vector database retrieval?

- **Concept: Late Interaction / ColBERT**
  - **Why needed here:** The pipeline uses ColBERT for reranking. Unlike simple cosine similarity, ColBERT preserves token-level context. Understanding this explains why the system uses a two-step retrieval process.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a system retrieve 100 chunks via embedding similarity and then re-sort them with a more expensive model like ColBERT?

- **Concept: Prompt Chaining (Q&A -> Editor)**
  - **Why needed here:** The system is not a single prompt. It chains a "Question Generator" -> "Answerer" -> "Editor". Understanding state passing between these steps is required to debug where citation information was lost.
  - **Quick check question:** In XSum, where does the citation tracking primarily occur—during the question generation, the answering, or the editing phase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Title + Abstract + Full Text) -> Chunking (150 tokens, 20 overlap) -> SPECTER2 Embedding -> FAISS Index -> Q-Gen LLM (5 questions) -> FAISS (Top 100) -> ColBERT (Top 20) -> QA LLM (Answers) -> Editor LLM (Final Summary)

- **Critical path:** The **Retrieval <-> QA Loop**. If the retriever fails to fetch the relevant chunk for a specific generated question, the QA LLM is instructed *not* to answer. This strict grounding is where the system trades recall for precision.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Verbosity vs. Selectivity:** The paper notes XSum can be verbose compared to human summaries ([section 4.5]).
  - **Latency vs. Quality:** Generating questions, retrieving, answering, and editing involves 3 separate LLM calls and a rerank step, significantly increasing latency compared to single-prompt summarization.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Verbose/Background Noise":** As noted in Section 4.5, low-scoring examples often include unnecessary background detail. Adjust the Editor prompt to prioritize "comparative insights" over definitions.
  - **"Missing Content":** If the Question Generator fails to ask about a specific methodology, it will never be retrieved or summarized.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Comparison:** Run the same input papers through "Pipeline 2" (Title-only retrieval) vs. XSum to validate the marginal gain of the Question Generation module on your specific domain.
  2. **Chunk Size Tuning:** Test 150-token chunks vs. 256-token chunks. Scientific arguments often span paragraphs; 150 tokens may split critical context (Method + Result).
  3. **Ablation on Questions:** Manually provide the "ideal" questions for a paper and compare the resulting summary to auto-generated questions to isolate retrieval quality from LLM writing quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question 1:** What is the specific contribution of the question-generation module compared to the editor module to XSum's overall performance? [explicit] The authors state in the "Conclusion and Future Work" section that "conducting an ablation study would allow for a deeper understanding of the impact of each component in the pipeline."
- **Question 2:** Does XSum produce summaries that match human expert standards for conciseness and selectivity, despite high automated metric scores? [explicit] The "Limitations" section notes the "lack of a comprehensive qualitative analysis," and the "Discussion" observes that XSum tends to be verbose and lacks the "selectivity" of human-written text.
- **Question 3:** Can the pipeline be effectively extended to include the initial retrieval of relevant papers rather than relying on a predefined set? [explicit] The "Limitations" section states, "The pipeline assumes a predefined set of input papers for summarization and does not address the challenge of identifying or retrieving relevant documents for a specific topic."
- **Question 4:** Does integrating vision-language models to process visual elements improve retrieval accuracy and summary quality? [explicit] The "Conclusion and Future Work" section suggests, "integrating vision-language models to process visually rich documents, including text, tables, and figures, offers a promising direction for improving retrieval accuracy."

## Limitations
- **Unknown templates:** Question generation prompt template not provided, only the Editor Module prompt is included
- **Verbose output:** XSum produces extended explanations vs. compact human writing, noted in Section 4.5
- **Predefined inputs:** Pipeline assumes a predefined set of input papers and does not address the challenge of identifying or retrieving relevant documents for a specific topic

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The overall pipeline architecture (RAG with Q&A decomposition) is sound and the aggregate performance metrics demonstrate clear superiority over baselines
- **Medium Confidence:** The two-stage retrieval process (FAISS + ColBERT) is a reasonable and effective strategy for improving precision, but specific hyperparameters are not fully specified
- **Low Confidence:** The individual module contributions (Question Generation quality, Editor's citation fidelity) are inferred from aggregate performance and not directly measured

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Question Generation:** Manually provide the "ideal" questions for a paper and compare the resulting summary to auto-generated questions to isolate retrieval quality from LLM writing quality
2. **Chunk Size Tuning for Scientific Arguments:** Test 150-token chunks vs. 256-token chunks to determine if scientific arguments are being split across chunks
3. **Citation Fidelity Audit:** Run a sample of summaries through a citation extraction tool to verify that all cited papers in the summary are actually referenced in the retrieved chunks used by the Answerer
