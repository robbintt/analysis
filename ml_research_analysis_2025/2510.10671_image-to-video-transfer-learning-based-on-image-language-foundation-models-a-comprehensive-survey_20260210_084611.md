# Image-to-Video Transfer Learning based on Image-Language Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.10671
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10671
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey categorizing image-to-video transfer learning paradigms and analyzing their effectiveness across video-text understanding tasks

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews image-to-video transfer learning, which adapts pre-trained image-language foundation models to video-text understanding tasks. The field addresses the challenge of transferring static image representations to dynamic video sequences, which require modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics. The survey categorizes transfer learning paradigms into frozen features (knowledge distillation, post-network tuning, side-tuning) and adapted features (full/partial fine-tuning, adapters, LoRA, prompt tuning), analyzing their effectiveness across fine-grained tasks (spatio-temporal video grounding, open-vocabulary tracking) and coarse-grained tasks (video retrieval, captioning, question answering). Experimental analysis demonstrates that simple frozen-feature methods achieve strong performance when combined with powerful pre-trained models, while adapted-feature methods provide more flexibility at higher computational cost.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically analyzes transfer learning approaches for adapting image-language foundation models to video-text understanding tasks. It distinguishes between frozen-feature methods that keep the pre-trained model weights fixed while extracting features for video tasks, and adapted-feature methods that modify the model parameters during transfer. The analysis covers various implementation strategies including knowledge distillation, adapter modules, low-rank adaptation, and prompt tuning, with evaluation across both fine-grained and coarse-grained video understanding tasks.

## Key Results
- Frozen-feature methods (knowledge distillation, post-network tuning, side-tuning) achieve strong performance when combined with powerful pre-trained models
- Adapted-feature methods (full/partial fine-tuning, adapters, LoRA, prompt tuning) provide more flexibility at higher computational cost
- Simple frozen-feature approaches can be highly effective for video-text tasks when using strong pre-trained image-language models
- Key challenges include efficient video frame processing and developing unified transfer learning paradigms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Image-to-video transfer learning works by leveraging the rich visual-linguistic representations learned by image-language foundation models and adapting them to capture the additional temporal dimension present in videos. The mechanism exploits the fact that many visual concepts and relationships are shared between images and video frames, while temporal dynamics can be modeled through additional processing layers or adapted attention mechanisms. The effectiveness of both frozen and adapted approaches stems from the strong prior knowledge encoded in pre-trained image-language models about object recognition, spatial relationships, and language grounding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Foundation Models**: Large-scale pre-trained models that capture general visual and linguistic knowledge - needed because they provide strong priors for transfer learning, quick check: verify pre-training dataset scale and objectives
- **Spatiotemporal Modeling**: Techniques for capturing temporal dynamics in video sequences - needed because videos require understanding motion and temporal relationships, quick check: assess temporal modeling capabilities of adapted methods
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Teacher-student framework for transferring knowledge from large models to smaller ones - needed for efficient deployment of frozen-feature methods, quick check: evaluate distillation performance across different video tasks
- **Adapter Modules**: Small neural networks inserted into pre-trained models for efficient adaptation - needed to reduce computational cost of fine-tuning, quick check: measure parameter efficiency of different adapter architectures
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using low-rank matrix decomposition - needed for balancing performance and computational efficiency, quick check: compare LoRA performance with full fine-tuning
- **Prompt Tuning**: Adjusting soft prompts to guide model behavior without modifying weights - needed for flexible task adaptation, quick check: evaluate prompt effectiveness across different video-text tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Pre-trained Image-Language Model -> Video Frame Processing -> Transfer Learning Module -> Video-Text Task Head
- **Critical Path**: Video frames → Pre-trained backbone → Temporal aggregation → Task-specific head
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen features (computational efficiency, limited flexibility) vs Adapted features (higher performance, increased computational cost)
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor temporal modeling in frozen-feature methods, overfitting in adapted-feature methods with limited data
- **First Experiments**: 1) Compare frozen vs adapted feature performance on video retrieval task, 2) Evaluate computational efficiency of different adapter architectures, 3) Test prompt tuning effectiveness on video question answering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis primarily focuses on methods adapting image-language foundation models for video-text tasks, potentially missing some recent approaches
- Experimental comparisons rely on published benchmark results with varying implementation details and evaluation protocols
- The rapidly evolving nature of this field means some emerging approaches may not be fully captured

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The categorization of transfer learning paradigms into frozen features and adapted features is well-established and methodologically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness claims for simple frozen-feature methods versus adapted-feature methods are supported by existing literature, though absolute performance comparisons may depend on specific model architectures and computational budgets
- **Medium confidence**: The identification of key challenges (efficient video frame processing, unified transfer learning paradigms) reflects current research trends but may not fully capture emerging solutions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing frozen-feature and adapted-feature methods on the same model architecture and video dataset to isolate the impact of transfer learning strategy from model-specific factors
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency trade-offs across different transfer learning paradigms using standardized metrics (FLOPs, memory usage, inference time) on representative video-text tasks
3. Survey recent pre-trained video-language models to assess whether emerging architectures might reduce the need for explicit image-to-video transfer learning through joint image-video training objectives
