# An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.19859
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19859
- Reference count: 40
- This tutorial reviews recent advances in understanding and exploiting low-rank structures in deep neural networks, which emerge during training and adaptation.

## Executive Summary
This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of low-rank structures that emerge during the training and adaptation of deep neural networks. The authors present two theoretical perspectives: low-rank structure at every iteration of gradient dynamics and low-rank structure at convergence due to implicit regularization. They demonstrate empirical evidence across various network architectures including linear networks, MLPs, VGG, and ViT models, showing how these insights inform practical techniques like LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes theoretical analysis and empirical observations of low-rank structures in deep neural networks. The authors examine gradient dynamics through the lens of low-rank structure, showing that both during training iterations and at convergence, neural networks exhibit pronounced low-rank characteristics. They analyze various fine-tuning methods including LoRA, AdapterDrop, and Deep LoRA, demonstrating how these approaches leverage low-rank structures for parameter efficiency. The tutorial also explores how masked training approaches like Dropout, Masked Autoencoders, and Masked Language Modeling produce approximately low-rank activations.

## Key Results
- Low-rank structures emerge consistently across diverse network architectures including linear networks, MLPs, VGG, and ViT models during both training and adaptation
- Gradient updates and masked training approaches (Dropout, MAEs, MLMs) induce low-rank structures in network parameters and activations
- Practical techniques like LoRA and Deep LoRA exploit these structures for efficient fine-tuning, with Deep LoRA using depth-adaptive rank allocation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Low-rank structures emerge in neural networks due to the inherent dimensionality reduction properties of optimization dynamics and the implicit regularization effects of training procedures. During gradient updates, the optimization landscape naturally constrains parameter updates to lie within low-dimensional subspaces. At convergence, implicit regularization through the training process drives parameters toward solutions with low effective dimensionality. Masked training approaches like Dropout and MAEs further enforce this structure by limiting the parameter space through selective activation patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Low-rank matrix decomposition**: Factorization of matrices into products of lower-rank matrices

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input data -> Forward pass (activations) -> Gradient computation -> Parameter update (low-rank) -> Convergence
- **Critical path**: Training optimization -> Low-rank emergence -> Fine-tuning adaptation -> Interpretability gains
- **Design tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency vs approximation accuracy; rank allocation vs model capacity; theoretical guarantees vs empirical performance
- **Failure signatures**: High-rank solutions indicate optimization issues; rank collapse suggests over-regularization; inconsistent rank patterns across layers
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Track rank evolution during training of different architectures, 2) Compare LoRA vs full fine-tuning on downstream tasks, 3) Analyze singular value spectra of converged models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the theoretical guarantees for low-rank gradient subspaces in deep linear networks (Theorem 2) be extended to general deep nonlinear networks without restrictive assumptions like network reversibility or small batch sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 states "extending the theoretical study of low-rank structures from deep linear networks to deep nonlinear networks" as a key direction, noting current findings "depend on relatively restrictive assumptions, such as network reversibility, specific loss functions, and small batch sizes."
- Why unresolved: Nonlinear activations break algebraic properties (rotational symmetry, layer alignment) used in linear analysis, and "the manner in which singular values and subspaces 'pass' through generally classes of typical nonlinearities used in deep learning is not well understood."
- What evidence would resolve it: Proofs showing gradient dynamics remain in low-rank subspaces for general nonlinear architectures, or bounds characterizing rank perturbation from common nonlinearities like ReLU.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why do masked training approaches (Dropout, Masked Autoencoders, Masked Language Modeling) produce approximately low-rank activations, and can this be rigorously characterized beyond the deep linear setting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.3 notes that "empirical evidence has suggested that the features learned by MAEs and MLMs are approximately low-rank... although it remains an open direction for future work to theoretically establish this rigorously."
- Why unresolved: While Dropout's equivalence to nuclear norm regularization is proven for linear networks, the mechanism for MAEs and MLMs lacks theoretical explanation despite widespread practical use.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proofs connecting masked self-supervised objectives to rank-inducing regularization, or characterizations of effective rank bounds under various masking rates and architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical basis for adaptive LoRA rank allocation across layers, and can optimal layer-specific ranks be predicted from architecture or data properties rather than heuristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2.2 notes that while AdaLoRA is effective, it "is largely heuristic and lacks a principled explanation of its working mechanism."
- Why unresolved: Empirical observations show deeper layers exhibit more pronounced low-rank structure (Figures 1, 9), but no theory explains this pattern or predicts optimal rank from first principles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical bounds connecting layer depth, task complexity, and optimal adapter rank; or provable relationships between gradient spectral properties and rank requirements.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do low-rank structures relate to neural collapse and other emergent phenomena in supervised learning, and can this connection improve model interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5: "the interplay between low-rank structures and phenomena like neural collapse in supervised learning offers fertile ground for advancing our understanding of these models' underlying mechanics."
- Why unresolved: Both phenomena emerge during training, but their mutual relationship and potential causal links remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis showing whether low-rank weights cause or result from neural collapse; or empirical correlations between rank measures and collapse metrics across architectures.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework for low-rank gradient dynamics is limited to linear models and specific optimization dynamics
- Extension to highly nonlinear deep networks remains an open question with only empirical evidence
- Interpretability claims based on low-rank analysis lack systematic validation across diverse tasks and model families

## Confidence
- Extension to nonlinear networks: Low confidence - theoretical framework breaks down for common activation functions
- Low-rank emergence universality: Medium confidence - empirical evidence across architectures but limited theoretical explanation
- Practical method effectiveness: High confidence - demonstrated improvements in parameter efficiency across multiple benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies on Deep LoRA's depth-adaptive rank allocation across diverse model architectures to verify if depth-based rank distribution consistently outperforms uniform allocation
2. Test the theoretical predictions of low-rank emergence during training across multiple nonlinear architectures (including ResNet, transformer variants) under varying optimization hyperparameters
3. Perform controlled experiments comparing model interpretability gains from low-rank decomposition against other post-hoc interpretability methods using standardized benchmark datasets and metrics
