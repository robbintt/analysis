# A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis

## Quick Facts

- Introduces state-space framework for nonstationary discriminant analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a principled state-space framework for nonstationary discriminant analysis that explicitly models temporal distribution shifts through class-conditional dynamics. The approach embeds discriminant analysis within linear-Gaussian state-space models, using Kalman smoothing with multiple measurements per time step, and extends to nonlinear/non-Gaussian drift via particle smoothing. The method addresses practical challenges including incomplete metadata through EM parameter estimation and GMM-based joint recovery of time labels and system parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent improvements over stationary baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance.

## Method Summary
The core method embeds discriminant analysis within linear-Gaussian state-space models, using Kalman smoothing with multiple measurements per time step. For nonlinear/non-Gaussian drift, particle smoothing is employed. Two practical extensions handle incomplete metadata: an EM approach that jointly estimates unknown system parameters, and a GMM-Kalman method that simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters. The approach yields time-indexed discriminants that adapt to target time while borrowing statistical strength across all observations.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates consistent improvements over stationary baselines (LDA, QDA, SVM) in simulations
- Shows robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance
- Provides time-indexed discriminants that adapt to target time while leveraging all observations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly modeling temporal dynamics through state-space equations, where class-conditional distributions evolve over time according to learned transition models. Kalman smoothing provides optimal state estimation given the model structure, while the EM algorithm enables parameter learning when metadata is incomplete. The GMM extension allows simultaneous recovery of latent time labels and parameters, making the method practical for real-world scenarios where temporal information may be partially observed or missing entirely.

## Foundational Learning

**State-space models**: Framework for modeling dynamic systems with hidden states and noisy observations; needed for temporal modeling of class distributions; quick check: verify understanding of state transition and observation equations.

**Kalman smoothing**: Optimal estimation of hidden states given observations and system model; needed for accurate state estimation in linear-Gaussian case; quick check: confirm knowledge of forward-backward recursion algorithm.

**Particle smoothing**: Sequential Monte Carlo method for state estimation in nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems; needed for handling complex drift patterns; quick check: understand importance sampling and resampling steps.

**Expectation-Maximization (EM)**: Iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation with latent variables; needed for parameter learning with incomplete metadata; quick check: verify understanding of E-step and M-step updates.

**Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Probabilistic model representing data as mixture of Gaussian distributions; needed for joint estimation of time labels and parameters; quick check: confirm knowledge of component responsibilities and parameter updates.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Time-indexed data -> State-space model parameters -> Kalman/Particle smoothing -> Discriminant functions -> Classification decisions

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing -> Model initialization -> Smoothing (Kalman/Particle) -> Parameter estimation (EM/GMM) -> Discriminant computation -> Classification

**Design tradeoffs**: Linear-Gaussian vs. nonlinear/non-Gaussian smoothing (accuracy vs. computational complexity); Kalman smoothing is computationally efficient but limited to linear-Gaussian systems, while particle smoothing handles more complex dynamics at higher computational cost.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on highly non-Gaussian data with particle smoothing; convergence issues with EM algorithm on small datasets; overfitting when model complexity exceeds available data.

**First experiments**: 1) Implement basic Kalman smoothing for linear Gaussian case; 2) Compare Kalman vs. particle smoothing on synthetic nonlinear drift; 3) Test EM parameter estimation on data with partially observed time labels.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the method on benchmark nonstationary datasets with known temporal drift to compare against modern online and adaptive classifiers.

2. Benchmark computational complexity and runtime of particle smoothing and EM variants against standard classifiers as data size and dimensionality scale.

3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of smoothing choice (Kalman vs. particle) and parameter estimation method (EM vs. GMM) on accuracy and robustness.
