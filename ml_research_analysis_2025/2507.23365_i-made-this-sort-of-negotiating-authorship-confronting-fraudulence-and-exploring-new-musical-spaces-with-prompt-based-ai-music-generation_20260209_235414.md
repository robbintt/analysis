- This paper reflects on the author's experience creating two music albums using prompt-based AI music generation platforms (Suno and Udio).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a self-reflective exploration of creating music using AI platforms Suno and Udio. The author produced two albums through prompt-based generation, examining their evolving role as curator, editor, and composer in this process. Through LLM-mediated reflection, they confront questions of authorship and fraudulence while identifying limitations in current AI music generation for non-expert musical expressions. The work introduces "pseudoplunderphonics" as a creative framework and advocates for broader musical diversity in AI training datasets.

## Method Summary
The author employed a qualitative, self-reflective methodology using LLM-mediated introspection to examine their experience creating two music albums with prompt-based AI music generation platforms. They analyzed their creative process, authorship claims, and emotional responses to AI-generated music through iterative dialogue with an LLM, treating the AI as a mirror for deeper self-examination of their artistic identity and practice.

## Key Results
- The author identifies "pseudoplunderphonics" as a new creative framework enabled by AI music generation platforms
- Current AI music platforms predominantly generate polished, professional-sounding outputs, limiting expression of non-expert musical voices
- The creative process reveals tensions between authorship claims and feelings of fraudulence when using AI-generated content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reflection process works by using LLM mediation to create psychological distance from immediate emotional responses, allowing the author to examine their creative identity and authorship claims more objectively. The iterative dialogue structure enables deeper exploration of how AI tools reshape creative agency and artistic self-perception, revealing patterns in how musicians negotiate their role when the technical execution is outsourced to AI systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt engineering**: Understanding how specific prompts influence AI music generation outputs; needed to effectively communicate creative intent to the AI system
- **Pseudoplunderphonics**: A framework for creating derivative works using AI generation rather than direct sampling; needed to conceptualize new creative possibilities
- **Authorship negotiation**: The psychological process of reconciling traditional creative ownership with AI-assisted production; needed to address ethical and identity concerns
- **Fraudulence perception**: The emotional response to creating art with AI assistance; needed to understand psychological barriers to adoption
- **Non-expert expression**: Musical styles and performances that deviate from polished, professional norms; needed to identify gaps in current AI capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Human artist -> Prompt engineering -> AI platform (Suno/Udio) -> Generated content -> Human curation/editing -> Final work
**Critical path**: Creative intent formulation → prompt crafting → generation → selection → refinement → release
**Design tradeoffs**: The platforms prioritize commercially viable, polished outputs over experimental or amateur expressions, limiting creative diversity
**Failure signatures**: Generated content that sounds overly generic, lacks the intended emotional quality, or fails to capture the artist's unique voice
**First experiments**: 1) Test prompt variations to explore platform capabilities and limitations 2) Create derivative works using generated content as source material 3) Compare emotional responses to AI-assisted versus fully human-created music

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The deeply personal, introspective nature based on a single author's experience lacks external validation and generalizability
- The LLM-mediated reflection process may shape conclusions more than genuine personal insight
- Claims about AI platform limitations are based on personal experience rather than systematic technical analysis

## Confidence
High confidence: Technical capabilities and limitations of Suno and Udio platforms are verifiable through direct use
Medium confidence: The "pseudoplunderphonics" framework and claims about AI's effect on musical identity are plausible but lack empirical support
Low confidence: Framework for including non-expert expressions in training datasets is speculative without systematic analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with multiple musicians using AI music generation platforms to assess whether the author's experience is widely shared
2. Perform technical analysis of Suno and Udio training datasets to verify claims about the absence of "non-expert" musical expressions
3. Test the "pseudoplunderphonics" framework by having multiple artists attempt to create works using this approach
