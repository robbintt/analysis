# Beyond Affinity: A Benchmark of 1D, 2D, and 3D Methods Reveals Critical Trade-offs in Structure-Based Drug Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14283
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14283
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 3D models achieve best binding affinity but exhibit high strain energy and lower chemical validity compared to 2D models

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks 15 structure-based drug design models across 1D, 2D, and 3D algorithmic approaches using ten protein targets. The models were evaluated on binding affinity (docking scores), pose quality, and pharmaceutical properties. Results reveal critical trade-offs between affinity optimization and chemical validity, with 3D models excelling at binding affinity but producing high strain energy and lower chemical validity. 2D models offer balanced performance across all metrics, while 1D models maintain consistent chemical validity but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 15 SBDD models across 1D, 2D, and 3D approaches using ten protein targets. Models were assessed on binding affinity through docking scores, pose quality through RMSD measurements, and pharmaceutical properties through SA score and QED metrics. The benchmarking framework compares performance across multiple metrics to reveal trade-offs inherent to different algorithmic approaches, with particular attention to the balance between affinity optimization and chemical validity.

## Key Results
- 3D models like Pocket2Mol achieve best binding affinity (-14.78 kcal/mol) but produce poses with high RMSD (4.03 Å) and strain energy (60.55 kcal/mol)
- 2D models offer balanced performance across binding affinity, pose quality, and chemical validity metrics
- 1D models maintain consistent chemical validity but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities
- Critical trade-off exists between affinity optimization and structural/chemical validity across all approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- Structure-based drug design (SBDD): Design of molecules targeting specific protein binding sites using structural information
  - Why needed: Enables rational drug design by leveraging protein-ligand interaction principles
  - Quick check: Compare to ligand-based approaches that don't require protein structure

- Binding affinity metrics: Computational measures of molecular interactions with protein targets
  - Why needed: Primary objective in drug design is achieving strong target binding
  - Quick check: Verify with experimental binding data when available

- Chemical validity metrics (SA score, QED): Computational assessments of drug-likeness
  - Why needed: Ensures designed molecules meet pharmaceutical industry standards
  - Quick check: Compare against known drug databases for validation

- Pose quality (RMSD): Measurement of molecular conformation accuracy in binding site
  - Why needed: Accurate binding poses are essential for reliable affinity predictions
  - Quick check: Validate against crystal structure data when available

- Strain energy: Computational measure of molecular stress in designed conformations
  - Why needed: High strain indicates unstable or synthetically challenging molecules
  - Quick check: Compare with known stable drug molecules as reference

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:**
1D models (SMILES-based) -> SMILES generation -> Chemical validity check -> Docking validation
2D models (Graph-based) -> Graph generation -> SMILES conversion -> Chemical validity check -> Docking validation
3D models (3D generation) -> 3D structure generation -> Geometry optimization -> Chemical validity check -> Docking validation

**Critical Path:**
The core workflow follows: Structure-based generation → Chemical validity assessment → Binding affinity prediction → Pose quality evaluation. Each model type implements this path differently, with 1D using string-based representations, 2D using graph-based representations, and 3D using direct 3D coordinate generation.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- 1D approaches prioritize chemical validity and synthetic accessibility but sacrifice binding affinity optimization
- 2D approaches balance chemical validity with reasonable binding affinity predictions
- 3D approaches maximize binding affinity but introduce high strain energy and chemical validity concerns

**Failure Signatures:**
- High SA scores or low QED values indicate poor chemical validity
- High RMSD values suggest inaccurate binding poses
- Extremely high strain energy (>60 kcal/mol) indicates synthetically challenging or unstable molecules

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare chemical validity metrics (SA score, QED) across all 15 models on identical protein targets
2. Analyze correlation between binding affinity and strain energy across different model types
3. Evaluate pose quality (RMSD) for top-scoring molecules from each approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation covers only ten protein targets, potentially limiting generalizability across diverse protein classes
- Chemical validity metrics provide indirect measures of pharmaceutical properties rather than direct assessment
- Computational efficiency and scalability of different approaches are not addressed
- No experimental validation of predicted binding affinities for top-performing molecules

## Confidence
- High confidence: Comparative performance rankings across 1D, 2D, and 3D models are robust and replicate known trade-offs
- Medium confidence: Absolute performance values may vary with different protein targets or evaluation protocols
- Medium confidence: Characterization of approach strengths/weaknesses is well-supported but could shift with expanded target diversity

## Next Checks
1. Expand benchmark to include at least 50 diverse protein targets spanning different binding site geometries and chemical environments
2. Conduct head-to-head validation with experimental binding affinity data for top-performing molecules from each approach
3. Evaluate computational efficiency metrics (runtime, memory usage, scaling with molecular size) to assess practical feasibility
