# IoMT-based Automated Leukemia Classification using CNN and Higher Order Singular Value

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.16448
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16448
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: IoMT-integrated CNN-HOSVD system achieves 98.88% accuracy for binary leukemia classification from blood images

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based automated system for classifying Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) using microscopic blood images. The proposed approach combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a feature extractor with Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) as a classifier. The system operates in a cloud-connected framework where patient samples are acquired via wireless microscopy, processed by the CNN-HOSVD model on a medical server, and results are relayed to clinicians in real-time. Tested on the ALL-IDB2 database with 260 images, the model achieves an average accuracy of 98.88% with low variance, demonstrating both high performance and robustness for automated leukemia diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The system uses a CNN to extract spatial features from 257×257 RGB microscopic blood images, converting these features into tensors for classification by HOSVD. The HOSVD classifier computes basis normalized matrices for ALL and healthy classes from the tensor decomposition, then classifies new samples by projecting their features onto these subspaces. The pipeline integrates into an IoMT framework where wireless digital microscopy captures samples, cloud servers process them using the CNN-HOSVD model, and results are transmitted to clinician monitors. The ALL-IDB2 database (130 ALL images, 130 healthy images) is used for evaluation with an 80% training split.

## Key Results
- Achieved 98.88% average accuracy with 0.009 standard deviation on ALL-IDB2 dataset
- HOSVD classifier outperforms SVM (98.12%), standard CNN (97.75%), KNN, and ELM
- Successfully integrated into IoMT framework for real-time communication between patients and clinicians

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Hierarchical feature extraction differentiates ALL and healthy cells using convolutional kernels
- **Mechanism**: CNN processes raw pixels through convolutional filters that identify spatial patterns like edges and textures characteristic of cell morphology
- **Core assumption**: Structural differences between malignant and healthy white blood cells are distinct enough for convolutional filters to capture without manual feature engineering
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] CNN categorizes ALL and normal cells; [PAGE 1] Kernels act as attribute identifiers filtering spatial features
- **Break condition**: Poor image resolution or overlapping cells obscuring morphological features

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: HOSVD provides robust classification with fewer tuning parameters than standard neural networks
- **Mechanism**: CNN feature tensors undergo multi-dimensional decomposition into orthogonal matrices and core tensor; classification uses nearest-basis similarity matching
- **Core assumption**: Feature tensors for ALL and healthy cells form distinct subspaces separable via tensor decomposition
- **Evidence anchors**: [PAGE 2] HOSVD has faster training speeds and fewer parameters; [PAGE 3] Table II shows HOSVD achieving 98.88% accuracy
- **Break condition**: Overlapping class subspaces due to highly non-linear or noisy features

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: IoMT framework enables scalable, real-time diagnostic support through cloud computing
- **Mechanism**: Wireless microscope captures samples, transmits to cloud server for processing, results relayed to clinician terminals
- **Core assumption**: Network latency and cloud processing time support real-time clinical requirements
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] Real-time communication between patients and clinicians; [PAGE 3] Fig. 2 shows data flow from microscope to monitor
- **Break condition**: Unstable internet connection or insufficient bandwidth for high-resolution image transfer

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - **Why needed here**: Feature extraction backbone that transforms raw images into meaningful representations
  - **Quick check question**: How does a convolutional layer reduce data dimensionality while preserving spatial relationships compared to a fully connected layer?

- **Concept**: **Tensor Decomposition (SVD & HOSVD)**
  - **Why needed here**: Novel classifier that uses linear algebra to identify patterns in multi-dimensional feature spaces
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between a matrix (2nd-order tensor) and a higher-order tensor, and why does SVD need to be extended to HOSVD for this data?

- **Concept**: **Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Architecture**
  - **Why needed here**: System framework for edge-to-cloud data processing and clinical communication
  - **Quick check question**: What are the security and latency implications of transmitting raw patient blood cell images to a cloud server?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Wireless Microscope -> CNN Feature Extractor -> Tensor Formation -> HOSVD Classifier -> Cloud Server -> Clinician Monitor
- **Critical path**: Transition from CNN feature maps to tensor input for HOSVD; discriminative features are essential for successful tensor decomposition
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Interpretability vs. Performance: HOSVD offers structured decision boundaries but relies on subspace assumptions
  - Speed vs. Accuracy: Fewer parameters provide faster training but potentially less non-linear modeling power
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - High standard deviation indicates overfitting to specific samples or staining variations
  - Misclassification of visually similar cells suggests texture feature collapse
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline Comparison**: Replicate with standard CNN softmax classifier on identical features to verify HOSVD performance advantage
  2. **Tensor Visualization**: Visualize core tensor and basis matrices to confirm ALL vs healthy classes form distinct clusters
  3. **Noise Robustness**: Test model under non-ideal conditions with injected noise or compression artifacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the CNN-HOSVD architecture maintain high accuracy for multi-class leukemia classification?
- Is the IoMT framework viable for real-world clinical deployment regarding latency and integration?
- Can combining CNNs with other subspace learning algorithms yield better performance than HOSVD?

## Limitations
- CNN architecture details are not fully specified, requiring assumptions about layer configurations
- Small dataset size (260 images) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability
- IoMT real-time performance is claimed but not empirically validated with latency measurements

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CNN as feature extractor (well-established methodology)
- **Medium confidence**: HOSVD classifier performance (specific implementation needs verification)
- **Medium confidence**: IoMT integration benefits (conceptually sound but not empirically tested)

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline replication**: Implement standard CNN with softmax classifier on identical features to verify HOSVD's claimed performance advantage
2. **Feature subspace visualization**: Visualize HOSVD basis matrices and core tensor to empirically confirm ALL vs healthy classes form distinct subspaces
3. **IoMT performance testing**: Measure actual end-to-end latency under varying network conditions to validate "real-time" claims
