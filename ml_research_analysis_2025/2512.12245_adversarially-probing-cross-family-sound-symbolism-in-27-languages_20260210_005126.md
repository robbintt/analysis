# Adversarially Probing Cross-Family Sound Symbolism in 27 Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12245
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12245
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 54.4% size classification accuracy while reducing language prediction to chance (34%) using adversarial scrubber

## Executive Summary
This study investigates cross-linguistic sound symbolism for size using 810 adjectives from 27 typologically diverse languages. A novel adversarial scrubber suppresses language-family signals while preserving size-related phonetic patterns, achieving 54.4% size classification accuracy while reducing language prediction to chance. Vowels (/a/, /i/, /o/) and consonants (particularly voiced fricatives like /Q/, /H/) contribute to size prediction across families. The adversarial approach isolates universal patterns from genealogical relatedness, suggesting acoustic properties beyond vowel height underlie cross-linguistic size symbolism.

## Method Summary
The study uses 810 adjectives (30 per language, 15 small/15 large) from 27 typologically diverse languages, transcribed phonemically in IPA. Languages are grouped into similarity tertiles via Levenshtein distance measures. An adversarial scrubber architecture includes a frozen pretrained BERT encoder (2 layers, 128 hidden units) on WikiPron IPA data, followed by a 64-dimensional projection, size classifier, and bin adversary with gradient reversal. The model is trained with staged gradient reversal to suppress language-family signals while preserving size-related phonetic patterns.

## Key Results
- Size classification accuracy of 54.4% while language-family prediction falls to chance (34%)
- Vowel height patterns confirmed: /a/ and /o/ associated with largeness, /i/ with smallness
- Consonant contribution identified: voiced fricatives (/Q/, /H/) strongly associated with size prediction
- Adversarial scrubbing successfully isolates universal patterns from genealogical relatedness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient Reversal for Language-Signal Suppression
A gradient reversal layer (GRL) acts as identity during forward pass but multiplies gradients by -λ during backpropagation. The encoder receives conflicting gradients: (1) from the size classifier, minimizing size loss; (2) from the bin adversary, maximizing bin loss. This minimax optimization forces the encoder to learn representations predictive of size but uninformative for genealogical similarity bins.

### Mechanism 2: Bag-of-Phoneme Representations Capture Symbolic Cues
Each word is represented as a sparse vector of IPA symbol counts. Interpretable classifiers (logistic regression, decision trees) then learn phoneme-to-size mappings. Feature importance analysis reveals which phonemes drive predictions across languages.

### Mechanism 3: Phonetic Pretraining on WikiPron
A 2-layer BERT encoder is pretrained on 1.6M WikiPron IPA words via masked language modeling. The encoder is then frozen and used as a fixed feature extractor for the downstream adversarial task, building general phonotactic knowledge across typologically diverse languages.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gradient Reversal Layer (Domain-Adversarial Training)**
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for scrubbing language-family signals while preserving task-relevant features.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why reversing gradients (multiplying by -λ) causes the encoder to become uninformative for the adversary?

- **Concept: Sound Symbolism (Iconicity)**
  - Why needed here: The phenomenon under study—non-arbitrary form-meaning mappings. Classic examples: /i/ → smallness, /a, o/ → largeness.
  - Quick check question: Why is controlling for genealogy critical when claiming cross-linguistic sound symbolism?

- **Concept: IPA Phonemic Representation**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses phonemic (not phonetic) transcriptions; understanding the distinction is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when using phonemic rather than narrow phonetic transcription?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  WikiPron (1.6M IPA words) → BERT pretraining (2 layers, 128 hidden) → FROZEN → Size adjectives (810 words, IPA) → Frozen encoder → Linear projection (64-dim) → Size classifier (2-layer FFN) and Bin adversary (2-layer FFN) with GRL

- **Critical path:** The GRL sits between the encoder projection and the bin adversary. If λ is too low, language signals persist; if too high, size signal may also be corrupted.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Scrubbing granularity: Bins (3 levels) vs. fine-grained language ID—coarser bins may leave language-family structure intact.
  - Encoder capacity: Small 2-layer BERT limits expressivity but reduces overfitting risk on 810 samples.
  - Pretraining vs. from-scratch: Freezing prevents catastrophic forgetting but may miss task-specific phonetic nuances.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Bin accuracy remains high (>40%) → GRL not converging; increase λ or training epochs.
  - Size accuracy drops to chance (<51%) → Adversary overpowers primary task; reduce λ or use staged ramping.
  - High variance across runs → Increase dropout or reduce projection dimension.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate the GRL (λ=0): Confirm bin accuracy rises (baseline: 54.4% vs. adversarial 34%) while size accuracy stays similar—validates that genealogy and size signals are partially separable.
  2. Remove vowels: Test consonant-only models (Table 2 shows drop to ~51-52% for distant bins)—quantifies vowel vs. consonant contributions.
  3. Swap bin labels (language shuffle): If size accuracy collapses, confirms the model relies on genuine genealogical structure, not artifacts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do the observed cross-family sound-symbolic patterns reflect true cognitive universals or residual deep phylogenetic connections among "distant" languages?
- Do suprasegmental features (tone, stress, intonation) contribute to cross-linguistic size symbolism, particularly in tone languages?
- Would continuous size scales reveal stronger or more nuanced cross-family sound-symbolic patterns than the binary small/large classification used in this study?
- Do acoustic (phonetic) properties predict size symbolism more robustly than phonemic representations?

## Limitations
- The 810-adjective dataset covers only 27 languages and may not capture full cross-linguistic variability in sound symbolism.
- The adversarial scrubbing approach operates at language-family bin level rather than fine-grained language identity, potentially leaving residual genealogical signals.
- With only 30 adjectives per language and leave-one-language-out evaluation, the sample size is modest for drawing universal claims about cross-linguistic sound symbolism.

## Confidence
- Cross-linguistic Sound Symbolism Exists: Medium - Effect size is modest and adversarial approach may not eliminate all family-related influences.
- Vowel Height is Not the Sole Mechanism: High - Well-supported by feature importance analysis and interpretable model.
- Adversarial Scrubbing Effectively Separates Genealogy from Symbolism: Medium - Successfully reduces prediction to chance but coarse bin-based approach limits confidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Fine-grained Language Identity Test**: Replace the 3-bin language-family classifier with full 27-language identification. If size accuracy remains above chance with fine-grained adversarial pressure, this would strengthen claims about universal rather than family-specific patterns.

2. **Acoustic Feature Integration**: Replicate the analysis using narrow phonetic transcriptions with acoustic correlates (formant frequencies, duration, voice quality). Compare performance to the phonemic baseline to quantify information lost in abstraction.

3. **Semantic Field Expansion**: Extend the dataset to include non-size semantic domains (sharpness, speed, brightness) and test whether the identified phonemes (/a/, /i/, /o/, /Q/, /H/) show consistent symbolic associations across semantic categories or are specific to size.
