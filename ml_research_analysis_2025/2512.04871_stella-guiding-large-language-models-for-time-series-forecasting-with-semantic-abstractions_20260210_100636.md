# STELLA: Guiding Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Semantic Abstractions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04871
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04871
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 55.91% relative improvement in MSE

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving time series forecasting with large language models (LLMs). The core issue is that existing LLM-based methods lack effective semantic guidance and fail to leverage key temporal patterns such as trend, seasonality, and residuals, limiting their forecasting performance. To overcome this, the authors propose STELLA, a framework that introduces hierarchical semantic anchors to guide the LLM. STELLA uses a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism to decouple the input time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then generates two types of semantic anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) providing global context, and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) capturing instance-specific patterns. These anchors are used as prefix-prompts to guide the LLM in modeling the intrinsic dynamics of the time series. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets show that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks, achieving relative improvements of up to 55.91% in MSE. Additionally, STELLA demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, validating its effectiveness in handling unseen domains.

## Method Summary
STELLA introduces a hierarchical semantic abstraction framework for time series forecasting with LLMs. The method employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It generates two types of semantic anchors: Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) providing global context and Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) capturing instance-specific patterns. These anchors are used as prefix-prompts to guide the LLM's forecasting process. The framework leverages the Neural STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) algorithm for decomposition and integrates semantic information through a carefully designed prompting strategy that helps the LLM understand and model temporal dynamics more effectively.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 55.91% relative improvement in MSE compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates superior performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks
- Shows strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings across eight benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
STELLA works by providing LLMs with semantic guidance that traditional approaches lack. By decomposing time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals, the framework creates interpretable representations that help the LLM understand underlying temporal patterns. The two-level semantic anchor system (CSP and FBP) provides both global context and instance-specific behavioral patterns, enabling more accurate modeling of time series dynamics. The prefix-prompting approach allows the LLM to leverage its reasoning capabilities while being guided by domain-specific semantic knowledge, resulting in more accurate forecasts than standard LLM approaches that treat time series as raw sequences without semantic structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual)**: Why needed - Enables separation of different temporal patterns for more accurate modeling; Quick check - Verify decomposition accuracy on known periodic datasets
- **Semantic abstraction mechanisms**: Why needed - Provides interpretable representations that guide LLM reasoning; Quick check - Test prompt effectiveness with and without semantic anchors
- **Prefix-prompting strategies**: Why needed - Allows integration of semantic guidance without modifying LLM architecture; Quick check - Compare performance with different prompt formulations
- **Large Language Model fine-tuning**: Why needed - Adapts general reasoning capabilities to time series forecasting; Quick check - Evaluate performance across different LLM sizes
- **Neural STL decomposition**: Why needed - Provides data-driven decomposition without requiring predefined seasonal periods; Quick check - Compare with classical STL on datasets with varying seasonality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Time Series -> Neural STL Decomposition -> Semantic Anchor Module -> LLM with Prefix-Prompting -> Forecast

**Critical Path**: Input time series flows through Neural STL decomposition, generates semantic anchors via the Semantic Anchor Module, which are then used as prefix-prompts for the LLM to produce forecasts.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses a two-level semantic anchor system (CSP and FBP) to balance global context with instance-specific patterns, trading off computational overhead for improved accuracy. The framework leverages existing LLM capabilities rather than training from scratch, but requires careful prompt engineering.

**Failure Signatures**: May underperform on time series lacking clear trend/seasonality patterns, could be sensitive to decomposition quality, and prefix-prompt effectiveness may vary across different LLM architectures.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test decomposition accuracy on synthetic time series with known components
2. Evaluate prompt effectiveness by comparing forecasts with and without semantic anchors
3. Benchmark performance against traditional forecasting methods on standard datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the discretization of continuous behavioral features (e.g., slope) into fixed categorical text tokens (e.g., "slightly increasing") during the Feature-to-Text process introduce an information bottleneck that limits the precision of the LLM's forecasts?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.6 describes generating Fine-grained Behavioral Prompts by converting numerical metrics into human-readable strings and categorical descriptions.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not compare the efficacy of these "hard" textual categorical anchors against "soft" continuous vector embeddings or richer natural language descriptions, leaving the optimality of the discretization strategy unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study comparing the current categorical text prompts against a variant that injects continuous feature vectors directly into the LLM's embedding space.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the necessity and effectiveness of the Semantic Anchor Module (SAM) scale with the size and intrinsic reasoning capacity of the Large Language Model backbone?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 4 (Implementation Details) notes that the authors used only the first 6 layers of LLaMA2-7B.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the semantic guidance provided by STELLA is required to compensate for the reduced capacity of the truncated model, or if the benefits persist and scale synergistically when using full-scale or larger state-of-the-art LLMs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments evaluating the marginal performance gain of the SAM module when applied to the full LLaMA2-7B or larger parameter variants (e.g., 13B/70B).

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the reliance on standard additive decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual) a fundamental limitation for modeling time series domains that lack these distinct classical structures?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.4 asserts that the Neural STL module segregates series into these specific fundamental components.
- **Why unresolved:** While effective on standard benchmarks, the paper does not assess the framework's robustness on chaotic, irregular, or event-based series where the assumptions of additive seasonality and trend might not hold or might be detrimental.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance analysis on datasets characterized by non-stationary, non-decomposable dynamics (e.g., high-frequency financial turbulence or irregular medical events).

## Limitations
- The decomposition-based approach assumes additive structure that may not hold for all time series domains
- Computational overhead from the semantic abstraction mechanism may impact scalability
- Performance relies on the quality of prompt engineering and may be sensitive to LLM architecture choices
- Benchmark datasets may not fully represent the diversity of real-world time series characteristics

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological framework and experimental design
- Medium confidence in the scalability and computational efficiency claims
- Medium confidence in the generalization capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios
- Medium confidence in the relative improvement metrics due to potential implementation-specific factors

## Next Checks
1. Test STELLA's performance on time series datasets with irregular patterns, noise, and missing values to assess robustness beyond the clean benchmark datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the impact of each semantic abstraction component (CSP, FBP, and decoupling mechanism) on forecasting accuracy
3. Evaluate computational complexity and inference time compared to traditional forecasting methods to verify practical scalability claims
