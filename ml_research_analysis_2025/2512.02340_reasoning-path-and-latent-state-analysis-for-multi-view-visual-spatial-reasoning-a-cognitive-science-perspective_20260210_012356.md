# Reasoning Path and Latent State Analysis for Multi-view Visual Spatial Reasoning: A Cognitive Science Perspective

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.02340
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02340
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Current VLMs struggle with multi-view spatial reasoning due to insufficient cross-view geometric alignment and relational coherence. We introduce ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark that systematically varies viewpoint patterns and query types to evaluate spatial mental model construction and maintenance. Evaluations of 15 VLMs reveal performance plateaus at 30–45% accuracy versus 81.5% for humans, with pronounced degradation in cross-view and perspective-changing tasks. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows reliable in-frame perception but sharp decline in cross-view inference. Implicit analysis via linear probing and entropy dynamics confirms progressive loss of task-relevant information and rising uncertainty across reasoning phases. These findings expose core weaknesses in cross-view geometric alignment, inference stability, and confidence calibration, highlighting the need for cognitively grounded training strategies to improve multi-view spatial reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the fundamental limitations of vision-language models (VLMs) in multi-view spatial reasoning tasks, revealing significant performance gaps compared to human cognition. Through the introduction of ReMindView-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark grounded in cognitive science principles, the research systematically evaluates how VLMs construct and maintain spatial mental models across different viewpoint configurations. The findings demonstrate that while VLMs can reliably process individual views, they struggle substantially with cross-view geometric alignment and maintaining relational coherence across perspective changes, with performance consistently plateauing at 30-45% accuracy versus 81.5% for humans.

The research employs both explicit and implicit analysis methods to characterize the reasoning paths and latent state evolution during spatial reasoning tasks. Explicit analysis uses LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting to evaluate phase-wise reasoning quality, while implicit analysis leverages linear probing and entropy dynamics to track information retention and uncertainty propagation. These complementary approaches reveal progressive information loss and confidence degradation as reasoning moves from single-view perception to cross-view inference, exposing critical weaknesses in current VLM architectures for spatial reasoning applications.

## Method Summary
The study introduces ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark comprising 25 systematically varied tasks that manipulate viewpoint patterns and query types to evaluate spatial mental model construction. Fifteen VLMs were evaluated using a two-pronged approach: explicit phase-wise analysis employing LLM-as-a-judge with self-consistency prompting to assess reasoning quality at each stage, and implicit analysis using linear probing and entropy dynamics to track information retention and uncertainty evolution. Performance was benchmarked against human accuracy (81.5%) to establish reference levels for spatial reasoning capability.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieved 30-45% accuracy on multi-view spatial reasoning tasks versus 81.5% for humans
- Performance degraded sharply in cross-view and perspective-changing tasks compared to single-view perception
- Progressive information loss and rising uncertainty were observed across reasoning phases, confirming fundamental limitations in cross-view geometric alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that VLMs' spatial reasoning failures stem from inadequate cross-view geometric alignment mechanisms and insufficient maintenance of relational coherence across viewpoint transitions. The progressive degradation in performance indicates that current architectures cannot effectively construct and maintain stable spatial mental models when required to integrate information across multiple perspectives. The entropy dynamics and linear probing analyses demonstrate that task-relevant information is systematically lost as reasoning progresses from individual view processing to cross-view inference, suggesting fundamental architectural limitations in how VLMs represent and manipulate spatial relationships.

## Foundational Learning
**Spatial Mental Models** - Cognitive representations that integrate visual information across multiple viewpoints to enable reasoning about object relationships and spatial configurations. Why needed: Essential for understanding how humans navigate complex visual environments and how VLMs should ideally process multi-view scenarios. Quick check: Can be validated through task performance consistency across viewpoint changes.

**Geometric Alignment** - The ability to establish correspondence between features and spatial relationships across different viewpoints. Why needed: Critical for cross-view reasoning tasks where objects or scenes must be mentally transformed or compared. Quick check: Measured through accuracy on perspective-changing queries.

**Relational Coherence** - Maintenance of consistent spatial relationships between objects across viewpoint transitions. Why needed: Fundamental for constructing stable mental representations that persist through perspective changes. Quick check: Assessed through performance stability across task phases.

**Cross-View Inference** - Reasoning that requires integration of information from multiple viewpoints to answer spatial queries. Why needed: Represents the core challenge where VLMs show significant performance degradation. Quick check: Evaluated through accuracy differences between single-view and multi-view tasks.

**Information Entropy Dynamics** - Measurement of uncertainty propagation through reasoning phases. Why needed: Provides quantitative insight into information retention and degradation during spatial reasoning. Quick check: Tracked through entropy changes across explicit reasoning phases.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Views -> Feature Extraction -> Cross-View Alignment -> Relational Encoding -> Inference Module -> Output Reasoning

**Critical Path:** The most critical processing sequence involves feature extraction from individual views, followed by cross-view alignment and relational encoding, with performance bottlenecks occurring at the alignment stage where geometric correspondence must be established.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study highlights tradeoffs between model complexity (ability to capture intricate spatial relationships) and generalization (performance across diverse viewpoint patterns). Models with more sophisticated alignment mechanisms showed better cross-view performance but at increased computational cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Sharp performance drops on perspective-changing tasks, progressive accuracy decline across reasoning phases, and rising entropy values indicating information loss and uncertainty accumulation during cross-view inference.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate single-view task performance to establish baseline perception capabilities
2. Test cross-view alignment performance on controlled viewpoint transitions
3. Measure entropy dynamics across reasoning phases to quantify information retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 25-task benchmark may not fully capture real-world spatial reasoning complexity
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation introduces potential subjectivity despite reliability measures
- Human performance reference (81.5%) may not represent optimal spatial reasoning across all task types

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence** in major claims due to methodological constraints including benchmark scope and evaluation subjectivity
- **Medium confidence** in entropy dynamics findings as proxy measures for cognitive processes
- **Medium confidence** in human performance benchmark as reference point for VLM comparison

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying specific components of ReMindView-Bench to isolate factors most affecting VLM performance degradation
2. Implement cross-validation with alternative evaluation methods, including human-in-the-loop assessment for a subset of tasks
3. Test VLMs with additional training on spatially-grounded datasets to determine if performance improvements can be achieved through targeted fine-tuning on multi-view reasoning tasks
