# OntoGSN: An Ontology-Based Framework for Semantic Management and Extension of Assurance Cases

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OntoGSN provides a formal, extensible, and interoperable framework for managing and extending the semantics of assurance cases.

## Executive Summary
OntoGSN is an ontology-based framework that addresses the persistent knowledge-management bottleneck in assurance case development by providing a formal, machine-readable representation of the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. The framework combines a comprehensive OWL/SWRL formalization of GSN with a middleware layer for automated querying and consistency checking, and a web-based interface for exploring assurance cases. By enabling semantic interoperability between assurance cases and domain ontologies, OntoGSN supports dynamic assurance scenarios such as adversarial robustness of AI systems while maintaining compatibility with existing tooling through a dedicated parser.

## Method Summary
The framework was developed through a three-layer architecture: a knowledge layer containing the OntoGSN core ontology (227 OWL axioms, 51 SWRL rules) and domain ontologies in Turtle format; an operations layer implemented in JavaScript that orchestrates a client-side Oxigraph triplestore and library of SPARQL queries; and an interface layer with coordinated tree, layer, and model views. The ontology was built using Protégé v5.6.3 and validated for consistency using Pellet, with SWRL rules also tested in Drools. The framework was evaluated against FAIR principles, scanned for pitfalls using OOPS!, and tested through competency questions formalized as SPARQL queries, with a case study demonstrating its utility for managing adversarial robustness arguments in large language models.

## Key Results
- OntoGSN achieves a 1:1 formalization of the GSN Community Standard v3 with 227 OWL axioms and 51 SWRL rules that capture GSN semantics including context-sensitivity and defeater propagation
- The framework demonstrates semantic interoperability by enabling cross-ontology reasoning between assurance cases and domain ontologies, validated through SPARQL queries answering 9 competency questions
- Evaluation shows OntoGSN scores highly on FAIR principles (Findability: 94%, Accessibility: 89%, Interoperability: 89%, Reusability: 89%) and contains no major modeling pitfalls according to OOPS! analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OntoGSN works by providing a formal semantic foundation for assurance cases that bridges the gap between human-readable argumentation and machine-processable knowledge. The OWL formalization captures the structural semantics of GSN elements (Goals, Strategies, Solutions) and their relationships, while SWRL rules encode dynamic semantics such as context propagation and defeater effects. The triplestore-based middleware enables automated querying and consistency checking, and the separation of core ontology from extensions allows the framework to maintain standard compliance while supporting domain-specific extensions. This architecture enables both static validation of argument structure and dynamic reasoning about argument validity in changing contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Goal Structuring Notation (GSN)**: The domain-specific language being formalized, with core elements (Goals, Strategies, Solutions, Context, Assumptions, Justifications) and relationships (`supportedBy`, `inContextOf`). Why needed: Without understanding GSN structure, the ontology's purpose is unintelligible. Quick check: In GSN, what is the primary relationship between a high-level `Goal` and a `Strategy` used to decompose it?
- **OWL Ontologies and SWRL Rules**: Web Ontology Language for structural model (classes, properties) and Semantic Web Rule Language for logical constraints (e.g., if an assumption is invalid, dependent goals are also invalid). Why needed: The core of OntoGSN is built using OWL/SWRL. Quick check: What is the fundamental difference between an OWL axiom (e.g., `SubClassOf`) and a SWRL rule (e.g., `A(x) ^ B(x) -> C(x)`)?
- **SPARQL and Triplestores**: Query language for graph databases that powers the framework's operations against a triplestore (Oxigraph). Why needed: Understanding how to query a graph database is essential to use, debug, or extend the middleware. Quick check: How would a SPARQL `SELECT` query differ from a `CONSTRUCT` query when working with an assurance case graph?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Knowledge Layer (OntoGSN Core + domain ontologies) -> Operations Layer (JavaScript middleware + Oxigraph triplestore + SPARQL queries) -> Interface Layer (web frontend with Tree, Layer, Model views)
- **Critical path**: User interacts with view in Interface Layer -> view calls middleware query API -> Operations Layer executes query against Oxigraph triplestore containing Knowledge Layer data -> middleware returns results to view which updates UI
- **Design tradeoffs**: Client-side vs. Server-side (client-side simplifies deployment but limits scale); SWRL vs. SPARQL for rules (SWRL for reasoning rigor vs. SPARQL for flexibility); 1:1 Formalization vs. Pragmatic Extension (strict GSN formalization with separate extensions to avoid core pollution)
- **Failure signatures**: Reasoner inconsistency suggesting contradictory axioms; SPARQL performance issues with complex queries over large cases; integration errors parsing legacy tool data into expected schema
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Load OntoGSN core ontology into Protégé and execute basic SPARQL queries to verify structure; 2) In interface, manually invalidate an Assumption and observe `valid` flag propagation via SWRL rules; 3) Create simple domain ontology, link GSN Goal to its class, and write SPARQL query demonstrating cross-ontology reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Client-side architecture imposes scalability constraints for managing large assurance cases with complex reasoning, limiting practical deployment
- Evaluation relies on single real-world case study (LLM adversarial robustness), limiting generalizability of results
- Separation of core ontology from extensions requires users to manually adopt non-standard elements, potentially creating adoption friction
- SWRL limitations (decidability, tool support) are acknowledged but not fully addressed, with SPARQL alternatives potentially sacrificing logical rigor

## Confidence
- High confidence in ontology's 1:1 formalization of GSN v3 (227 OWL axioms, 51 SWRL rules) and FAIR evaluation results
- Medium confidence in framework's practical utility given single case study and client-side architecture constraints
- Medium confidence in semantic interoperability claims as cross-ontology reasoning demonstrations are limited to provided examples

## Next Checks
1. Scale test: Evaluate framework performance with progressively larger assurance cases (100+ nodes) to quantify client-side triplestore limitations and identify query optimization needs
2. Tool integration: Test the "helper ontology and parser" with actual export files from major assurance case tools (ASCE, CAE, JAMA) to validate seamless data migration claims
3. Domain ontology stress test: Create a complex domain ontology (100+ classes/properties) and verify that cross-ontology reasoning maintains performance and accuracy
