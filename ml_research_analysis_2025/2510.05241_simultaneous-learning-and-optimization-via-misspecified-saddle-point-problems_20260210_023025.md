# Simultaneous Learning and Optimization via Misspecified Saddle Point Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05241
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05241
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes algorithms that achieve O(log K/K) convergence rate for simultaneous learning and optimization in misspecified saddle point problems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of solving saddle point optimization problems when parameters must be learned from data. The authors propose two algorithms based on accelerated primal-dual methods that simultaneously handle both the optimization and learning aspects. The key insight is that traditional approaches fail to account for the dynamic nature of learning parameters, leading to suboptimal performance. By explicitly incorporating parameter evolution into the acceleration dynamics and using adaptive step-size selection, the proposed methods achieve provably faster convergence rates than existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two main algorithms: Naive APD and Learning-aware APD. Naive APD directly substitutes parameter estimates into primal-dual updates without accounting for parameter dynamics. Learning-aware APD explicitly incorporates parameter evolution into the acceleration dynamics and employs an adaptive backtracking line search for step-size selection. Both methods are based on accelerated primal-dual methods but differ in how they handle the interplay between learning and optimization. The Learning-aware approach treats the learning problem as an integral part of the optimization dynamics, leading to tighter convergence constants and better empirical performance.

## Key Results
- Both Naive APD and Learning-aware APD achieve O(log K/K) convergence rate
- Learning-aware APD attains a tighter O(1) constant and demonstrates superior empirical performance
- For problems with multiple learning solutions, modified Learning-aware APD achieves O(1/√K) rate
- Learning-aware method with backtracking shows fastest convergence in portfolio optimization experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed algorithms work by recognizing that learning parameters are not fixed but evolve during optimization. Traditional primal-dual methods treat parameters as constants, leading to suboptimality when parameters must be learned. By explicitly modeling parameter dynamics and incorporating them into the acceleration framework, the Learning-aware approach can better navigate the joint learning-optimization landscape. The adaptive backtracking line search further enhances performance by automatically adjusting to the problem structure.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Saddle Point Problems** - Optimization problems involving both primal and dual variables; needed because the framework addresses problems of the form min_x max_y f(x,y).
2. **Accelerated Primal-Dual Methods** - Optimization algorithms that achieve faster convergence by incorporating momentum; needed as the base framework for both proposed algorithms.
3. **Parameter Estimation from Data** - Statistical learning techniques for inferring unknown parameters; needed because the core problem involves unknown parameters that must be learned.
4. **Backtracking Line Search** - Adaptive step-size selection method; needed to automatically adjust step sizes based on problem structure.
5. **Convergence Analysis** - Mathematical framework for proving algorithm performance; needed to establish the O(log K/K) convergence guarantees.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data -> Parameter Estimation -> Saddle Point Problem -> Accelerated Primal-Dual Updates -> Solution

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves iterating between parameter updates and primal-dual updates. The Learning-aware method explicitly couples these updates through its acceleration dynamics, while Naive APD treats them separately.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between computational complexity and convergence speed. Learning-aware APD requires more computation per iteration due to parameter dynamics incorporation, but achieves faster overall convergence. The adaptive backtracking adds computational overhead but eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include: (1) slow convergence when learning problem has multiple solutions, (2) numerical instability if step sizes are not properly adapted, (3) poor performance if parameter dynamics are not accurately modeled.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement both algorithms on a simple portfolio optimization problem with synthetic data
2. Compare convergence rates of Naive vs Learning-aware approaches on problems with varying numbers of learning solutions
3. Test sensitivity to initial parameter estimates and step size choices
