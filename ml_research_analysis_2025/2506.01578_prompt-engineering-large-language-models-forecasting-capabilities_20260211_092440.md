# Prompt Engineering Large Language Models' Forecasting Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01578
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01578
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 38 prompts tested across 100 forecasting questions and 4 models; most had negligible effects, with only base rate usage showing slight improvement

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluated 38 different prompt engineering techniques to improve large language models' forecasting accuracy across 100 diverse questions and four major models (Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B, and o1). Using Brier scores to measure accuracy, the research found that most prompt modifications—including sophisticated approaches like chain-of-thought reasoning, Bayesian updating, and automated prompt generators—had minimal impact on forecasting performance. Only prompts that explicitly referenced base rates showed small improvements, while prompts encouraging Bayesian reasoning or multi-option evaluation actually decreased accuracy. The findings suggest that current prompt engineering techniques have limited effectiveness for improving LLM forecasting capabilities, pointing to the need for more advanced approaches like retrieval augmentation or fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The researchers tested 38 prompt variations across four categories (unguided reflection, framework, information, and incentives) using 100 forecasting questions from Metaculus, FRED, and Wikipedia. Each prompt was applied to four large language models at temperature=0, with responses parsed for probability estimates and evaluated using Brier scores. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects models with random intercepts for questions and models, along with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The study compared treatment prompts against a minimal control prompt and measured differences in accuracy, examining both simple single-modification prompts and compound prompts combining multiple techniques.

## Key Results
- 35 of 37 treatment prompts showed no significant effect on forecasting accuracy after multiple comparison correction
- Base rate prompts (Base Rate First, Frequency-Based Reasoning) showed small improvements of 0.016-0.019 mean difference
- Bayesian Reasoning and Propose-Evaluate-Select prompts significantly decreased accuracy (p < 0.001)
- Compound prompts and automated prompts from OpenAI/Anthropic showed minimal gains
- Larger prompts generally performed worse than simpler alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reference-based prompts that anchor on historical frequencies may produce marginal forecasting improvements
- Mechanism: Prompts instructing models to explicitly consider base rates (e.g., "What is the historical frequency of similar events?") appear to activate statistical patterns learned during training, marginally improving calibration
- Core assumption: LLMs encode distributional information about event frequencies that can be retrieved with appropriate prompting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "references to base rates yield slight benefits"
  - [section] Table 5 shows Frequency-Based Reasoning (-0.019 mean diff) and Base Rate First (-0.016 mean diff) with significant t-tests before adjustment
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence on forecasting-specific base rate mechanisms in the retrieved literature
- Break condition: If models lack training data relevant to the specific forecasting domain, base rate prompts cannot retrieve useful priors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Complex multi-step reasoning prompts (Bayesian updating, multi-option evaluation) can systematically harm forecasting accuracy
- Mechanism: These prompts may cause models to produce superficial reasoning traces that appear coherent but propagate errors or amplify overconfidence, rather than implementing genuine probabilistic computation
- Core assumption: Current LLMs do not perform reliable Bayesian inference when instructed to do so; they generate plausible-looking reasoning that may compound uncertainties incorrectly
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning" showed "strong negative effects on accuracy"
  - [section] Table 4 shows Bayesian Reasoning (+0.030 estimate) and Propose-Evaluate-Select (+0.033 estimate) significantly worsened accuracy (p < 0.001)
  - [corpus] No counter-evidence found in retrieved papers regarding Bayesian prompting effectiveness
- Break condition: If models had robust probabilistic reasoning capabilities embedded, Bayesian-style prompts would improve rather than harm accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Forecasting accuracy is largely insensitive to prompt engineering because it requires capabilities beyond instruction-following
- Mechanism: Forecasting performance depends on (a) access to current information, (b) genuine reasoning about temporal dynamics, and (c) calibrated uncertainty—none of which can be substantially elicited through instruction alone in models without retrieval or tool access
- Core assumption: The tested models' forecasting capability is near their architecture/training ceiling; prompts cannot substantially improve underlying competence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a minimal baseline"
  - [section] Table 4 shows 35/37 treatment prompts had no significant effect after correction; even compound prompts and automated generators showed minimal gains
  - [corpus] Retrieval-augmented approaches and fine-tuning are cited as alternative directions, implying prompting alone is insufficient
- Break condition: If future models incorporate forecasting-specific training or reasoning architectures, this insensitivity pattern may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Brier Scores**
  - Why needed here: The entire evaluation framework relies on Brier scores to measure forecast accuracy (lower = better)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a forecast of 80% for an event that occurs gets a Brier score of 0.04?

- Concept: **Multiple Comparison Corrections (Benjamini-Hochberg)**
  - Why needed here: With 38 prompts tested, understanding why most "significant" effects disappear after correction is critical to interpreting results
  - Quick check question: Why does testing 37 hypotheses simultaneously require adjustment of significance thresholds?

- Concept: **Mixed-Effects Models with Random Intercepts**
  - Why needed here: The paper's primary analysis accounts for variation across questions and models; understanding this helps interpret why t-test results differ from LMM results
  - Quick check question: What does a random intercept for "questions" capture in a forecasting study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Control prompt (minimal baseline) -> Treatment prompts (38 variants) -> Models (4 LLMs) -> Questions (100 diverse) -> Brier score calculation -> LMM analysis with BH correction

- Critical path:
  1. Define forecasting questions with resolution dates after model knowledge cutoffs
  2. Apply identical prompt + question combinations across all models at temperature=0
  3. Parse outputs for probability estimates (handle refusals)
  4. Compute per-question Brier scores for each prompt-model pair
  5. Calculate difference-from-control for statistical testing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Simple vs. compound prompts**: Simple prompts allow causal attribution; compound prompts better reflect real usage but confound effects
  - **Single-model vs. cross-model testing**: Testing across models increases generalizability but requires more resources
  - **Question selection**: Diverse sources (Metaculus, FRED, Wikipedia) improve external validity but increase heterogeneity

- Failure signatures:
  - **Refusal spikes**: Abstention prompt caused 38% of all refusals; some prompts systematically trigger safety filters
  - **Format failures**: Complex prompts may produce unparseable outputs (noted in missing forecast counts)
  - **Overconfidence drift**: Bayesian and Propose-Evaluate-Select prompts increased mean absolute distance from 50% (17-20pp vs 12-13pp control)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate the base rate finding**: Test Base Rate First prompt on a new question set to verify whether the small improvement is reproducible or noise
  2. **Diagnose Bayesian harm**: Run a controlled comparison separating the reasoning trace from the final forecast to identify whether the reasoning content or the instruction itself causes degradation
  3. **Test retrieval augmentation**: Compare minimal-prompt + retrieval system against best-performing prompts to quantify the gap between prompting and knowledge-access interventions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can retrieval-augmented approaches or fine-tuning overcome the limitations of prompt engineering for forecasting?
- How do these findings generalize to future model architectures with different capabilities?
- What is the optimal balance between prompt complexity and forecasting performance?

## Limitations
- Focus on instruction-tuned LLMs without retrieval or external tool access, constraining achievable accuracy
- Reliance on publicly available questions from diverse sources may introduce uncontrolled heterogeneity
- Temperature=0 setting may not reflect typical user interactions with these models
- Small effect sizes make results sensitive to analytical choices and model capabilities

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Most prompt engineering techniques show negligible effects on forecasting accuracy; Bayesian reasoning prompts significantly harm accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: Base rate prompts provide slight improvements (0.016-0.019 mean difference) but lose significance after multiple comparison correction
- **Low Confidence**: Interpretation that prompt engineering cannot substantially improve forecasting accuracy assumes this applies to all future model architectures

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate Base Rate Effect**: Test the Base Rate First and Frequency-Based Reasoning prompts on a new, independently sourced question set to determine whether the small improvements observed are reproducible or statistical noise

2. **Diagnose Bayesian Harm**: Conduct a controlled experiment separating the reasoning trace from the final forecast in Bayesian prompts to determine whether the reasoning content itself or the instruction to reason Bayesianly causes the accuracy degradation

3. **Retrieval Augmentation Benchmark**: Compare the best-performing prompt against a minimal-prompt + retrieval system setup to quantify the gap between prompt engineering and knowledge-access interventions, which would help determine whether the ceiling observed is due to prompting limitations or fundamental model constraints
