# Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20520
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: MARL-based online learning unit achieves highest scheduling rewards while continuously expanding MSG coverage

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incomplete Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) coverage in metascheduling for time-triggered architectures. The proposed solution introduces an online learning unit that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to explore new scheduling solutions during runtime, expanding the MSG beyond what's feasible with offline training. Three RL models—Multi-Armed Bandits, Contextual Bandits, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning—are implemented and evaluated. The online learning unit continuously improves scheduling robustness and system efficiency by discovering new MSG nodes and retraining AI inference models, ensuring the system can meet timing constraints while adapting to runtime variations.

## Method Summary
The approach combines offline MSG generation via Genetic Algorithm with online RL-based exploration. An online learning unit with RL Agent Unit (MAB/CB/MARL), NN Learning Block, and trigger logic continuously explores scheduling solutions when context events occur. RL agents propose spatial allocation actions, reconstruction model builds schedules with safety checks, and observer evaluates rewards. The system retrains AI spatial inferences using valid solutions discovered online, expanding MSG coverage beyond offline training limitations. Three RL models are evaluated: MAB with epsilon-greedy decay, Contextual Bandits with ANN-based context modeling, and MARL with dedicated agents per task plus coordinator.

## Key Results
- MARL model achieved highest rewards across task counts 10-50 but incurred higher computational costs
- Online learning unit successfully expanded MSG coverage beyond offline training limitations
- Retrained AI inferences maintained or improved makespan performance without degrading previously learned scenarios
- Continuous learning mode outperformed deadline-triggered learning in reward optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Online RL-based exploration expands MSG coverage beyond infeasible offline training by discovering new scheduling solutions during runtime.
- RL agents (MAB, CB, or MARL) propose spatial allocation actions → reconstruction model builds schedules → observer evaluates rewards → best solutions stored, expanding MSG nodes.
- Assumes Markovian environment properties for valid RL updates; supported by reward improvements over time but lacks explicit Markov property validation.

### Mechanism 2
- MARL achieves higher scheduling rewards than simpler bandit approaches through task-level optimization via dedicated agents and coordinator.
- Each task has dedicated agent determining temporal/spatial priority; coordinator aggregates decisions into unified strategy, capturing optimization opportunities.
- Assumes agent coordination overhead is acceptable and coordinator can resolve conflicts without deadlock; supported by reward metrics but lacks deadlock analysis.

### Mechanism 3
- Online learning unit retrains AI spatial inferences without degrading performance on previously learned scenarios through careful validation.
- NN predictor initialized with pre-trained weights, learns from RL-generated improved allocations, weights transferred back with validation on held-out schedules.
- Assumes online samples generalize without overfitting; supported by makespan metrics but lacks catastrophic forgetting testing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) as DAG**: Understanding MSG structure explains why offline training is incomplete—exhaustive coverage is infeasible due to state explosion from context events.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why adding high-resolution slack variations (0-99%) to a context model causes MSG state explosion?

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation (Epsilon-Greedy with Decay)**: All three RL models use epsilon-greedy policies; understanding this tradeoff is essential for tuning decay rates (0.96-0.99 in experiments).
  - Quick check: If epsilon decays too fast, what happens to MSG coverage? Too slow?

- **Time-Triggered Architecture Constraints (WCET, Precedence, Message Collisions)**: Reconstruction model must enforce these constraints regardless of RL decisions; safety checks are non-negotiable.
  - Quick check: Why can't the RL agent directly set task start times without a reconstruction/safety layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Application Model -> Platform Model -> Context Model -> Metascheduler (GA + AI inferences) -> Online Learning Unit (RL Agent + NN Predictor + Trigger) -> Reconstruction & Safety Check -> Schedule evaluation -> Deploy -> Observer (rewards)

- **Critical path**: Context event occurs → Online Operation Manager extracts context info → AI inference generates priorities → Reconstruction model builds schedule with safety checks → If deadline missed → trigger Online Learning Unit → RL explores alternatives → updates NN predictor → commits improved weights

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - MAB: O(n) complexity, fast, lower rewards—use for simple/low-latency scenarios
  - CB: O(n²) complexity, moderate performance gain—often not worth it over MAB per paper analysis
  - MARL: O(log n) complexity per agent but high wall-clock time due to coordination—use when reward quality justifies latency
  - Trigger strategy: Continuous learning vs. deadline-failure-triggered

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Locked loops: Incorrect precedence handling in reconstruction—safety check must catch
  - Message collisions: Reconstructor allocates overlapping message slots—detected in safety phase
  - Missed deadlines after retraining: Overfitting to recent context events—validate on held-out schedules
  - Infinite exploration: Epsilon decay too slow—deadlines missed while still exploring

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline MAB epsilon decay sweep: Run MAB with epsilon decay values {0.9, 0.96, 0.99, 0.996, 0.998} on 100 scenarios × 10 context events. Plot average reward vs. episodes.
  2. Task complexity scaling: Compare MAB, CB, MARL on task counts {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. Measure max reward and execution time.
  3. Retraining safety validation: Take pre-trained spatial inference, identify 1,000 failing schedules, run MARL to generate corrected allocations, retrain NN predictor on 9,000 samples, validate on 1,000 held-out.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Parallelization potential**: What performance improvements in execution time and scalability can be achieved by parallelizing epsilon-greedy search epochs within the online learning unit?
- **Cloud deployment benefits**: Does deploying the online learning unit on cloud-based or distributed architectures with higher clock rates enable real-time immediate fault recovery?
- **Advanced training techniques**: What advanced training techniques are required to prevent online enhancement training from degrading AI inference's performance on previously learned scenarios?

## Limitations
- Markovian environment assumptions for RL updates are not explicitly validated, which could invalidate standard RL mechanisms
- MARL computational overhead lacks comparison against real-time timing constraints of target architecture
- Catastrophic forgetting on specific scenario types remains untested despite claims of safe retraining

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mechanism by which online RL expands MSG coverage beyond offline training (supported by experimental reward improvements)
- **Medium Confidence**: MARL's superior reward performance (demonstrated but lacks deadlock analysis and timing constraint comparison)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that retraining doesn't degrade previously learned scenarios (supported by makespan metrics but lacks distributional shift robustness testing)

## Next Checks
1. Test MSG expansion convergence under non-Markovian context event sequences to verify RL update validity
2. Instrument MARL coordinator with deadlock detection and recovery metrics during task counts beyond 50
3. Conduct catastrophic forgetting analysis by evaluating pre-training scenario performance after multiple retraining cycles with diverse context event distributions
