# SmartPilot: A Multiagent CoPilot for Adaptive and Intelligent Manufacturing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06492
- Reference count: 34
- SmartPilot achieves 93% anomaly detection accuracy, 21.51% forecasting error reduction, and 88.6% Q&A accuracy

## Executive Summary
SmartPilot is a neurosymbolic multiagent CoPilot that addresses critical manufacturing challenges including anomaly detection, production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. The system integrates three specialized agents: PredictX for anomaly prediction using multimodal sensor and image data with knowledge infusion, ForeSight for production forecasting using LSTM models enhanced with domain-specific features, and InfoGuide for real-time Q&A using RAG and LLMs. The neurosymbolic approach combines neural network methods with symbolic reasoning through manufacturing ontologies, enabling accurate predictions and user-level explanations. Deployed in both rocket assembly and vegemite production environments, SmartPilot demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline approaches while maintaining interpretability and edge deployment capabilities.

## Method Summary
SmartPilot employs a neurosymbolic multiagent architecture with three specialized agents. PredictX uses decision-level fusion of time series and image modalities through a frozen autoencoder and fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0, enhanced with a knowledge-infused custom loss function that incorporates manufacturing ontologies. ForeSight implements a 2-layer LSTM for production forecasting, concatenated with domain-specific features like raw material quantities and evaporation ratios. InfoGuide provides domain-specific Q&A through a dual retrieval system combining BERT embeddings and Jaccard similarity, with threshold-based response generation using Mixtral. The system integrates these agents through a unified framework supporting real-time manufacturing operations with edge deployment capabilities.

## Key Results
- PredictX achieved 93% accuracy in anomaly detection, representing a 47% relative improvement over time-series-only baselines
- ForeSight reduced production forecasting errors by 21.51% compared to baseline LSTM models through knowledge-infused feature integration
- InfoGuide maintained 88.6% accuracy in answering domain-specific queries with 92.1% relevance while operating within 2.3 seconds response time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge-Infused Learning for Anomaly Detection
Integrating domain knowledge from manufacturing ontologies into the loss function improves anomaly detection accuracy and enables user-level explanations. A custom loss function combines Weighted Mean Squared Error (WMSE) with an additional penalty term derived from process ontology sensor ranges, constraining the neural network to respect domain-valid operating conditions during training. The same ontology provides templated explanations mapping predicted anomalies to responsible variables, robot functions, and expected values.

### Mechanism 2: Late Fusion of Multimodal Data with Transfer Learning
Decision-level fusion of time series and image modalities, combined with transfer learning (frozen encoder), outperforms single-modality baselines while reducing overfitting risk. Time series data passes through an autoencoder with frozen encoder; images pass through fine-tuned EfficientNet. Their outputs fuse at the decision level via a fully connected network, preventing gradient updates from overfitting to limited manufacturing data.

### Mechanism 3: Dual Retrieval with Threshold-Gated Response Generation
Combining neural semantic retrieval (BERT embeddings) with symbolic keyword retrieval (Jaccard similarity), plus a refusal threshold, achieves high relevance while minimizing hallucinations. Manufacturing manuals are preprocessed and chunked, then retrieved using dual scoring. If scores exceed threshold, Mixtral generates response; otherwise, system refuses, preventing low-confidence hallucinations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Neurosymbolic AI**
  - Why needed: SmartPilot's core innovation is blending neural pattern recognition with symbolic domain knowledge
  - Quick check: Why would a purely neural anomaly detector struggle to explain why a particular sensor reading indicates an anomaly?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning with Frozen Encoders**
  - Why needed: PredictX freezes the autoencoder encoder to prevent overfitting on limited manufacturing data
  - Quick check: What diagnostic signal would indicate that frozen encoder features are not transferring well to your manufacturing domain?

- **Concept: Late vs. Early Fusion**
  - Why needed: SmartPilot chooses decision-level (late) fusion for multimodal integration
  - Quick check: If camera feeds were available 90% of the time but sensor data was continuous, would late fusion still be the right choice?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - PredictX: Time series autoencoder (frozen encoder) + EfficientNet-B0 (fine-tuned) → fusion FC layer → anomaly classification + ontology-grounded explanations
  - ForeSight: 2-layer LSTM (temporal) → concatenation with domain features (raw materials, evaporation ratios) → dense → production forecast
  - InfoGuide: PDF preprocessing → text chunking → LLaMA-2-7b-chat summarization → dual retrieval (BERT cosine + Jaccard) → threshold gate → Mixtral response
  - Inter-agent bridge: DistilBERT fine-tuned via LoRA on PredictX/ForeSight outputs enables InfoGuide to answer real-time prediction queries
  - Deployment: OPC-UA server (sensors), cameras (images), Streamlit/HTML UI, edge-optimized inference

- **Critical path:**
  1. Real-time data ingestion (OPC-UA sensors + cameras)
  2. Modality-specific preprocessing (normalization, cropping via zero-shot object detection)
  3. Agent inference (PredictX anomaly, ForeSight forecast, InfoGuide retrieval)
  4. Knowledge infusion at training (loss penalty) and inference (explanation templates)
  5. User feedback loop through UI dashboards

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Compact models (EfficientNet-B0 vs. larger variants) prioritize edge deployment over maximum accuracy
  - Late fusion improves modularity and robustness to missing modalities but may miss early cross-modal correlations
  - InfoGuide refusal threshold optimizes for precision (no hallucinations) at potential cost of recall (unanswered valid queries)
  - Transfer learning reduces training data requirements but assumes domain shift is manageable

- **Failure signatures:**
  - PredictX: Low F1 on specific anomaly classes (e.g., multi-part missing) → likely class imbalance; augment or reweight
  - ForeSight: High RMSE on high-variability products (Yeast-FMX: 61 vs. 16 for rocket) → LSTM underfitting or missing features; consider attention or external variables
  - InfoGuide: High refusal rate or low relevance → threshold miscalibration or documentation gaps; audit retrieval quality
  - Inter-agent: InfoGuide fails on real-time queries → DistilBERT LoRA adapter not generalizing; expand fine-tuning data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Modality ablation:** Run PredictX with time-series-only and image-only inputs on held-out test set; quantify fusion gain (target: >15% accuracy improvement vs. best single modality based on Table I patterns)
  2. **Knowledge infusion impact:** Train ForeSight with and without domain features; measure MAE/RMSE delta (target: ~21% error reduction per Table III)
  3. **Retrieval calibration:** Create held-out query-document pairs; sweep InfoGuide threshold and plot precision-recall curve; select threshold achieving >90% precision while maximizing recall

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can reinforcement learning be effectively integrated into SmartPilot's multiagent architecture for continuous improvement of anomaly prediction and production forecasting?
- What factors explain the negative improvement (-15%) observed for Yeast-BRN forecasting, and how can the ForeSight agent be made robust across all product types?
- How does SmartPilot's knowledge-infused learning approach transfer to manufacturing domains lacking pre-existing ontologies?
- How does InfoGuide perform on adversarial or out-of-distribution queries that fall below the similarity threshold?

## Limitations
- Knowledge infusion mechanism's exact mathematical formulation remains unspecified, limiting exact reproduction of the 93% anomaly detection accuracy
- Dual retrieval threshold values for InfoGuide are determined experimentally but not reported, creating uncertainty in replicating the 88.6% accuracy claim
- Vegemite Evaporation dataset access is unclear, though paper [31,32] is cited
- Class imbalance in anomaly detection (missing multi-part cases) may affect real-world generalization despite reported F1 scores

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Neurosymbolic integration concept and multimodal fusion architecture are well-specified with clear mechanisms
- **Medium Confidence:** Reported accuracy improvements (93% vs 63% baseline, 21.51% forecasting error reduction) are supported by comparative tables but rely on partially described loss functions
- **Low Confidence:** Exact knowledge infusion loss formulation, retrieval threshold calibration, and class imbalance handling lack sufficient detail for precise reproduction

## Next Checks
1. **Modality ablation test:** Run PredictX with time-series-only and image-only inputs on held-out test set; verify >15% accuracy improvement from fusion as implied by Table I patterns
2. **Knowledge infusion ablation:** Train ForeSight with/without domain features; measure MAE/RMSE delta targeting ~21% error reduction per Table III claims
3. **Retrieval calibration audit:** Create held-out query-document pairs; sweep InfoGuide threshold and plot precision-recall curve to identify optimal setting achieving >90% precision while maximizing recall
