# Semi-Supervised Regression with Heteroscedastic Pseudo-Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15266
- Reference count: 40
- This paper tackles semi-supervised regression with heteroscedastic pseudo-labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of semi-supervised regression by introducing a bi-level optimization framework that learns uncertainty estimates for pseudo-labels. The method models pseudo-label noise as heteroscedastic, allowing for joint optimization of the regression model and an uncertainty learner. Empirical results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across three benchmark datasets, with reduced mean absolute error and improved coefficient of determination under varying label ratios.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach tackles semi-supervised regression by treating pseudo-label noise as heteroscedastic, meaning the noise variance varies across data points. The framework employs bi-level optimization where the upper level optimizes the regression model while the lower level learns uncertainty estimates for pseudo-labels. This joint optimization allows the model to adaptively weigh pseudo-labels based on their estimated reliability, leading to more robust training in scenarios with limited labeled data.

## Key Results
- Consistent performance gains over existing methods across three benchmark datasets
- Reduced mean absolute error in semi-supervised regression tasks
- Improved coefficient of determination (R²) across varying label ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The heteroscedastic modeling of pseudo-label noise allows the framework to capture varying levels of uncertainty across different data points. By jointly optimizing the regression model and uncertainty learner through bi-level optimization, the method can adaptively assign appropriate weights to pseudo-labels based on their reliability estimates. This prevents the model from being overly influenced by noisy or unreliable pseudo-labels, leading to more stable and accurate regression performance in semi-supervised settings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semi-supervised learning**: Why needed - to leverage unlabeled data for improved model performance; Quick check - verify understanding of labeled vs unlabeled data utilization
- **Heteroscedastic noise modeling**: Why needed - to capture varying uncertainty levels across data points; Quick check - confirm ability to distinguish heteroscedastic from homoscedastic noise
- **Bi-level optimization**: Why needed - to jointly optimize regression and uncertainty estimation; Quick check - validate understanding of nested optimization problems

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data -> Pseudo-label generator -> Uncertainty learner -> Regression model -> Final predictions
Critical path: Pseudo-label generation → Uncertainty estimation → Weighted regression training
Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity of bi-level optimization vs performance gains
Failure signatures: Overconfident uncertainty estimates leading to poor pseudo-label weighting
First experiments: 1) Test on single dataset with varying label ratios, 2) Compare against baseline semi-supervised methods, 3) Analyze uncertainty estimate quality
