# TSRBench: A Comprehensive Multi-task Multi-modal Time Series Reasoning Benchmark for Generalist Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18744
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-task, multi-modal benchmark for evaluating generalist models on time series reasoning across 14 domains and 15 tasks

## Executive Summary
TSRBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate generalist models' time series reasoning capabilities across 4125 problems spanning 14 domains and 15 tasks in perception, reasoning, prediction, and decision-making. Experiments with 30+ leading models reveal that perception tasks are well-handled but reasoning, forecasting, and decision-making remain challenging. Scaling laws hold for most tasks except prediction, and strong reasoning does not ensure accurate forecasting. Additionally, while textual and visual time series representations are complementary, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them. These findings highlight critical gaps in generalist models and provide actionable insights for future research.

## Method Summary
The TSRBench benchmark is constructed by curating 4125 time series problems from 14 domains, including healthcare, finance, energy, and more. These problems are organized into 15 distinct tasks covering perception (classification, segmentation, outlier detection), reasoning (retrieval, regression, interpolation), prediction (forecasting, imputation), and decision-making (recommendation, planning). Each task includes multiple sub-tasks with varying complexity levels. The benchmark evaluates models across three modalities: textual descriptions, visual plots, and multimodal combinations. A standardized evaluation framework measures performance using domain-appropriate metrics while tracking reasoning effort and inference efficiency.

## Key Results
- Perception tasks are well-handled by current models, while reasoning, forecasting, and decision-making remain challenging
- Scaling laws hold for most tasks except prediction, where performance plateaus
- Strong reasoning performance does not guarantee accurate forecasting
- Textual and visual time series representations are complementary but current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of time series reasoning tasks and domains, standardized evaluation framework, and multi-modal approach. By including diverse task types and data representations, TSRBench exposes the limitations of current generalist models in handling complex temporal reasoning, forecasting, and decision-making scenarios. The benchmark's design reveals that while models excel at pattern recognition and basic perception tasks, they struggle with higher-order reasoning, long-term forecasting, and integrating multiple data modalities effectively.

## Foundational Learning
**Time Series Analysis** - Understanding temporal patterns, trends, and dependencies in sequential data
*Why needed*: Core to all benchmark tasks
*Quick check*: Can identify seasonal patterns, trends, and anomalies in sample time series

**Multi-modal Representation Learning** - Processing and integrating information from textual and visual sources
*Why needed*: Benchmark evaluates models on both textual and visual time series representations
*Quick check*: Can accurately extract features from both text descriptions and time series plots

**Reasoning Over Temporal Data** - Performing logical inference and pattern recognition across time steps
*Why needed*: Critical for reasoning tasks like retrieval and interpolation
*Quick check*: Can correctly answer questions about temporal relationships in sample data

**Forecasting and Prediction** - Estimating future values based on historical patterns
*Why needed*: Core to prediction tasks in the benchmark

**Decision-Making Under Uncertainty** - Making recommendations based on time series patterns
*Why needed*: Essential for decision-making tasks in the benchmark
*Quick check*: Can provide appropriate recommendations given time series context

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Curation -> Task Design -> Model Evaluation -> Result Analysis -> Insight Generation

**Critical Path**: The benchmark follows a pipeline from data collection through task formulation to model evaluation, with each stage building on the previous to ensure comprehensive assessment of time series reasoning capabilities.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark balances breadth (14 domains, 15 tasks) against depth (detailed sub-tasks within each category) to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining practical evaluation feasibility. The multi-modal approach adds complexity but better reflects real-world scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: Models that excel at perception tasks but struggle with reasoning and prediction tasks, indicating a gap between pattern recognition and higher-order temporal reasoning. Performance degradation on tasks requiring long-term dependencies or multi-modal integration.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate a standard transformer model on basic classification and forecasting tasks to establish baseline performance
2. Test multimodal models on tasks requiring integration of textual and visual inputs
3. Compare performance across different reasoning effort levels to understand the relationship between computational resources and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can alignment techniques be developed to effectively fuse textual and visual time series representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B states future research should "focus on developing alignment techniques that effectively fuse high-resolution visual patterns with a semantic textual context."
- Why unresolved: The authors find that while textual and visual inputs are complementary, current models (like GPT-5) fail to effectively fuse them, yielding T+V performance that largely overlaps with single-modality solutions.
- Evidence to resolve: A model architecture or training methodology that achieves significantly higher accuracy on T+V inputs compared to the union of single-modality (T or V) baselines on TSRBench.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can large-scale pre-trained time series foundation models bridge the decoupling between semantic reasoning and numerical prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B highlights a "critical need to develop foundation models pre-trained specifically on massive-scale, diverse time series corpora."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that scaling laws break down for prediction tasks and strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate forecasting, indicating a fundamental disconnect in current generalist models.
- Evidence to resolve: A foundation model that exhibits positive scaling laws for prediction tasks and shows a strong positive correlation between reasoning performance and forecasting accuracy on TSRBench.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can adaptive test-time scaling strategies optimize the trade-off between inference compute and accuracy in time series reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B suggests "future work should explore adaptive reasoning strategies, such as structured reasoning and self-verification," while Section 4.4 shows reasoning efforts significantly improve performance.
- Why unresolved: While high reasoning efforts (e.g., o4-mini-high) boost accuracy, they are computationally expensive; it is unclear how to adaptively allocate this compute.
- Evidence to resolve: An algorithm that dynamically adjusts inference-time reasoning depth based on input complexity while maintaining the performance gains observed in high-reasoning modes.

## Limitations
- Benchmark primarily focuses on short time series samples (typically under 1000 time steps), which may not represent real-world long-range dependency scenarios
- Evaluation primarily assesses models' ability to process modalities in isolation rather than their capacity to dynamically switch between or integrate multiple modalities
- Reliance on existing datasets and tasks may not fully capture emerging challenges in time series reasoning, particularly in high-dimensional data streams or real-time decision-making

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The benchmark successfully demonstrates that perception tasks are well-handled by current models while reasoning, forecasting, and decision-making remain challenging.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that scaling laws hold for most tasks except prediction requires further validation across broader model families and scale ranges.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that strong reasoning does not ensure accurate forecasting is based on limited experimental evidence and may be influenced by specific task design choices.

## Next Checks
1. Extend benchmark evaluation to include long time series sequences (10,000+ time steps) to assess model performance on extended temporal dependencies and identify potential performance degradation patterns.

2. Implement dynamic modality switching tests where models must determine optimal representation formats for different subtasks within complex reasoning chains, measuring both accuracy and computational efficiency.

3. Conduct ablation studies on the current benchmark tasks to identify which specific characteristics (e.g., noise levels, seasonality, missing data patterns) most significantly impact model performance across different task categories.
