# BEAR: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multimodal Language Models for Atomic Embodied Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.08759
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08759
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduced BEAR benchmark with 4,469 tasks across 14 atomic embodied skills; found all 20 evaluated MLLMs (including GPT-5) performed well below human level; proposed BEAR-Agent tool integration to improve performance by 9.12% on GPT-5.

## Executive Summary
BEAR is the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on atomic embodied capabilities, ranging from low-level pointing and trajectory reasoning to high-level planning. The benchmark includes 4,469 interleaved image-video-text tasks across 14 fine-grained skills in 6 categories. When tested on 20 representative MLLMs, all models performed well below human levels, with open-source models trailing proprietary ones by over 13%. To address these limitations, the authors propose BEAR-Agent, a conversable multimodal agent that integrates vision models and domain-specific tools to enhance perception, 3D understanding, and planning. BEAR-Agent improved GPT-5 performance by 9.12% and showed similar gains on open-source models.

## Method Summary
The authors created BEAR by curating 4,469 atomic embodied tasks from 13 public datasets spanning pointing, bounding box localization, trajectory reasoning, spatial reasoning, task planning, and long-horizon planning. Evaluation used direct prompting with specific templates, processing inputs as either merged frames or sequential frames depending on the model. To enhance performance, they developed BEAR-Agent, an AutoGen-based conversable agent that orchestrates tool calls (GroundingDINO, Set-of-Mark, custom functions) to offload low-level perception tasks from the MLLM while maintaining high-level reasoning.

## Key Results
- All 20 evaluated MLLMs achieved performance well below human levels on atomic embodied tasks
- Open-source models trailed proprietary models by over 13% on average
- BEAR-Agent improved GPT-5 performance by 9.12% (17.5% relative gain)
- BEAR-Agent showed similar gains on open-source models
- Simulation experiments confirmed BEAR-Agent improved task execution in embodied environments by over 20%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Externalized Visual Grounding via Tool Orchestration
The system improves MLLM performance by offloading low-level perception to specialized computer vision tools rather than relying on the MLLM's native visual encoder. The conversable agent framework generates Python code to call external functions, feeding annotated images back into the MLLM for high-level reasoning.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Dialogue for Context Accumulation
Multi-turn dialogue allows the agent to accumulate visual evidence and correct reasoning steps before committing to an answer, overcoming single-shot prompting limitations. The agent maintains conversation history and can request additional tools or validate observations across multiple turns.

### Mechanism 3: Explicit Domain Knowledge Injection
BEAR-Agent injects procedural knowledge (e.g., physics rules, affordance heuristics) via system prompts to correct MLLM's lack of embodied common sense. This primes the model to select correct trajectories based on physical laws it might not have learned implicitly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Embodied Capability Taxonomy**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding the hierarchy from low-level (Pointing/BBox) to mid-level (Trajectory/Spatial) to high-level (Planning) is essential to diagnosing where models fail (mostly low-level visual grounding).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between "Pointing" (pixel localization) and "Trajectory Reasoning" (vector/motion direction) in the context of robot manipulation?

- **Concept: Visual Tool Use / Code Generation**
  - **Why needed here:** BEAR-Agent relies on MLLMs generating executable Python code to call tools. You must understand how an LLM maps textual observations to function signatures.
  - **Quick check question:** How does an LLM "execute" a tool it cannot physically run itself? (Answer: It generates the code, which an external Python environment executes).

- **Concept: Egocentric Spatial Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** A key failure mode is "Spatial Direction Understanding Error," where models confuse left/right/front/back in first-person views.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does spatial reasoning from an egocentric video differ from reasoning in a static 2D image? (Hint: Dynamic camera motion and frame alignment).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Orchestrator (AutoGen agent) -> Reasoning Engine (MLLM) -> Tool Layer (Python environment with GroundingDINO, SoM, custom functions) -> Context Manager (Jupyter Notebook storing history)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Input: Image + Question -> Agent initializes with category-specific prompt
  2. Reasoning: MLLM generates Python code to call a tool
  3. Execution: Agent executes code in Tool Layer, generating modified image or text
  4. Feedback: Result fed back to MLLM as "Observation"
  5. Termination: MLLM outputs `ANSWER: <text> TERMINATE`

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Accuracy:** Tool calls add significant inference time but bridge the "omni-visual" gap
  - **Bespoke vs. General:** Hand-crafted knowledge base improves specific benchmarks but may lack generality compared to end-to-end training

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Localization Error:** Tool detects object but MLLM selects wrong point
  - **Visual Reasoning Error:** Visualization is generated correctly but MLLM misinterprets direction or color
  - **Tool Hallucination:** MLLM calls tools with non-existent parameters or invents tool names

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run "Pointing" category on InternVL3-14B using Direct prompting to observe >60% Localization Error rate
  2. Implement `detect` function using GroundingDINO and run BEAR-Agent on "General Object Pointing" task
  3. Implement `extend_arrow` and run agent on "Gripper Trajectory Reasoning," inspecting cases where tool helps vs. fails

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multimodal models be trained or prompted to improve spatial reasoning capabilities when standard Chain-of-Thought strategies degrade performance on intuitive, non-verbal spatial tasks?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.2 states CoT prompting is ineffective for Spatial Reasoning because spatial understanding is an intuitive, non-verbal process.
- Why unresolved: Paper identifies failure of current reasoning paradigms but doesn't propose alternatives respecting non-verbal spatial cognition.
- What evidence would resolve it: Study demonstrating new training objective or inference technique that improves spatial reasoning without verbal step-decomposition.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MLLMs intrinsically develop fine-grained localization and 3D understanding capabilities demonstrated by BEAR-Agent, or is external tool integration necessary for robust embodied agency?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.1 introduces BEAR-Agent specifically to address "omni-visual abilities" bottleneck by integrating pretrained vision models.
- Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates tool-augmented solution but doesn't investigate if scaling or architectural changes could yield same capabilities without external tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of future foundation model with native high-resolution perception that matches BEAR-Agent's performance without external APIs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific data modalities or training paradigms are required to bridge the large performance gap between proprietary and open-source models in long-horizon embodied tasks?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.2 notes proprietary models average 39.2%, outperforming open-source by 13.4%, and Figure 5 shows scaling model size doesn't consistently improve embodied performance.
- Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates standard scaling laws don't reliably enhance embodied capabilities, implying specific training data or architectural features differentiate proprietary models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study showing training open-source models on specific datasets closes the 13.4% gap with proprietary counterparts.

## Limitations
- Curated BEAR dataset (4,469 VQA pairs) is not yet public, limiting direct reproduction
- Internal logic for semantic scene graph construction and trajectory extension heuristics lacks full detail
- Results heavily depend on specific MLLM versions and their vision encoders

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core claim that MLLMs struggle with atomic embodied tasks is well-supported by 20-model evaluation
- **Medium Confidence:** BEAR-Agent improvement mechanism is logically sound but exact performance gains depend on unspecified implementation details
- **Medium Confidence:** Human baseline comparison using GPT-4o as proxy is methodologically reasonable but not definitive

## Next Checks

1. Attempt to recreate BEAR's 4,469 VQA pairs using the described GPT-4o+Grounded-SAM curation pipeline on the 13 source datasets
2. Implement and run GroundingDINO + custom trajectory functions, logging actual vs. hallucinated tool outputs in BEAR-Agent
3. Test the same Direct Prompting and BEAR-Agent pipeline on 3 different MLLM versions to verify ~9% average improvement is reproducible
