- Primary result: VR-based 3D scene editing system integrating generative AI with real-time immersive editing of radiance fields (NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting).

## Executive Summary
Dreamcrafter is a VR-based 3D scene editing system that integrates generative AI with real-time immersive editing of radiance fields (NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting). It provides a modular architecture to combine direct manipulation with natural language instructions, using proxy representations for previewing high-latency operations. A user study with seven participants showed that users prefer a mix of prompting and sculpting, feeling more control with sculpting but creating more objects via prompting. Participants found proxy representations useful for scene composition, though some uncertainties remained about final object details. Dreamcrafter supports 2D and 3D outputs, enabling iterative scene creation and stylization. The system bridges immersive editing and generative AI, offering flexible, creative control over 3D content authoring.

## Method Summary
Dreamcrafter combines immersive VR editing with generative AI capabilities through a modular architecture. The system allows users to edit radiance fields (NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting) using both direct manipulation and natural language instructions. It employs proxy representations to preview high-latency operations, enabling real-time scene composition while generative processes run in the background. The system supports multiple output formats including 2D images and 3D radiance fields, facilitating iterative scene creation and stylization workflows.

## Key Results
- Users prefer a mixed approach combining prompting and sculpting, with sculpting providing better control while prompting enables faster object creation.
- Proxy representations were found useful for scene composition, though 2D proxies lack size information that can cause placement uncertainties.
- The system successfully bridges immersive editing with generative AI, supporting both 2D and 3D output formats for iterative scene creation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by providing flexible input modalities (voice, direct manipulation) combined with generative AI capabilities, while using proxy representations to maintain real-time interaction despite high-latency generative operations. The modular architecture allows users to choose between different editing approaches based on their needs, with proxy previews enabling informed decision-making during scene composition. The support for multiple output formats (2D and 3D) enables iterative workflows that combine the strengths of different representation types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Radiance Fields (NeRFs)**: Neural representations of 3D scenes that enable high-quality rendering from novel viewpoints. Why needed: Core data representation for immersive 3D editing. Quick check: Can the system render consistent views from different camera positions?
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Alternative 3D representation using millions of particles for efficient rendering. Why needed: Provides faster rendering than NeRFs while maintaining quality. Quick check: Compare rendering performance between NeRF and Gaussian Splatting modes.
- **Proxy Representations**: Low-fidelity previews used during high-latency operations. Why needed: Maintain real-time interaction while generative processes complete. Quick check: Measure user task completion time with and without proxies.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Natural language processing combined with 3D content generation. Why needed: Enable intuitive content creation through conversational commands. Quick check: Test system response to varied natural language instructions.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of editing, generation, and rendering components. Why needed: Allow flexible combination of different input and output modalities. Quick check: Verify independent operation of each module.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Input -> Processing Module -> Proxy Generator -> Real-time Renderer -> Output Format
**Critical Path**: Voice/Natural Language Input → Text Processing → 3D Generation → Proxy Creation → Scene Integration → Final Output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Real-time interaction vs. generation quality; 2D proxy simplicity vs. 3D spatial accuracy; user control vs. automation.
**Failure Signatures**: 
- Proxy mismatch with final output indicates generation failure or model limitations
- High latency suggests model complexity exceeds system capacity
- Incorrect object placement reveals proxy representation limitations
- Speech recognition errors propagate to generation failures

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test basic voice command generation with simple objects to verify core functionality
2. Compare user task completion times with and without proxy representations
3. Evaluate consistency between 2D proxy previews and final 3D outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How do alternative input modalities like 2D/3D sketches or gestures compare to voice commands for controlling generative AI in immersive editors?
- Basis in paper: The authors ask, "what if users could use Dreamcrafter with text or 2D/3D sketches/images as reference input or with multimodal input like gestures...?"
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies heavily on speech-to-text, and while sculpting exists, other multimodal inputs remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring user efficiency and satisfaction when using sketch-based versus voice-based generation workflows.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What forms of proxy representations (e.g., wireframes, low-fidelity meshes) best mitigate the loss of size and spatial information inherent in 2D previews?
- Basis in paper: The authors ask, "what might alternative proxies or intermediate proxies between 2D and 3D objects look like? For example, would users find 3D wireframe outlines just as useful as the 2D image previews?"
- Why unresolved: Participants found 2D proxies useful for style but insufficient for scene composition due to missing size cues; 3D proxies were added post-hoc but not formally evaluated against other abstract forms.
- What evidence would resolve it: User testing various proxy types (wireframe, abstract mesh, 2D image) to measure placement accuracy and cognitive load during scene composition tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can immersive systems enable global editing of underlying environments rather than limiting edits to individual objects?
- Basis in paper: The paper states, "users may want to edit aspects of the underlying environment as they design their scenes... Ideally, users should be able to... control which objects receive the global style treatment."
- Why unresolved: The current system is limited to editing or generating discrete radiance field objects and cannot modify the fixed background environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a global stylization pipeline and an evaluation of its ability to apply consistent style changes across the entire scene view.

## Limitations
- The user study involved only seven participants, limiting generalizability of findings and lacking diversity in user expertise levels.
- The system cannot edit the underlying environment, restricting users to object-level modifications only.
- Latency measurements for high-latency operations are not provided, making it difficult to assess proxy system effectiveness.

## Confidence
- **High**: The core technical implementation of radiance field editing and proxy representation system appears sound.
- **Medium**: Usability findings are based on limited user study with seven participants and lack longitudinal evaluation.
- **Low**: Robustness of generative AI integration in complex real-world scenarios remains untested.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale user study (minimum 20 participants) with varied expertise levels to validate the initial usability findings and assess learning curves for different user groups.
2. Perform a comprehensive latency analysis comparing proxy-based previews with actual generative outputs across various scene complexities and operation types.
3. Test the system's robustness with ambiguous or complex natural language instructions and evaluate the quality and consistency of generated outputs across multiple editing sessions.
