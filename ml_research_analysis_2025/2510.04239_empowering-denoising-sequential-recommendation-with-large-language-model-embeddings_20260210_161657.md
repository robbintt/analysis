# Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.04239
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04239
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: IADSR integrates LLM semantic embeddings with sequential models to identify and filter noisy interactions, achieving 24.6% to 36.3% average improvements in HR@5 and NDCG@5 across four datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of noise in sequential recommendation systems—such as accidental clicks and exploratory behaviors—that can degrade recommendation performance. The proposed IADSR framework combines collaborative signals from traditional sequential models with semantic information from large language models to better identify and filter noisy interactions. By aligning long-term and short-term interests across both modalities and employing a Gumbel-Sigmoid function for noise detection, IADSR effectively preserves real user preferences while removing noise. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art denoising methods.

## Method Summary
IADSR operates in two stages: offline generation of semantic embeddings using LLM2Vec from item names, and online training that aligns semantic and collaborative embeddings via InfoNCE loss. The framework computes cross-modal consistency scores from three cosine similarities between long-term and short-term interests, then applies a Gumbel-Sigmoid function to generate differentiable binary masks for denoising. A reconstruction loss helps the model learn from its own denoising decisions. The method is evaluated across multiple backbone models (GRU4Rec, SASRec, Caser) on Amazon Beauty, Sports, Toys, and MovieLens-100K datasets.

## Key Results
- IADSR achieves average improvements of 24.6% to 36.3% in HR@5 and NDCG@5 compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods
- Consistent gains observed across all four datasets and three different backbone sequential models
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of semantic embeddings, cross-modal alignment, and reconstruction loss components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Semantic embeddings from LLMs provide contextual understanding that prevents over-denoising of cold items.
- **Mechanism**: LLM2Vec encodes item text (e.g., product names) into dense vectors that capture product attributes and category information through pre-trained world knowledge. When collaborative signals are sparse (cold items), semantic embeddings provide an alternative basis for judging whether an interaction aligns with user interests.
- **Core assumption**: Item names contain sufficient semantic signal to infer product relationships and user intent (Assumption: more detailed text would improve this further).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "integrates collaborative signals from traditional sequential models with semantic information from large language models to better identify and filter noisy interactions"
  - [section 3.2] "Even with just the item name, the semantic embeddings effectively capture product categories and attributes through the pre-trained knowledge embedded in the LLM"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on embedding fusion strategies but don't specifically validate semantic embeddings for cold-start denoising
- **Break condition**: If item text is missing, generic, or misleading (e.g., sponsored product names that obscure function), semantic embeddings may provide incorrect similarity signals.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Cross-modal alignment via InfoNCE loss creates shared representation space where consistency between modalities indicates genuine user preference.
- **Mechanism**: The model computes cosine similarity between long-term interests in both modalities (semantic vs. collaborative). High similarity suggests the user's behavior pattern is coherent across what they semantically prefer and what they interact with collaboratively. InfoNCE loss explicitly maximizes mutual information between corresponding interest embeddings.
- **Core assumption**: User interests are fundamentally consistent regardless of the modality used to represent them (Assumption: this holds for most users but may fail for users with highly exploratory or inconsistent behavior).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.3.2] "Both modalities ultimately attempt to capture the same underlying user interests"
  - [section 3.4] "Users whose cross-modal similarity λ exceeds a threshold θ proceed to the detailed noise detection stage"
  - [corpus] No direct validation from neighbors; assumption remains plausible but unverified across diverse user populations
- **Break condition**: If modality alignment fails (e.g., semantic embeddings don't capture key preference dimensions), the consistency check will misclassify both signal and noise.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Gumbel-Sigmoid enables differentiable binary mask generation for end-to-end denoising training.
- **Mechanism**: Rather than hard-thresholding noise scores, Gumbel-Sigmoid adds stochastic noise and applies temperature-controlled sigmoid, producing differentiable binary-like masks. This allows gradient flow through the denoising decision, letting the model learn from its own noise-filtering choices via reconstruction loss.
- **Core assumption**: The noise score (sum of three cross-modal consistency measures) reliably distinguishes noise from signal.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.4.2] "The Gumbel-Sigmoid function enables differentiable binary sampling during training...allowing models to make discrete decisions...while effectively maintaining gradient flow"
  - [section 4.3] Ablation shows reconstruction loss provides "additional training supervision that helps the model learn more robust embeddings"
  - [corpus] Gumbel-Softmax variants are standard in related work; mechanism is technically sound but effectiveness depends on score quality
- **Break condition**: If temperature is too high, masks become non-discriminative; if too low, gradients vanish.

## Foundational Learning

- **Sequential Recommendation**:
  - Why needed here: The backbone models (GRU4Rec, SASRec, Caser) encode temporal patterns from interaction sequences; understanding how they produce embeddings is essential for the alignment stage.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how SASRec's self-attention differs from GRU4Rec's recurrent encoding for the same user sequence?

- **Contrastive Learning / InfoNCE Loss**:
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for aligning semantic and collaborative embeddings; understanding what InfoNCE optimizes helps diagnose alignment failures.
  - Quick check question: What happens to InfoNCE loss when all embeddings in a batch are identical (degenerate case)?

- **Cold-Start Problem**:
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly targets over-denoising of cold items; understanding why collaborative signals fail for sparse items explains the semantic embedding motivation.
  - Quick check question: If an item has only 2 interactions, what can a collaborative embedding reliably capture vs. what semantic embeddings might provide?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM2Vec (item names → semantic embeddings) → Sequential backbone (interaction sequences → collaborative embeddings) → Cross-modal alignment (InfoNCE) → Noise score computation (3 cosine similarities) → Gumbel-Sigmoid mask → Denoised sequence → Reconstruction loss → Backpropagation

- **Critical path**: Semantic embedding quality → Alignment quality → Mask generation → Reconstruction loss balancing

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using only item names vs. full descriptions: simpler but weaker semantic signal
  - Threshold θ: too high filters out users who could benefit from denoising; too low applies noisy masks
  - Progressive denoising across epochs: more stable but slower convergence

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Cold items consistently flagged as noise → semantic embeddings not providing useful signal
  - HR@5 improves but HR@20 drops → over-aggressive denoising (check mask statistics)
  - Alignment loss doesn't converge → embedding spaces fundamentally incompatible (check dimensionality, normalization)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate baseline comparison on Beauty dataset with GRU4Rec; verify reported HR@5 and NDCG@5 gains
  2. Ablate semantic embeddings entirely (use only collaborative signals) to quantify semantic contribution; expect performance drop especially for cold-item metrics
  3. Vary threshold θ from -1.0 to 0.9; plot HR@5 vs. θ to find optimal operating point and validate paper's claim that θ = -0.9 works best

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes semantic embeddings from item names are sufficient for cross-modal denoising without validating this across different text qualities or domains
- Relies on a single threshold θ for all users, which may not adapt well to diverse user behavior patterns
- Memory requirements for LLM2Vec with long sequences could limit practical deployment on commodity hardware

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of using Gumbel-Sigmoid for differentiable denoising and the overall two-stage framework architecture
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that semantic embeddings specifically help with cold-start denoising (based on correlation with improved performance but not direct validation)
- **Low confidence**: The universal optimality of θ = -0.9 threshold across all datasets and user populations

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on text quality**: Remove item names entirely and replace with random tokens; measure how much performance degrades to quantify the actual contribution of semantic information versus other mechanisms.
2. **Cold-item performance analysis**: Filter evaluation to only cold items (≤5 interactions) and compare IADSR's HR@5 against baselines; if gains disappear, the cold-start denoising claim is unsupported.
3. **Threshold sensitivity study**: Vary θ from -1.0 to 0.9 in 0.1 increments and plot HR@5 vs. threshold for each dataset; if optimal θ varies significantly across datasets, the paper's fixed threshold choice is inadequate.
