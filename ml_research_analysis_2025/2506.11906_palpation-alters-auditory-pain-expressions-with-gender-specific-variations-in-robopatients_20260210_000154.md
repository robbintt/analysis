# Palpation Alters Auditory Pain Expressions with Gender-Specific Variations in Robopatients

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11906
- Reference count: 40
- Participants found vocal pain expressions realistic and distinguishable, with female sounds easier to interpret.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for generating adaptive auditory pain expressions in a robopatient during abdominal palpation, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically refine pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. The system successfully adapts to individual palpation forces and sound preferences, capturing a broad spectrum of pain intensity from mild discomfort to acute distress. Results show that participants' actual palpation forces averaged around 40-60 N, with pain sound perception exhibiting saturation at lower forces and gender-specific thresholds. Participants found vocal pain expressions realistic and distinguishable, with female sounds easier to interpret. The approach demonstrates potential for enhancing abdominal palpation training by offering a controllable and immersive simulation platform that accounts for individual and gender-based differences in pain perception.

## Method Summary
The system uses PPO to learn mapping between palpation force and pain sound parameters (pitch, amplitude) through human feedback. Force is measured by 4 load cells (246mm spacing), filtered with moving average window=20, and scaled to pain intensity (β=5). Binary user feedback (Agree/Disagree) serves as reward. The policy network selects from 4×4 discrete pitch-amplitude combinations. Separate PPO training occurs for male and female pain sounds. 120 trials per gender per participant (240 total) with target forces [5, 10, 15, 20]N.

## Key Results
- PPO successfully adapts pain sound parameters in real-time based on palpation force and human feedback
- Pain sound perception exhibits saturation at lower forces with gender-specific thresholds
- Female pain expressions were easier for participants to interpret than male expressions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
PPO enables stable, continuous adaptation of pain sound parameters through binary human feedback in real-time. The algorithm maintains two neural networks—a policy network that selects pitch/amplitude combinations based on palpation force, and a value network estimating future rewards. Binary user feedback (Agree=1, Disagree=0) serves as the reward signal. The clipped surrogate objective function constrains policy updates to prevent destabilizing large deviations while allowing iterative refinement.

### Mechanism 2
A linear scaling relationship transforms filtered palpation force into pain intensity, enabling bounded exploration of the auditory pain space. Four load cells measure total palpation force, which is smoothed via moving average filter (window=20) and scaled by β=5 to produce pain intensity (0-100 range). This intensity guides the policy network's selection of pitch and amplitude from discrete parameter spaces (4 amplitude levels, 4 pitch levels).

### Mechanism 3
Gender-specific acoustic parameterizations emerge from separate PPO training sessions, reflecting perceptual differences in how pain vocalizations are interpreted. The system trains independently on male and female pain soundtracks (3 per gender). PPO learns different pitch-amplitude mappings for each gender based on accumulated feedback. Results show male expressions characterized by lower pitch and consistent amplitude, while female expressions exhibit higher pitch and more variable intensity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Why needed here: Understanding why PPO was chosen over SAC, DDPG, or TD3 requires grasping policy gradient fundamentals, clipped objectives, and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in human-in-the-loop settings.
  - Quick check question: Why does PPO use a clipped surrogate objective rather than unconstrained policy gradient updates, and what failure mode does this prevent?

- **Acoustic Features of Pain Vocalizations**: Why needed here: The system manipulates pitch and amplitude based on research showing these features signal pain intensity. Understanding this mapping is essential for interpreting the parameter spaces explored.
  - Quick check question: According to the paper's cited literature, what acoustic characteristics (pitch, amplitude, duration, fundamental frequency variation) are associated with higher pain intensity in vocalizations?

- **Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed here: The paradigm differs from standard RL—rewards come from subjective human judgments with potential cognitive biases, and sample efficiency is critical due to participant fatigue.
  - Quick check question: How does binary feedback (Agree/Disagree) get converted to a reward signal, and what does the paper suggest about participants' feedback reliability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Load cells (4× 20kg, 246mm spacing) → DAQ (NI USB-6212, 1000Hz) → Silicone abdominal phantom (Ecoflex 00-30) → MATLAB 2024a (force filtering, pain intensity calculation, PPO agent) → MorphFace (3D physical-virtual hybrid face) + Audio playback (Razer Kraken headset) → Android tablet (Bluetooth Keyboard app) → Agree/Disagree buttons → Binary rewards

- **Critical path**: User palpates phantom (5s window, target force 5-20N) → Load cells capture force → moving average filter (window=20) → threshold check (>0.5N) → Force scaled to pain intensity (β=5) → state for PPO → Policy network outputs (pitch, amplitude) from discrete spaces → Pain sound played + facial expression displayed on MorphFace → User provides feedback (3s window, binary or 0.5 if timeout) → Transition (state, action, reward, next_state) stored → Policy/value networks updated via clipped objective → Loop continues (120 trials per gender per participant)

- **Design tradeoffs**: PPO vs SAC/DDPG chosen for policy stability and real-time adaptability; binary vs continuous feedback simplifies cognitive load but loses granularity; discrete parameter spaces (4×4 pitch-amplitude grid) limit expression richness but make exploration tractable with small sample sizes; gender-separate training captures perceptual differences but doubles experiment duration (240 trials total)

- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistent feedback prioritizes comfort over accuracy, policy converges to idiosyncratic mappings; policy instability with large reward variance prevents convergence; force measurement artifacts from noise below 0.5N threshold; timeout-induced noise with 0.5 default for missed decisions; small sample generalization limits statistical power

- **First 3 experiments**: Baseline single-participant learning curve (120 trials, one gender) to observe convergence behavior; cross-participant variance analysis (3-5 participants) to quantify individual differences; force generalization test (probe learned policy at intermediate forces like 7.5N, 12.5N) to evaluate interpolation capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=5 participants) and lack of demographic diversity constrain generalizability of gender-specific findings
- Binary feedback mechanism may not capture full spectrum of perceptual nuances and introduces noise through timeout-induced default rewards
- Discrete 4×4 action space limits richness of possible pain expressions compared to continuous parameter spaces

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: PPO implementation successfully learns to map palpation forces to pain sounds in real-time, as evidenced by convergence patterns and participant feedback on realism
- **Medium Confidence**: Gender-specific acoustic patterns (lower pitch/consistent amplitude for males, higher pitch/variable intensity for females) are observed but require validation with larger, more diverse samples
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about generalizability to clinical training and ability to capture "broad spectrum of pain intensity" are limited by small sample size and controlled experimental conditions

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-participant policy stability**: Compare learning curves and final policies across 10+ participants to quantify individual differences and assess whether pooled policies maintain performance

2. **Force-generalization probe**: After training on discrete target forces, systematically test intermediate forces (7.5N, 12.5N, 17.5N) to evaluate interpolation capability and mapping continuity

3. **Cultural/demographic validation**: Repeat the experiment with participants from diverse cultural backgrounds to determine if gender-based acoustic patterns persist across populations
