  forecasting horizons beyond the conventional day-ahead setting, leveraging recent
  advances in deep learning (DL) for time series forecasting. We propose a novel DL-based
  EPF framework that systematically evaluates both standard DL models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM,
  Transformer) and state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models (e.g., Mamba, TimeXer,
  TimeMixer) across all five regions of the Australian National Electricity Market

# Multi-Horizon Electricity Price Forecasting with Deep Learning in the Australian National Electricity Market

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01157
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Standard DL models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) outperform SOTA models on 24-hour forecasts but degrade faster on 48-hour horizons, while SOTA models show greater robustness at the cost of short-term precision.

## Executive Summary
This study extends electricity price forecasting horizons beyond the conventional day-ahead setting by evaluating both standard and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures across all five Australian National Electricity Market regions. The framework systematically benchmarks nine DL models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, DLinear, TimesNet, iTransformer, Mamba, TimeMixer, TimeXer) using a direct multi-step forecasting strategy. Results reveal a trade-off between short-term accuracy and long-horizon robustness, with pronounced diurnal error patterns driven by physical generation mix and price regime dynamics.

## Method Summary
The study forecasts 30-minute Regional Reference Prices using univariate time series data from the Australian NEM (Jan 2023-Jun 2025), downsampled from 5-minute to 30-minute resolution. Nine deep learning models are evaluated across 5 regions using direct multi-step forecasting with 7-day (24h) or 14-day (48h) lookback windows. Models are trained with Adam optimizer, ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling, and early stopping, with performance assessed via MAE, RMSE, rMAE, sMAPE, and MDA across 5 random seeds.

## Key Results
- Standard DL models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) achieve superior 24-hour accuracy but show higher degradation on 48-hour horizons
- SOTA models exhibit greater robustness to longer horizons through "over-smoothing" of high-frequency volatility
- Diurnal error patterns show evening ramp errors for MAE/RMSE and midday negative-price regime errors for sMAPE

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Standard DL models (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) achieve superior short-horizon accuracy by prioritizing high-frequency local volatility signals, specifically capturing the "evening ramp" dynamics better than SOTA architectures.
- **Mechanism:** CNN filters and LSTM gates capture immediate temporal gradients and short-term dependencies effectively. This sensitivity allows them to react to rapid price shifts during demand ramps (16:00–20:30), resulting in lower MAE and RMSE in 24-hour forecasts.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that the superior short-term performance of standard DL models is due to their inductive bias toward local temporal features, whereas their poorer long-term performance suggests they fail to capture durable global trends.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Standard DL models deliver superior overall performance... pronounced time-of-day error patterns, with peak errors during evening ramps."
  - [section 4.3.1] "Error peaks in MAE and RMSE align closely with periods of elevated short-term price volatility... rise is comparatively modest for sequence-based architectures such as Transformers, Mamba, and LSTM."
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., *A Transformer approach for Electricity Price Forecasting*) generally supports the efficacy of attention mechanisms, but specific comparisons of local volatility capture are unique to this paper's diurnal analysis.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism would fail if the market volatility profile shifts to purely structural trends without rapid intra-day ramps, potentially neutralizing the standard DL advantage.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** SOTA time series models (e.g., TimeXer, TimeMixer) exhibit greater robustness to horizon extension (48h) by effectively smoothing high-frequency noise, albeit at the cost of short-term precision.
- **Mechanism:** Architectures designed for long-sequence modeling (e.g., decomposition layers in TimeMixer, patch attention in TimeXer) tend to filter out "transient" volatility to focus on longer-range dependencies. This reduces error accumulation over 48 hours but causes "over-smoothing" during volatile 24-hour windows.
- **Core assumption:** The paper posits that the lower performance degradation of SOTA models implies a capacity for "global robustness" rather than just better modeling, suggesting they might be under-fitting the high-frequency dynamics of the NEM.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "SOTA models exhibit greater robustness to longer horizons."
  - [section 4.4.2] "SOTA architectures... demonstrated superior stability... likely stems from an 'over-smoothing' of the data, effectively filtering out the high-frequency volatility."
  - [corpus] Evidence regarding specific degradation rates is primarily derived from this paper's benchmark; corpus neighbors focus on accuracy rather than the robustness/smoothing trade-off.
- **Break condition:** If exogenous variables (weather, load) are introduced, SOTA models designed for multivariate inputs might regain short-term precision, breaking the current trade-off.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Distinct intraday error regimes are driven by the physical generation mix, where negative prices (midday solar) inflate relative errors and dispatchable ramps (evening) inflate absolute errors.
- **Mechanism:** In high-renewable regions (SA, VIC), solar generation drives prices to zero or negative values around midday. This causes Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) to spike because the denominator in relative error calculations approaches zero, independent of the model's accuracy on absolute price magnitude.
- **Core assumption:** The analysis assumes that the error spikes are a structural feature of the price distribution (generation physics) rather than a failure of the model architecture itself.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Inflated relative errors during midday negative-price regimes."
  - [section 4.3.2] "sMAPE spikes dramatically during midday intervals... coinciding with peak negative price occurrences exceeding 40%... sMAPE's formula... becomes highly sensitive when prices hover near zero."
  - [corpus] *Probabilistic intraday electricity price forecasting...* notes the difficulty of intraday trading, aligning with the finding that specific intraday intervals are harder to predict.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism holds for percentage-based metrics; however, if evaluation were strictly based on magnitude metrics (MAE), the midday "failure" signal would likely disappear.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Direct Multi-Step Forecasting**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses a direct strategy (predicting 48/96 steps in one pass) rather than a recursive one. This prevents error accumulation where a bad prediction at step 1 degrades step 2.
  - **Quick check question:** If you feed the prediction of time $t$ back into the model to predict $t+1$, which specific error metric would likely degrade fastest over a 48-hour horizon?

- **Concept:** **Relative vs. Absolute Error Metrics**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights that MAE and RMSE measure magnitude (good for trading hedging), while sMAPE and MDA measure direction/relative shape (good for operational scheduling). A model can be "good" at MAE but "fail" at sMAPE during negative price periods.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a model predicting a price of \$5 when the actual price is -\$5 result in a mathematically unstable or infinite sMAPE value?

- **Concept:** **Regime-Switching Dynamics**
  - **Why needed here:** Electricity prices are non-stationary, switching between positive, zero, and negative regimes based on renewable availability. Standard DL models often struggle at these "switch" boundaries (trend changes).
  - **Quick check question:** During which specific time-of-day window does the paper identify "directional accuracy degradation," and what physical grid event causes it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Univariate 30-min RRP -> Min-Max Scaling + Time Features -> LSTM/CNN-LSTM/Transformer/DLinear/TimesNet/iTransformer/Mamba/TimeMixer/TimeXer -> Linear Layer -> 48/96 step forecast

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Data Splitting:** Must be strictly chronological (Train: Jan '23-Dec '24, Test: Jan '25-Jun '25)
  2. **Sequence Construction:** Map 336 steps (7 days) lookback to 48 steps forecast
  3. **Diurnal Analysis:** Do not aggregate results; you must evaluate performance at each of the 48 half-hour intervals to detect the "midday spike" and "evening ramp" patterns

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Standard DL (LSTM/CNN-LSTM):** Choose for higher accuracy on 24h horizons; accepts higher degradation on 48h horizons. High sensitivity to volatility.
  - **SOTA (TimeXer/Mamba):** Choose for consistency across multi-day horizons; accepts "over-smoothing" of rapid price spikes.
  - **Univariate vs. Multivariate:** The paper deliberately restricts inputs to price only to benchmark architectures. Adding generation/load data (exogenous variables) is the recommended next step but complicates the baseline comparison.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Midday sMAPE Explosion":** If sMAPE spikes >80% during 09:00–15:00 while MAE remains low, the model is struggling with the zero-price floor (negative pricing regime).
  - **The "Evening Drift":** If RMSE disproportionately increases compared to MAE during 17:00–20:00, the model is missing extreme price spikes (tail events).
  - **Naive Equivalence:** If rMAE ≥ 1.0, the model is performing no better than a weekly naive persistence forecast (last week's prices) and should be discarded.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Sanity Check:** Train a simple LSTM and a Weekly Naive model. Verify that LSTM rMAE < 1.0 on the QLD dataset. If not, check data normalization or lookback window sizing.
  2. **Horizon Degradation Test:** Train your selected best model (e.g., TimeXer) on the 24h task, then the 48h task. Plot the degradation % (Δ%). If degradation > 15%, the model is over-fitting to short-term local dependencies.
  3. **Intraday Profile Audit:** Plot MAE and sMAPE for all 48 intervals of the day. Confirm if the error peaks align with the paper's findings (Midday for sMAPE, Evening for MAE). If peaks occur at random times, inspect the timestamp feature encoding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can hybrid architectures combining local recurrent/convolutional modules with global decomposition-based SOTA components simultaneously achieve high short-term accuracy and long-horizon robustness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4.2 suggests that future work should prioritize architectures that capture short-term volatility while maintaining robustness over long forecasting horizons, specifically proposing a "decomposing the forecasting task" approach.
- Why unresolved: The study found a dichotomy where standard DL models offered the best short-term accuracy but degraded rapidly, while SOTA models were robust but "over-smoothed" volatility.
- What evidence: Developing a coupled architecture and demonstrating it maintains lower degradation percentages at 48 hours without sacrificing the 24-hour accuracy of standard DL baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do asymmetric or regime-weighted loss functions improve forecasting accuracy for negative-price regimes and heavy-tailed price spikes compared to standard MSE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4.3 states that future work should explore loss functions tailored to asymmetric distributions, noting that standard MSE is "misaligned" with the economic significance of extreme events.
- Why unresolved: Models optimized with MSE tended to regress toward the mean, under-emphasizing the difficult intervals with zero or negative prices.
- What evidence: A comparative study showing that models trained with regime-weighted objectives yield statistically significant improvements in sMAPE during midday negative-price intervals.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the integration of exogenous variables (e.g., weather, load, interconnector flows) enable models to anticipate structural shifts like midday negative pricing and evening ramps more effectively than univariate inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4.1 concludes that "Future models should integrate additional data" because univariate inputs cannot capture the physical drivers (like solar irradiance) of specific diurnal error patterns.
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately excluded exogenous features to isolate architectural performance, limiting the models' ability to distinguish between low demand and renewable saturation events.
- What evidence: A multivariate modeling study that demonstrates reduced error spikes during the evening ramp and midday solar oversupply periods relative to the univariate baselines established in this paper.

## Limitations

- Strict univariate modeling assumption limits generalizability to real-world systems that rely on exogenous inputs
- Use of relative metrics (sMAPE) introduces sensitivity to near-zero price regimes, potentially over-penalizing models
- Architectural details for baseline models are underspecified, affecting reproducibility of comparative results

## Confidence

- **High:** Horizon degradation trends, SOTA robustness, diurnal error patterns (evening ramp, midday spike)
- **Medium:** Interpretation of SOTA over-smoothing as structural smoothing vs. underfitting; regional performance differences without causal attribution
- **Low:** Extrapolation of current results to systems with different renewable penetration or pricing regimes

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Region Transferability:** Retrain top-performing models (e.g., LSTM, TimeXer) on pooled regional data and evaluate out-of-region performance to test robustness to structural heterogeneity
2. **Exogenous Input Sensitivity:** Augment the univariate baseline with day-ahead load and solar forecasts; measure impact on MAE/sMAPE for midday and evening intervals
3. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Replace point forecasts with quantile regression or ensemble-based probabilistic outputs; compare reliability diagrams and sharpness against deterministic benchmarks
