# On the Difficulty of Token-Level Modeling of Dysfluency and Fluency Shaping Artifacts

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA adapters significantly improves dysfluency recognition in stuttered speech for English and German datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts in stuttered speech using automatic speech recognition systems. The authors propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach using LoRA adapters to predict special tokens representing disfluencies and modified speech within transcriptions. Experiments on English and German stuttered speech datasets demonstrate significant improvements in word error rates and token placement accuracy, particularly when incorporating language-adaptive pretraining. However, persistent tokenization bias against German limits overall performance gains.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a token-level modeling approach using LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained ASR models. The method focuses on predicting special tokens that mark dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts in transcriptions. Language-adaptive pretraining is incorporated to improve cross-linguistic performance. The approach is evaluated on established stuttered speech corpora in both English and German, comparing word error rates and token placement accuracy against baseline systems.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in word error rates for both English and German stuttered speech datasets
- Enhanced token placement accuracy for dysfluency markers in transcriptions
- Language-adaptive pretraining further improves cross-linguistic performance
- Tokenization bias against German persists despite adaptation techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation approach works by injecting small trainable adapter modules into pretrained ASR models, allowing for effective fine-tuning on dysfluency-specific patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. The token-level modeling strategy enables precise identification and marking of disfluencies and fluency artifacts within transcriptions. Language-adaptive pretraining helps bridge cross-linguistic gaps by exposing the model to diverse language patterns before specialized fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
- LoRA adapters (Low-Rank Adaptation) - Lightweight fine-tuning technique that reduces parameter count while maintaining performance; needed for efficient adaptation to specialized tasks
- Token-level modeling - Approach treating disfluencies as discrete tokens to be predicted; needed for precise dysfluency identification in transcriptions
- Language-adaptive pretraining - Pretraining strategy that incorporates multiple languages to improve cross-linguistic generalization; needed to address multilingual model limitations
- Disfluency patterns - Characteristics of stuttered speech including repetitions, prolongations, and blocks; needed for understanding the specific challenges in ASR for dysfluent speech
- Fluency-shaping artifacts - Modifications in speech resulting from fluency shaping techniques; needed for comprehensive modeling of stuttered speech variations
- Tokenization bias - Systematic errors in how language models process different languages; needed to understand performance disparities between languages

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Pretrained ASR model -> LoRA adapters -> Token-level dysfluency prediction -> Language-adaptive pretraining
- Critical path: Speech input → ASR model processing → LoRA-enhanced token prediction → Disfluency-marked output
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency (LoRA) vs. model capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns; precise token-level modeling vs. sequence-level contextual understanding
- Failure signatures: Persistent tokenization bias against German, limited performance gains on spontaneous speech, potential oversimplification of complex dysfluency patterns
- First experiments: 1) Baseline ASR performance comparison on stuttered vs. fluent speech, 2) LoRA adapter effectiveness evaluation across different hyperparameter settings, 3) Cross-linguistic performance analysis between English and German datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to address persistent tokenization bias in multilingual models for dysfluency recognition
- Whether alternative modeling approaches might better capture temporal dependencies in dysfluencies
- How the approach generalizes to languages beyond English and German

## Limitations
- Tokenization bias against German significantly limits cross-linguistic performance gains
- Token-level modeling may oversimplify the complex temporal and prosodic nature of stuttered speech
- Results based on controlled corpora may not generalize to spontaneous speech with naturalistic variability

## Confidence
- Medium: Measurable improvements in controlled experimental conditions, but limited generalizability due to language-specific performance gaps and persistent tokenization bias

## Next Checks
1. Cross-linguistic validation on additional languages with different morphological and prosodic characteristics to assess the universality of the LoRA adaptation approach
2. Evaluation on spontaneous speech corpora with naturalistic stuttering patterns to test robustness against acoustic variability
3. Comparative analysis of token-level versus sequence-level modeling approaches to determine optimal architecture for capturing temporal dynamics of dysfluencies
