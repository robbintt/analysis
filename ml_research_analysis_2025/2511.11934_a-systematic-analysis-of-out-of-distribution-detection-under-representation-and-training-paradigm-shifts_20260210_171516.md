# A Systematic Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Detection Under Representation and Training Paradigm Shifts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.11934
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11934
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This study systematically evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods under varying training paradigms and representation regimes. It introduces a representation-centric experimental design that varies backbone architectures (CNN vs. ViT), training paradigms, and confidence scoring functions (CSFs), alongside neural collapse-based geometric analysis. Using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics, the evaluation spans CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet with near/mid/far semantic shifts stratified by CLIP embeddings. Statistical analysis via Friedman tests, Conover-Holm post-hoc, and Bron-Kerbosch cliques identifies that representation structure dominates OOD detection efficacy. Probabilistic CSFs (e.g., MSR, GEN) excel in misclassification detection for both CNNs and ViTs, while geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) dominate under stronger shifts for CNNs. For ViTs, GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. Monte-Carlo Dropout shows a class-count-dependent trade-off, and PCA projection improves several detectors. Neural collapse analysis explains why prototype and boundary-based scores become optimal under strong shifts.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of out-of-distribution detection methods, systematically varying backbone architectures (CNNs vs. Vision Transformers), training paradigms, and confidence scoring functions. The research introduces a novel representation-centric experimental design that leverages neural collapse analysis and semantic shift stratification using CLIP embeddings. By evaluating multiple metrics including AURC and AUGRC across CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets with varying semantic shift strengths, the study identifies that representation structure is the dominant factor affecting OOD detection performance.

The findings reveal distinct performance patterns across different detector families, with probabilistic confidence scoring functions excelling in misclassification detection while geometry-aware scores dominate under stronger semantic shifts for CNNs. For Vision Transformers, certain detectors like GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error show consistent performance. The study also demonstrates that Monte-Carlo Dropout exhibits class-count-dependent behavior and that PCA projection can improve detector performance. Neural collapse analysis provides mechanistic explanations for why prototype and boundary-based scores become optimal under strong semantic shifts.

## Method Summary
The study employs a representation-centric experimental design that systematically varies backbone architectures (CNNs vs. Vision Transformers), training paradigms (standard vs. robust training), and confidence scoring functions (CSFs). Neural collapse analysis is integrated to understand geometric properties of learned representations. Semantic shifts are stratified into near, mid, and far categories using CLIP embeddings. The evaluation framework uses AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics and employs statistical analysis including Friedman tests, Conover-Holm post-hoc tests, and Bron-Kerbosch cliques to identify performance patterns. The study spans multiple datasets including CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

## Key Results
- Representation structure (backbone architecture) is identified as the dominant factor affecting OOD detection efficacy, with CNNs and ViTs showing distinct performance patterns across different confidence scoring functions.
- Probabilistic confidence scoring functions (MSR, GEN) excel in misclassification detection for both CNNs and ViTs, while geometry-aware scores (NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) dominate under stronger semantic shifts for CNNs.
- For Vision Transformers, GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error show consistently competitive performance across various semantic shift strengths.
- Monte-Carlo Dropout exhibits a class-count-dependent trade-off in performance, with PCA projection improving the performance of several detectors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's mechanism for evaluating OOD detection efficacy centers on the interaction between representation structure and confidence scoring functions. By systematically varying backbone architectures and training paradigms, the research demonstrates that the geometric properties of learned representations fundamentally determine which OOD detection methods perform best. Neural collapse analysis provides the theoretical framework explaining why certain geometric scores (prototype and boundary-based) become optimal under strong semantic shifts, as these methods exploit the specific geometric organization of features that emerges during training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Neural Collapse Theory**: Explains how feature representations in neural networks tend to collapse toward class-means during training, creating predictable geometric patterns that OOD detectors can exploit.
- **Semantic Shift Stratification**: Uses CLIP embeddings to categorize OOD samples into near, mid, and far shifts, providing a systematic way to evaluate detector performance across varying difficulty levels.
- **Confidence Scoring Functions (CSFs)**: Different mathematical approaches to quantifying uncertainty in model predictions, including probabilistic methods (MSR, GEN) and geometric methods (NNGuide, fDBD, CTM).
- **AURC/AUGRC Metrics**: Area Under the Risk-Coverage curve and Area Under the Gain-Risk curve, which evaluate the trade-off between detection performance and coverage of in-distribution samples.
- **Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm**: A graph-theoretic method used to identify cliques in performance rankings, helping to cluster confidence scoring functions with similar detection efficacy.
- **Statistical Post-Hoc Analysis**: Conover-Holm test and Friedman tests are used to determine statistically significant differences in performance across different experimental conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Backbone Architecture (CNN/ViT) -> Feature Representation -> Confidence Scoring Function -> OOD Detection Output

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is from backbone architecture to confidence scoring function performance, as the representation structure fundamentally determines which CSFs will be effective. This explains why the study focuses heavily on varying architectures and analyzing their geometric properties.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances comprehensive coverage of detection methods against experimental tractability by using a stratified semantic shift approach and statistical analysis to identify dominant patterns rather than exhaustively comparing all possible method combinations.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor OOD detection performance occurs when there is a mismatch between the geometric properties of the representation and the assumptions underlying the confidence scoring function. For example, prototype-based methods fail when representations don't exhibit strong neural collapse.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate baseline performance of all CSFs on standard CIFAR-10 with near shifts. 2) Compare CNN vs. ViT performance on the same task to establish representation structure effects. 3) Test PCA projection enhancement across all CSFs to validate the improvement hypothesis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The analysis assumes ImageNet pretraining as a standard baseline, but does not explore how training from scratch or different pretraining datasets might affect OOD detection performance.
- The representation-centric design stratifies shifts using CLIP embeddings, which may not perfectly align with task-specific semantic boundaries.
- Neural collapse analysis focuses on global behavior but may miss class-specific collapse patterns that could influence detector performance.

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Core finding that representation structure (backbone architecture) is the dominant factor for OOD detection efficacy, supported by consistent patterns across multiple metrics and statistical analyses.

**Medium confidence**: Relative performance rankings of specific confidence scoring functions due to potential interactions between CSF design, backbone architecture, and semantic shift strength that may not be fully captured in the current experimental design.

**Medium confidence**: Neural collapse explanations for geometric score behavior, as the analysis establishes correlation but may not fully account for all factors influencing score performance.

## Next Checks
1. Test the robustness of CSF rankings when training from scratch without ImageNet pretraining to isolate architecture effects from pretraining-induced representation properties.
2. Validate the semantic shift stratification by comparing CLIP-based thresholds with task-specific human annotations or domain expert labels for the evaluated datasets.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of classes in the CIFAR-100 experiments to further characterize the class-count-dependent behavior of Monte-Carlo Dropout and other probabilistic methods.
