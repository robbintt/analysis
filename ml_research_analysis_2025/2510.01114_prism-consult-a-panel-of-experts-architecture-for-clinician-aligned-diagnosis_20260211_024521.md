# PRISM-Consult: A Panel-of-Experts Architecture for Clinician-Aligned Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01114
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01114
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Router-based specialist dispatch achieves 69% compute savings with 0.965 life-threatening recall

## Executive Summary
PRISM-Consult is a routed panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into domain-specific specialists (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). The system tokenizes ED episodes as structured clinical events, uses a lightweight router to read initial tokens, and dispatches to relevant specialists. This approach achieves high routing quality and significant compute savings versus consulting all specialists, while maintaining safety through deterministic threshold-based arbitration.

## Method Summary
The architecture uses a logistic regression router with Platt scaling to process the first K tokens of structured clinical events and dispatch to specialist models. Each specialist inherits the base PRISM transformer backbone with LoRA adapters for domain-specific fine-tuning. The router employs asymmetric thresholds to enforce a safety-first policy, consulting life-threatening domains (Cardiac/Pulmonary) when confidence exceeds thresholds, otherwise consulting top-2 domains, and failing open to all specialists when confidence is universally low.

## Key Results
- Specialists converge with development perplexities near ~2.0 across domains
- Router achieves 69% compute reduction (1.565 expected consulted experts per episode)
- Life-threatening condition recall reaches 0.965 under safety-first policy
- System provides interpretable, auditable consult at scale with parameter efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Early-Prefix Discriminative Routing
The initial event tokens (symptoms, vitals) contain sufficient signal to route cases to organ-system specialists. A lightweight logistic regression router ingests the first K tokens as TF-IDF features and emits calibrated probabilities over 5 domains, filtering the solution space before deep inference. Clinical presentations are assumed separable by organ system at the early triage stage. Evidence: Router achieves 1.565 expected consulted experts per episode (~69% reduction), implying successful discrimination.

### Mechanism 2: Efficient Specialist Fine-Tuning via Shared Representations
A single compact transformer backbone supports heterogeneous domains when fine-tuned with LoRA adapters. The system freezes base PRISM weights and attaches parameter-efficient adapters for each specialist, learning domain-specific likelihoods without catastrophic forgetting. Core assumption: Clinical event "grammar" is shared across domains while "semantics" are domain-local. Evidence: Specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities near ~2.0.

### Mechanism 3: Safety-First Threshold Arbitration
Deterministic dispatch policy based on asymmetric thresholds approximates safety-first clinical workflow better than raw probabilistic ranking. Router enforces: if life-threatening domain exceeds threshold, force consultation; else consult top-2; if confidence universally low, fail-open to all experts. Core assumption: False negatives on life-threatening conditions are significantly more costly than compute overhead of false positives. Evidence: Life-threatening recall reported at 0.965.

## Foundational Learning

**Mixture of Experts (MoE) vs. Routing**
- Why needed: PRISM-Consult uses external routing to select complete models, not standard MoE where experts mix inside network
- Quick check: Does system sum outputs of multiple models (ensemble), or select single pathway (routing)?

**Probability Calibration (Platt Scaling)**
- Why needed: Router uses specific thresholds (e.g., 0.70) that only work if raw logits convert to calibrated probabilities reflecting true likelihoods
- Quick check: If model outputs 0.80 confidence for Cardiac, does that mean 80% of similar cases are actually Cardiac?

**Autoregressive Event Prediction**
- Why needed: Specialist models trained to predict next token in clinical sequence, with diagnostic capability emergent from sequence completion
- Quick check: Is model trained to classify "AMI" directly, or to predict token [DIAG]_ICD9_410.xx given history of chest pain and ECG orders?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Tokenizer -> Router -> Dispatcher -> Specialists -> Arbitrator

**Critical path**: Router Calibration is most sensitive component. Under-confident router defaults to "consult-all" (safe but computationally expensive); over-confident router risks missing cross-domain pathologies.

**Design tradeoffs**: Safety vs. Compute (lowering $t_{hi}$ increases safety recall but reduces 69% compute savings); Shared Vocab vs. Specificity (shared token template saves parameters but may force generalist definitions lacking nuance for rare conditions).

**Failure signatures**: Uniform Routing (router probabilities flatten ~0.20 due to data drift, system enters permanent "fail-open" mode); Domain Confusion (chest pain routed to Musculoskeletal due to spurious correlation between "age" and "fall" tokens).

**First 3 experiments**: 1) Router AUC Validation (plot ROC curves for 5 domains to ensure better than random guessing); 2) Per-Domain Perplexity (train one specialist, verify validation loss decreases smoothly to PPL ~2.0); 3) Safety Constraint Probing (run full pipeline on known life-threatening cases, lower routing threshold until Recall ≥ 0.98, measure resulting compute cost).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does PRISM-Consult perform on confirmed multi-diagnosis episodes under multi-label routing and arbitration? The current MIMIC-IV corpus is effectively single-label, so multi-label routing regime was not strongly exercised. Evidence: "multi-label arbitration as a priority validation objective."

### Open Question 2
Does PRISM-Consult generalize to external sites with different coding practices, lab panels, and temporal drift? All experiments used single-institution MIMIC-IV data (BIDMC, 2008–2019); cross-site and temporal robustness were not assessed. Evidence: "Replicate training/evaluation on second site with distinct coding habits and temporally held-out slice."

### Open Question 3
Can asymmetric, safety-first routing thresholds consistently achieve life-threatening recall ≥0.98 without excessive compute overhead? Current test set recall (0.965) fell short of targeted ≥0.98; asymmetric thresholds were proposed but not implemented. Evidence: "Threshold selection favored near-constraint point; future reports should hard-enforce prespecified safety constraints."

### Open Question 4
How does PRISM-Consult compare to classical classifiers (XGBoost) and compact encoder models (ClinicalBERT) on same early-prefix prediction task? No alternative baselines were evaluated; relative efficiency, accuracy, and calibration remain unknown. Evidence: "PRISM-Consult should be benchmarked against classical classifiers and compact encoder models."

## Limitations

- Clinical realism of routing assumptions unverified on diverse populations; router may overfit to specific presentation patterns
- Performance contingent on quality of structured event logging; cannot "see" critical information unless encoded as specific token
- Safety-first policy thresholds are hand-tuned and may not adapt to changing patient populations or temporal drift
- "Fail-open" mechanism reverts system to full compute overhead, negating efficiency benefits

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Architectural design and implementation of routed panel-of-experts framework are technically sound. LoRA adapters, Platt scaling calibration, and deterministic dispatch logic are well-established techniques. 69% compute savings are plausible given documented routing quality.

**Medium Confidence**: Convergence claims (perplexities near ~2.0) supported by training dynamics, but clinical significance of numerical metrics not fully established. Low perplexity on structured events doesn't necessarily translate to clinically accurate diagnostic suggestions.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about safety and clinical utility are most uncertain. 0.965 recall for life-threatening conditions measured on retrospective data with known outcomes; no evidence for prospective, real-time clinical performance where decisions have immediate consequences.

## Next Checks

1. **External Temporal Validation**: Deploy on independent ED cohort from different hospital system collected ≥12 months after training data. Measure routing patterns over time to test assumption that first five tokens contain persistent discriminative signal across clinical environments and temporal disease patterns.

2. **Asymmetric Threshold Stress Test**: Systematically vary routing thresholds ($t_{hi}, t_{lo}$) in both directions and measure trade-off between safety (life-threatening recall) and efficiency (average specialists consulted). Identify whether current threshold settings are robust or if small changes cause dramatic performance swings indicating overfitting.

3. **Multi-Label Case Analysis**: Construct test set of known multi-morbidity cases (e.g., cardiac + pulmonary conditions) and evaluate whether router correctly identifies need to consult multiple specialists. Measure precision of router's confidence scores when multiple domains are truly relevant versus single-domain cases.
