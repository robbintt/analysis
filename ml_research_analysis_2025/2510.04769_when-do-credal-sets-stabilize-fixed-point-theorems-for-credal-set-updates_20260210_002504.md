# When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fixed-point theorems for Hausdorff-continuous and contracting update functions on credal sets

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fixed-point theorems for iterative credal set updates, extending classical results to the imprecise probabilistic setting. The authors prove that continuous updating functions on compact metric spaces admit compact, non-empty fixed points, and under contraction conditions, orbits converge to unique fixed points. The work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding stability in credal set-based machine learning, with applications to Bayesian deep learning, continual learning, and multi-agent systems where uncertainty representations evolve iteratively.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze update rules f: C → C acting on credal sets C (closed, convex sets of probability measures). They establish conditions for fixed-point existence using Hausdorff continuity and Schauder-Tychonoff fixed-point theorems, prove uniqueness and convergence under Boyd-Wong contraction conditions, and provide envelope bounds for compositions of monotone updaters. The main theoretical results are demonstrated using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example, with an empirical illustration showing parameter convergence in finitely generated credal sets under repeated Bayesian updates.

## Key Results
- Hausdorff-continuous update functions on compact credal hyperspaces admit fixed points (Theorem 1)
- Under Boyd-Wong contraction conditions, orbits converge to unique fixed points at rates governed by ψ (Theorem 3)
- Inner and outer envelope orbits bound limiting behavior for compositions of monotone updaters (Proposition 5)
- Empirical validation shows convergence of extreme-point parameters to zero under repeated CBDL updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hausdorff-continuous update functions on compact credal hyperspaces admit fixed points.
- Mechanism: The proof embeds credal sets into sequence space via support functions, applies the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed-point theorem on the compact convex image, and pulls back to the original space. Continuity in the Hausdorff metric ensures the update map's graph is closed in the hyperspace of nonempty compact convex subsets.
- Core assumption: The parameter space X is a compact metric space, and the update function f : C → C is Hausdorff-continuous.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The authors prove that continuous updating functions on compact metric spaces admit compact, non-empty fixed points, extending Kakutani's theorem to credal sets."
  - [Section 3.1, Theorem 1] "If f is continuous in the Hausdorff topology, then the set of fixed points of f is compact and nonempty."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for fixed-point existence on credal sets; neighbor papers focus on credal prediction and uncertainty quantification, not fixed-point theory.
- Break condition: Hausdorff discontinuity of the update rule (e.g., Example 1 with a threshold at λ₂ = 1 − δ) can yield an empty fixed-point set even on compact spaces.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Under a Boyd–Wong–type contraction condition, orbits converge to a unique fixed point at a rate governed by ψ.
- Mechanism: The contraction inequality d_H(f(P), f(Q)) ≤ ψ(d_H(P, Q)) with ψ(t) < t and right upper-semicontinuity ensures completeness of (C, d_H) and lets the Boyd–Wong theorem yield both uniqueness and orbit convergence without requiring a uniform Lipschitz constant.
- Core assumption: X is Polish (separable completely metrizable), and f satisfies the ψ-contraction in the Hausdorff metric.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They show uniqueness and convergence of orbits under contraction conditions."
  - [Section 3.3, Theorem 3] "...then f has a unique fixed point P*, and, for each P₀ ∈ C, the orbit (Pₙ) of P₀ under f converges to P*."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak for contraction-based convergence on credal sets; related work (e.g., imprecise Markov chains) addresses similar questions via Perron–Frobenius but on countable state spaces.
- Break condition: If ψ(t) ≥ t on a non-negligible set, or upper semicontinuity fails, convergence may stall or orbits may diverge/oscillate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For compositions of order-preserving updaters indexed by evidence, inner and outer envelope orbits bound the limiting behavior.
- Mechanism: Define f(P) := CH(∪_E f_E(P)) and f(P) := ∩_E f_E(P). If each f_E is monotone and f, f satisfy the contraction conditions, then when the Hausdorff limit of compositions exists, it lies between the fixed points P* and P* of the envelopes.
- Core assumption: f_E is order-preserving for all E; f and f satisfy the contraction conditions; the Hausdorff limit lim_{n→∞} ○_i f_{E_i}(P₀) exists.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...and provide inner/outer approximations for sequences of credal sets under different update functions."
  - [Section 3.4, Proposition 5] "P* ⊆ lim_{n→∞} ○_i f_{E_i}(P₀) ⊆ P*."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support; neighbor papers do not address composition bounds or order-preserving updates.
- Break condition: Non-monotone updaters (e.g., Bayesian updating can dilate) invalidate the envelope sandwich; limit existence must still be verified per case.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hausdorff metric on closed subsets
  - Why needed here: The paper's continuity and contraction conditions are expressed in d_H; fixed-point existence hinges on compactness and completeness in this metric.
  - Quick check question: Given two closed convex subsets of a simplex, can you compute or estimate their Hausdorff distance via extreme-point pairwise distances?

- Concept: Weak* topology on probability measures
  - Why needed here: Credal sets are subsets of Δ_X endowed with the weak* topology; metrizability (e.g., via Prokhorov metric) is required to define d_H and ensure compactness properties.
  - Quick check question: Does weak* convergence of probability measures imply convergence of expectations for all bounded continuous functions?

- Concept: Boyd–Wong contractions vs Banach contractions
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ψ-contractions with ψ(t) < t, which generalize uniform Lipschitz contractions and allow distance-dependent contraction rates.
  - Quick check question: If ψ(t) = t/2, what is the contraction type and the expected convergence rate of orbits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Credal set representation (finitely generated or polyhedral) -> Update rule f: C → C (CBDL elementwise Bayes or optimization-based) -> Hausdorff-continuity diagnostics -> Contraction verification -> Envelope bounds for compositions

- Critical path:
  1. Verify X is compact (or compactify); choose a metric metrizing weak* on Δ_X
  2. Ensure f outputs credal sets (nonempty weak*-closed convex) and is Hausdorff-continuous (structural or heuristic check)
  3. If unique convergence is required, verify ψ-contraction (or uniform L < 1) conditions
  4. For variable-evidence sequences, confirm monotonicity of f_E and existence of Hausdorff limits

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Countably vs finitely additive probabilities: Countably additive case ensures metrizability; finitely additive requires X finite for completeness (Theorem 12 vs Theorem 3)
  - Uniform vs non-uniform contraction: Uniform L < 1 simplifies proofs but may be harder to satisfy; ψ-contractions allow weaker, distance-dependent contraction at the cost of sublinear rates
  - Fixed vs variable evidence: CBDL with fixed E simplifies analysis; Pessimistic CBDL (infimum over E) requires strong regularity (IV') for continuity

- Failure signatures:
  - Empty fixed-point set: Hausdorff discontinuity at thresholds (Example 1)
  - Non-unique or non-convergent orbits: ψ(t) ≥ t regions or lack of upper semicontinuity
  - Envelope bound failure: Non-monotone f_E (e.g., dilation under Bayes); non-existent Hausdorff limits under arbitrary compositions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the Gaussian finitely generated credal set simulation (Appendix C): Track extreme-point parameter convergence under repeated Bayes updates to validate orbit convergence
  2. Hausdorff-continuity diagnostic: Perturb extreme-point parameters of a polyhedral credal set and measure approximate d_H(f(P), f(P + δP)) to empirically assess continuity
  3. Contraction estimation: For a CBDL setup with bounded likelihoods α_k ≤ ℓ_k(E|θ) ≤ β_k, estimate τ = max_k tanh((1/4) log(β_k/α_k)) and compare predicted vs observed convergence rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can standard Bayesian posterior consistency and concentration results be formally derived as special cases of the fixed-point theorems for credal sets?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "it remains to be explicitly shown that (Bayesian) posterior consistency / concentration can be framed as special cases of our results."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper establishes conditions for general fixed points, it has not yet proven that the specific limiting behavior of Bayesian posteriors (concentrating to a Dirac at the true parameter) fits these specific fixed-point dynamics under the presented topological constraints.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal proof showing that under correct model specification, the iterative application of the Bayes' rule within the credal set framework results in a fixed point corresponding to the true parameter distribution.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific structural conditions must be imposed on threshold-based update rules (e.g., model trimming or ensemble selection) to guarantee the existence and attainability of fixed points?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note they "plan to study the structure needed to place on these kinds of threshold-based update rules... to have fixed points, and to be able to reach them."
- **Why unresolved:** Thresholding introduces discontinuities (as highlighted in Example 1), which generally violates the Hausdorff continuity requirement of Theorem 1.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Identification of conditions (e.g., specific monotonicity or regularity constraints) under which threshold-based mechanisms satisfy the necessary continuity or contraction properties defined in the main theorems.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can fixed-point theorems be derived for lower probabilities within the context of Integral Imprecise Probability Metrics (IIPM)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors plan to "inspect how our theorems can be put to use to study the existence of fixed point theorems for lower probabilities in the context of IIPM."
- **Why unresolved:** The current work focuses on credal sets (convex sets of probabilities), whereas lower probabilities represent uncertainty differently; the topological properties required for fixed points in the IIPM space are unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the Hausdorff continuity and contraction results to the space of lower probabilities, accompanied by an existence proof analogous to Theorem 1.

## Limitations

- The paper's fixed-point theorems rely on strong compactness and continuity assumptions that may not hold in practical machine learning settings
- Hausdorff-continuity is difficult to verify for complex update rules, particularly when optimization-based inference is involved
- The contraction conditions, while general, may be too restrictive for some learning scenarios
- The empirical validation is limited to a single synthetic example with conjugate Gaussian updates

## Confidence

- Fixed-point existence under Hausdorff-continuity: **High** (Theorem 1 proof is rigorous, supported by abstract and section claims)
- Uniqueness and convergence under ψ-contraction: **Medium** (Theorem 3 proof is sound, but corpus evidence for practical applicability is weak)
- Envelope bounds for compositions: **Low** (Proposition 5 relies on monotonicity conditions that are easily violated in practice)

## Next Checks

1. **Hausdorff-continuity verification**: Apply the empirical diagnostic from the onboarding section to measure d_H(f(P), f(P+δP)) for perturbed credal sets under various update rules (e.g., variational inference, MCMC-based updates)

2. **Contraction estimation across architectures**: Systematically estimate ψ-contraction constants across different neural network architectures and data regimes in credal Bayesian deep learning to identify when theoretical convergence rates are achievable

3. **Non-conjugate update stability**: Extend the fixed-point analysis to non-conjugate settings (e.g., using MCMC or variational approximations) to test whether convergence still occurs under approximate inference methods
