# Dataset Creation for Visual Entailment using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11605
- Reference count: 8
- Models trained on synthetic data achieve F-scores of 0.686 on SNLI-VE and 0.384 on SICK-VTE

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of creating large, high-quality datasets for visual entailment tasks, which are typically labor-intensive to produce manually. The authors propose generating synthetic data by using the premise text from the SNLI textual entailment dataset as prompts for the Stable Diffusion image generator, replacing each textual premise with a corresponding image. They evaluate the quality of the generated images both intrinsically (via CLIP-based similarity metrics) and extrinsically (by training visual entailment classifiers on the synthetic data and testing on real datasets). The results show that classifiers trained on the synthetic dataset achieve F-scores of 0.686 on SNLI-VE (compared to 0.703 for real data) and 0.384 on SICK-VTE (compared to 0.400 for real data), indicating only slight performance drops.

## Method Summary
The method generates synthetic visual entailment datasets by converting textual premises from SNLI into images using Stable Diffusion (Realistic Vision v51) at 512x512 resolution. CLIP embeddings are extracted for both generated images and hypothesis texts. A custom fusion function combines these embeddings through concatenation, sum, difference, and element-wise product operations, creating a 2560-dimensional feature vector. A two-layer MLP classifier with 250 hidden units is trained on this fused representation to classify image-hypothesis pairs as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. The synthetic dataset (Synthetic-NLI-VE) contains one image per premise text from the original SNLI-VE dataset.

## Key Results
- Classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve F1-scores of 0.686 on SNLI-VE test set versus 0.703 for models trained on real data
- Cross-dataset generalization to SICK-VTE shows minimal performance difference between synthetic and real training data (F1 ~0.39)
- Generated images achieve mean cosine similarity of 0.465 with original SNLI-VE images, indicating reasonable visual fidelity
- Models trained on synthetic data show better performance on synthetic test sets than real test sets, suggesting the synthetic distribution is "easier" to classify

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Text-to-image synthesis can serve as a viable proxy for real-world visual data in entailment tasks, provided the generated artifacts preserve semantic fidelity to the premise text. Stable Diffusion maps textual premises into pixel space, and the resulting images are consumed by a CLIP encoder that projects them into a shared embedding space. If the generative model captures the subject-action-object structure of the premise, the visual features mathematically align with the hypothesis text, allowing the classifier to learn entailment patterns without human-curated photography.

### Mechanism 2
Entailment relationships can be effectively captured through geometric vector operations in a multimodal embedding space. The architecture utilizes a fuse function that operates on CLIP features through concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication. The difference vector isolates the semantic gap (potential contradiction), while the element-wise product highlights feature overlap (entailment). An MLP learns to map these geometric signatures to class labels.

### Mechanism 3
Synthetic datasets reduce visual variability (noise), resulting in "easier" training distributions that yield higher in-domain test scores but fail to improve cross-domain generalization. Generative models produce images with standardized lighting, composition, and style, reducing the long-tail complexity found in real Flickr photos. A model trained on this cleaner distribution overfits to the generative prior but loses robustness, performing poorly on structurally different datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multimodal Feature Fusion
  - Why needed here: The core classifier relies on manually engineering interactions between image and text vectors rather than using an end-to-end attention mechanism
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why v_image - v_text might help detect a "contradiction"?

- **Concept**: Text-to-Image Prompt Fidelity
  - Why needed here: The system's success hinges on whether the Stable Diffusion model "obeys" the SNLI premise
  - Quick check question: What is the risk of using a generic prompt versus the full premise sentence?

- **Concept**: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between "looking like the original" (Cosine Similarity) and "acting like the original" (Classifier Performance)
  - Quick check question: Why is high cosine similarity (intrinsic) not a guarantee of high downstream accuracy (extrinsic)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Generator (Stable Diffusion) -> Encoder (CLIP) -> Fusion Layer (Custom function) -> Classifier (MLP)
- **Critical path**: The Fusion Layer is the bottleneck. Unlike modern VQA models using cross-attention, this architecture depends entirely on the geometric properties of the CLIP embeddings
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Resolution: Fixed at 512x512 (SD native) vs. Original ~400px, requiring resizing which may lose fine-grained detail
  - Prompting: Using raw SNLI captions vs. engineered prompts. The paper uses raw captions, potentially sacrificing visual specificity
  - Cost: Synthetic generation costs compute; original data costs human labor
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High Synthetic / Low Real Score: Indicates the generated images lack the "long-tail" diversity of real life; the model is learning the generator's biases, not the task
  - Low Recall@k: Suggests the generated image focuses on the main subject but ignores background details necessary for full entailment logic
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify Generation Fidelity: Randomly sample 50 generated images vs. their text premises. Check if the "noun-verb-object" structure is visually present
  2. Ablate Fusion Components: Retrain the MLP using only [v_1, v_2] (removing the math operations) to quantify the contribution of the difference/product vectors
  3. Cross-Domain Stress Test: Train on Synthetic-SNLI-VE and evaluate on a small slice of SICK-VTE to reproduce the generalization failure and confirm the bias hypothesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Generating multiple images per caption (rather than a one-to-one mapping) could potentially improve the utility of synthetic datasets for training visual entailment models
- The findings might be different for visual entailment models that do not rely on CLIP feature vectors
- The cross-domain generalization of models trained on synthetic data to visual entailment tasks in different domains, such as abstract scenes or diagrams, remains unexplored

## Limitations
- The approach's effectiveness is tied to the CLIP embedding space, which may not generalize to other multimodal feature representations
- Synthetic data reduces visual variability, potentially limiting model robustness to real-world image diversity
- Cross-dataset generalization remains poor regardless of training data source, suggesting architectural rather than data limitations

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Confidence in the claim that synthetic data is "promising" for data-sparse settings. The performance drop on SICK-VTE suggests limited generalization, which could indicate synthetic data introduces subtle inductive biases rather than solving the underlying task complexity.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a prompt fidelity audit by sampling 50 generated images and manually verifying whether the visual subject-action-object structure matches the SNLI premise text
2. Perform a fusion ablation study by retraining the MLP using only concatenated embeddings to quantify the contribution of geometric operations
3. Create a small synthetic subset of SICK-VTE and evaluate whether models trained on SNLI-VE synthetic data transfer better to this in-domain synthetic distribution versus the real SICK-VTE test set
