# Bridge the Domains: Large Language Models Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18383
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM4CDSR achieves up to 35.29% improvement in Hit Rate@10 and 13.02% in NDCG@10 on Book-Movie dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM4CDSR, a large language model-enhanced approach for cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) that addresses two critical challenges: the overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The method leverages LLMs to generate semantic item embeddings and employs a hierarchical profiling module to capture cross-domain user preferences from a unified representation perspective. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing CDSR methods and LLM-based baselines.

## Method Summary
LLM4CDSR addresses cross-domain sequential recommendation challenges by enhancing item representations through LLM-generated embeddings and learning unified user preferences across domains. The approach uses a trainable adapter with contrastive regularization to align domain-specific information while preserving domain characteristics. A hierarchical LLM profiling module summarizes user preferences by aggregating cross-domain interactions at multiple levels. The method specifically tackles the overlap dilemma by reducing dependence on overlapping users and handles transition complexity through semantic item relationships learned from LLMs.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 35.29% improvement in Hit Rate@10 on Book-Movie dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates 13.02% improvement in NDCG@10 on the same dataset
- Shows effectiveness in alleviating overlap dilemma while maintaining inference efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs to capture semantic relationships between items across domains, creating a unified representation space that transcends domain boundaries. The trainable adapter with contrastive regularization ensures that the model learns domain-invariant features while preserving domain-specific characteristics. The hierarchical profiling module effectively aggregates user preferences across domains at multiple granularities, enabling better cross-domain preference transfer.

## Foundational Learning
- Cross-domain sequential recommendation: Required to understand the problem of leveraging information from multiple domains for better recommendations; quick check: verify understanding of domain overlap and sequential patterns
- Large language models in recommendation: Essential for grasping how LLMs can generate semantic item embeddings; quick check: confirm knowledge of LLM-based representation learning
- Contrastive learning: Important for understanding the regularization technique used to align representations; quick check: verify understanding of contrastive loss functions
- Hierarchical modeling: Needed to comprehend how user preferences are aggregated at multiple levels; quick check: confirm understanding of multi-level preference modeling
- Item embedding generation: Critical for understanding how semantic relationships are captured; quick check: verify knowledge of embedding generation techniques
- User preference profiling: Essential for grasping how cross-domain preferences are summarized; quick check: confirm understanding of preference aggregation methods

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM-generated embeddings -> Trainable adapter with contrastive regularization -> Hierarchical LLM profiling -> Cross-domain preference learning

Critical Path:
The critical path involves generating item embeddings using LLMs, passing them through the trainable adapter with contrastive regularization, then processing through the hierarchical profiling module to capture user preferences across domains. This path is essential for learning unified representations that enable effective cross-domain recommendations.

Design Tradeoffs:
The primary tradeoff involves balancing domain-specific information preservation with domain-invariant feature learning. The contrastive regularization helps maintain this balance, though it introduces additional computational overhead. The hierarchical structure adds complexity but enables more nuanced preference modeling across domains.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on datasets with high domain dissimilarity may indicate insufficient semantic alignment
- Degradation when overlap is minimal could suggest inadequate handling of the overlap dilemma
- Computational bottlenecks during inference might reveal inefficiencies in the hierarchical profiling module

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing LLM-enhanced embeddings to isolate their contribution
2. Comparison with single-domain sequential recommendation baselines
3. Stress test on datasets with varying degrees of domain overlap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to domain pairs beyond the three tested datasets remains uncertain
- Scalability to domains with vastly different item characteristics requires further validation
- Computational overhead of LLM-based components needs more extensive empirical evaluation

## Confidence
- High confidence in empirical methodology and experimental design
- Medium confidence in theoretical contributions regarding overlap dilemma solutions
- Medium confidence in claimed efficiency improvements during inference

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of the LLM-enhanced item embeddings versus the hierarchical profiling module
2. Test the approach on additional domain pairs with varying degrees of overlap to systematically evaluate the overlap dilemma solution
3. Perform runtime analysis comparing inference speeds across different hardware configurations and model sizes
