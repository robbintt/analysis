# A Multi-Resolution Benchmark Framework for Spatial Reasoning Assessment in Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12741
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Benchmark reveals systematic neural network failures in fundamental spatial reasoning tasks despite high traditional performance metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a systematic benchmark framework for evaluating neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, specifically focusing on morphological properties like connectivity and distance relationships. The framework generates synthetic datasets using VoxLogicA, a spatial model checker, to create controlled evaluation scenarios including maze connectivity problems and spatial distance computation tasks across multiple resolutions. An automated pipeline handles dataset generation, training with cross-validation, inference, and evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU metrics. Preliminary results with nnU-Net reveal significant limitations in neural network spatial reasoning, showing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework establishes a reproducible experimental protocol for identifying specific limitations in neural network spatial understanding and suggests hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods may be necessary for reliable spatial reasoning in clinical applications.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a multi-resolution approach to spatial reasoning assessment, generating synthetic datasets through VoxLogicA that encode specific spatial relationships and morphological properties. The experimental pipeline consists of automated dataset generation, cross-validated training procedures, inference generation, and evaluation using standard metrics including Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU). The methodology focuses on controlled scenarios such as maze connectivity problems where neural networks must identify connected paths through obstacles, and distance computation tasks requiring accurate spatial measurement. The framework operates across multiple spatial resolutions to assess scale-dependent reasoning capabilities, providing granular insight into where and how neural networks fail to capture fundamental spatial relationships.

## Key Results
- Neural networks systematically fail at basic geometric and topological understanding tasks despite achieving high traditional performance metrics
- nnU-Net implementations show significant limitations in maze connectivity problems, unable to reliably identify connected paths through obstacles
- Spatial distance computation tasks reveal fundamental difficulties in neural networks' ability to accurately measure and reason about spatial relationships
- Multi-resolution testing demonstrates that spatial reasoning failures persist across different scales, indicating architecture-level limitations rather than scale-specific issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its controlled synthetic environment that isolates specific spatial reasoning capabilities from confounding real-world complexities. By using VoxLogicA to generate datasets with precisely defined morphological properties, the benchmark eliminates noise and ambiguity that might mask fundamental reasoning deficits. The multi-resolution approach exposes scale-dependent failures that might be hidden in single-resolution evaluations, while the focus on connectivity and distance relationships targets core spatial reasoning primitives that should be learnable by neural networks given sufficient data and capacity.

## Foundational Learning
- VoxLogicA spatial model checking: Provides formal specification and generation of spatial properties; needed to create ground-truth spatial relationships for evaluation; quick check: verify generated datasets satisfy specified spatial constraints
- Multi-resolution analysis: Enables assessment of scale-dependent reasoning capabilities; needed because neural networks may fail at specific spatial scales; quick check: confirm consistent performance patterns across resolutions
- Morphological property definition: Establishes formal criteria for spatial relationships like connectivity; needed to create unambiguous ground truth for evaluation; quick check: validate that morphological properties correctly capture intended spatial concepts
- Dice coefficient and IoU metrics: Provide quantitative measures of segmentation and classification accuracy; needed to compare neural network outputs against ground truth; quick check: verify metric calculations on simple test cases
- Cross-validation methodology: Ensures robust performance assessment across different dataset partitions; needed to avoid overfitting and assess generalization; quick check: confirm consistent results across folds

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: VoxLogicA -> Dataset Generator -> Training Pipeline -> Inference Engine -> Evaluation Module

Critical path: The framework follows a sequential pipeline where VoxLogicA generates controlled synthetic datasets encoding specific spatial relationships, which are then used to train neural networks (specifically nnU-Net in initial experiments) through cross-validation. The trained models generate inferences on test datasets, which are evaluated using Dice coefficient and IoU metrics to quantify spatial reasoning performance.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes controlled experimental conditions over real-world applicability, sacrificing ecological validity for the ability to isolate specific spatial reasoning capabilities. This design choice enables precise identification of failure modes but may limit generalizability to clinical scenarios with natural variability and noise.

Failure signatures: Neural networks demonstrate systematic failures in identifying connected paths through maze structures and computing accurate spatial distances, even when traditional performance metrics suggest adequate learning. These failures manifest as consistent misclassifications of spatial relationships rather than random errors, indicating fundamental limitations in spatial understanding rather than insufficient training.

First experiments: 1) Run connectivity tests on simple linear mazes to establish baseline performance; 2) Evaluate distance computation on regularly spaced grid patterns; 3) Test multi-resolution performance on identical spatial configurations at different scales.

## Limitations
- Synthetic datasets may not capture the complexity and noise present in real-world medical imaging scenarios
- Focus on morphological properties like connectivity and distance may overlook other critical spatial reasoning aspects such as shape recognition or spatial transformations
- Current implementation primarily tests nnU-Net architecture, limiting conclusions about broader neural network capabilities

## Confidence

## Next Checks
1. Expand testing to include diverse neural network architectures (Transformers, Graph Neural Networks, hybrid models) to assess whether spatial reasoning limitations are architecture-specific
2. Validate benchmark results on real-world medical imaging datasets to evaluate practical applicability and robustness to natural variability
3. Conduct ablation studies varying resolution scales and morphological complexity to identify specific failure modes and their relationship to spatial reasoning deficits
