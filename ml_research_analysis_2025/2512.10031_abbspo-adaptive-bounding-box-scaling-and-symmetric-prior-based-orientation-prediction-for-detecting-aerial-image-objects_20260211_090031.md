core_contribution: ABBSPO addresses the problem of weakly supervised oriented object
  detection using horizontal bounding box annotations. The key challenge is that previous
  methods struggle when using tight horizontal bounding boxes (T-HBoxes) because their
  scales differ from coarse HBoxes (C-HBoxes), leading to inaccurate predictions.

# ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10031
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art WS-OOD performance with 3.03%-5.13% AP50 improvement over previous HBox-supervised methods

## Executive Summary
ABBSPO addresses weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) using only horizontal bounding box annotations, a challenging task where previous methods struggle particularly with tight horizontal bounding boxes (T-HBoxes). The key innovation is a dual-branch approach: an Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) module that dynamically adjusts ground truth HBox scales to match predicted rotated boxes, and a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that leverages object symmetry in aerial images for self-supervised angle learning. The method achieves significant improvements on both DIOR and DOTA datasets, with particularly strong gains on complex-shaped objects like airplanes and overpasses.

## Method Summary
ABBSPO is a FCOS-based detector with ResNet-50 + FPN backbone using two specialized branches for oriented object detection from horizontal bounding boxes. The Scale Learning Branch (SLB) incorporates an Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling module that generates multiple scaled versions of ground truth HBoxes and selects the optimal scale via IoU minimization, addressing the mismatch between T-HBox and predicted rotated box scales. The Orientation Learning Branch (OLB) uses three-view consistency (original/rotated/flipped) combined with a Symmetric Prior Angle loss that exploits object symmetry through SSIM computation on projected proposals. The approach handles both tight HBoxes (DIOR) and coarse HBoxes (DOTA) through dataset-specific scale range tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.03%-5.13% AP50 improvement over previous HBox-supervised methods on DIOR and DOTA datasets
- Demonstrates 8.18% and 5.31% 3-AP50 improvements on complex-shaped objects (airplane/expressway service area/overpass) on DIOR
- Shows 2.38% AP50 improvement on DOTA-v1.0 with strong performance on challenging categories like planes and helicopters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing two fundamental challenges in WS-OOD: scale mismatch between HBoxes and predicted rotated boxes, and orientation ambiguity without direct supervision. ABBS dynamically adjusts GT HBox scales during training to match predicted rotated box scales, eliminating the performance gap between T-HBox and C-HBox annotations. The SPA loss leverages the inherent symmetry of many aerial objects (airplanes, ships, vehicles) to provide self-supervised orientation guidance through cross-view consistency, reducing reliance on weak rotation/flip consistency losses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weakly supervised oriented object detection**: Learning to predict rotated bounding boxes without RBox annotations, using only HBox labels. Why needed: Annotation of rotated boxes is expensive, making WS-OOD crucial for practical deployment.
- **FCOS-based oriented object detection**: Extending FCOS architecture to predict orientation angles and rotated box parameters. Why needed: FCOS provides a strong foundation for dense object detection without anchor boxes.
- **Scale-space adaptation**: Dynamically adjusting ground truth box scales during training to match predicted box scales. Why needed: T-HBoxes and predicted rotated boxes have different scales, causing training instability.
- **Cross-view consistency**: Using multiple transformed views (rotation/flip) to provide self-supervision for orientation learning. Why needed: Orientation lacks direct supervision in WS-OOD setting.
- **Symmetry-based self-supervision**: Exploiting object symmetry through SSIM computation to guide angle prediction. Why needed: Many aerial objects have inherent symmetry that can be leveraged for orientation learning.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input images -> ResNet-50 + FPN backbone -> FCOS head with SLB and OLB branches -> ABBS module (SLB) + SPA loss (OLB) -> Orientation and scale predictions
- **Critical path**: Images → Backbone → SLB with ABBS → OLB with SPA → Rotated box predictions
- **Design tradeoffs**: ABBS provides scale adaptation but requires additional computation; SPA exploits symmetry but only works for symmetric objects; trade-off between complexity and performance gain
- **Failure signatures**: Collapsed predictions on T-HBox datasets (incorrect scale range in ABBS); orientation instability on asymmetric objects (SPA applied incorrectly); poor performance on small objects (insufficient SPA supervision)
- **First experiments**: 1) Train baseline FCOS with HBox supervision to establish performance floor; 2) Implement and test ABBS module with different scale ranges; 3) Add SPA loss for symmetric object categories and evaluate impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can ABBS be improved for rectangular objects (tennis courts, vehicles) where scaling is often unnecessary, showing only marginal gains? The current uniform angle-based scaling provides limited utility for objects where the minimum circumscribed rectangle already matches the optimal bounding box.
- **Open Question 2**: How can SPA loss be adapted for small objects where insufficient pixel information makes symmetry axis determination unreliable? The fixed 50×50 projection becomes noisy when object resolution is inherently limited.
- **Open Question 3**: Can optimal scale range parameters for ABBS be automatically determined rather than manually tuned based on annotation type? Current approach requires dataset-specific manual tuning without principled selection mechanism.
- **Open Question 4**: How can the method handle objects lacking inherent bilateral symmetry where SPA loss assumptions don't hold? Asymmetric objects must rely solely on weaker view-consistency losses, potentially limiting orientation accuracy.

## Limitations
- Performance gains on rectangular objects are marginal due to limited utility of scaling adjustments
- SPA loss effectiveness degrades for small objects due to insufficient pixel information for reliable symmetry detection
- Requires manual tuning of scale range parameters based on annotation type (T-HBox vs C-HBox)
- Limited to objects with inherent bilateral symmetry, with asymmetric objects relying on weaker supervision signals

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodological innovations (ABBS module and SPA loss) are clearly specified and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: AP50 improvement claims are supported by experimental results but depend on precise hyperparameter tuning
- **Medium confidence**: 3-AP50 improvements on complex-shaped objects are well-documented but require careful SPA implementation

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary learning rate, batch size, and weight decay to establish robust baseline performance before implementing ABBS/SPA modules
2. **SPA loss ablation**: Compare performance with different top-k sampling values (N_spa) and verify symmetric object category selection for consistent results
3. **Scale range validation**: Test ABBS performance across different scale ranges ([1.0, 1.5] vs [0.9, 1.1]) to confirm dataset-specific optimization and identify automatic selection approaches
