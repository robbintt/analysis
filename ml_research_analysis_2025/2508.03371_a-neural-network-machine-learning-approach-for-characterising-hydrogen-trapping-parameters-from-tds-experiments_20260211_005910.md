# A neural network machine-learning approach for characterising hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS experiments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03371
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03371
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ML framework using neural networks to extract hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS data

## Executive Summary
This work presents a machine learning framework that automates the extraction of hydrogen trapping parameters from thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) data. The approach uses two interconnected neural networks - one for classifying the number of distinct trap types, and another for predicting trap densities and binding energies. The method is trained exclusively on synthetic data generated from numerical simulations using established hydrogen transport models, then validated on three tempered martensitic steels with different compositions.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs two neural networks trained on synthetic TDS data generated from McNabb-Foster and Oriani hydrogen transport models. The first network classifies the number of distinct hydrogen trap types present in a sample, while the second predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The approach is validated against experimental TDS data from three tempered martensitic steels, showing strong agreement with conventional optimization methods. The code is publicly available for broader application.

## Key Results
- Successfully extracts hydrogen trapping parameters (binding energies and densities) from TDS data using ML
- Classification model accurately identifies number of distinct trap types
- Regression model predicts trap parameters with good agreement to conventional methods
- Framework processes data rapidly without local minima issues
- Training data can be reused across different experimental datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the distinct thermal desorption signatures of different hydrogen trap types. Each trap type has characteristic binding energy that determines its desorption temperature, creating unique patterns in TDS spectra. The classification network identifies these patterns to determine trap type count, while the regression network maps the entire desorption profile to specific trap parameters using learned relationships from synthetic data.

## Foundational Learning

**Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS)**: Hydrogen release measurement technique where samples are heated and hydrogen desorption is monitored. Why needed: Primary experimental method for characterizing hydrogen trapping. Quick check: Understanding how heating rate affects desorption peak temperatures.

**McNabb-Foster Model**: Mathematical framework describing hydrogen diffusion and trapping in metals. Why needed: Generates synthetic TDS data for training. Quick check: Familiarity with diffusion-trapping coupled differential equations.

**Oriani Equilibrium**: Theory describing distribution of hydrogen between mobile and trapped states. Why needed: Basis for hydrogen transport modeling in training data generation. Quick check: Understanding of trapping site occupancy equilibrium.

**Neural Network Classification**: ML approach for categorizing data into discrete classes. Why needed: Identifying number of distinct trap types from TDS spectra. Quick check: Understanding of softmax activation and cross-entropy loss.

**Neural Network Regression**: ML approach for predicting continuous values. Why needed: Estimating trap densities and binding energies from TDS profiles. Quick check: Understanding of loss functions for continuous output prediction.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generation -> Neural Network Training -> TDS Data Processing -> Parameter Extraction

**Critical Path**: The workflow follows sequential processing where synthetic data generation feeds network training, which then processes experimental TDS data to extract parameters. The classification network output determines the regression network architecture configuration.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The exclusive use of synthetic training data avoids experimental data collection but introduces model dependence on simulation accuracy. The two-network architecture provides specialized optimization but requires careful coordination between components.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor classification accuracy manifests as incorrect trap type identification, leading to fundamentally wrong parameter extraction. Regression failures appear as systematically biased binding energy or density predictions, particularly for overlapping trap signatures.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test classification accuracy on synthetic data with overlapping trap signatures. 2) Validate regression predictions against known analytical solutions for simple trapping scenarios. 3) Apply framework to TDS data from materials with independently verified trapping parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Training data exclusively synthetic, limiting validation to three steel samples
- No independent experimental validation across diverse material systems
- Classification model assumptions may fail for materials with overlapping trap signatures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Methodology for using neural networks to process TDS data is technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Performance on three steel samples suggests practical utility but sample size is limited
- **Low confidence**: Generalization claims to arbitrary materials systems lack supporting evidence

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on materials with known hydrogen trapping characteristics from independent experimental studies
2. Compare predictions against TDS data from multi-temperature ramp experiments
3. Validate classification model performance on synthetic data containing overlapping trap signatures
