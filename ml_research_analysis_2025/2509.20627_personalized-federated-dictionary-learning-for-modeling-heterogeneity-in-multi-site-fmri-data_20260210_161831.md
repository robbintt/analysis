# Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning for Modeling Heterogeneity in Multi-site fMRI Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.20627
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20627
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Achieves 76.4% average classification accuracy on ABIDE dataset, outperforming traditional ML (60.2%) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (GCN: 64.44%, GAT: 70.1%, BrainGNN: 73.7%)

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL) framework designed to enable collaborative multi-site fMRI analysis while preserving data privacy and addressing site-specific heterogeneity. The framework decomposes site-specific dictionaries into shared global and personalized local components, allowing effective cross-site modeling without raw data sharing. PFedDL incorporates dictionary alignment and orthogonal sparse coding to improve interpretability and training stability. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, achieving 92.3% accuracy on the USM site with a 12.8% improvement over BrainGNN.

## Method Summary
PFedDL operates through an iterative federated learning process where each site maintains a local dictionary while contributing to a global dictionary. The method decomposes each site's dictionary atoms into shared and personalized components using sparse coding. Dictionary alignment ensures consistent interpretation across sites by matching corresponding atoms. Orthogonal sparse coding constrains the representation to improve interpretability and training stability. The framework alternates between local dictionary updates and global aggregation rounds, enabling privacy-preserving collaborative learning without sharing raw neuroimaging data between sites.

## Key Results
- Achieved 76.4% average classification accuracy on ABIDE dataset
- Outperformed traditional methods (RF: 60.2%, SVM: 61.5%)
- Surpassed state-of-the-art deep learning approaches (GCN: 64.44%, GAT: 70.1%, BrainGNN: 73.7%)
- Achieved 92.3% accuracy on USM site, a 12.8% improvement over BrainGNN
- Identified consistent brain regions associated with ASD across sites

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of site-specific heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies by decomposing dictionaries into shared and personalized components. This decomposition allows the model to capture both universal patterns across sites and site-specific variations, which is crucial for neuroimaging data acquired with different scanners and protocols. The dictionary alignment component ensures that corresponding brain patterns are consistently represented across sites, while orthogonal sparse coding provides stable and interpretable representations. By learning without sharing raw data, the framework preserves privacy while enabling knowledge transfer between sites.

## Foundational Learning
**Dictionary Learning**: Technique for representing data as sparse combinations of basis elements (atoms), useful for fMRI's high-dimensional and structured data
- *Why needed*: fMRI data requires efficient representation methods that can capture spatial-temporal patterns while maintaining interpretability
- *Quick check*: Verify that learned atoms correspond to meaningful brain activation patterns

**Federated Learning**: Distributed learning paradigm where models are trained across multiple sites without sharing raw data
- *Why needed*: Privacy regulations and data protection requirements prevent raw data sharing in multi-site studies
- *Quick check*: Ensure model convergence while maintaining privacy guarantees

**Sparse Coding**: Representation of data using a small number of active basis elements
- *Why needed*: fMRI data is high-dimensional but typically has sparse activation patterns, making sparse representations efficient
- *Quick check*: Validate that sparsity levels are appropriate for neuroimaging data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Sites (local dictionaries) -> Global aggregation -> Dictionary alignment -> Orthogonal sparse coding -> Classification

**Critical Path**: Local sparse coding → Dictionary update → Global aggregation → Alignment → Final classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Synchronous communication assumes reliable connections, which may not reflect real-world federated learning scenarios
- Orthogonal constraints improve interpretability but may limit representation flexibility
- Decomposition into shared/personalized components increases model complexity but better handles heterogeneity

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor alignment between dictionaries may indicate incompatible preprocessing or acquisition differences
- High personalization scores may suggest insufficient common signal across sites
- Training instability may result from improper sparsity regularization

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate dictionary learning on single-site data before federated extension
2. Test alignment mechanism with synthetic heterogeneous data
3. Compare performance with varying levels of site heterogeneity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to ABIDE dataset, which may not represent full diversity of multi-site neuroimaging studies
- Synchronous communication assumption may not reflect real-world asynchronous federated learning scenarios
- Biological validation relies on anatomical labeling without deeper functional interpretation

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in mathematical formulation and algorithmic implementation of PFedDL
- **Medium confidence** in empirical performance claims due to single-dataset evaluation
- **Medium confidence** in privacy preservation claims without formal differential privacy bounds

## Next Checks
1. Test PFedDL on additional multi-site datasets beyond ABIDE, including different neuroimaging modalities and clinical conditions
2. Evaluate framework performance under asynchronous and unreliable communication conditions typical of real federated learning deployments
3. Conduct formal privacy analysis to quantify actual privacy guarantees, including resistance to membership inference attacks
