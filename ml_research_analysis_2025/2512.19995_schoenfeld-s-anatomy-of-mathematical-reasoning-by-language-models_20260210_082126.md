- Introduces ThinkARM framework applying Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to analyze LLM reasoning traces at scale

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ThinkARM, a scalable framework that applies Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to automatically analyze the reasoning traces of large language models (LLMs). By categorizing each sentence in reasoning traces into eight functional episodes—such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, and Verify—the method enables fine-grained, interpretable insights into how LLMs structure their problem-solving. Applied to 15 diverse models solving 100 math problems, ThinkARM reveals consistent cognitive dynamics, showing that reasoning models progress from abstract analysis to concrete execution and end with verification. The approach also uncovers that exploration serves as a branching step tied to correctness, and that efficient reasoning methods selectively suppress evaluative episodes.

## Method Summary
ThinkARM annotates reasoning traces using eight functional episodes (Read, Analyze, Plan, Implement, Explore, Verify, Monitor, Answer) derived from Schoenfeld's Episode Theory. The framework uses GPT-5 for large-scale annotation, validated against human-labeled gold sets (86.33% accuracy, κ=82.85). Analysis modules include temporal dynamics (progress-normalized frequency), episode allocation (% token budget), transition patterns (N-gram mutual information, 8×8 transition matrices), and correctness diagnostics (Lasso regression on episode features). The approach is applied to 1,500 traces from 15 models solving 100 Omni-MATH problems, revealing reproducible reasoning patterns and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models.

## Key Results
- Reasoning models exhibit a consistent three-phase "cognitive heartbeat" pattern: early decay of Read/Analyze/Plan/Explore, mid-trace peak of Implement, late increase of Verify/Monitor
- Exploration-verification feedback loops (Explore→Monitor, Explore→Analyze) positively correlate with reasoning correctness
- Efficient reasoning methods like L1/ThinkPrune selectively suppress verification steps while preserving accuracy
- Episode word clouds show distinct lexical distributions per episode (e.g., "coprime/boundary" for Analyze vs. variable names for Implement)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Episode-level abstraction reveals reasoning structure invisible at token-level or outcome-level analysis. By mapping sentences to 8 functional categories, ThinkARM creates an intermediate representation that captures reasoning intent rather than surface statistics. Word clouds show distinct lexical distributions per episode. Core assumption: Sentence-level functional labels correspond meaningfully to cognitive states; GPT-5 annotations reliably approximate human judgment.

### Mechanism 2
Reasoning models exhibit a consistent three-phase "cognitive heartbeat" pattern across traces. Temporal analysis shows: (1) Read/Analyze/Plan/Explore decay early; (2) Implement peaks mid-trace in bell-curve; (3) Verify/Monitor increase toward end. This pattern is reproducible across DeepSeek-R1, Qwen-3-32B, QwQ-32B, Phi-4-Reasoning. Core assumption: Progress normalization preserves meaningful temporal structure across varying trace lengths.

### Mechanism 3
Exploration-verification feedback loops correlate with reasoning correctness; efficient methods selectively suppress evaluation steps. Transition analysis via Mutual Information shows Explore→Monitor and Explore→Analyze transitions positively predict correctness. Efficient methods like L1/ThinkPrune reduce Verify/Analyze budget while preserving Implement. Core assumption: Lasso regression coefficients identify causally relevant features, not just correlations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Schoenfeld's Episode Theory**: Provides the 8-category taxonomy for annotating reasoning traces; foundational to the entire framework. Quick check: Can you distinguish Analyze (conceptual inference with certainty) from Explore (uncertainty, hypothesis-testing)?

- **Mutual Information for sequence patterns**: Used to identify discriminative episode N-grams that distinguish reasoning vs. non-reasoning models. Quick check: Given episode sequences from two model groups, how would you compute MI for an N-gram pattern?

- **Lasso-regularized logistic regression**: Feature selection for correctness prediction; sparsity ensures interpretable episode-level predictors. Quick check: Why use L1 (Lasso) over L2 (Ridge) regularization when you have 72 features but want interpretable coefficients?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Problem Set (100 Omni-MATH) → 15 Models → 1,500 traces (410K sentences) → Gold Annotation (7,067 sentences, human-verified) → Annotator Selection (GPT-5: 86.33% acc) → Full-Scale Annotation (sentence → episode label) → Analysis Modules (Temporal Dynamics, Episode Allocation, Transition Patterns, Correctness Diagnostics)

- **Critical path**: Gold set quality → annotator selection → annotation consistency → feature extraction → downstream analysis. If GPT-5 agreement drops below ~80%, re-evaluate annotator.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Sentence-level vs. paragraph-level: Chose sentence for scalability and uniform granularity; may miss multi-sentence reasoning units. GPT-5 annotation vs. human: Automation enables 410K scale but introduces labeling noise. Mathematical domain only: Enables clean episode mapping; generalization to other domains untested.

- **Failure signatures**: Low inter-annotator agreement on gold set (would break validity). Episode word clouds that overlap substantially (would indicate taxonomy not capturing real distinctions). Transition patterns with near-zero MI for all N-grams (would indicate no discriminative structure).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate gold set annotation: Select 9 problems, have 2 humans annotate ~7K sentences; verify κ > 0.80 before scaling. 2. Temporal dynamics sanity check: Plot episode frequency vs. progress for a single model; confirm Implement peaks mid-trace, Verify increases late. 3. Transition pattern extraction: Compute top-10 discriminative N-grams for reasoning vs. non-reasoning models; verify Explore-Monitor loops appear with MI > 0.20.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Domain specificity: The episode taxonomy was validated on mathematical problems and may not generalize to other domains like code or legal reasoning.
- Labeling reliability: The pipeline relies on GPT-5 to annotate 410K sentences, which could introduce systematic labeling errors despite strong gold set agreement.
- Temporal normalization assumption: Progress normalization across traces assumes comparable reasoning dynamics that may mask important structural differences.

## Confidence

- **High**: Episode taxonomy captures meaningful cognitive distinctions; reasoning models show consistent three-phase temporal patterns; exploration-verification feedback loops correlate with correctness.
- **Medium**: Efficient reasoning methods selectively suppress evaluation steps while preserving correctness; transition patterns distinguish reasoning from non-reasoning models.
- **Low**: Episode taxonomy generalizes to non-mathematical domains; Lasso regression coefficients identify causally relevant features.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Apply ThinkARM to 50 code reasoning traces and compare episode distributions and temporal patterns to the mathematical corpus. Check if Implement peaks mid-trace and Verify increases late in both domains.

2. **Annotation Consistency Audit**: Sample 100 sentences from 5 diverse models, have two independent human annotators label episodes, and compute Cohen's κ. If κ < 0.75, investigate systematic labeling errors in GPT-5 annotations.

3. **Efficient Method Ablation Study**: Take 10 reasoning traces from DeepSeek-R1, apply L1/ThinkPrune, and measure (a) accuracy change, (b) episode budget shifts, (c) whether Explore→Monitor loops are preserved or eliminated. Verify that correctness is maintained while verification steps are reduced.
