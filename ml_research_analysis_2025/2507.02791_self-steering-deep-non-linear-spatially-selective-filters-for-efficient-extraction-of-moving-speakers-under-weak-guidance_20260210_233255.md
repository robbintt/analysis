# Self-Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Efficient Extraction of Moving Speakers under Weak Guidance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.02791
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02791
- **Authors:** Jakob Kienegger; Alina Mannanova; Huajian Fang; Timo Gerkmann
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** A self-steering pipeline combining lightweight particle filtering with a deep SSF using temporal feedback achieves efficient real-time moving speaker extraction with strong performance gains over resource-intensive tracking methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of real-time speech enhancement for moving speakers in resource-constrained environments. While deep non-linear spatially selective filters (SSFs) excel at extracting stationary speakers, dynamic scenarios require computationally heavy tracking algorithms for precise directional guidance, limiting real-time applicability. To overcome this, the authors propose a self-steering pipeline that combines a lightweight particle filter (PF) with an SSF using temporal feedback. By leveraging the enhanced speech signal from prior frames, the PF's tracking accuracy improves significantly, reducing the need for resource-intensive data-driven tracking. Evaluated on a synthetic dataset, the proposed method shows substantial gains in both tracking accuracy and speech enhancement performance, with superior signal-to-distortion ratios and preference in listening tests over comparable methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed method implements a self-steering pipeline where a bootstrap particle filter tracks the speaker direction using either noisy mixtures or enhanced speech from the previous frame, while a modified FT-JNF SSF (adapted to causal MIMO output) applies spatial masks conditioned on the previous frame's estimated direction. The system operates in a sequential loop: the PF estimates the current direction using the previous enhanced speech as observation, this direction is delayed by one frame to become available to the SSF, which then enhances the current frame's input. Training involves first training the SSF alone for 300 epochs, then fine-tuning the entire AR pipeline for 25 epochs with an auxiliary MAE loss. The evaluation uses synthetic two-speaker mixtures with controlled motion trajectories, comparing the self-steering approach against oracle baseline and traditional concatenated tracking methods.

## Key Results
- The AR (autoregressive) feedback loop substantially improves both tracking accuracy (MAE reduction) and speech enhancement quality (SI-SDR gain) compared to the Concatenated baseline
- The MIMO modification to the SSF preserves spatial information necessary for PF localization with only negligible parameter increase
- Subjective listening tests show clear preference for the proposed method over comparable approaches in real recorded scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If enhanced speech from a prior frame is fed back to a tracker, tracking accuracy for moving speakers improves relative to tracking based on noisy mixtures.
- **Mechanism:** Autoregressive Feedback Loop. The system creates a cycle where the spatially selective filter (SSF) cleans the audio, and this clean signal allows the lightweight Particle Filter (PF) to better estimate the direction of arrival (DoA) for the next frame. This compensates for the PF's limited ability to model complex motion without heavy computation.
- **Core assumption:** The enhanced speech signal $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ retains sufficient spatial cues (direct path propagation) to serve as a reliable observation for the PF, and the one-frame processing delay does not destabilize the extraction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "...introduce temporal feedback to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter."
  - [Section 4]: "Rather than approximating the posterior based on the broadband observations $Y_t$... the PF algorithm can utilize the spatial characteristics of the target's direct path propagation."
  - [Corpus]: Corpus evidence supports weakly guided extraction concepts (precursor paper 2505.14517) but lacks specific confirmation of this PF-SSF feedback loop outside this work.
- **Break condition:** If the initial tracking error is too large, the SSF may enhance the wrong speaker or noise, feeding "garbage" back to the PF, causing the feedback loop to diverge.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** If the SSF is modified to output a multi-channel signal (MIMO) rather than a single masked channel (MISO), it preserves the spatial information required for the feedback mechanism.
- **Mechanism:** Spatial Fidelity via MIMO Masking. Instead of collapsing the output to a single channel immediately (Eq. 2), the system applies masks to all channels (Eq. 5). This preserves the inter-microphone phase/delay information, allowing the PF to localize the speaker from the enhanced signal rather than the noisy input.
- **Core assumption:** The neural network can accurately estimate the anechoic inter-microphone propagation to generate these multi-channel masks without introducing phase distortions that mislead the tracker.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4]: "...estimates of such a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) strategy have already been proven to result in an improved localization performance for stationary scenarios."
  - [Section 5.2]: "The modifications to compute a multi-channel mask... only account for a negligible increase... in model parameters."
  - [Corpus]: Related work (e.g., 2601.12345) explores adaptive steering, but does not explicitly confirm MIMO as a prerequisite for PF stability.
- **Break condition:** If the room reverberation is extremely high (beyond training distribution), the MIMO mask might fail to suppress reverberant tails effectively, potentially creating "ghost" sources that confuse the PF.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** If the SSF is conditioned on the previous frame's DoA ($\theta_{t-1}$) rather than the current one, the system can operate causally, provided the network learns to predict directional dynamics.
- **Mechanism:** Directional Lookahead/Prediction. Due to the latency of the sequential loop (calculate DoA $\to$ Enhance), the SSF receives a delayed direction. The network must effectively infer the speaker's current location based on the past trajectory implicitly stored in its hidden state.
- **Core assumption:** The speaker's movement speed and acceleration are bounded such that a single frame shift (e.g., 16ms) does not move the speaker out of the SSF's spatial "beamwidth."
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4]: "...only the DoA estimates from the previous frames $\hat{\theta}_{t-1}$ are accessible to the SSF. This necessitates a directional single-frame lookahead prediction..."
  - [Page 3]: "Due to the wide range of distances... we use the inter-frame velocity $v_t$... to obtain a physically meaningful parametrization for the motion model."
  - [Corpus]: Not explicitly discussed in corpus neighbors.
- **Break condition:** If a speaker moves with extremely high angular velocity (e.g., running very close to the array), the lag between $\theta_{t-1}$ and actual $\theta_t$ may exceed the SSF's tolerance, causing the filter to "lose" the speaker.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Particle Filters (Sequential Monte Carlo)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the tracking backbone. Unlike Kalman filters, PFs handle non-linear/non-Gaussian motion (like human walking paths) by representing the probability distribution as a set of discrete "particles" (samples).
  - **Quick check question:** If the likelihood function (acoustic power) is noisy, how does the resampling step in a PF prevent particle degeneracy (collapse to a single wrong point)?

- **Concept:** Spatially Selective Filters (SSF)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the enhancement backbone. Unlike beamformers that strictly sum channels, deep SSFs learn non-linear masks to isolate speech in the time-frequency domain based on spatial features.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a deep SSF distinguish two speakers at the same frequency if they arrive from different angles?

- **Concept:** Autoregressive (AR) Processing
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation is the feedback loop. Understanding AR models is critical to managing the stability and error accumulation of this system.
  - **Quick check question:** In a standard AR loop, how does an estimation error at $t=0$ propagate to $t=10$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Input Buffer: Receives multi-channel audio $Y_t$
  2. Particle Filter (PF): Uses $Y_t$ (for likelihood) OR $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ (if feedback engaged) + Previous Particles → Outputs Current DoA $\hat{\theta}_t$
  3. Delay Unit: Buffers the DoA so frame $t$ uses estimate from $t-1$ (or updates model to be causal)
  4. Deep SSF (MIMO): Receives $Y_t$ and $\hat{\theta}_{t-1}$ + Hidden State → Outputs Multi-channel Mask $M_t$
  5. Mask Application: $M_t \odot Y_t \to \hat{S}_t$ (Enhanced multi-channel output)
  6. Feedback Path: Taps $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ to serve as the observation for the PF in the next cycle

- **Critical path:** The synchronization between the PF's DoA output and the SSF's processing window. The PF must provide the direction before the SSF finishes processing the frame to maintain real-time operation.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MISO vs. MIMO: MISO is computationally cheaper but discards spatial info required for feedback; MIMO preserves spatiality but requires reconstructing anechoic propagation (harder training target)
  - Tracking Complexity: A simple "Random Walk" PF is robust but inaccurate; a "Constant Velocity" PF matches walking dynamics better but fails if the model mismatch is high

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Lock Loss: PF tracks an interferer. Audio switches from target to interferer abruptly
  - Muddy Output: SSF receives fluctuating DoAs; masks become overly conservative (attenuating target) or overly broad (letting noise in)
  - Silence: If the PF particles collapse (all weight on one bad location) and the SSF mutes the output because the direction is wrong, the feedback loop starves the PF of input, permanently killing the extraction

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Static Oracle Baseline: Run the SSF with ground truth DoA (no PF) to establish the upper bound of enhancement quality (SI-SDR/PESQ)
  2. Ablation on Feedback: Compare "Concatenated" (PF tracks $Y_t$) vs. "AR" (PF tracks $\hat{S}_{t-1}$) to isolate the gain from the feedback loop
  3. Motion Stress Test: Evaluate tracking error (MAE) as speaker velocity increases (e.g., stationary vs. walking vs. running) to verify the CV motion model assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The reliance on synthetic training data raises questions about generalization to real-world acoustic environments with non-stationary noise and overlapping speech
- The autoregressive feedback mechanism introduces a single-frame delay that may accumulate errors in scenarios with high speaker velocity or rapid direction changes
- The paper does not address how the system handles speaker occlusion or sudden trajectory changes that could break the tracking loop

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using enhanced speech feedback to improve tracking accuracy is well-supported by the experimental results, showing consistent improvements across multiple metrics (SI-SDR, PESQ, MAE)
- **Medium Confidence:** The MIMO masking modification's contribution to spatial fidelity is theoretically sound, but the paper lacks ablation studies isolating its specific impact from the feedback mechanism
- **Medium Confidence:** The one-frame lookahead prediction assumption appears reasonable given the bounded motion model, though extreme speaker movements could exceed the system's tolerance

## Next Checks
1. Test the system with real recorded data from dynamic speaker scenarios to validate synthetic dataset generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the MIMO masking effect from the feedback mechanism to quantify individual contributions
3. Evaluate system performance under extreme motion conditions (speaker running or rapid directional changes) to identify the velocity threshold where the one-frame lookahead fails
