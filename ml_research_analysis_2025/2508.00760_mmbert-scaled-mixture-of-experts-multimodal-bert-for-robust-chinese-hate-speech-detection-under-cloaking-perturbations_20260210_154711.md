# MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00760
- Reference count: 16
- MMBERT achieves macro F1 scores of 95.2, 92.2, and 85.8 on ToxiCloakCN, ToxiCN, and COLD respectively

## Executive Summary
Chinese hate speech detection faces unique challenges from cloaking perturbations that evade text-only models. MMBERT introduces a BERT-based multimodal framework integrating text, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. The model employs a three-stage progressive training strategy to address MoE instability, first aligning modalities to BERT's embedding space, then training modality-specific experts, and finally fine-tuning the complete model. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over BERT baselines, open-source LLMs, and closed-source LLMs, with speech modality contributing most to robustness against homophonic cloaking.

## Method Summary
MMBERT extends BERT-base-chinese with 12 MoE layers, each containing three modality-specific experts (text, speech, vision) and a router that dynamically allocates expert weights. Multimodal inputs are generated synthetically: speech via Kokoro TTS, vision via font rendering. The three-stage training strategy addresses MoE instability: Stage 1 trains aligners to map speech/vision features to BERT embedding space using MSE loss; Stage 2 trains modality experts with cross-entropy while adapting aligners; Stage 3 jointly fine-tunes all components with an auxiliary load-balancing loss. This progressive approach prevents router collapse and enables effective multimodal fusion for detecting cloaked hate speech.

## Key Results
- MMBERT achieves macro F1 scores of 95.2, 92.2, and 85.8 on ToxiCloakCN, ToxiCN, and COLD datasets respectively
- Outperforms BERT-based models, open-source LLMs, and closed-source LLMs with in-context learning
- Speech modality contributes most to robustness (F1 of 91.1 vs 86.6 for vision on ToxiCloakCN under homophonic perturbation)
- Ablation studies confirm progressive training strategy is essential, with removing stages causing instability and degraded performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Redundancy for Cloaking Robustness
Integrating speech and visual modalities with text provides complementary signals that decode cloaking perturbations designed to evade text-only detectors. Chinese cloaking techniques obscure text semantics while preserving phonological or visual properties. Speech captures phonetic patterns that survive homophones; visual modality captures glyph structure that survives deformation.

### Mechanism 2: Progressive Training Prevents MoE Instability
The three-stage training strategy prevents training instability and performance degradation that occurs when naively integrating MoE into BERT-based models. Stage 1 trains aligners via MSE to project modality features into BERT embedding space. Stage 2 trains modality-specific experts with cross-entropy while adapting aligners. Stage 3 jointly fine-tunes with auxiliary load-balancing loss.

### Mechanism 3: Context-Aware Routing Adapts to Perturbation Type
The router learns to dynamically weight modality-specific experts based on input characteristics, allocating more weight to speech for homophones and vision for code-mixing. The router is a linear layer that produces softmax-normalized weights, learning which expert provides the most useful signal for each perturbation type during training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Layers**
  - Why needed: Replaces standard feed-forward layers with modality-specialized experts and a router, enabling dynamic computation paths based on input characteristics
  - Quick check: Can you explain why MoE layers might be more robust than dense layers when inputs have heterogeneous perturbation types?

- **Concept: Cross-Modal Alignment via Projection Layers**
  - Why needed: Speech and vision encoders produce features in different dimensional spaces; aligners map them to BERT's embedding space so they can be concatenated and processed together
  - Quick check: What would happen if you skipped alignment and directly concatenated modality features to text embeddings?

- **Concept: Load-Balancing Loss for MoE**
  - Why needed: Prevents router collapse where one expert receives all inputs; auxiliary loss encourages uniform expert utilization
  - Quick check: How would you diagnose whether your router is collapsing to a single expert during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text → BERT tokenizer; Speech → Kokoro TTS → Whisper-base encoder → Speech aligner (2-layer MLP); Vision → Font rendering → CLIP-base encoder → Vision aligner (2-layer MLP) → Concatenate aligned embeddings → 12 MMBERT blocks (self-attention + MoE layer each) → Classification head on [CLS] token

- **Critical path:** Stage 1: Freeze BERT backbone; train aligners with MSE loss against BERT text embeddings (lr=1e-3). Stage 2: Unfreeze experts; train each expert with cross-entropy on hate speech task while adapting aligners (lr varies by component). Stage 3: Integrate all components; joint fine-tuning with L_total = L_CE + α·L_aux where α=1e-2 (lr=5e-4).

- **Design tradeoffs:** Synthetic multimodal data (TTS + font rendering) vs. real audio/images: Synthetic is scalable but may not capture real-world acoustic/visual variation. BERT-base backbone vs. larger encoder: Keeps parameter count manageable (~297M total, 60M trainable) but may limit capacity. Three modality-specific experts vs. more experts: Simple but may not capture within-modality variation.

- **Failure signatures:** Cultural context gaps (38% of errors): Misclassifies regionally specific expressions due to limited training diversity. Sarcasm/reclaimed terms (32% of errors): Binary labels cannot distinguish self-deprecating humor from hate. Router collapse: If one expert receives >90% of weight across layers, Stage 2 or load-balancing may have failed.

- **First 3 experiments:** Validate alignment quality: Before Stage 2, compute MSE between aligned speech/vision embeddings and BERT text embeddings on held-out samples; if >0.5, increase Stage 1 epochs or adjust MLP depth. Ablate modalities: Train with only text+speech and text+vision to confirm speech contribution. Analyze routing patterns: Visualize expert weights per layer for each perturbation type; if routing is uniform across perturbation types, router may not have learned useful specialization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can MMBERT effectively distinguish between actual hate speech and non-hate speech involving sarcasm or reclaimed slurs?
- Basis: Appendix C identifies "Sarcasm and Reclaimed Terms" as a dominant failure mode (32% of errors), citing the limitation of binary labels in capturing nuance
- Why unresolved: Binary "hate/non-hate" labels lack the context necessary to differentiate between malicious slurs and self-deprecating humor or in-group reclamation
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing a ternary labeling scheme or datasets enriched with speaker intent metadata

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the framework be improved to handle regional dialects and specific sociopolitical cultural contexts?
- Basis: Appendix C highlights "Cultural Context Gaps" as the leading cause of errors (38%), specifically misclassifying culturally nuanced expressions like "Taiwanese rednecks"
- Why unresolved: Training data appears to lack sufficient coverage of regional dialects and specific sociopolitical contexts
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on a dataset specifically annotated by native speakers from diverse Chinese-speaking regions

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the reliance on synthetically generated speech and font images limit the model's performance on naturally occurring multimodal content?
- Basis: Methodology states that visual and audio data are synthetically generated from text, rather than utilizing real-world recordings or images
- Why unresolved: Unclear if alignment learned from synthetic data transfers to real-world scenarios involving background noise, varied accents, or complex visual memes
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking MMBERT on a dataset containing naturally occurring audio and actual images

## Limitations
- Synthetic multimodal data quality may not capture real-world acoustic and visual cues used by humans to interpret cloaked content
- Router generalization to novel perturbation types not seen during training remains untested
- Cultural context coverage gaps lead to 38% of errors, particularly for regional dialects and sociopolitical expressions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Progressive training strategy effectiveness (well-supported by ablation), cross-modal redundancy mechanism (plausible given cloaking categories)
- **Medium Confidence:** Router specialization generalization (qualitatively shown but not quantitatively validated for unseen perturbations)
- **Low Confidence:** Synthetic data fidelity (assumes synthetic TTS and font rendering adequately capture multimodal cues without validation)

## Next Checks
1. Validate alignment quality: Before Stage 2, compute MSE between aligned speech/vision embeddings and BERT text embeddings on held-out samples; if >0.5, increase Stage 1 epochs or adjust MLP depth
2. Test router generalization: Evaluate MMBERT on a held-out subset containing novel cloaking patterns not present in training to measure whether routing weights still effectively allocate to appropriate modality experts
3. Compare synthetic vs real multimodal data: Train an ablation model using real speech recordings and real character images instead of synthetic TTS and font rendering to quantify the fidelity gap
