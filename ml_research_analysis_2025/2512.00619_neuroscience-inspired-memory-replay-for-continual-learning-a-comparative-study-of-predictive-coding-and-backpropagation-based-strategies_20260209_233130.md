# Neuroscience-Inspired Memory Replay for Continual Learning: A Comparative Study of Predictive Coding and Backpropagation-Based Strategies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00619
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00619
- Authors: Goutham Nalagatla; Shreyas Grandhe
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Predictive coding-based replay outperforms backpropagation-based VAE approaches in continual learning with 15.3% better task retention

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative study of two generative replay approaches for continual learning, evaluating predictive coding-based methods against standard backpropagation-based VAE approaches. The core innovation lies in leveraging biologically-inspired predictive coding principles to synthesize samples from previously learned tasks, which are then interleaved with new task data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The study demonstrates that predictive coding-based replay achieves significantly better task retention while maintaining comparable transfer efficiency, suggesting that local learning rules inspired by neuroscience can provide more stable solutions to continual learning challenges.

## Method Summary
The study compares two generative replay approaches for continual learning: a predictive coding-based method and a standard backpropagation-based VAE approach. Both methods use generative models to synthesize samples from previously seen tasks, which are interleaved with new task data during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The predictive coding approach employs local learning rules inspired by biological neural networks, while the backpropagation-based method uses standard gradient descent optimization. The methods are evaluated on Split-MNIST and Split-CIFAR datasets (10 and 100 variants) using metrics for task retention and transfer efficiency.

## Key Results
- Predictive coding-based replay achieves 15.3% better average task retention compared to backpropagation-based VAE approaches
- Both methods maintain similar transfer efficiency across experimental conditions
- Predictive coding exhibits significantly lower forgetting across all tested datasets
- The biologically-inspired local learning rules provide more stable continual learning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of predictive coding-based replay stems from its biologically-inspired local learning rules that better capture temporal dependencies and maintain stable representations across tasks. Unlike standard backpropagation, which relies on global error signals that can destabilize previously learned representations, predictive coding uses local prediction errors that propagate through hierarchical layers in a manner more aligned with cortical processing. This approach creates more robust internal models that resist catastrophic forgetting when new tasks are introduced.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks; critical because the entire study addresses this fundamental challenge in continual learning
- **Generative replay**: The strategy of synthesizing samples from past tasks to interleave with new training data; essential for understanding the core methodology being compared
- **Predictive coding**: A neuroscience-inspired framework where neural activity represents prediction errors rather than raw stimuli; necessary for grasping why this approach might outperform standard methods
- **Local learning rules**: Weight update mechanisms that depend only on local information rather than global error signals; important for understanding the biological plausibility claims
- **Task retention vs transfer efficiency**: Dual metrics measuring how well models maintain old knowledge while acquiring new skills; fundamental for evaluating continual learning performance

Quick check: Can you explain why interleaving synthetic samples from old tasks helps prevent forgetting? (Answer: It provides rehearsal of previously learned patterns, preventing the model from overwriting stable representations)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input data -> Generative model -> Synthetic sample generation -> Interleaved training -> Performance evaluation

Critical path: The generative model synthesis and interleaving mechanism is the critical path, as it directly determines whether previously learned task representations are maintained during new task acquisition.

Design tradeoffs: The study prioritizes biological plausibility and task retention over computational efficiency, as the predictive coding approach likely requires more complex implementation than standard backpropagation but delivers superior performance in preventing forgetting.

Failure signatures: If the generative model fails to accurately capture the distribution of previously learned tasks, catastrophic forgetting will occur. Poor synthetic sample quality will manifest as degraded performance on earlier tasks when training on new ones.

First experiments:
1. Run both approaches on Split-MNIST with only 2 tasks to establish baseline performance differences
2. Test the sensitivity of each method to the ratio of synthetic to real samples during interleaving
3. Evaluate performance degradation when synthetic sample quality is intentionally reduced

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific datasets tested (Split-MNIST and Split-CIFAR variants)
- Comparison focuses only on two specific generative replay approaches, potentially missing other viable solutions
- Computational efficiency differences between methods are not investigated, which could impact practical deployment
- Biological plausibility claims remain theoretical without direct neurophysiological validation

## Confidence

Major Claim Confidence:
- Predictive coding superiority in task retention: High - based on direct experimental comparison across multiple datasets
- Similar transfer efficiency between methods: Medium - requires verification across broader task domains
- Lower forgetting with predictive coding: High - statistically significant across experimental conditions
- Biological plausibility of predictive coding: Low - theoretical claim not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Test both approaches on more diverse and complex datasets (e.g., real-world image classification tasks with higher resolution and variability) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of predictive coding's specific components (e.g., local learning rules, temporal dynamics) on continual learning performance
3. Measure and compare computational efficiency (training time, memory usage, parameter counts) between predictive coding and backpropagation-based approaches across all experimental conditions
