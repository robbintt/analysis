# Large Language Model for OWL Proofs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12444
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs can generate OWL proofs but struggle with noise, incomplete premises, and complex derivations

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates seven Large Language Models on three proof-related tasks in OWL ontologies: extraction, simplification, and explanation. The authors develop an automated dataset construction framework that selects subsumptions and justifications from real ontologies, then adds noisy axioms based on semantic distances. GPT-o4-mini and Qwen3-32B achieve the best overall performance, though all models show significant performance degradation when handling complex derivations, noisy data, or incomplete premises. The study reveals that logical complexity of proofs has a greater impact on performance than the representation form used.

## Method Summary
The authors create a systematic dataset construction framework that automatically extracts subsumptions and justifications from real ontologies. They then introduce controlled noise by adding axioms based on semantic distances between concepts. Seven different LLMs are evaluated across standard and complex settings, with tasks including proof extraction, simplification, and explanation. Performance is measured under various conditions including different levels of noise and completeness of premises. The framework allows for controlled experimentation on how LLMs handle OWL proof generation under stress conditions.

## Key Results
- GPT-o4-mini and Qwen3-32B achieve the best overall performance on OWL proof tasks
- Performance drops up to 47% when noise is introduced to the proof data
- Logical complexity of proofs affects performance more significantly than representation form
- Models struggle with complex derivations and show 38% performance reduction with incomplete axioms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that LLMs can leverage their pattern recognition capabilities to identify logical relationships in OWL ontologies. The models appear to use their training on structured knowledge to recognize proof patterns, though their performance degrades when faced with noise or incomplete information. The effectiveness of LLMs in this domain likely stems from their exposure to structured reasoning patterns during pre-training, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear.

## Foundational Learning
- OWL ontologies: Why needed - foundation for semantic web and knowledge representation; Quick check - understand basic OWL constructs and reasoning
- Proof extraction in ontologies: Why needed - core capability for validating logical inferences; Quick check - grasp justification mining techniques
- Justification noise: Why needed - real-world data imperfection; Quick check - understand semantic distance metrics
- Logical complexity measurement: Why needed - key factor affecting LLM performance; Quick check - comprehend proof structure analysis
- LLM prompting strategies: Why needed - critical for task performance; Quick check - review few-shot and zero-shot prompting
- Ontology reasoning tasks: Why needed - domain-specific evaluation; Quick check - understand subsumption and entailment

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Dataset construction -> LLMs -> Evaluation metrics -> Performance analysis

Critical path: Ontology selection -> Justification extraction -> Noise injection -> LLM prompting -> Result evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Synthetic dataset creation allows controlled experimentation but may not reflect real-world complexity; multiple model testing provides comparison but doesn't capture full model landscape; automated framework enables scalability but may miss nuanced reasoning patterns.

Failure signatures: Performance drops with noise (up to 47%), incomplete premises (38% reduction), and complex derivations; logical complexity impacts performance more than representation form.

First experiments:
1. Test basic proof extraction on clean ontology data to establish baseline performance
2. Introduce controlled noise incrementally to measure performance degradation curve
3. Compare performance across different logical complexity levels with identical representation forms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do different ontology domains affect LLM performance on proof tasks?
- What specific training data patterns enable LLMs to handle OWL reasoning?
- Can performance improvements be achieved through specialized fine-tuning on ontology data?
- How do LLMs internally represent logical complexity during proof generation?

## Limitations
- Synthetic datasets with controlled noise may not capture real-world ontology complexity
- Performance drops under stress conditions may reflect dataset artifacts rather than genuine reasoning limitations
- Seven-model selection may not represent full spectrum of available architectures
- Domain-specific reasoning capabilities not fully explored across different ontology domains
- Limited analysis of how different prompting strategies affect performance across models
- No investigation into the internal mechanisms LLMs use for logical reasoning

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Basic extraction and simplification capabilities | High |
| Performance under noise and incomplete premises | Medium |
| Logical complexity vs. representation form impact | Medium |
| Generalization to real-world ontology scenarios | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Validate results on manually curated real-world ontology datasets with documented proof structures
2. Test model performance across multiple ontology domains (biomedical, financial, etc.) to assess domain-specific reasoning capabilities
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the synthetic noise generation to determine if observed performance drops are dataset artifacts or genuine reasoning limitations
4. Investigate the impact of different prompting strategies on model performance
5. Analyze model attention patterns to understand how LLMs process logical complexity
