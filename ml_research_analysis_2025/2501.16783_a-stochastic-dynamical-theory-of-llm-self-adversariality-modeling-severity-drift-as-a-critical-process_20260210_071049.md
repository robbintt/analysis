- Primary result: Presents a stochastic dynamical model for how LLMs may self-amplify latent biases through chain-of-thought reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical model for tracking how LLM reasoning chains may amplify latent biases or harmful content over time. The model uses a severity variable x(t) ∈ [0,1] governed by an SDE with drift terms capturing self-reinforcement, alignment damping, and baseline bias emergence. The Fokker-Planck equation describes how severity probability distributions evolve, revealing phase transitions between self-correcting and runaway behaviors. The framework provides theoretical foundations for formal verification of LLM stability during extended reasoning.

## Method Summary
The model represents LLM severity evolution as a continuous-time stochastic process governed by an SDE with drift µ(x) = αx(1-x) - βx² + γ and diffusion σ(x). The Fokker-Planck equation ∂P/∂t = -∂/∂x[µ(x)P] + (1/2)∂²/∂x²[σ²(x)P] describes probability distributions over severity states. Stationary solutions Pss(x) ∝ (1/σ²(x))exp(2∫₀ˣ µ(z)/σ²(z)dz) reveal phase transitions when α > β. The model derives critical thresholds, first-passage times to harmful states, and scaling laws for runaway behavior. Simulation requires Euler-Maruyama discretization with boundary enforcement at x=0 and x=1.

## Key Results
- Phase transition occurs at α = β: subcritical regimes (α < β) self-correct while supercritical regimes (α > β) exhibit runaway severity
- Stationary distributions shift from unimodal near x=0 (subcritical) to bimodal or peaked near x=1 (supercritical)
- First-passage time analysis provides metrics for expected time to reach harmful severity thresholds
- Critical scaling laws characterize how severity variance and mean evolve near phase transition points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on balancing three competing forces in the drift function: self-reinforcement (αx(1-x)) that amplifies existing severity through reasoning chains, alignment damping (βx²) that corrects harmful outputs through training signals, and baseline bias emergence (γ) that introduces persistent systematic tendencies. When self-reinforcement dominates (α > β), severity exhibits positive feedback that can drive the system toward harmful states. The diffusion term σ(x) introduces stochastic fluctuations that can either facilitate escape from safe states or provide noise that prevents runaway escalation, depending on their magnitude and the current severity level.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic Differential Equations: Needed for modeling continuous-time severity evolution; quick check: verify Euler-Maruyama implementation converges
- Fokker-Planck Equation: Describes probability density evolution; quick check: confirm numerical solution matches analytical stationary distribution
- Phase Transition Theory: Identifies critical thresholds between stable and unstable regimes; quick check: sweep α-β parameter space to observe transition
- First-Passage Time Analysis: Quantifies expected time to reach harmful thresholds; quick check: compare empirical vs theoretical mean first-passage times
- Boundary Condition Implementation: Ensures severity remains bounded in [0,1]; quick check: verify no trajectories escape valid range

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Severity Variable x(t) -> SDE Dynamics -> Fokker-Planck Evolution -> Stationary Distribution Analysis
**Critical Path**: Severity initialization → SDE time-stepping → Boundary enforcement → Distribution convergence → Phase transition detection
**Design Tradeoffs**: Continuous-time modeling vs discrete LLM generation steps; analytical tractability vs empirical accuracy; boundary conditions (reflecting vs absorbing)
**Failure Signatures**: Severity escaping [0,1] bounds; no observable phase transition despite varying parameters; stationary distributions failing to converge
**First Experiments**: 1) Implement and validate Euler-Maruyama SDE discretization with proper boundary conditions; 2) Numerically solve Fokker-Planck equation and verify stationary distribution matches analytical form; 3) Systematically vary α-β parameters to observe and characterize phase transition behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the severity variable x(t) be operationalized from actual LLM outputs in practice?
- What empirical validation strategies exist for comparing the theoretical phase transition predictions with real LLM behavior?
- How sensitive are the phase transition predictions to the specific functional forms chosen for drift and diffusion terms?

## Limitations
- No operational definition provided for measuring severity from actual LLM outputs
- Parameter estimation procedure not specified for real-world LLM data
- Boundary conditions assumed but not empirically justified
- Theoretical framework not validated against actual LLM chain-of-thought behavior
- Model assumes continuous-time dynamics while LLMs operate in discrete generation steps
- Stochastic forcing terms may oversimplify complex interactions in real LLM reasoning chains

## Confidence
- High confidence: Mathematical formulation of SDE and Fokker-Planck equation is correct
- Medium confidence: Phase transition analysis is theoretically valid given assumed model structure
- Low confidence: Claims about LLM self-adversarial behavior without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Severity Metric Validation**: Implement and validate a severity measurement method on LLM chain-of-thought outputs, establishing the empirical mapping from text to x ∈ [0,1] and testing inter-rater reliability and classifier accuracy.

2. **Parameter Estimation Pipeline**: Develop a procedure to estimate (α,β,γ,σ₀,σ₁) from empirical LLM data by fitting the SDE to observed severity trajectories, including uncertainty quantification and validation that estimated parameters predict phase transitions in held-out data.

3. **Empirical Phase Transition Detection**: Collect longitudinal severity data from LLMs performing extended reasoning tasks, analyzing whether empirical distributions show the predicted phase transitions and whether these align with the theoretical critical threshold.
