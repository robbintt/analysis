# Critical Thinking: Which Kinds of Complexity Govern Optimal Reasoning Length?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01935
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01935
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Optimal reasoning length correlates with task run length (number of reasoning steps) but not with state-space size in large language models

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates which aspects of task complexity determine the optimal length of reasoning chains in large language models. The authors introduce a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to formalize complexity through two measurable properties: run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). Through extensive experiments across diverse tasks and models including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-3, they find that optimal reasoning length strongly correlates with DFA run length but not with state-space size. They demonstrate that filtering generations to predicted optimal reasoning lengths improves accuracy by 3.7-4.7% absolute across models, with COT-RL models showing the largest gains. The results suggest that test-time compute primarily serves implicit state-tracking rather than representing complex decision structures.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize task complexity using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) with two key properties: run length (number of reasoning steps required to solve the task) and state-space size (the number of unique states in the DFA). They create a taxonomy of reasoning tasks across three domains - logic puzzles, mathematics, and commonsense reasoning - spanning the complexity space. Using 22 representative tasks, they evaluate multiple models including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, and COT-RL variants. For each task, they generate reasoning traces at varying lengths (2, 10, 20, 30, 40 steps) and evaluate accuracy. They analyze correlations between optimal reasoning length and DFA properties, then demonstrate that filtering generations to predicted optimal lengths improves accuracy across all models tested.

## Key Results
- Optimal reasoning length strongly correlates with DFA run length (r=0.55) but not with state-space size
- Filtering generations to predicted optimal reasoning lengths improves accuracy by 3.7-4.7% absolute across models
- COT-RL models show the largest gains from optimal reasoning length filtering
- Test-time compute appears to primarily serve implicit state-tracking rather than representing complex decision structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a measurable formalization of task complexity through DFAs, which capture the sequential nature of reasoning tasks. The strong correlation between run length and optimal reasoning suggests that the number of reasoning steps required is the primary determinant of how much computation is beneficial. The lack of correlation with state-space size indicates that representing complex decision structures may be less important than maintaining state through the reasoning process. COT-RL models' larger gains suggest they may be better optimized for leveraging appropriate reasoning lengths.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs)**: Mathematical models representing sequential processes with states and transitions. Needed to formalize reasoning complexity in a measurable way. Quick check: Verify DFA correctly captures all valid reasoning paths for a given task.

2. **Chain-of-Thought (COT) Reasoning**: Sequential reasoning approach where models generate intermediate steps before reaching conclusions. Needed as the reasoning paradigm being evaluated. Quick check: Ensure generated reasoning traces follow logical progression.

3. **State-space Size**: The number of unique states in a DFA, representing decision complexity. Needed as one of two complexity metrics. Quick check: Count unique states in DFA representation of task.

4. **Run Length**: The number of reasoning steps required to solve a task, representing sequential complexity. Needed as the primary complexity metric. Quick check: Verify optimal solution path length matches expected run length.

5. **Test-time Compute Scaling**: The practice of allocating more computational resources during inference for improved performance. Needed as the core phenomenon being investigated. Quick check: Compare performance across different reasoning lengths.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Task → DFA formalization → Generate reasoning traces (varying lengths) → Evaluate accuracy → Analyze correlation with DFA properties → Filter to optimal lengths

**Critical Path**: Task selection → DFA construction → Model evaluation across reasoning lengths → Correlation analysis → Optimal length prediction → Accuracy improvement validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper trades off model diversity for depth of analysis, focusing on a curated set of 22 tasks across three domains rather than a broader but shallower evaluation. This allows for rigorous DFA formalization but may limit generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor DFA construction leading to incorrect complexity measurements, insufficient reasoning length diversity in experiments, or failure to account for task-specific nuances in reasoning requirements.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify DFA correctly captures reasoning complexity for a simple logic puzzle. 2) Test correlation between run length and optimal reasoning on a subset of tasks. 3) Demonstrate accuracy improvement from optimal length filtering on a single model-task pair.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The DFA-based complexity formalization may not capture all aspects of real-world reasoning complexity
- The focus on deterministic problems with clear optimal reasoning lengths may not translate to open-ended or creative tasks
- The findings may not generalize across all model architectures or task domains beyond those tested

## Confidence
- DFA complexity framework applicability: High
- Correlation between run length and optimal reasoning: Medium
- State-space size independence finding: Medium
- Test-time compute interpretation: Low-Medium
- Cross-model generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the DFA framework and optimal reasoning predictions on non-deterministic, open-ended reasoning tasks where multiple valid solution paths exist
2. Validate the state-space independence finding across a broader range of model families beyond the tested GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-3 architectures
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of state-tracking mechanisms versus explicit decision representation in different model architectures
