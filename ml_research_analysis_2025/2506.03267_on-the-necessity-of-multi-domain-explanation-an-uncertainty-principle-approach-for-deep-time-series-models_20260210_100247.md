# On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-domain explanations are often necessary for comprehensive time series model interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an uncertainty principle-based approach to quantify when time and frequency domain attributions in time series explainability highlight different features. The key idea is that if attributions in both domains are simultaneously localized, they likely represent distinct features rather than being direct counterparts. Using a variant of the uncertainty principle from signal processing, the authors develop an algorithm to detect violations, indicating when multi-domain explanations are necessary. Experiments across diverse deep learning models (ResNet, InceptionTime, TCN, TST), XAI methods (DeepLIFT, GradientSHAP, LIME, etc.), and datasets (MIMIC, US climate, synthetic, etc.) show frequent uncertainty principle violations—ranging from 0-100% depending on model/method—demonstrating that time-only explanations often miss important features present in other domains. Notably, Saliency never violates UP due to lack of baseline, while LIME's sparsity regularization causes consistent violations. The findings underscore that multi-domain explanations are essential for comprehensive time series model interpretation.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an algorithm based on the uncertainty principle from signal processing to detect when time and frequency domain attributions represent distinct features. The approach involves computing attributions in both domains, measuring their localization (sparsity), and checking for simultaneous localization that would indicate different features being highlighted. The method uses a threshold-based detection system where violations occur when both time and frequency domain attributions are simultaneously sparse. This provides a quantitative measure of when multi-domain explanations are necessary rather than redundant.

## Key Results
- Multi-domain explanations are frequently necessary, with uncertainty principle violation rates ranging from 0-100% across different models and methods
- Saliency methods never violate the uncertainty principle due to their lack of baseline comparison
- LIME consistently violates the uncertainty principle due to its built-in sparsity regularization
- Different XAI methods show varying rates of necessity for multi-domain explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The uncertainty principle from signal processing states that a signal cannot be simultaneously localized in both time and frequency domains. The authors leverage this principle by treating model attributions as signals - if attributions are simultaneously localized in both time and frequency domains, they likely represent different underlying features rather than the same feature viewed from different perspectives. This mathematical framework provides a principled way to determine when explanations in different domains are capturing genuinely different aspects of the model's decision-making process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Mathematical principle stating that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both be highly localized. Why needed: Forms the theoretical foundation for detecting when multi-domain explanations capture different features. Quick check: Verify that high frequency resolution requires longer time windows and vice versa.
- **Signal Decomposition**: Process of breaking down signals into constituent components across different domains. Why needed: Enables comparison of attributions across time and frequency domains. Quick check: Confirm that the same signal can be represented equivalently in both domains.
- **Attribution Localization**: Measurement of how concentrated or sparse model attributions are in a given domain. Why needed: Determines whether explanations are highlighting specific features versus distributed patterns. Quick check: Calculate sparsity metrics for sample attributions.
- **Multi-domain Explainability**: Concept that model interpretations should consider multiple representational domains. Why needed: Addresses limitations of single-domain explanations in capturing complete model behavior. Quick check: Compare explanations from time-only vs multi-domain approaches on benchmark datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
XAI Method -> Attribution Computation -> Time Domain Analysis -> Frequency Domain Analysis -> Uncertainty Principle Check -> Violation Detection

**Critical Path**
1. Compute model attributions using chosen XAI method
2. Apply time domain analysis to measure localization
3. Apply frequency domain analysis to measure localization
4. Check for simultaneous localization (uncertainty principle violation)
5. Determine necessity of multi-domain explanation

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach trades computational complexity for explanatory completeness. Computing attributions in multiple domains and checking for uncertainty principle violations adds overhead but provides more comprehensive insights. The choice of window size and basis functions for frequency analysis represents a key hyperparameter that affects both computational cost and detection accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**
False negatives may occur when the uncertainty principle threshold is set too high, missing cases where multi-domain explanations would be beneficial. False positives could arise from noisy attributions that appear localized by chance. Methods without proper baseline comparisons (like Saliency) will never trigger violations regardless of actual explanatory value.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test the violation detection algorithm on synthetic signals with known time-frequency characteristics to validate the mathematical framework
2. Compare violation rates across different window sizes and basis function counts to establish sensitivity to hyperparameters
3. Analyze violation patterns across different model architectures to identify which are most likely to benefit from multi-domain explanations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings are primarily validated on time series datasets with strong periodic components, limiting generalizability to non-periodic or non-stationary data
- The theoretical link between the uncertainty principle and XAI lacks rigorous empirical proof of causation
- Reported violation rates depend heavily on hyperparameter choices (window size, basis functions) that are not exhaustively tested

## Confidence
- Generalizability to non-periodic data: Medium
- Theoretical foundation of UP-XAI link: Medium
- Ranking of XAI methods by violation rate: Medium
- Necessity of multi-domain explanations for periodic data: High

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on non-periodic and non-stationary time series datasets (e.g., financial, biomedical with irregular sampling)
2. Conduct ablation studies varying key hyperparameters (window sizes, basis function counts) to assess robustness of violation rates
3. Compare with alternative signal decomposition methods (e.g., wavelets, empirical mode decomposition) to ensure observed effects are not method-specific artifacts
