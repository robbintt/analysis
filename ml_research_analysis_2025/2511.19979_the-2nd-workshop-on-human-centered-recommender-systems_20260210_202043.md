## Executive Summary
This workshop on Human-Centered Recommender Systems (HCRS) addresses the growing need to move beyond traditional metrics like accuracy and engagement toward designing recommender systems that prioritize human values such as trust, fairness, transparency, and well-being. Centered around three thematic axes—Human Understanding, Human Involvement, and Human Impact—HCRS fosters interdisciplinary collaboration to advance systems that truly understand, involve, and benefit users. It features keynotes, panels, and papers on topics including LLM-based interactive recommenders, fairness and bias mitigation, privacy-preserving methods, and societal welfare optimization. By integrating insights from recommender systems, HCI, AI safety, and social computing, HCRS aims to shape the next decade of responsible and human-aligned recommendation research.

## Method Summary
The HCRS paradigm proposes three thematic research axes: Human Understanding (modeling intents, cognition, and affect), Human Involvement (interactive, co-adaptive systems with user feedback), and Human Impact (multi-objective optimization for fairness, privacy, diversity, and societal welfare). The method involves redefining evaluation metrics beyond clicks and ratings to include satisfaction, trust, and well-being, implementing interactive interfaces for user feedback, and balancing competing objectives through multi-objective optimization frameworks. Implementation requires operationalizing human-centered metrics, integrating interactive feedback loops into recommendation pipelines, and designing constraint-based optimization that balances traditional relevance with fairness and diversity considerations.

## Key Results
- Traditional metrics like accuracy and engagement no longer capture what truly matters to humans
- Interactive, co-adaptive systems can empower users to guide model updates and co-create content
- Multi-objective optimization can mitigate systemic harms like echo chambers and filter bubbles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shifting evaluation metrics from engagement to multidimensional human outcomes may enable recommender systems to better align with human values.
- Mechanism: By redefining the optimization target, systems learn to prioritize long-term human outcomes over short-term engagement signals. This creates feedback loops that reward content contributing to user welfare rather than exploitation of attention.
- Core assumption: Engagement metrics are poor proxies for human benefit; human-centered metrics can be operationalized and measured reliably.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "traditional metrics, e.g., accuracy, clicks, and engagement, no longer capture what truly matters to humans"
  - [section 1] "moving beyond clicks toward multidimensional measures such as satisfaction and trust"
  - [corpus] HELM paper proposes "Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for LLM-Powered Recommender Systems" addressing similar metric limitations
- Break condition: If human-centered metrics remain poorly defined or correlate strongly with engagement, the mechanism collapses into rebranded engagement optimization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Enabling interactive, co-adaptive user involvement may increase user autonomy and system alignment with individual preferences.
- Mechanism: Users provide explicit feedback, express preferences, and co-create content through conversational or multi-turn interactions. This direct signal channel reduces reliance on inferred preferences from behavioral traces, potentially improving preference alignment.
- Core assumption: Users can and will articulate preferences accurately; interactive friction does not degrade user experience unacceptably.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1] "Enabling interactive, co-adaptive, and controllable systems that empower users to guide model updates, express preferences, and co-create content"
  - [section 2] Topics include "Interactive and conversational recommendation, multi-turn and mixed-initiative interaction"
  - [corpus] "Beyond Chat" framework describes LLMs as "companions, coaches, mediators" with role-based human-centered support
- Break condition: If interaction costs outweigh perceived benefits, users disengage from feedback mechanisms, reverting systems to passive observation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-objective optimization across fairness, privacy, diversity, and satisfaction may mitigate systemic harms like filter bubbles and echo chambers.
- Mechanism: Rather than optimizing a single engagement objective, systems balance competing goals (e.g., content diversity vs. relevance, privacy vs. personalization). This prevents any single metric from dominating and creating pathological outcomes.
- Core assumption: Trade-offs between objectives can be meaningfully quantified and weighted; no single objective should always dominate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "Multi-objective optimization for social good, balancing privacy, diversity, and satisfaction"
  - [section 1] "mitigating issues such as echo chambers and filter bubbles"
  - [corpus] "Socially-Aware Recommender Systems Mitigate Opinion Clusterization" directly addresses opinion polarization from recommendation
- Break condition: If optimization collapses to a degenerate solution (e.g., diversity tokenism) or weights favor engagement implicitly, systemic harms persist.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Traditional recommender system architectures (collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid)**
  - Why needed here: HCRS extends rather than replaces existing systems; understanding baseline architectures reveals where human-centered modifications integrate.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how matrix factorization predicts user-item preferences and where fairness constraints would enter the optimization?

- Concept: **Fairness definitions in ML (individual vs. group fairness, disparate impact)**
  - Why needed here: "Fairness and bias mitigation" is a core HCRS axis; without understanding fairness formalizations, implementation remains superficial.
  - Quick check question: What is the tension between demographic parity and individual fairness in recommendation contexts?

- Concept: **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation methods**
  - Why needed here: HCRS requires "human-centered evaluation methodologies and user studies" beyond offline metrics; HCI provides the toolkit.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between usability testing and longitudinal well-being assessment for recommender evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User Modeling Layer -> Recommendation Engine -> Interaction Interface -> Evaluation Framework -> Governance Module

- Critical path:
  1. Instrument existing system to log human-centered signals (not just clicks)
  2. Define pilot human-centered metric (e.g., satisfaction survey, diversity score)
  3. Implement single constraint (fairness or diversity) in ranking
  4. Run A/B test measuring both traditional and human-centered metrics
  5. Iterate on metric operationalization before scaling constraints

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Interactivity vs. friction**: More user control increases autonomy but adds interaction cost
  - **Fairness vs. relevance**: Group fairness may reduce individual recommendation quality
  - **Privacy vs. personalization**: Data minimization limits model capacity
  - **Transparency vs. complexity**: Full explainability may overwhelm users

- Failure signatures:
  - Metric gaming: System optimizes new metric superficially (e.g., diversity as token category inclusion)
  - Feedback fatigue: Users abandon interactive features due to cognitive load
  - Fairness paradox: Formal fairness achieved but user trust decreases
  - Engagement collapse: Human-centered optimization inadvertently removes compelling content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Metric correlation analysis**: Measure correlation between engagement metrics and human-centered proxies (satisfaction surveys, trust questionnaires) on existing system to validate whether new metrics capture distinct signal
  2. **Single-constraint pilot**: Add one fairness constraint (e.g., provider exposure parity) to ranking and measure impact on both engagement and fairness metrics
  3. **Interactive feedback prototype**: Build minimal conversational preference elicitation interface for narrow domain; measure user willingness to provide explicit feedback and its impact on recommendation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can recommender systems accurately model user intents, cognition, and affect using signals that go beyond traditional clicks and ratings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper explicitly lists "Modeling users’ intents, cognition, and affect beyond clicks and ratings" as a primary topic under the "Human Understanding" thematic axis.
- **Why unresolved:** Current systems rely heavily on implicit behavioral metrics (clicks, dwell time) which serve as noisy proxies for complex internal human states like satisfaction or cognitive load.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validation of new multi-modal modeling techniques (e.g., physiological signals, qualitative feedback) that demonstrate higher correlation with user-reported states than engagement metrics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What multi-objective optimization frameworks can effectively balance competing human-centric goals, such as privacy, diversity, and satisfaction?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Under "Emerging Cross-Domain Topics," the authors solicit submissions on "Multi-objective optimization for social good, balancing privacy, diversity, and satisfaction."
- **Why unresolved:** Optimizing for accuracy often comes at the expense of fairness or privacy; finding a theoretical or empirical equilibrium that satisfies "social good" without degrading user utility remains difficult.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Algorithms that mathematically guarantee constraints on fairness/privacy while maintaining competitive recommendation utility in real-world deployments.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can user simulation be designed to ensure scalable and safe training of recommender systems without misrepresenting complex human behavior?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The "Human Involvement" section lists "User simulation for scalable and safe training and evaluation" as a specific topic of interest.
- **Why unresolved:** Simulated users often rely on historical data or simplistic rules, failing to capture the unpredictable, dynamic, and adversarial nature of real human interaction.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrations of "sim-to-real" transfer where policies trained safely in simulation perform robustly and safely when deployed to actual human users.

## Limitations

- The HCRS framework remains largely conceptual without concrete implementation specifications
- Critical uncertainties include lack of operational definitions for human-centered metrics like "trust" and "well-being"
- Absence of specific architectural patterns for integrating interactive elements with existing recommender systems

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The identified problem space (limitations of engagement metrics) is well-established in literature and practice
- **Medium confidence**: The three thematic axes (Human Understanding, Involvement, Impact) represent coherent research directions, though specific implementation approaches remain unspecified
- **Low confidence**: Claims about specific mechanisms (e.g., interactive feedback improving preference alignment) lack empirical validation within the proposal itself

## Next Checks

1. **Metric operationalization validation**: Conduct correlation analysis between traditional engagement metrics and proposed human-centered proxies (satisfaction, trust) on existing systems to verify they capture distinct signals rather than being rebranded engagement measures.

2. **Interactive feedback feasibility study**: Build minimal prototype for conversational preference elicitation and measure actual user participation rates versus stated preferences to determine if interaction costs justify benefits.

3. **Multi-objective optimization boundary test**: Implement controlled experiments testing fairness-diversity-relevance trade-offs to identify whether formal fairness improvements translate to perceived user benefit or create counterintuitive outcomes.
