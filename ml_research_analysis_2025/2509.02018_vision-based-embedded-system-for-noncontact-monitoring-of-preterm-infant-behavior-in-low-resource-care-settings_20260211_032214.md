# Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant Behavior in Low-Resource Care Settings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.02018
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02018
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** Vision-based embedded system for noncontact monitoring of preterm infant behavior in low-resource NICUs, achieving 91.8% sleep detection accuracy and 97.7% crying classification accuracy on Raspberry Pi 5

## Executive Summary
This study presents a vision-based embedded system for noncontact monitoring of preterm infant behavior in low-resource NICUs. We developed an optimized MobileNetV3 model deployed on a Raspberry Pi to detect sleep/awake states and crying episodes from video feeds. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection, 97.7% for crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment. Our framework integrates model quantization (68% size reduction), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT communication for clinical alerts.

## Method Summary
The system uses a MobileNetV3-Small backbone with 30% channel pruning on Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, trained on Roboflow datasets for sleep/awake and crying/normal classification. Training employs TensorFlow 2.10 with Adam optimizer (lr=0.001), batch size 32, and label smoothing (0.1). The pipeline uses MediaPipe for face detection followed by classification. Models are converted to TensorFlow Lite with FP16 quantization for deployment on Raspberry Pi 5, with temporal smoothing via 5-frame sliding window and event-triggered alerts via Firebase/MQTT.

## Key Results
- MobileNetV3-Small achieves 91.81% accuracy for sleep detection and 97.7% accuracy for crying classification
- FP16 quantization reduces model size by 68% and latency by 22% while maintaining accuracy
- End-to-end system processes frames in ~870ms on Raspberry Pi 5
- Lightweight CNN architectures offer optimal tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency for edge deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** FP16 quantization reduces model size by ~60% and inference latency by ~22% while preserving classification accuracy for neonatal behavior detection.
- **Mechanism:** Converting 32-bit floating-point weights to 16-bit reduces memory bandwidth requirements and storage footprint. Smaller bit-width enables faster load/store operations on resource-constrained hardware with limited cache.
- **Core assumption:** The quantized model's reduced numerical precision does not significantly degrade feature representation for sleep/awake and crying classification tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Trained models were converted to TensorFlow Lite format using FP16 quantization, reducing size by 60% and latency by 22%."
  - [abstract] "model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68% reduction in size)"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; no neighbor papers specifically quantify FP16 compression rates for edge neonatal monitoring.
- **Break condition:** If classification accuracy drops >5% post-quantization, the precision loss is too aggressive; consider mixed-precision or per-channel quantization.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Lightweight CNN architectures (MobileNetV3-Small) achieve clinically viable accuracy while maintaining real-time inference on edge hardware where larger models fail.
- **Mechanism:** Depthwise separable convolutions and squeeze-and-excitation blocks reduce FLOPs while preserving channel-wise feature recalibration. The architecture prioritizes width over depth, keeping activation maps smaller.
- **Core assumption:** Neonatal facial cues (eye closure, mouth openness) are spatially localized and do not require the multi-scale receptive fields of deeper architectures.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "MobileNet attained the lowest per-inference latency (7.57ms) and the smallest on-disk TF-Lite size (2.59 MB)"; "InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB0 impose substantially larger runtime memory footprints (≈125–161MB) and longer processing times (≈61–66ms)."
  - [table] MobileNet: 91.81% accuracy, 2.59MB size; InceptionV3: 94.15% accuracy, 23.00MB size.
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Edge AI for Real-time Fetal Assessment in Rural Guatemala" supports edge deployment for maternal/neonatal health in low-resource settings, but does not provide comparative model benchmarks.
- **Break condition:** If detection tasks require fine-grained temporal dynamics (e.g., micro-expression sequences spanning >100ms), a purely spatial CNN may underperform; temporal models (RNN/Transformer) should be evaluated.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Temporal smoothing via sliding-window averaging and event-triggered alerts reduces false positives without adding computational overhead.
- **Mechanism:** A five-frame sliding window (~200ms at 25 FPS) filters sporadic misclassifications. Alerts fire only when behavioral states persist beyond a duration threshold (e.g., crying >10 seconds), leveraging state persistence as a proxy for clinical significance.
- **Core assumption:** Clinically relevant behavioral events (sustained crying, sleep state changes) persist across multiple frames, while noise and transient misclassifications do not.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "A five-frame sliding window (200 ms at 25 FPS) smooths sporadic errors and triggers alerts only for sustained events."
  - [section] "Counters tracking behavioral duration are updated only when stable states persist across consecutive frames."
  - [corpus] "Infant Cry Detection Using Causal Temporal Representation" introduces temporal causality for cry detection but does not quantify sliding-window filtering.
- **Break condition:** If critical neonatal events have sub-200ms duration (e.g., apneic spasms), this window may suppress true positives; window size must be tuned per clinical event type.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **TensorFlow Lite quantization (FP16/INT8)**
  - **Why needed here:** Enables deployment of CNN models on memory-constrained edge devices; directly affects storage footprint, inference latency, and RAM usage.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 20MB FP32 model, estimate the expected storage size and RAM reduction after FP16 quantization.

- **Concept:** **Depthwise separable convolutions**
  - **Why needed here:** MobileNetV3 relies on this operation to reduce FLOPs; understanding it is necessary to evaluate efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs versus standard convolutions.
  - **Quick check question:** Compare the FLOP count of a standard 3×3 convolution versus a depthwise separable convolution for a 64-channel input/output tensor of size H×W.

- **Concept:** **Inference latency budgeting in real-time pipelines**
  - **Why needed here:** Face detection (10–50ms) and per-face inference (5–20ms) must fit within a 33ms budget for 30 FPS operation; pipeline stage timing determines feasibility.
  - **Quick check question:** For a pipeline with face detection (30ms), preprocessing (5ms), and inference (10ms), what is the maximum sustainable frame rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 → MediaPipe Face/Landmark Detection → Preprocessing: BGR→RGB, resize 256×256, normalize → Quantized MobileNetV3-Small (.tflite) → Temporal Filter (5-frame sliding window) → Annotation & Display → Firebase (batched 15s intervals) / MQTT/TLS alerts

- **Critical path:**
  1. Frame capture at 25 FPS, 640×480 resolution (HDR enabled)
  2. Face detection using MediaPipe; reject frames with no valid face or low confidence
  3. Crop face ROI, resize to 256×256, normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
  4. Run MobileNetV3 inference (~7.57ms per frame)
  5. Apply temporal smoothing; trigger Firebase/MQTT alerts on sustained events

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. latency:** InceptionV3 offers +2.3% accuracy over MobileNetV3 but 8.7× slower inference (66ms vs. 7.57ms)
  - **Resolution vs. throughput:** 720p input improves detection but face/pose detection latency (O(HW)) may exceed frame budget
  - **Batching vs. real-time alerts:** Firebase updates batched at 15s intervals reduce network overhead but delay routine state-change notifications

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Model init stall:** First inference takes >1s due to model loading (TF-Lite interpreter initialization)
  - **Dropped frames:** Cumulative latency (face detection + inference) >40ms causes frame queue overflow
  - **False positive spikes:** Confidence threshold misconfigured; temporal filter window too short for noisy environments
  - **Network timeout:** Firebase/MQTT messages fail silently in offline mode without local fallback

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Latency profiling:** Measure end-to-end per-frame latency with 480p vs. 720p input; log face detection, preprocessing, inference, and network update times separately to identify bottleneck
  2. **Quantization accuracy delta:** Run identical test set through FP32 and FP16 models; compute accuracy drop and per-class F1-score degradation
  3. **Temporal filter sensitivity:** Vary sliding window size (3, 5, 7 frames) and alert threshold (5s, 10s, 15s); plot false positive/negative rates against window duration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the system perform in clinical trials when validated against manual scoring by healthcare professionals in actual low-resource NICU environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.4 that immediate next steps include "clinical trials to validate the system against manual scoring by healthcare professionals."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on public datasets and simulated environments (Section 3.3), which do not capture the full complexity of live clinical settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Published results from hospital trials showing agreement metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa) between the system's alerts and human clinician observations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do real-world occlusions (e.g., blankets, sensors) and variable NICU lighting degrade the model's classification accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 identifies the need for collecting "real-world NICU data... to improve model robustness against occlusions and lighting variations."
- Why unresolved: While augmentation was used during training, the model has not been evaluated on physical data where such variables are uncontrolled and unpredictable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks derived from a diverse, real-world test dataset collected specifically under variable lighting and partial occlusion conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can knowledge distillation successfully transfer capabilities from larger architectures (e.g., InceptionV3) to the lightweight MobileNet model without increasing inference latency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose in Section 4.4 the "exploration of hybrid architectures through knowledge distillation to enhance lightweight models."
- Why unresolved: It is currently unknown if this specific transfer learning technique can resolve the "integrated performance paradox" identified in Section 4.3 without breaking the strict latency budget required for edge deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative metrics showing the distilled model's accuracy versus its inference time (ms) and memory footprint (MB) on the Raspberry Pi.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the system maintain consistent real-time frame rates when the O(HW) complexity of MediaPipe face detection is applied to high-resolution video streams without hardware acceleration?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.3 highlights that MediaPipe operations dominate processing time, making 30 FPS operation difficult without reducing resolution or adding hardware acceleration, yet specific accelerator benchmarks are absent.
- Why unresolved: The paper benchmarks CPU-only performance but does not test if dedicated neural accelerators (like Edge TPU) can overcome the pipeline bottlenecks to allow higher resolution monitoring.
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency benchmarks of the full pipeline running on edge devices equipped with neural processing units (NPUs) at 720p resolution.

## Limitations
- 30% SE block channel pruning mechanism lacks implementation details, making exact replication challenging
- Firebase integration and threading logic for 15-second batching remain unverified pending code release
- Study relies on Roboflow-curated datasets rather than raw NICU video streams, potentially limiting generalizability
- Temporal dynamics beyond single-frame classification are not explicitly modeled

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Model accuracy metrics (91.8% sleep detection, 97.7% crying classification) and latency measurements on Raspberry Pi 5
- **Medium confidence:** FP16 quantization benefits (68% size reduction, 22% latency improvement) based on single-model testing
- **Medium confidence:** Comparative benchmarking against other architectures, though EfficientNetB0's failure suggests task-specific constraints
- **Low confidence:** Clinical validation in actual NICU settings with live preterm infants

## Next Checks

1. Profile memory usage and inference latency across FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization levels on the same Raspberry Pi 5 hardware
2. Test temporal smoothing window sensitivity using ROC curves at 3, 5, and 7-frame window sizes
3. Deploy the complete system (including Firebase/MQTT) in a controlled environment with simulated NICU conditions and measure end-to-end alert latency
