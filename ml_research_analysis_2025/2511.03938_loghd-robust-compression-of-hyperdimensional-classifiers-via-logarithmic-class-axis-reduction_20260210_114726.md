core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of efficient and robust model
  compression in hyperdimensional computing (HDC), specifically targeting the high
  memory cost of storing one prototype per class. The authors propose LogHD, a novel
  method that reduces memory by compressing along the class axis rather than the feature
  axis.

# LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03938
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** LogHD achieves competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience to bit-flip noise at matched memory budgets

## Executive Summary
LogHD introduces a novel compression method for hyperdimensional computing that reduces memory usage by compressing along the class axis rather than the feature axis. The method replaces C per-class prototypes with n≈ ⌈log_k C⌉ bundle hypervectors, preserving original dimensionality D while achieving logarithmic scaling in the number of classes. This approach enables significant memory savings and improved noise resilience compared to conventional HDC methods.

## Method Summary
LogHD employs a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding to achieve efficient compression. The method uses logarithmic class-axis reduction, where n bundle hypervectors represent the original C classes through a capacity-aware codebook. Profile-based decoding allows accurate classification despite the compressed representation. The approach can be composed with feature-axis sparsification for additional compression gains.

## Key Results
- LogHD achieves competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience to bit-flip noise at matched memory budgets
- LogHD ASIC instantiation delivers 498× energy efficiency and 62.6× speedup over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU
- At equal memory, LogHD sustains target accuracy at roughly 2.5-3.0× higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LogHD works by leveraging logarithmic compression along the class axis, which reduces memory requirements while maintaining classification accuracy. The capacity-aware codebook ensures efficient use of available hypervector space, while profile-based decoding enables accurate reconstruction of class information from compressed representations. This approach provides superior noise resilience compared to feature-axis compression methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC):** A computing paradigm using high-dimensional vectors for robust computation; needed for understanding the context and motivation behind LogHD
- **Class-Axis vs Feature-Axis Compression:** Different approaches to reducing model size; quick check: compare memory usage and accuracy trade-offs
- **Bundle Hypervectors:** Groups of hypervectors representing multiple classes; quick check: verify capacity constraints and decoding accuracy
- **Capacity-Aware Codebook:** Optimizes hypervector usage based on available capacity; quick check: evaluate codebook efficiency across different class distributions
- **Profile-Based Decoding:** Reconstruction method for compressed representations; quick check: measure decoding accuracy under various noise conditions
- **Logarithmic Scaling:** Mathematical relationship between input size and output size; quick check: verify logarithmic behavior with increasing class counts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Bundle Hypervector Generation -> Capacity-Aware Codebook -> Profile-Based Decoding -> Classification Output

**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing and encoding -> Bundle hypervector generation -> Codebook lookup and profile decoding -> Final classification decision

**Design Tradeoffs:** Memory vs accuracy vs noise resilience; logarithmic compression provides significant memory savings but requires careful capacity management and decoding optimization

**Failure Signatures:** Decreased classification accuracy, increased decoding errors, capacity overflow in codebook, degraded noise resilience

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Verify logarithmic scaling behavior with increasing class counts using synthetic datasets
2. Compare accuracy and memory usage against conventional HDC and feature-axis compression methods
3. Evaluate noise resilience under various bit-flip rates and hardware implementations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependence on achieving sufficient separation between bundle hypervectors for accurate decoding
- Uncertainty about scalability to thousands of classes where bundle capacity constraints become critical
- Assumes fixed bundling capacity without adaptive strategies for varying class distributions

## Confidence
- Accuracy claims: Medium-High (competitive performance with conventional HDC across multiple datasets)
- Noise resilience claims: Medium (primarily simulation-based analysis)
- Energy efficiency claims: High (explicit ASIC design specifications provided)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LogHD on datasets with 1000+ classes to verify logarithmic scaling holds under realistic capacity constraints
2. Implement profile-based decoding on actual hardware platforms to validate noise resilience claims beyond simulation
3. Compare LogHD against emerging hyperdimensional compression methods under identical memory budgets and hardware constraints
