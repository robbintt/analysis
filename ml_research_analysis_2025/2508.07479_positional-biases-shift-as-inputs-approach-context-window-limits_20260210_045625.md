# Positional Biases Shift as Inputs Approach Context Window Limits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07479
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07479
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Positional biases in LLMs shift as inputs approach context window limits, with LiM effect strongest at Lrel ≤ 0.5

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how positional biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) change as inputs approach the context window limits. The authors define relative input length (Lrel) as the ratio of input length to context window size, systematically varying relevant information positions across seven Lrel values from 0.06 to 1.0. Using retrieval-reasoning minimal pairs, they isolate positional effects from other factors and demonstrate that the Lost in the Middle effect is strongest when Lrel ≤ 0.5.

The primary finding reveals that as inputs grow longer relative to context windows, primacy bias weakens while recency bias remains stable, creating a distance-based bias favoring information closer to the input's end. The study also establishes that successful retrieval is prerequisite for effective reasoning, with reasoning accuracy improving 25% to 373% when retrieval succeeds versus fails.

## Method Summary
The authors construct retrieval-reasoning minimal pairs where each retrieval question targets specific information needed for the corresponding reasoning question. They systematically vary the position of relevant information within distractor text across seven Lrel values (0.06 to 1.0), where Lrel represents the ratio of input length to context window size. This controlled approach enables isolation of positional biases from other confounding factors while maintaining consistent content across experimental conditions.

## Key Results
- LiM effect is strongest when Lrel ≤ 0.5, with middle-positioned information accuracy lower than first and last positions
- Beyond Lrel threshold, primacy bias weakens while recency bias remains stable, creating distance-based bias toward input end
- Successful retrieval increases reasoning accuracy by 25% to 373% compared to retrieval failures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying these positional bias shifts relates to how LLMs process information across different input lengths relative to their context windows. As inputs approach context window limits, the model's attention mechanisms and positional encoding schemes interact differently with information at various positions. The weakening of primacy bias while recency bias remains stable suggests that positional encodings may have different decay rates or attention weights depending on their distance from the input boundaries.

## Foundational Learning
- **Relative Input Length (Lrel)**: Ratio of input length to context window size; needed to quantify how input scaling affects positional biases; quick check: verify Lrel calculations across different context window sizes
- **Lost in the Middle (LiM) Effect**: Phenomenon where middle-positioned information has lower accuracy than edge positions; needed to understand baseline positional biases; quick check: confirm LiM exists in control conditions
- **Primacy vs Recency Bias**: Favoritism toward initial versus final positions; needed to explain directional shifts in accuracy patterns; quick check: measure accuracy differences between first and last positions across Lrel values
- **Retrieval-Reasoning Pipeline**: Two-stage process where information extraction precedes logical inference; needed to understand how early-stage errors propagate; quick check: verify retrieval accuracy correlates with reasoning performance

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Text -> Retrieval Module -> Reasoning Module -> Output Accuracy

Critical Path:
1. Tokenization and positional encoding
2. Information retrieval from specified position
3. Reasoning based on retrieved information
4. Accuracy measurement at output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Minimal pairs control content but may oversimplify real-world complexity
- Seven Lrel values provide systematic coverage but may miss non-linear effects
- Accuracy metric captures performance but not confidence or reasoning quality

Failure Signatures:
- High retrieval failure rates indicate positional encoding breakdown
- Disproportionate accuracy drops at middle positions indicate LiM effect
- Inconsistent reasoning accuracy despite successful retrieval suggests reasoning module limitations

First Experiments:
1. Verify LiM effect exists in baseline conditions without Lrel variation
2. Test retrieval accuracy at each position across all Lrel values
3. Measure reasoning accuracy when retrieval succeeds versus fails

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental design may not fully capture complex interactions between retrieval and reasoning processes
- Focus on seven specific Lrel values may miss non-linear effects at other ratios
- Accuracy metric alone provides limited view of positional bias nuances

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Retrieval success strongly correlates with reasoning accuracy (25% to 373% improvement)
- Systematic Lrel variation provides robust evidence for positional bias shifts

Medium confidence:
- Lrel ≤ 0.5 threshold for strongest LiM effect may vary with different architectures
- Primacy weakening and recency stability driving distance-based bias is plausible but may oversimplify

Low confidence:
- Direct inheritance of positional biases from retrieval to reasoning may not capture full complexity
- Study doesn't adequately address attention patterns and architectural features contributing to effects

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test Lrel threshold effects across multiple LLM architectures to determine if positional bias shifts are architecture-dependent

2. **Metric expansion**: Incorporate confidence calibration, reasoning quality assessments, and attention pattern analysis beyond accuracy

3. **Real-world scenario testing**: Design experiments with naturalistic retrieval-reasoning tasks to validate controlled minimal pair findings in practical applications
