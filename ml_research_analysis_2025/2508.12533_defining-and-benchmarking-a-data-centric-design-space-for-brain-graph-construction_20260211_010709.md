# Defining and Benchmarking a Data-Centric Design Space for Brain Graph Construction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12533
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematically benchmarks data-centric choices in brain graph construction, showing high-amplitude BOLD retention, robust correlation metrics, and lagged correlations consistently improve GNN performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper reframes brain graph construction from fMRI data as a data-centric design problem, organizing the process into three stages: temporal signal preprocessing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Rather than proposing new models, it systematically benchmarks combinations of existing techniques to optimize upstream data decisions. The study explores high-amplitude BOLD signal retention, alternative correlation metrics (e.g., Spearman, Kendall), globally unified graph topologies, and lagged correlations to capture dynamic interactions. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that these data-centric choices consistently improve GNN classification accuracy over standard pipelines. Notably, retaining high-amplitude signals, using robust correlation measures, and incorporating lagged dynamics yield the strongest gains. The results highlight the importance of upstream data decisions in shaping effective brain graph representations and provide a practical framework for future Auto-Data-Centric AI research in neuroimaging.

## Method Summary
The paper constructs a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, systematically exploring three key stages. First, temporal signal preprocessing applies Z-score normalization and high-amplitude BOLD signal retention (using percentile or standard deviation thresholds with binary or retention variants). Second, topology extraction computes functional connectivity matrices using Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlation metrics, optionally creating a globally unified topology from the top 5% consistent edges. Third, graph featurization incorporates lagged correlations (lags 1-10) and encodes multi-view correlations as edge features. The constructed graphs are classified using a unified GNN architecture (GCN, GAT, or SAGE) with SortPooling followed by a 2-layer MLP. Experiments on HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets systematically compare these data-centric choices against standard pipelines.

## Key Results
- High-amplitude BOLD signal retention (top 30%) consistently improves classification accuracy by reducing noise while preserving functionally relevant co-activation patterns.
- Alternative correlation metrics (Spearman, Kendall) outperform Pearson correlation by better handling outliers and non-linear dependencies in fMRI time series.
- Incorporating lagged correlations (optimal lag ~5 for HCP, ~1 for ABIDE) captures temporal dependencies and consistently improves performance across datasets.
- Globally unified topologies improve performance on datasets with homogeneous connectivity patterns but may fail on heterogeneous data.
- No single data-centric strategy dominates across all datasets, highlighting the need for flexible, modular design spaces.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retaining high-amplitude BOLD signals selectively preserves functionally relevant co-activation patterns while reducing noise, which leads to improved feature quality for downstream GNNs.
- Mechanism: BOLD signals with high amplitude are more likely to correspond to meaningful neural events. The paper introduces a thresholding function $\Theta(t, Z_r; \theta, \gamma)$ that filters out sub-threshold signal components. This reduces the contribution of low-amplitude fluctuations, which may contain a higher proportion of non-neural noise or uninformative background activity, to the subsequent correlation calculations.
- Core assumption: High-amplitude BOLD fluctuations are more representative of meaningful functional connectivity than low-amplitude fluctuations. Noise and irrelevant signal components are predominantly found in the low-amplitude range.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...retaining high-amplitude signals... yield the strongest gains."
  - [PAGE 3]: "Previous studies on resting-state fMRI data have demonstrated that high-amplitude BOLD fluctuations may play a crucial role in defining brain functional connectivity... Retaining primarily high-amplitude fluctuations has been shown to reduce data volume by up to 94%... while still preserving key functional networks."
  - [corpus]: The provided corpus signals do not directly discuss high-amplitude signal retention as a specific mechanism. The papers focus more on general graph construction, ensemble methods, and kernel GNNs.
- Break condition: If high-amplitude signal fluctuations are themselves driven by non-neural artifacts (e.g., motion spikes) that were not perfectly removed in preprocessing, this method could amplify noise rather than signal, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Alternative correlation metrics like Spearman and Kendall are more robust to outliers and non-linear dependencies in fMRI time series, producing more reliable functional connectivity matrices for graph construction.
- Mechanism: Pearson correlation assumes a linear relationship and is sensitive to outliers, which are common in fMRI data. Spearman (rank-based) and Kendall (concordance-based) correlations do not assume linearity and are less affected by extreme values. By using these metrics, the functional connectivity matrix better reflects the monotonic relationships between brain regions, leading to a graph topology that is more representative of true functional architecture.
- Core assumption: The "true" functional relationships between brain regions are not always linear and fMRI data contains outliers that distort linear correlation measures. A more robust, rank-based metric provides a more accurate estimate of this underlying connectivity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [PAGE 4]: "PCC's lack of robustness means outliers can introduce false correlations or mask existing ones... measures like Spearman's rank correlation and Kendall's tau... may offer advantages in handling non-linear dependencies..."
  - [PAGE 7]: "Across all three datasets, using alternative correlation coefficients yields consistent improvements over Pearson..."
  - [corpus]: Not explicitly covered in the provided corpus. Corpus papers like "Hyperbolic Kernel Graph Neural Networks" mention fusion of multimodal data but not the choice of correlation metric.
- Break condition: If the relationships between ROI time series are predominantly and cleanly linear with very few outliers, Pearson correlation may be statistically more powerful, and the switch to rank-based metrics could introduce unnecessary information loss, failing to improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating lagged correlations into node features allows brain graphs to capture temporal dependencies, such as causality and directionality, that are missed by standard instantaneous correlation.
- Mechanism: Neural communication involves time delays. Standard functional connectivity (Pearson correlation) is calculated at zero-lag ($\delta=0$). The paper proposes using cross-correlation at various time lags ($\delta \neq 0$). By concatenating these lagged correlation vectors to the node features $X$, the GNN is provided with a richer representation that encodes not just synchronous co-activation but also leading/lagging relationships between regions.
- Core assumption: Functionally relevant neural interactions have a temporal offset that is not captured by instantaneous correlation. These time-lagged interactions are important for the downstream classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [PAGE 5]: "...common approach of calculating only the instantaneous correlation may fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics, overlooking time-lagged interactions between brain regions."
  - [PAGE 7]: "Incorporating lagged correlations consistently improves GNN performance across datasets and settings, suggesting that temporal offsets capture dynamic neural interactions beyond what instantaneous correlation provides."
  - [corpus]: Papers like "Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution for resting-state fMRI analysis" (Gadgil et al., 2020, cited in paper) and "Ensemble-Based Graph Representation of fMRI Data" (corpus) support the importance of temporal modeling, though the corpus paper focuses on ensemble representations rather than lagged correlation specifically.
- Break condition: If the temporal resolution (TR) of the fMRI data is too low to meaningfully resolve the hemodynamic delays between regions, or if the dynamics are not stationary across the scan, the computed lagged correlations may be spurious and fail to improve generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Functional Connectivity (FC) from fMRI**
  - Why needed here: This is the fundamental quantity being engineered. The entire paper is about how to best construct a graph representing FC. You must understand that FC is a statistical dependency (typically correlation) between the BOLD time series of distinct brain regions.
  - Quick check question: Given two time series from different brain regions, how does the choice of correlation metric (Pearson vs Spearman) change the interpretation of their Functional Connectivity?

- Concept: **Brain Graph Construction Pipeline**
  - Why needed here: The paper reframes this multi-step process as a "design space." To apply the findings, you must know the standard stages: Preprocessing -> ROI Signal Extraction -> Correlation/Topology Extraction -> Featurization -> Graph.
  - Quick check question: In the standard pipeline, what is the typical source of the node features ($X$) and how are the edges ($E$) in the graph typically defined?

- Concept: **Data-Centric AI**
  - Why needed here: This is the paper's core conceptual framing. It contrasts with model-centric AI. The key insight is that improving the data representation (the graph construction) can yield larger or more consistent gains than tuning the GNN model itself.
  - Quick check question: A researcher achieves 88% accuracy with a GCN on a standard brain graph. According to this paper's data-centric philosophy, what should be their next step to try and improve performance before changing the GCN architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
    - **Temporal Signal Preprocessing:** Input: Raw BOLD time series per ROI. Operation: Z-normalization, then thresholding (percentile or std dev based). Output: Filtered time series.
    - **Topology Extraction:** Input: Preprocessed time series. Operation: Compute correlation matrix (Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall). Optionally, create a globally unified topology. Threshold to get adjacency matrix $A$. Output: Graph structure ($V, A$).
    - **Graph Featurization:** Input: Time series, Correlation matrices. Operation: Compute lagged correlations. Concatenate various correlation matrices to form node features $X$. Optionally encode multi-view correlations as edge features $E'$. Output: Final attributed graph ($G=(V,E,X,E')$).

- Critical path: The quality of the **Topology Extraction** and **Graph Featurization** stages is most critical. The experiments show that alternative correlation metrics and lagged features consistently provide gains. High-amplitude retention in **Temporal Signal Preprocessing** is the most impactful preprocessing step.

- Design tradeoffs:
    - **High-amplitude retention ($\theta$):** High threshold (e.g., top 30%) reduces noise but risks discarding meaningful low-amplitude signal components. Binary thresholding ($\gamma=1$) is more robust to outliers but loses amplitude information.
    - **Correlation Metric:** Pearson captures linear relationships but is noise-sensitive. Spearman/Kendall are more robust but may miss linear patterns.
    - **Lagged Correlations:** Adding them enriches node features but increases feature dimensionality ($X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d'n}$). For large ROIs or many lags, this can become computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.
    - **Unified vs. Subject-Specific Topology:** Unified topology promotes stable aggregation and can improve performance on subjects similar to the group average but may fail on subjects with highly idiosyncratic connectivity.

- Failure signatures:
    - **Performance degradation with high-amplitude retention:** Likely caused by an aggressive threshold or by amplifying motion artifacts that were not properly regressed out.
    - **No gain from lagged correlations:** Could indicate the fMRI TR is too coarse, the chosen lag ($\delta$) is incorrect, or the task does not involve significant temporal delays.
    - **Unified topology fails:** Model performance may drop if the dataset is highly heterogeneous, and a single group-level graph cannot represent the variability in individual subjects.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce Baseline vs. Best Config:** On a single dataset (e.g., HCP-Rest with ROI=400), compare the accuracy of a fixed GNN (e.g., GCN) using (a) standard pipeline vs. (b) the paper's best configuration (Kendall correlation + high-amplitude retention + lagged features). This validates the core claim.
  2. **Ablate High-Amplitude Retention:** Test different thresholding strategies ($\Theta_{\theta p30\gamma0}, \Theta_{\theta p30\gamma1}, \Theta_{\theta sd1\gamma0}, \Theta_{\theta sd1\gamma1}$) while keeping other factors constant. Measure the impact on correlation matrix values and downstream accuracy.
  3. **Lag Sensitivity Analysis:** On HCP-Rest and ABIDE, train models with node features augmented by different single lag values (e.g., $\delta = 1, 3, 5, 7$). Plot accuracy vs. lag to see if the optimal lag ($\approx 5$ for HCP, $\approx 1$ for ABIDE) corresponds to dataset-specific TR, as suggested by the paper.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the optimal data-centric configuration be automatically predicted for a new dataset or task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly mention their framework provides a "conceptual foundation for future research in Auto-Data-Centric AI—where data construction pipelines, like model architectures, can be automatically explored and optimized."
- Why unresolved: The current study manually explores combinations; no automated selection mechanism is proposed or tested for generalizing to new datasets without extensive benchmarking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a meta-learning or optimization framework that can predict effective configurations for unseen datasets, validated across diverse neuroimaging benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does no single data-centric strategy dominate across all datasets, and what dataset characteristics determine which strategy works best?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe "no single strategy dominates across all datasets" and state this "reinforces the value of a modular and flexible data-centric design space framework."
- Why unresolved: The paper benchmarks strategies but does not analyze what properties of HCP vs. ABIDE (e.g., sample size, noise levels, TR differences) cause different strategies to excel.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis correlating dataset properties (SNR, temporal resolution, sample heterogeneity) with the effectiveness of each data-centric choice.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do data-centric choices interact with each other, and are there synergistic combinations beyond simple aggregation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates individual components and some combinations, but Figure 5 shows variable outperformance rates, suggesting complex interactions; the methodology does not exhaustively explore all combinatorial possibilities.
- Why unresolved: The design space has many dimensions (signal retention × correlation metric × lag value × topology type), making full factorial exploration impractical; only selected combinations were tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies with interaction analysis, or application of design-of-experiments methodology to identify significant interaction effects between data-centric choices.

## Limitations

- Critical architectural details (SortPooling parameters, MLP head dimensions) are underspecified, preventing exact replication of reported results.
- The paper focuses exclusively on correlation-based graph construction, which may not capture all relevant neural interactions, especially non-linear ones.
- Optimal parameters (e.g., lag values) are dataset-specific, suggesting findings may not generalize without re-tuning for new datasets.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that upstream data decisions (correlation metric choice, high-amplitude retention, lagged correlations) have a consistent and measurable impact on GNN classification accuracy. The ablation studies directly support this primary claim.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific best configurations (e.g., Kendall correlation + top 30% high-amplitude + lag=5 for HCP) are well-supported for the tested datasets. However, the optimal values are likely task and dataset dependent, and the paper does not provide a general rule for selecting them on new data.
- **Low Confidence:** The exact numerical results (e.g., specific accuracy percentages) are difficult to reproduce without the missing architectural details and random seeds. The robustness of the findings to different GNN architectures is not fully explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce the Best Configuration:** On a held-out subset of HCP-Rest data, train a GCN using the paper's best configuration (Kendall correlation, high-amplitude retention with $\gamma=0$, and lagged features with $\delta=5$) and compare its accuracy to a baseline model using Pearson correlation and no lagged features. This validates the core data-centric claim.
2. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the high-amplitude retention threshold ($\theta$) and the lag value ($\delta$) while keeping other factors constant. Plot the classification accuracy to identify the optimal range for these parameters on a given dataset, testing the paper's observation that they are dataset-specific.
3. **Architecture Ablation:** Replace the SortPooling layer with a simple global pooling method (e.g., mean pooling) while keeping the data-centric pipeline changes (correlation metric, high-amplitude retention, lagged features). If performance drops significantly, it confirms the importance of the SortPooling architecture in the paper's design.
