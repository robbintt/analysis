# Fault Diagnosis and Quantification for Photovoltaic Arrays based on Differentiable Physical Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17107
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Proposed differentiable fast fault simulation model achieves I-V reconstruction errors below 3% with high computational efficiency suitable for edge devices

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of accurate fault diagnosis and quantification in photovoltaic arrays, which is essential for reliable operation and intelligent maintenance. Existing fault quantification methods often lack efficiency and interpretability, particularly when dealing with multiple simultaneous faults. The authors propose a novel approach based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM) that accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. This enables efficient optimization for fault parameter identification using gradient-based methods.

The proposed gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method leverages the differentiable property of the simulation model, employing the Adahessian optimizer to quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. The approach demonstrates high quantification accuracy across different fault types with I-V reconstruction errors below 3%, while offering strong physical interpretability and low memory costs. The method's computational efficiency makes it suitable for deployment on edge devices like PV inverters, addressing a key practical constraint in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines a differentiable fast fault simulation model with gradient-based optimization to achieve efficient fault diagnosis and quantification. The DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple fault conditions while maintaining differentiability, allowing analytical gradients to be computed with respect to fault parameters. This differentiability enables the use of gradient-based optimization methods for fault parameter identification. The GFPI method employs the Adahessian optimizer, which is particularly effective for this problem due to its second-order derivative information. The approach can handle various fault types including partial shading, short-circuit faults, and series-resistance degradation simultaneously, providing both accurate quantification and physical interpretability of the results.

## Key Results
- Achieves I-V reconstruction errors below 3% across different fault types
- Demonstrates high computational efficiency suitable for edge device deployment
- Successfully quantifies multiple fault types including partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation
- Provides strong physical interpretability of fault parameters through gradient-based optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the differentiable property of the fast fault simulation model to enable efficient gradient-based optimization for fault parameter identification. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on black-box models or heuristic methods, the differentiable model provides analytical gradients that directly inform the optimization process. The Adahessian optimizer is particularly effective because it uses second-order derivative information, allowing faster convergence to optimal fault parameters. This approach combines the accuracy of physics-based modeling with the efficiency of gradient-based optimization, while maintaining interpretability through the physical meaning of the fault parameters.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: DFFSM -> Adahessian Optimizer -> Fault Parameter Output -> I-V Reconstruction

Critical path: The differentiable fast fault simulation model generates I-V curves given fault parameters, which are compared to measured data. The Adahessian optimizer computes gradients through the differentiable model to update fault parameters iteratively until convergence.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades off model complexity against computational efficiency, using simplified but differentiable fault models rather than fully detailed physical models. This enables real-time performance while maintaining sufficient accuracy for fault quantification.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may occur with complex fault combinations that exceed model capabilities, noisy measurements that confuse the gradient-based optimization, or when multiple fault types produce similar I-V signatures.

First experiments:
1. Validate differentiable model accuracy by comparing analytical gradients with finite difference approximations
2. Test optimization convergence speed across different initial parameter guesses
3. Evaluate memory usage and computation time on representative edge device hardware
