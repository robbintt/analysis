# From Minutes to Days: Scaling Intracranial Speech Decoding with Supervised Pretraining

## Quick Facts

- Pretraining on week-long ambient audio improves speech decoding after finetuning, with gains scaling log-linearly with pretraining duration

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that supervised pretraining on week-long intracranial recordings of ambient audio substantially improves speech decoding performance compared to training only on short experimental datasets. The approach uses contrastive learning to align brain activity with wav2vec 2.0 audio embeddings during pretraining, then finetunes on clean audiobook audio. While zero-shot transfer fails due to distribution shift between ambient and clean audio, finetuning restores accuracy. The method shows consistent improvements across three subjects with gains scaling log-linearly with pretraining duration.

## Method Summary
The method employs contrastive learning to align brain activity with audio embeddings during pretraining on week-long ambient recordings, followed by finetuning on clean audiobook audio. Brain signals are processed through a deep convolutional encoder with Bahdanau attention, while audio is encoded using wav2vec 2.0 layer 19 features. The model learns to associate brain activity with audio representations through a CLIP-style contrastive loss. During finetuning, a linear head is added to adapt the pretrained brain encoder to the target audiobook task. The approach addresses the limitation of small experimental datasets by leveraging the abundance of naturally occurring speech in clinical monitoring data.

## Key Results
- Pretraining significantly improves retrieval rank on held-out audiobook data across three subjects (p<0.05 each)
- Performance gains scale log-linearly with pretraining duration
- Wav2vec 2.0 features outperform melspectrograms for two of three subjects
- Zero-shot performance is poor due to distribution shift between ambient and clean audio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Supervised pretraining on ambient audio-brain pairs improves downstream speech decoding when followed by task-specific finetuning.
- Mechanism: Contrastive learning aligns brain embeddings with wav2vec 2.0 audio representations during pretraining, creating a shared embedding space where similar brain-audio pairs are closer. The model learns general audio-brain correspondence from diverse ambient sounds, which transfers to speech-specific decoding after finetuning adapts the representations to the target distribution.
- Core assumption: Ambient audio captured by clinical monitoring reflects what the patient hears, and the brain's speech processing regions respond similarly to naturalistic and controlled listening contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size."
  - [section 3.1] "For all three subjects, the pretrained model significantly outperforms the baseline model (Subject 1: p-value=0.017, Subject 2: p-value <10e-3, Subject 3: p-value<10e-3)"
  - [corpus] Related work on brain foundation models (BaRISTA, BrainStratify) explores transformer-based representations for intracranial data, but direct evidence for ambient audio pretraining is limited—this appears novel.
- Break condition: If ambient audio does not correlate with attended speech (e.g., patient is not listening, high background noise), the brain-audio alignment signal degrades. If electrode placement misses auditory cortex, representations may fail to capture speech-relevant features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Wav2vec 2.0 features provide superior alignment targets compared to melspectrograms because they capture contextualized speech representations that better match cortical processing.
- Mechanism: Wav2vec 2.0 is pretrained on large-scale speech data and learns hierarchical representations where deeper layers (layer 19 used here) encode phonetic and linguistic features. These contextualized embeddings more closely approximate the brain's speech representations than raw acoustic features, enabling better cross-modal alignment.
- Core assumption: The brain's speech processing hierarchy maps onto wav2vec 2.0's learned representations, particularly deeper layers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "models trained with wav2vec features significantly outperform those trained with melspectrogram for two of the three subjects (Subject 2: p-value=0.010, Subject 3: p-value <10e-3)"
  - [section 2.2] "a previous study showed that deeper layers in the model map better linearly to the brain (Millet et al., 2022)"
  - [corpus] Neuro2Semantic and related work also leverage pretrained speech models for brain decoding, supporting the general approach, though comparative evidence against acoustic features is sparse.
- Break condition: If electrode coverage is primarily in early auditory cortex (Subject 1), acoustic features may suffice and contextual features provide diminishing returns. If wav2vec's training distribution mismatches target speech (e.g., different language, noisy conditions), alignment quality drops.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Finetuning is necessary because zero-shot transfer fails due to distribution shift between ambient audio and clean audiobook recordings.
- Mechanism: Pretraining on noisy ambient audio teaches general audio-brain correspondence, but the embedding space structure differs from clean speech. The model learns to align brain activity with noisy, reverberant, multi-source audio. Clean audiobook audio occupies a different region of wav2vec embedding space (confirmed via UMAP), so direct zero-shot retrieval performs poorly. Finetuning on task-specific data adapts the brain encoder to the target distribution.
- Core assumption: The distribution shift is primarily in the audio domain (ambient vs. clean) rather than brain activity patterns (passive vs. task-engaged).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The mean retrieval ranks for the two downstream datasets (ambient=0.382, true=0.498) are significantly higher than those of the week-long data (rank=0.149)"
  - [section 3.2] "the distribution of true audiobook data is drastically different from the rest" (UMAP analysis)
  - [corpus] Time-Masked Transformers paper addresses test-time adaptation for neural decoding, acknowledging distribution shift as a key challenge, though the specific ambient-to-clean audio shift is not directly addressed in corpus papers.
- Break condition: If finetuning data is insufficient (the paper shows log-linear scaling), performance gains from pretraining cannot be realized. If brain activity itself shifts substantially between passive listening and active task engagement, finetuning on task data alone may not fully close the gap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning (CLIP-style)
  - Why needed here: The core training objective maximizes similarity between positive brain-audio pairs while minimizing it for negatives. Without understanding contrastive loss, the mechanism for cross-modal alignment is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a batch of N brain-audio pairs, what does the CLIP loss optimize for each pair?

- Concept: Distribution shift / domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: The paper's central challenge is that pretraining and target data come from different distributions. Finetuning addresses this, but zero-shot fails.
  - Quick check question: Why would a model trained on noisy hospital room audio fail to retrieve clean audiobook segments, even if the speech content is identical?

- Concept: Scaling laws in deep learning
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates log-linear scaling between pretraining data quantity and downstream performance. This informs how much data is needed for practical gains.
  - Quick check question: If doubling pretraining data from 50 to 100 hours improves retrieval rank by 10%, what improvement would you expect from 100 to 200 hours (assuming log-linear scaling continues)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Brain encoder: 3-second iEEG windows → linear projection → convolutional blocks with skip connections → Bahdanau attention over time → d-dimensional embedding
  - Audio encoder: Wav2vec 2.0 (frozen, pretrained) → layer 19 activations → average over tokens → d-dimensional embedding
  - Contrastive head: Learnable temperature parameter, cosine similarity computation, cross-entropy loss over batch
  - Finetuning head: Linear layer added on top of pretrained brain encoder

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess iEEG (0.05-50 Hz bandpass, downsample to 40 Hz, robust scaling per channel)
  2. Extract wav2vec embeddings from 30-second audio chunks, interpolate to 120 Hz, segment into 3-second windows
  3. Train contrastive model on week-long ambient data (train/val/test split by 2-hour recording files)
  4. Finetune on audiobook task data with added linear head
  5. Evaluate via mean relative retrieval rank on held-out test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Wav2vec vs. melspectrogram: Wav2vec better for most subjects but requires GPU inference; melspectrogram faster but lower performance
  - Daytime-only vs. 24/7 pretraining: Paper finds no clear advantage from including nighttime data (less auditory content)
  - Deep encoder vs. linear baseline: Deep encoder benefits more from pretraining; linear encoder shows minimal gains

- Failure signatures:
  - Zero-shot retrieval rank ~0.5 (near random): Distribution shift between pretraining and target—must finetune
  - Performance degrades across days: Neural signal drift—consider day-specific normalization or domain adaptation
  - Subject 1 shows no wav2vec advantage: Check electrode locations; primary auditory cortex may favor acoustic features

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline vs. pretrain+finetune comparison on one subject to validate pipeline; expect ~10-20% improvement in retrieval rank
  2. Ablate pretraining data amount (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) to confirm log-linear scaling on your data
  3. Compare wav2vec vs. melspectrogram features; if your electrode coverage includes early auditory cortex, melspectrogram may be competitive

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can explicit modeling techniques mitigate the cross-day neural drift observed in the learned embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify daily drift as a robustness challenge and suggest domain-adversarial training, sliding-window normalization, or time-aware positional embeddings as specific future directions.
- Why unresolved: The current model's embeddings cluster significantly by recording date, indicating that neural non-stationarity remains a major hurdle for generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model that maintains consistent retrieval performance across days without distinct temporal clustering in the embedding space.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can multi-subject pretraining further scale decoding performance despite the heterogeneity of electrode implantations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that while performance scales log-linearly, extending this to multi-subject datasets requires solving electrode heterogeneity, potentially via subject-embedding layers.
- Why unresolved: The current study validates scaling only within single subjects; cross-subject variability currently prevents the aggregation of data from multiple patients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful transfer learning or performance gains when pretraining on a pooled dataset of multiple subjects with varying electrode placements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does integrating video and text modalities into the pretraining framework enhance the semantic richness of brain representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that extending the approach to integrate video and text embeddings is essential for extending the modeling of cognition.
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to the auditory modality, leaving the potential contributions of visual or linguistic context unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved decoding accuracy on semantic tasks or better alignment with high-level language models when multimodal data is included in the contrastive objective.

## Limitations

- Temporal alignment challenges: The paper assumes perfect alignment between brain recordings and ambient audio, but intracranial EEG suffers from significant neural drift across days that limits cross-day generalization.
- Distribution shift magnitude: While the paper demonstrates zero-shot failure due to distribution shift between ambient and clean audio, the specific acoustic features driving this separation are not characterized.
- Limited subject count: Results are shown for three subjects, limiting sample size and generalizability across diverse electrode configurations and brain regions.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Pretraining improves retrieval performance when followed by finetuning (p<0.05 for all subjects). This is directly measured and statistically validated.
- Medium Confidence: Wav2vec 2.0 features outperform melspectrograms (significant for 2/3 subjects). The effect is observed but not universal, suggesting electrode coverage influences the optimal feature choice.
- Medium Confidence: Log-linear scaling between pretraining duration and performance. The scaling relationship is demonstrated but limited to the available data range (up to ~100 hours).

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Feature Space**: Systematically remove specific acoustic differences between ambient and clean audio (e.g., noise reduction, dereverberation) to identify which aspects of the distribution shift most impact zero-shot performance.

2. **Cross-Day Transfer Analysis**: Evaluate model performance when training and testing on different days for the same subject. Measure the rate of neural drift and assess whether the learned embeddings provide any cross-day generalization beyond day-specific finetuning.

3. **Feature Contribution Analysis**: For each subject, map electrode locations and correlate performance gains with cortical coverage. Specifically test whether subjects with more primary auditory cortex coverage show reduced benefits from wav2vec features compared to melspectrograms.
