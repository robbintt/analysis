# Standard Applicability Judgment and Cross-jurisdictional Reasoning: A RAG-based Framework for Medical Device Compliance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.18511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18511
- Reference count: 40
- First end-to-end AI system for regulatory standard applicability judgment in medical device compliance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first end-to-end AI system for regulatory standard applicability judgment in medical device compliance. The system leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that retrieves relevant standards from a structured multilingual corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability labels (Mandatory, Recommended, Not Applicable) with traceable justifications. A manually annotated benchmark dataset of 105 device descriptions and their standard mappings was constructed for evaluation. The proposed RAG-based approach achieved 73% classification accuracy and 87% top-5 retrieval recall, significantly outperforming retrieval-only, rule-based, and zero-shot baselines. The system supports cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, enabling conflict detection and harmonized compliance analysis.

## Method Summary
The system implements a RAG pipeline where device descriptions are encoded using Sentence-BERT, relevant standards are retrieved via FAISS with optional cross-encoder reranking, and GPT-4 generates structured applicability labels with justifications. The approach uses few-shot prompting with cue-word rules ("shall" → Mandatory) and JSON schema to ensure consistent outputs. Cross-jurisdictional comparison groups outputs by standard ID and region, flagging conflicts through semantic similarity analysis. The system was evaluated on a benchmark of 105 device descriptions against a regulatory corpus of 3,900+ Chinese and U.S. standards.

## Key Results
- RAG model achieves 87% Top-5 retrieval recall, outperforming retrieval-only (68.8%) and rule-based baselines (28.4%)
- Applicability classification accuracy of 73%, surpassing retrieval-only (31.4%), rule-based (9.1%), and zero-shot LLM (14.0%) baselines
- Cross-jurisdictional reasoning successfully identifies conflicts and gaps in regulatory coverage between Chinese and U.S. standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dense semantic retrieval with reranking surfaces relevant standards that lexical overlap misses.
- Mechanism: Sentence-BERT encodes device descriptions and standard scopes into 384-dim vectors; FAISS retrieves top-k by cosine similarity; a cross-encoder reranks candidates using contextual relevance signals.
- Core assumption: Regulatory scope text contains semantically discriminative language that aligns with device descriptions despite low lexical overlap.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards."
  - [section 3.3] "RAG model achieves a Top-5 Recall of 87%, substantially surpassing the retrieval-only baseline (68.8%) and the rule-based mapping method (28.4%)."
  - [corpus] Related work on medical device classification (arXiv:2505.18695) confirms transformers improve over keyword baselines, but does not directly validate this reranking approach.
- Break condition: If standard scope texts are too brief or generic (average 74.2 chars in this corpus), semantic overlap degrades and retrieval precision drops.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structured prompting with few-shot examples constrains LLM outputs to parsable applicability labels with justifications.
- Mechanism: The prompt bundles device description, top-k retrieved standards, explicit cue-word rules ("shall" → Mandatory), and few-shot JSON examples; GPT-4 (T=0.3) generates structured output with standard_id, applicability, justification, clause.
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably distinguish regulatory modality from linguistic cues when given domain-grounded context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability labels (Mandatory, Recommended, Not Applicable) with traceable justifications."
  - [section 5.1] "RAG model attains an applicability classification accuracy of 71%... retrieval-only baseline (31.4%), rule-based (9.1%), zero-shot LLM (14.0%)."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on structured prompting effectiveness for this task; related regulatory AI work emphasizes interpretability but lacks controlled comparisons.
- Break condition: If retrieved context is ambiguous or the LLM hallucinates clause references, justification quality degrades despite correct labels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rule-based comparison of region-specific outputs flags cross-jurisdictional regulatory gaps.
- Mechanism: After LLM classification, outputs are grouped by standard ID and region; a comparator checks for applicability conflicts (Mandatory vs Not Applicable), clause mismatches, and justification divergence via SBERT similarity; conflicts are tagged and surfaced in a dashboard.
- Core assumption: Semantically equivalent standards across jurisdictions can be aligned by ID matching and scope similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification."
  - [section 3.6] "When conflicts are identified across regions, a structured tagging scheme is employed to label them as Conflict Detected, Clause Mismatch, or Justification Divergence."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related work discusses EU AI Act challenges but does not validate automated gap detection.
- Break condition: If standards lack explicit cross-jurisdiction mappings (e.g., YY vs CFR equivalents), false positives or missed conflicts occur.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: This system combines retrieval with generative inference to ground LLM outputs in domain-specific regulatory text, reducing hallucination.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why retrieval-only baselines underperform on applicability classification compared to RAG?

- Concept: Dense Semantic Embeddings
  - Why needed here: SBERT encodes device descriptions and standard scopes into a shared vector space for similarity search; understanding embedding quality is critical for debugging retrieval.
  - Quick check question: What happens to retrieval recall if standard scope texts are truncated to 20 characters?

- Concept: Structured LLM Prompting
  - Why needed here: The system relies on prompt engineering (few-shot examples, cue-word rules, JSON schema) to produce consistent, parsable outputs from GPT-4.
  - Quick check question: Why does temperature=0.3 matter for regulatory decision support versus creative writing tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Perception: SBERT encoder (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) → device embedding vx
  - Retrieval: FAISS IndexFlatL2 → top-k standards → cross-encoder rerank
  - Context Construction: prompt assembly with device x, top-k standards, cue-word rules, few-shot examples
  - Reasoning: GPT-4 API call → JSON output with applicability labels
  - Compliance Output: post-processing → region metadata reinsertion → validation
  - Gap Analysis: region-grouped comparison → conflict tagging → dashboard visualization

- Critical path:
  1. Input free-text device description
  2. Encode to vx via SBERT
  3. Retrieve top-k standards via FAISS + rerank
  4. Construct prompt with retrieved context
  5. Call GPT-4, parse structured JSON
  6. Compare across regions, flag conflicts
  7. Output compliance matrix + justifications

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SBERT MiniLM (384-dim, 6-layer) chosen for speed vs larger mpnet-base (768-dim) for accuracy
  - Temperature 0.3 trades creativity for determinism; higher T increases variability in justifications
  - Rule-based gap analysis provides interpretability but may miss nuanced conflicts that semantic similarity could catch

- Failure signatures:
  - Generic device descriptions ("monitoring device") → low retrieval precision
  - Vague standard scopes ("general performance requirements") → overprediction of "Recommended"
  - Missing standards in corpus due to naming inconsistencies (e.g., "IEC 60601-2-24" vs "60601-2-24:2012")
  - LLM outputs with malformed JSON or hallucinated clause references

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run retrieval-only baseline on 10 sample device descriptions to confirm semantic retrieval advantage over keyword matching (expect ~68% vs ~28% top-5 recall as per paper).
  2. Ablate few-shot examples from prompt to measure impact on classification accuracy and justification consistency.
  3. Test gap analysis module on vacuum blood collection tube case (CN vs US) to verify conflict detection matches paper's reported mandatory/asymmetric coverage divergence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can supervised fine-tuning or preference alignment using expert-labeled examples reduce hallucinations and increase consistency in applicability classification for ambiguous or complex device descriptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 states "model performance may be improved through supervised fine-tuning or preference alignment using expert-labeled examples, which could reduce hallucinations and increase consistency in complex or ambiguous cases."
- Why unresolved: The current system uses zero-shot prompting with GPT-4; no fine-tuning experiments were conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of a fine-tuned model against the current zero-shot baseline on the 105-sample benchmark, measuring hallucination rates and classification consistency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does retrieval precision and classification accuracy change when full-text standard documents with chunk-level embeddings replace scope-only summaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.5 notes scope statements are "underspecified or overly brief" and proposes "integrating full-text documents to enable chunk-level embedding and retrieval" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current corpus contains only short scope descriptions (average 74.2 characters), limiting discriminative power for overlapping standards.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study comparing current scope-based retrieval against chunked full-text retrieval on the same benchmark, measuring Top-k recall and applicability accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can automated verification mechanisms or logic-based consistency checks detect and prevent conflicting applicability judgments across jurisdictions without human intervention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 calls for "integration of automated verification mechanisms and logic-based consistency checks" to enhance traceability and reduce systemic risk.
- Why unresolved: Current conflict detection flags discrepancies post-hoc but does not prevent or auto-resolve them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of consistency verification rules, evaluated on cross-jurisdictional pairs to measure false positive/negative conflict detection rates.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does incorporating international standards (ISO, IEC) and regulatory guidance documents improve cross-jurisdictional harmonization analysis beyond the current CN-US coverage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.5 states ISO/IEC standards were excluded due to "access restrictions and licensing constraints," limiting comprehensive cross-jurisdictional comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The corpus covers only Chinese and U.S. standards; global manufacturers require broader jurisdictional support.
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanded corpus evaluation including EU MDR, ISO, and IEC standards, measuring coverage gaps and harmonization accuracy.

## Limitations
- Benchmark dataset and complete regulatory corpus are not publicly available, preventing exact reproduction of reported metrics.
- Prompt template with few-shot examples is not specified, requiring reconstruction that may affect reproducibility.
- Embedding model usage is inconsistent across modules (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 vs all-mpnet-base-v2), creating ambiguity in implementation.

## Confidence
- High confidence in retrieval mechanism (87% top-5 recall) due to clear evidence and controlled comparison with baselines.
- Medium confidence in classification accuracy (73%) due to reliance on proprietary LLM API and unspecified prompt engineering.
- Medium confidence in cross-jurisdictional gap analysis due to weak corpus validation and dependence on standard ID alignment.

## Next Checks
1. Implement retrieval-only baseline on sample device descriptions to confirm semantic retrieval advantage over keyword matching (expect ~68% vs ~28% top-5 recall).
2. Conduct ablation study on few-shot examples in prompt to measure impact on classification accuracy and justification consistency.
3. Test gap analysis module on vacuum blood collection tube case (CN vs US) to verify conflict detection matches reported mandatory/asymmetric coverage divergence.
