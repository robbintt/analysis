# AgriLens: Semantic Retrieval in Agricultural Texts Using Topic Modeling and Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08283
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08283
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Framework combining neural topic modeling, zero-shot topic labeling, and semantic retrieval for agricultural text corpora

## Executive Summary
AgriLens introduces a framework for exploring large agricultural text corpora by combining neural topic modeling, zero-shot topic labeling, and semantic retrieval. The system extracts coherent topics from unstructured agricultural text using BERTopic with transformer embeddings and HDBSCAN clustering, then employs language models (Flan-T5 and Mistral-7B) to generate interpretable topic labels. Semantic retrieval is supported through dense embeddings and vector search in ChromaDB. The framework demonstrates strong semantic alignment, high factuality, and good human-rated relevance and usefulness of retrieved chunks, enabling scalable information access in specialized domains without labeled data.

## Method Summary
The AgriLens framework processes agricultural text corpora through a multi-stage pipeline. First, documents are cleaned and chunked at the sentence level with metadata preservation. Topic modeling employs BERTopic using BAAI-bge-small-en embeddings, UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction. Zero-shot topic labeling generates human-readable labels using structured prompts with either Flan-T5 or Mistral-7B language models. Semantic retrieval embeds documents using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and stores them in ChromaDB, then uses topic labels as queries to retrieve semantically aligned chunks via cosine similarity search. The system includes comprehensive evaluation modules measuring semantic alignment, factuality, document coverage, and human ratings.

## Key Results
- BERTScore scores up to 0.825 demonstrate strong semantic alignment between generated topic labels and cluster content
- Factuality scores up to 0.90 indicate high faithfulness of generated labels to source material
- Human experts rated retrieved chunks as relevant, useful, and coherent across multiple agricultural topics
- System successfully handles the ENAGRINEWS dataset with interpretable topic labels and effective retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Neural Topic Modeling via Transformer Embeddings and Density-Based Clustering
BERTopic extracts semantically coherent topics by first capturing semantic relationships through transformer-based embeddings (BAAI-bge-small-en), then reducing dimensionality while preserving local topological structure using UMAP, followed by HDBSCAN identifying clusters in variable-density distributions, and finally c-TF-IDF extracting discriminative keywords per cluster. This approach assumes documents discussing similar agricultural themes will occupy proximate regions in the embedding space, and density-based clustering can recover these natural groupings. The method works well for agricultural text where semantic relationships between documents are preserved in embedding space.

### Mechanism 2: Zero-Shot Topic Labeling via Structured Prompting
Language models generate interpretable topic labels from extracted keywords by formatting topic keywords (and optionally representative documents) into structured prompts, then using pre-trained LLMs like Flan-T5 or Mistral-7B to generate concise labels under instructional constraints. This approach assumes pre-trained LLMs have sufficient world knowledge, including agricultural domain concepts, to generalize from keyword sets to coherent labels in zero-shot settings. The structured prompting ensures consistent label generation across different topic clusters without requiring task-specific training data.

### Mechanism 3: Topic-Guided Semantic Retrieval via Dense Vector Search
Generated topic labels serve as natural language queries to retrieve semantically aligned document chunks through a vector database system. Documents are chunked and embedded using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, stored in ChromaDB with metadata, then topic labels are embedded with the same model and top-k cosine similarity search retrieves aligned chunks. This mechanism assumes using the same embedding model for both indexing and querying preserves semantic alignment, and that chunking preserves enough context for meaningful retrieval while maintaining granularity for precise search results.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: BERTopic and Neural Topic Modeling**
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for unsupervised topic extraction; requires understanding of how embeddings, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and c-TF-IDF compose
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why c-TF-IDF emphasizes terms frequent within a cluster but rare across clusters, and how this differs from standard TF-IDF?

- **Concept: Zero-Shot Prompting with LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Enables interpretable label generation without labeled training data; requires understanding of prompt design and LLM generalization limits
  - Quick check question: Given a set of topic keywords ["drought", "yield", "maize", "irrigation"], what instruction would you include in a prompt to constrain the LLM to generate a short, domain-relevant label?

- **Concept: Dense Retrieval and Vector Databases**
  - Why needed here: Underpins the semantic search pipeline; requires understanding of embedding models, similarity metrics, and indexing for scale
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to use the same embedding model for both document indexing and query encoding in a semantic retrieval system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Preparation (JSON extraction → cleaning → sentence-based chunking) → Topic Modeling (BAAI-bge-small-en embeddings → UMAP → HDBSCAN → c-TF-IDF keywords) → Zero-Shot Label Generation (keyword prompt → Flan-T5/Mistral-7B) → Vector Indexing (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings → ChromaDB) → Semantic Retrieval (topic label query → embedding → top-k cosine search) → Evaluation Module (BERTScore, factuality, document coverage, human ratings)

- **Critical path:** Embedding quality (BAAI-bge-small-en) → clustering coherence (HDBSCAN parameters) → keyword discriminativeness (c-TF-IDF) → label quality (LLM + prompt design) → retrieval relevance (embedding model + chunking strategy). Degradation at any stage propagates downstream.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Flan-T5 vs. Mistral-7B: Flan-T5 shows higher factuality (0.90 vs. 0.87), Mistral-7B shows higher semantic alignment (BERTScore 0.825 vs. 0.814) and better human-rated abstraction/fluency. Paper selects Mistral-7B for end-to-end system. Chunking strategy: Sentence-based grouping balances coherence and size; smaller chunks increase retrieval granularity but risk context loss. Embedding model choice: BAAI-bge-small-en for topic modeling vs. all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for retrieval—different models optimized for different stages.

- **Failure signatures:** High cosine similarity (>0.7) with low factuality (<0.3) indicates hallucinated labels. Low specificity scores in retrieved chunks suggest overly broad topic labels or suboptimal chunking. Many singleton clusters from HDBSCAN indicate embedding space not separating topics well or parameters need tuning.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate topic coherence on a held-out subset: Manually inspect clusters from BERTopic on 500-1000 documents; assess whether keywords and representative documents form coherent themes. Tune UMAP/HDBSCAN parameters if clusters are fragmented.
  2. Compare LLM labelers on agricultural specificity: Generate labels for the same 20 topics using both Flan-T5 and Mistral-7B; evaluate factuality, coverage, and human-rated relevance to identify which better captures agricultural domain nuance.
  3. End-to-end retrieval sanity check: Use 10 generated topic labels as queries; retrieve top-5 chunks per query and have domain experts rate relevance, specificity, coherence, and usefulness. Identify whether failures stem from topic labeling, chunking, or embedding alignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the AgriLens framework perform when extended to a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for question-answering, rather than solely for semantic retrieval and topic labeling?
- Basis in paper: The introduction states that the current implementation "departs from full RAG frameworks" by focusing on topic-guided retrieval, while the related work section discusses systems like ShizishanGPT and AgroLLM that utilize retrieval for generative QA.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates the system's ability to retrieve relevant chunks and label topics, but it does not assess the quality of generated answers (e.g., faithfulness or coherence) that a user might derive from the retrieved context.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of an end-to-end generative pipeline using AgriLens retriever, measuring metrics such as answer correctness, hallucination rates, and ROUGE scores against a ground-truth QA dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the heuristic metric used for hallucination analysis (Cosine Similarity > 0.7 and Factuality < 0.3) accurately capture all instances of subtle semantic errors in topic labeling?
- Basis in paper: The methodology defines hallucination detection using specific, fixed thresholds to flag "fluent yet factually misleading" labels, but acknowledges this is a method to "disentangle fluency from faithfulness" rather than a comprehensive error analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the metric identifies clear mismatches, it may miss "hallucinations" that are factually grounded (high factuality) but semantically divergent from the specific nuances of the cluster, or those that fall near the threshold boundaries.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study correlating the automated hallucination scores with fine-grained human annotations of error types across a larger sample of generated labels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the unsupervised topic modeling and labeling pipeline generalize effectively to non-English agricultural corpora or specialized sub-domains (e.g., technical farm logs) without retraining?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates the system exclusively on the English-language ENAGRINEWS dataset (news articles and blogs), while the Related Work section notes that multilingual tools and diverse text types (like social media) remain "underexplored."
- Why unresolved: The framework relies on transformer embeddings (BAAI-bge-small-en) and language models (Mistral-7B) optimized for English general text; performance on low-resource languages or highly technical agricultural jargon is not demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-lingual and cross-domain experiments applying the same pipeline (with multilingual embeddings) to datasets in other languages or technical genres, comparing topic coherence and label quality scores.

### Open Question 4
- Question: To what extent does the sentence-based chunking strategy limit the retrieval of information that spans multiple sentences or requires broader document-level context?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge adopting a sentence-based chunking strategy to "preserve contextual flow," but note that chunking strategies involve trade-offs regarding semantic independence and that they did not perform an ablation study against semantic or fixed-size chunking.
- Why unresolved: Agricultural concepts often require longer context windows (e.g., describing a complex crop rotation cycle); constraining chunks to sentence boundaries might fragment this information, lowering the "Usefulness" score observed in human evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing retrieval performance (Recall@k and human-rated coherence) using varying chunk sizes and strategies on the same corpus.

## Limitations

- Limited human evaluation with only two domain experts rating 30 topics constrains generalizability of usefulness and relevance assessments
- Computational requirements for processing large-scale corpora may present practical deployment challenges without specific performance metrics
- Framework effectiveness not validated on non-English agricultural corpora or specialized sub-domains beyond news articles and blogs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core BERTopic pipeline (embeddings → UMAP → HDBSCAN → c-TF-IDF) effectively extracts coherent topics from unstructured text, supported by established methodology and reasonable performance metrics
- **Medium confidence**: The zero-shot topic labeling approach generates interpretable labels, as evidenced by human evaluation, though the limited sample size constrains broader generalization
- **Medium confidence**: Semantic retrieval functionality produces relevant chunks, but the evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics (BERTScore, factuality) with limited human validation of retrieval quality

## Next Checks

1. **Scale validation**: Process a 10x larger subset of ENAGRINEWS (minimum 10,000 documents) and measure end-to-end processing time, memory usage, and whether topic coherence and retrieval relevance remain stable at scale

2. **Cross-domain robustness**: Apply the complete pipeline to another specialized domain (e.g., medical literature or legal documents) and compare topic coherence, label quality, and retrieval relevance against baseline agricultural performance

3. **Expert validation expansion**: Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation with 5-10 domain experts rating 100+ topics and their retrieved chunks, measuring inter-rater reliability and establishing confidence intervals for relevance, usefulness, and label quality scores
