# SITA: Learning Speaker-Invariant and Tone-Aware Speech Representations for Low-Resource Tonal Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.09050
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09050
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves ~0.61 cross-gender retrieval accuracy and increases hard-negative tone separation (0.01-0.08 → 0.675) while maintaining near-teacher ASR WER (~0.51 vs 0.46).

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of learning speaker-invariant yet tone-aware speech representations for low-resource tonal languages like Hmong, where embeddings of the same word spoken by different speakers must be similar while embeddings of the same base word with different tones must remain well-separated. To tackle this, the authors propose SITA, a two-stage lightweight adaptation recipe for wav2vec-style encoders. Stage 1 uses a cross-gender contrastive loss to encourage speaker invariance and a tone-repulsive loss to prevent tone collapse by explicitly separating same-base different-tone pairs, with optional freezing of lower layers. Stage 2 fine-tunes upper layers with CTC and knowledge distillation to preserve ASR capability. Evaluated on a curated Hmong word corpus and transferred to Mandarin, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy (achieving ~0.61 average Top-1) and increases hard-negative cosine distance from ~0.01-0.08 to ~0.675, while maintaining ASR performance close to a fully ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. The method generalizes to unseen speakers and different tonal languages, suggesting it is a broadly applicable approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.

## Method Summary
SITA is a two-stage adaptation method for wav2vec-style speech encoders designed to produce speaker-invariant yet tone-aware representations for low-resource tonal languages. In Stage 1, the model is trained with a cross-gender contrastive loss (InfoNCE) to align same-word embeddings across speakers and a tone-repulsive loss (InfoNCE plus tone classifier) to separate same-base different-tone pairs, with optional freezing of lower layers to stabilize geometry. In Stage 2, the upper layers are fine-tuned with CTC and knowledge distillation from a stronger ASR teacher to preserve recognition capability. The method is evaluated on Hmong and transferred to Mandarin, demonstrating improvements in both cross-gender retrieval accuracy and tone separation while maintaining ASR performance close to a fully adapted teacher model.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~0.61 average cross-gender retrieval Top-1 accuracy (vs. ~0.3-0.4 for baselines)
- Increases hard-negative cosine distance from ~0.01-0.08 to ~0.675, indicating strong tone separation
- Maintains ASR WER of ~0.51, close to teacher WER of 0.46
- Improves retrieval and tone geometry when transferred to Mandarin from Hmong-trained model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cross-gender contrastive learning aligns same-word embeddings across speakers, reducing demographic bias.
- **Mechanism:** An InfoNCE loss pulls together embeddings of the same lexical item spoken by opposite-gender speakers (positive pairs) and pushes away different lexical items (negatives), conditioned on a temperature-scaled cosine similarity.
- **Core assumption:** Opposite-gender pairs are representative of broader speaker variation, and negatives effectively define the embedding boundary.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers"
  - [section 3.2] InfoNCE loss equations (1)-(3) define the contrastive pull/push.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on cross-gender contrastive loss for tonal languages; neighboring papers focus on low-resource ASR or tone recognition without this specific objective.
- **Break condition:** If speaker variation in the target domain is not well-represented by the gender binary used during training, invariance may not generalize (e.g., age or accent variation not covered).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-base different-tone pairs in embedding space.
- **Mechanism:** For each anchor, the loss constructs hard-negative pairs (same word, different tone) alongside positives (same word, same tone). The multi-class NCE-style formulation and a tone classifier encourage larger cosine distance for hard negatives while maintaining high within-tone similarity.
- **Core assumption:** The training data contains sufficiently many same-word different-tone examples to define a useful hard-negative set, and tone labels are reliable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations"
  - [section 3.2] Tone-aware loss definition with P(i), H(i), S(i) sets and loss (5).
  - [corpus] Related work on tone recognition in low-resource languages (North-East India languages) confirms that self-supervised models can encode tone, but does not validate this specific repulsion objective.
- **Break condition:** If the tone inventory or tonal system differs substantially from training (e.g., different number of tones or tone sandhi rules), hard-negative separation may not generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Staged training decouples representation learning from ASR fine-tuning, preserving recognition capability.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 updates mid-layer embedding weights with speaker/tone losses while optionally freezing lower layers. Stage 2 freezes the embedding layers and fine-tunes upper layers with CTC and optional knowledge distillation from a stronger teacher model.
- **Core assumption:** The embedding layer index L and freezing strategy leave sufficient capacity in upper layers for ASR adaptation without overwriting the learned geometry.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure"
  - [section 5.2] Ablation shows staged training yields better retrieval-ASR trade-off vs. single-stage optimization.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for staged speaker-invariant/tone-aware adaptation; related low-resource ASR papers use standard fine-tuning or specialized prosody modules.
- **Break condition:** If downstream ASR data is extremely scarce or has domain shift, distillation may not sufficiently regularize the student, or frozen embeddings may be too rigid.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**
  - **Why needed here:** The speaker-invariant loss uses InfoNCE to shape the embedding space by contrasting positive and negative pairs. Understanding how temperature, negatives, and loss formulation affect geometry is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Given an anchor, how does increasing the temperature τ in InfoNCE affect the gradient signal from hard vs. easy negatives?

- **Concept: Tonal Languages and Lexical Tone**
  - **Why needed here:** The tone-repulsive loss hinges on distinguishing same-base different-tone pairs. Awareness of tone inventories and minimal-pair structures is necessary for data construction and loss interpretation.
  - **Quick check question:** For a tonal language like Hmong, would two words with the same segmental content but different tones be considered "same lexical item" or "different lexical items" for the purpose of contrastive pairs?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation for ASR**
  - **Why needed here:** Stage 2 uses KD to keep student frame-level posteriors close to a teacher. Understanding KL divergence on CTC outputs, temperature scaling, and trade-offs between stability and plasticity is key.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might standard frame-level KL distillation be problematic for CTC models, and how might a temperature adjustment help?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - XLS-R (wav2vec-style) encoder, 24 transformer blocks
  - Stage 1: Blocks B to L (e.g., 13–19 or 13–21) trainable; speaker-invariant InfoNCE loss, tone-aware NCE + tone classifier loss; lower blocks (1–12) optionally frozen
  - Stage 2: Blocks L+1 to M (remaining upper layers) and CTC head trainable; embedding layers 1–L frozen; CTC loss + optional KL distillation from a pre-trained ASR teacher
  - Data pipeline: Word-level audio segments with lexical, tone, and speaker metadata; optional FreeVC voice conversion for augmentation

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Data preparation:** Collect word-level recordings with tone and gender labels. Segment using VAD. Optionally augment with voice conversion.
  2. **Stage 1 training:** Initialize from XLS-R; freeze lower layers; train with combined speaker-invariant and tone-aware loss (weights α=0.5). Save checkpoint at target layer L.
  3. **Stage 2 training:** Freeze blocks 1–L; fine-tune upper blocks and CTC head with CTC loss, optionally regularized by KD from a pre-trained ASR teacher.
  4. **Evaluation:** Extract pooled embeddings from layer L; evaluate cross-gender retrieval, tone geometry, and ASR WER/CER.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Layer L choice:** Deeper L (e.g., 21) improves retrieval/tone separation but leaves fewer upper layers for ASR, potentially degrading WER. Shallower L (e.g., 19) leaves more capacity for ASR but may reduce embedding quality.
  - **Freezing vs. full fine-tuning:** Freezing lower layers stabilizes retrieval and reduces overfitting in low-resource regimes, but may limit adaptation to new acoustic conditions.
  - **Distillation weight δ:** Higher KD weight stabilizes ASR but may slow convergence; pure CTC may adapt faster but risk overfitting.
  - **Voice conversion augmentation:** Can increase speaker diversity, but ablation shows it is not strictly necessary; may introduce artifacts.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Tone collapse:** Hard-negative cosine distance remains low (~0.01–0.08), retrieval performance near chance.
  - **Over-regularized embeddings:** Retrieval strong but ASR WER significantly worse than teacher; may indicate upper-layer capacity insufficient or embeddings too rigid.
  - **Unstable training:** Sudden drops in retrieval accuracy or tone classification after Stage 2; check that embedding layers are correctly frozen.
  - **Directional retrieval imbalance:** Large gap between F→M and M→F Top-1 accuracy; may indicate speaker or gender imbalance in training data.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline probing:** Evaluate frozen XLS-R on cross-gender retrieval and tone geometry (hard-negative distance, within-tone similarity) to quantify the initial collapse.
  2. **Layer selection sweep:** Train Stage 1 alone with L∈{19,21,24} (freeze lower layers) and compare retrieval, tone geometry, and tone classification accuracy without Stage 2.
  3. **Staged vs. single-stage:** Compare SITA (staged, L=19 or 21, freeze) against a single-stage multi-objective training (all losses jointly, no freezing) on both retrieval metrics and ASR WER to validate the trade-off.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does SITA's speaker-invariance and tone-awareness generalize to spontaneous, conversational speech with natural prosodic variation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Limitations section states: "our retrieval and tone-geometry metrics may not fully reflect performance on spontaneous, conversational speech or under broader domain shift."
- **Why unresolved:** All experiments use read word lists collected under standardized protocols with controlled pauses, which differ substantially from natural speech.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation on spontaneous Hmong/Mandarin corpora (e.g., conversational datasets, broadcast speech) showing comparable retrieval accuracy and tone separation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How should the tone-separation vs. ASR accuracy trade-off be optimally balanced for different downstream priorities?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Limitations section: "SITA exposes an inherent trade-off between tone separation and ASR accuracy: the appropriate loss weighting and freezing strategy may depend on the downstream priority (e.g., robust retrieval vs. recognition), and may require task-specific tuning."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates the trade-off exists but does not provide a principled method for selecting optimal hyperparameters (α, δ, feature layer) across different use cases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A systematic study varying loss weights and freezing strategies across tasks (retrieval-focused vs. ASR-focused) with clear guidelines or automated selection criteria.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does cross-gender contrastive training inadvertently preserve or amplify other demographic biases (age, accent, socioeconomic status)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Ethical Considerations: "our training objectives encourage invariance to nuisance variation, they do not guarantee the removal of all demographic information or prevent downstream misuse."
- **Why unresolved:** Invariance is only explicitly enforced for gender; other speaker attributes remain unexamined.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Probing experiments on SITA embeddings for age, dialect, and other protected attributes, combined with fairness audits on diverse speaker populations.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does SITA perform on tonal languages with different tonal inventories (e.g., 2-tone vs. 5+ tone systems) and typologically distinct tone features?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Limitations section: "the best configuration may change with more data, different demographic distributions, or different tonal inventories."
- **Why unresolved:** Only Hmong (7 tones) and Mandarin (4 tones) were tested; generalization to African, Southeast Asian, or Amazonian tonal languages with different prosodic structures remains unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Transfer experiments on diverse tonal languages (e.g., Yoruba, Thai, Vietnamese, Navajo) without retuning hyperparameters.

## Limitations
- Generalization to non-binary speaker variation (age, accent, etc.) not validated
- Tone system dependency may require recalibration for languages with different tone inventories
- Freezing assumptions may not hold under significant domain shift or extreme low-resource conditions

## Confidence
- **Speaker-invariant embeddings via cross-gender contrastive loss:** High confidence
- **Tone-aware embeddings via tone-repulsive loss:** Medium confidence
- **Staged training preserves ASR capability:** Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-gender retrieval robustness test:** Evaluate SITA embeddings on cross-gender retrieval using age-based or accent-based speaker splits instead of gender to verify that invariance generalizes beyond the binary gender assumption.
2. **Tone system generalization test:** Apply SITA to a tonal language with a different number of tones (e.g., Cantonese with 6-9 tones) and measure whether the tone-repulsive mechanism still effectively separates same-base different-tone pairs without recalibration.
3. **Freezing boundary sensitivity analysis:** Sweep the freezing layer index L and measure the impact on both retrieval accuracy and ASR WER to identify the optimal trade-off and determine if deeper embeddings can be preserved without sacrificing recognition.
