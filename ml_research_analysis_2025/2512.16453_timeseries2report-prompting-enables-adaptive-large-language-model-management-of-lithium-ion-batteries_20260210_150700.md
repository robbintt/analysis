# TimeSeries2Report prompting enables adaptive large language model management of lithium-ion batteries

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.16453
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16453
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TS2R framework converts raw battery time-series data into natural language reports, enabling LLMs to perform interpretable battery management without retraining

## Executive Summary
This work introduces TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series data into structured, semantically enriched natural language reports, enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform interpretable battery management without retraining. TS2R segments time-series data, assigns semantic descriptors using rule-based methods, and synthesizes these into natural language reports. Evaluated across lab-scale and real-world datasets, TS2R-enhanced LLMs significantly improve report quality and task performance in SOC prediction, anomaly detection, and charging/discharging management. Report-based prompting consistently outperforms vision-, embedding-, and text-based baselines, with TS2R+ChatGLM-4.5 and TS2R+DeepSeek-v3.2 achieving the highest factual accuracy and consistency.

## Method Summary
The TimeSeries2Report framework processes lithium-ion battery operational data through three main stages: time-series segmentation, semantic descriptor assignment using rule-based methods, and natural language report synthesis. The system takes raw operational data as input, segments it into meaningful intervals, applies domain-specific rules to assign semantic descriptors (such as "overcharge" or "normal discharge"), and generates structured natural language reports. These reports serve as prompts for LLMs, which then perform battery management tasks including state-of-charge prediction, anomaly detection, and charging/discharging optimization. The approach leverages existing LLMs without requiring model retraining, making it a lightweight solution for adaptive battery intelligence.

## Key Results
- TS2R-enhanced LLMs significantly improve report quality and task performance across SOC prediction, anomaly detection, and charging/discharging management
- Report-based prompting consistently outperforms vision-, embedding-, and text-based baselines in factual accuracy and consistency
- TS2R+ChatGLM-4.5 and TS2R+DeepSeek-v3.2 achieve the highest performance metrics in empirical evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by bridging the semantic gap between raw time-series battery data and LLMs' natural language processing capabilities. By converting complex operational patterns into human-readable reports with semantic descriptors, TS2R provides LLMs with interpretable context that enables reasoning about battery states and behaviors without requiring specialized training on time-series data. The rule-based semantic assignment ensures consistency and domain-specific accuracy in the generated reports, while the natural language format allows LLMs to leverage their existing language understanding capabilities for battery management tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time-series segmentation**: Needed to identify meaningful operational intervals; quick check: verify segmentation aligns with known battery state transitions
- **Rule-based semantic descriptors**: Required for consistent domain-specific labeling; quick check: test rule coverage across edge cases and anomalies
- **Natural language report synthesis**: Essential for LLM interpretability; quick check: validate report clarity and completeness against expert annotations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Raw Time-Series Data -> Segmentation Module -> Rule-Based Semantic Assignment -> Natural Language Report Generator -> LLM Interface -> Battery Management Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path runs from time-series segmentation through semantic assignment to report generation, as errors in early stages propagate downstream and affect LLM performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Rule-based semantic assignment provides consistency but lacks adaptability to novel scenarios; natural language reports maximize LLM compatibility but add generation overhead.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor segmentation leads to inaccurate semantic descriptors; incomplete rule coverage causes missing or incorrect labels; ambiguous report language reduces LLM task accuracy.

**First Experiments**
1. Test segmentation accuracy on known battery state transition points
2. Validate semantic descriptor assignment against ground truth labels for various operational scenarios
3. Measure LLM performance degradation with increasingly ambiguous or incomplete reports

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on lithium-ion batteries, limiting generalizability to other chemistries
- Rule-based semantic descriptor assignment may struggle with novel or edge-case behaviors
- Human-annotated reports used for evaluation represent a relatively small sample size (N=50 per dataset)

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Report-based prompting improves LLM performance on time-series battery data
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic enrichment approach scalability across diverse conditions and chemistries
- **Medium Confidence**: Comprehensive baseline comparisons, but potential hybrid approaches unexplored

## Next Checks
1. Test TS2R performance on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and solid-state battery datasets to assess generalizability beyond tested lithium-ion chemistry
2. Measure end-to-end latency from time-series input to LLM response, including report generation time, for real-time deployment suitability
3. Systematically introduce anomalous or novel operational patterns to evaluate rule-based semantic descriptor assignment adaptability
