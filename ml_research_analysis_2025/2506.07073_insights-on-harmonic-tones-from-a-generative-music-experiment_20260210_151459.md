# Insights on Harmonic Tones from a Generative Music Experiment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07073
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: AI-generated bass music revealed that single harmonic complex tones can contain two or more distinct melodic lines

## Executive Summary
A studio-lab experiment using the BassNet AI model discovered that harmonic complex tones can contain multiple independent melodic lines, challenging long-standing debates about whether humans can perceive individual harmonics as separate pitches. The model, trained to generate bass-like audio from mix inputs, learned to create structured simultaneous melodies from monophonic sequences of harmonics. This finding suggests contemporary music production techniques may enable more common multi-pitch perception than previously thought, and demonstrates how AI-human collaboration in studio-labs can lead to new insights in music perception and creativity.

## Method Summary
The study employed BassNet, a variational gated autoencoder that predicts f0 trajectories and Constant-Q Transform (CQT) log-magnitude spectrograms from bass-less mix audio. These predictions drive additive synthesis of sine waves, where harmonic amplitudes are determined by the predicted CQT. Key controllable parameters include Onset Threshold (note density), Harmonics (count), low-pass filter settings, Harmonic Variation (temperature-controlled softmax for amplitude dynamics), and odd/even harmonic strength ratio. The model was trained on contemporary popular music and tested through studio-lab collaboration with music producers.

## Key Results
- BassNet generated bass tracks containing independent melodic lines from monophonic harmonic sequences
- The multi-pitch effect emerged from predicted CQT spectrograms creating coherent horizontal structures across specific harmonics
- Three signal characteristics contribute to the phenomenon: audible harmonics, odd-harmonic emphasis with weak fundamental, and inharmonicity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Controllable Harmonic Amplitude Variation via CQT Prediction
The model generates independent melodic lines by predicting time-varying harmonic amplitude profiles that create coherent horizontal structures across specific partials. BassNet predicts f0 trajectories and CQT log-magnitude spectrograms. The CQT predictions determine relative harmonic amplitudes via additive synthesis. The "Harmonic Variation" parameter (temperature-controlled softmax) enhances amplitude fluctuations in upper harmonics over time, allowing individual harmonics to form perceptible melodic contours.

### Mechanism 2: Odd-Harmonic Emphasis with Weak Fundamental
Selectively amplifying odd harmonics while suppressing the fundamental and even harmonics creates conditions favoring multi-pitch perception. When the lowest strong partial is an odd harmonic (e.g., H3) with 2f0 spacing between subsequent partials, the auditory system may perceive two distinct pitch values rather than one integrated timbre. The paper explicitly implements an odd/even harmonic balance parameter.

### Mechanism 3: Perceptual Weighting via ISO 226-2003
Human frequency sensitivity weighting reveals spectral features that standard analysis might obscure, making multi-pitch structures more analyzable. The researchers apply ISO 226-2003 equal-loudness contours to weighted audio before spectral analysis. This accounts for varying human sensitivity across frequencies, ensuring evaluated power spectra reflect perceived (not merely acoustic) spectral profiles.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Harmonic Complex Tones and Partial Audibility**
  - Why needed here: The entire finding rests on whether individual harmonics within a complex tone can be perceived as separate pitches—a contested question since Mersenne (1636).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a tone with fundamental at 100 Hz and strong harmonics at 300 Hz, 500 Hz, 700 Hz might be heard as two different pitches?

- **Concept: Constant-Q Transform (CQT) Spectrograms**
  - Why needed here: BassNet outputs CQT spectrograms (not raw audio), which directly determine harmonic amplitudes in synthesis.
  - Quick check question: How does CQT differ from standard STFT in frequency resolution, and why might this matter for bass frequencies?

- **Concept: Additive Synthesis of Sine Waves**
  - Why needed here: The final audio output is produced by additive synthesis, where the harmonic series is determined by predicted f0 and relative amplitudes from CQT.
  - Quick check question: Given f0=110 Hz and relative amplitudes [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.8] for harmonics 1-5, which harmonics would likely dominate perception?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Bass-less mix audio -> Feature extraction -> Variational gated autoencoder -> Predicts (f0 trajectory, CQT log-magnitude) -> Additive sine wave synthesis with controllable parameters -> Bass audio track

- **Critical path:** The CQT prediction -> harmonic amplitude extraction -> additive synthesis chain determines whether independent melodic lines emerge. The Harmonic Variation dial is the key intervention point discovered through producer collaboration.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher Harmonic Variation -> livelier sound but risk of incoherent melodic lines
  - Odd-harmonic emphasis -> multi-pitch potential but reduced bass "weight"
  - More harmonics -> richer timbre but computational cost and potential masking

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Flat/static harmonic amplitudes -> no emergent melodies
  - Excessive temperature -> chaotic, incoherent harmonic trajectories
  - Strong fundamental + even harmonics -> single integrated pitch
  - Inharmonicity -> transcription/analysis difficulty

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline characterization:** Generate bass for a simple mix with Harmonic Variation=0 and odd/even balance=0.5. Transcribe perceived pitches. Establish single-pitch baseline.
  2. **Parameter sweep:** Systematically vary Harmonic Variation (low/medium/high) and odd/even balance. For each condition, run perceptual transcription. Map parameter space to number of perceived melodic lines.
  3. **Ablation on CQT prediction:** Replace predicted CQT with fixed harmonic profiles (e.g., constant relative amplitudes). Test whether independent melodic lines disappear, confirming that the model's learned CQT structures—not just synthesis parameters—drive the phenomenon.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent can humans "hear out" individual harmonics as distinct pitches in contemporary musical contexts?
- Basis in paper: The introduction states the findings "prompt a reconsideration of the long-standing debate on whether humans can perceive harmonics as distinct pitches" and Section 4.1 reviews historical disagreements from Mersenne through Plomp and Dixon Ward.
- Why unresolved: Historical research shows conflicting results under laboratory conditions, and the paper suggests contemporary production techniques may create more favorable conditions, but systematic perceptual studies in these new contexts remain lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale listening tests across diverse listener populations using stimuli from contemporary electronic music production, comparing perception under controlled vs. production-realistic conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relative contribution of each signal characteristic (audible harmonics, odd-harmonic emphasis with weak fundamental, inharmonicity) to the perception of multiple simultaneous melodic lines?
- Basis in paper: Section 3 identifies three aspects that "may account for the presence of simultaneous coherent melodic lines" but does not quantify their individual or combined effects.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents correlational observations from BassNet outputs without controlled manipulation of individual parameters to establish causal relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation experiments isolating each characteristic while controlling for others, combined with perceptual ratings of multi-pitch perception.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How prevalent are multi-pitch structured timbres in contemporary popular music production, and what production techniques are commonly used to achieve them?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states: "Planned publications include studies exploring how Hyper Music producers and electronic musician Vitalic use mainstream technology to create complex tones that lead to the perception of simultaneous pitch values."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides isolated examples (The Cure, Judas Priest, Alt-J, Omnisphere presets) but no systematic survey of production practices or music catalog analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Computational analysis of spectral characteristics across large corpora of contemporary popular music, combined with producer interviews and workflow documentation.

## Limitations

- The claim that independent melodic lines are "perceived" by listeners is primarily supported by producer testimony rather than controlled psychoacoustic experiments with naive listeners
- The paper doesn't clarify whether the multi-pitch effect emerges from the model's learned representations or primarily from specific synthesis parameters
- The broader claim that this finding fundamentally challenges centuries of pitch perception theory overstates the evidence from studio observations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The technical implementation of BassNet and the additive synthesis pipeline is well-documented and reproducible. The claim that the model can generate harmonic complex tones with controllable amplitude variations is supported by clear technical specifications.

**Medium Confidence:** The observation that producers perceive multiple melodic lines in the generated bass is credible based on studio-lab collaboration, but lacks systematic perceptual validation. The proposed mechanisms (harmonic amplitude variation, odd-harmonic emphasis) are plausible but not definitively proven as the sole causes.

**Low Confidence:** The broader claim that this finding fundamentally challenges centuries of pitch perception theory overstates the evidence. The paper presents an interesting studio observation but hasn't conducted the rigorous psychoacoustic experiments needed to overturn established perceptual models.

## Next Checks

1. **Controlled Listening Experiment:** Conduct a formal psychoacoustic study with both trained musicians and naive listeners to verify whether the multi-pitch perception is consistent, robust, and not simply a result of expectation or expertise bias. Use forced-choice identification tasks and probe-tone techniques to measure pitch salience.

2. **Ablation Study on CQT Generation:** Replace the model's predicted CQT with synthetically generated harmonic amplitude profiles (both random and structured patterns). If the multi-pitch effect disappears with non-model CQT inputs, this would confirm the BassNet's learned representations are essential rather than just the synthesis parameters.

3. **Fundamental Restoration Test:** Systematically reintroduce the fundamental frequency at varying amplitudes while maintaining the odd-harmonic emphasis. Track whether the multi-pitch perception degrades as predicted, providing causal evidence for the "missing fundamental" hypothesis in this specific context.
