# Sampling from multimodal distributions with warm starts: Non-asymptotic bounds for the Reweighted Annealed Leap-Point Sampler

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17977
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17977
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Polynomial-time bounds for sampling from multimodal distributions without Gaussian approximation assumptions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Re-ALPS (Reweighted Annealed Leap-Point Sampler), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler that eliminates the need for Gaussian approximation assumptions. The algorithm leverages warm start points to each mode and uses a dynamic reweighting scheme to estimate component and level weights, ensuring balance throughout the temperature ladder. The key contribution is proving polynomial-time bounds for sampling from multimodal distributions in a general setting, under the assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point.

## Method Summary
Re-ALPS modifies the original ALPS algorithm by introducing a dynamic reweighting scheme that estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm maintains warm start points to each mode and uses these to tilt the distribution components. Component and level weights are estimated inductively to ensure balance throughout the temperature ladder. The method estimates partition functions for individual components through Monte Carlo methods and maintains level balance through continuous weight estimation during the sampling process.

## Key Results
- Proves polynomial-time bounds for sampling from multimodal distributions without Gaussian approximation assumptions
- Demonstrates that component partition functions can be approximated sufficiently well via Monte Carlo estimation
- Shows improved mixing performance compared to standard ALPS on mixtures of heavy-tailed distributions
- Addresses limitations of original ALPS algorithm that relies on local Hessian information and approximate Gaussian shapes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Re-ALPS works by maintaining warm start points to each mode and using dynamic reweighting to estimate component and level weights. The algorithm estimates component partition functions through Monte Carlo sampling, which allows it to handle distributions with complex geometries beyond approximate Gaussian shapes. By ensuring balance throughout the temperature ladder through inductive weight estimation, the method can efficiently explore all modes of the distribution.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Component partition function estimation**: Needed to handle non-Gaussian components; quick check: verify Monte Carlo variance decreases with sample size
2. **Level balance maintenance**: Critical for efficient mixing across temperature ladder; quick check: monitor weight ratios across adjacent levels
3. **Warm start points**: Enable mode-specific exploration; quick check: validate warm starts reach their intended modes
4. **Inductive weight estimation**: Allows dynamic adaptation during sampling; quick check: test convergence of weight estimates

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input distribution -> Warm start initialization -> Temperature ladder construction -> Monte Carlo partition function estimation -> Weight reweighting -> Markov chain sampling -> Output samples

**Critical path**: The critical computational path involves estimating component partition functions via Monte Carlo sampling at each temperature level, which directly impacts the efficiency of weight estimation and overall mixing time.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead of partition function estimation against the benefit of handling complex multimodal distributions without Gaussian assumptions. This introduces variance in weight estimates that must be balanced against sample size requirements.

**Failure signatures**: Algorithm failure manifests as imbalance propagation up the temperature ladder, slow mixing due to poor partition function estimates, or inability to maintain warm start points in high-dimensional spaces.

**First experiments**:
1. Test partition function estimation variance across varying dimensionalities
2. Validate level balance maintenance under different component scale ratios
3. Compare mixing times against baseline ALPS on synthetic multimodal distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical implementation of component partition function estimation introduces significant variance in high-dimensional settings
- Assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to others may not hold for distributions with widely varying component scales
- Level balance maintenance through inductive weight estimation may be compromised by numerical errors and approximation limitations

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework and polynomial-time bounds: High
- Component partition function estimation via Monte Carlo: Medium
- Practical performance in high-dimensional settings: Low
- Level balance maintenance under real-world conditions: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement empirical variance analysis of component partition function estimates across varying dimensionalities to quantify the impact on overall algorithm performance.

2. Conduct stress tests with distributions containing components of widely varying scales to assess the robustness of the significant mass assumption and level balance maintenance.

3. Compare Re-ALPS performance against established multimodal sampling methods (e.g., Tempered Transitions, Parallel Tempering) on benchmark problems with known mixing times to validate practical efficiency claims.
