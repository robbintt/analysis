# ADLGen: Synthesizing Symbolic, Event-Triggered Sensor Sequences for Human Activity Modeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.17987
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17987
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ADLGen outperforms baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic richness, and downstream activity recognition for ADL data synthesis.

## Executive Summary
ADLGen introduces a generative framework for synthesizing realistic, event-triggered, and symbolic sensor sequences for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in ambient assistive environments. The method integrates a decoder-only Transformer with sign-based symbolic-temporal encoding and a context- and layout-aware sampling strategy. To ensure semantic fidelity, an LLM-driven automatic generate-evaluate-refine loop verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates correction rules without manual intervention. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ADLGen outperforms baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.

## Method Summary
ADLGen synthesizes symbolic, event-triggered sensor sequences using a decoder-only Transformer conditioned on activity labels. The framework employs sign-based symbolic-temporal encoding to efficiently represent sensor states and decouple symbolic from temporal information. Context- and layout-aware sampling guides generation toward physically plausible sequences using floorplan-derived adjacency constraints. An LLM-driven hierarchical evaluation loop verifies semantic coherence and generates executable refinement rules to correct violations automatically. The method achieves strong statistical fidelity and semantic richness while preserving downstream activity recognition performance.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baseline generators in MMD2 statistical fidelity metrics
- Achieves higher semantic quality scores through LLM-driven refinement
- Improves downstream activity recognition F1 scores compared to real and synthetic baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sign-based symbolic-temporal decoupling enables efficient modeling of sparse, discrete sensor events.
- **Mechanism:** By encoding sensor state as a sign (+1 for ON/OPEN, -1 for OFF/CLOSE) attached to the sensor ID token, vocabulary size scales with sensor count rather than sensor-state combinations. Decoupling symbolic sequences from temporal sequences prevents heterogeneous token interleaving, allowing the Transformer attention mechanism to focus on sensor activation patterns while temporal embeddings operate as a contextual modulator.
- **Core assumption:** ADL semantics are primarily determined by spatial sensor activation patterns; temporal information provides secondary contextual cues rather than primary discriminative structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "sign-based symbolic-temporal encoding... [for] sparse and symbolic sensor sequences"
  - [section 3.1]: "This design offers multiple advantages: (1) vocabulary efficiency, as only sensor IDs form the vocabulary; (2) sequence compression without information loss; (3) compact encoding of spatial identity and activation state semantics"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support; CARE (2510.16988) addresses event-triggered streams but focuses on contrastive learning rather than tokenization; DomusFM (2602.01910) processes smart-home sensor data with a foundation model but does not use decoupled encoding explicitly.
- **Break condition:** If sensor states are multi-valued (non-binary) or if precise timestamp prediction is required as primary output, sign-based encoding loses representational capacity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Context- and layout-aware sampling enforces both behavioral diversity and physical plausibility without requiring spatial topology to be learned by the model.
- **Mechanism:** Dynamic temperature modulation adjusts sampling randomness based on sequence length, sensor diversity, and repetition frequency. Spatial adjacency constraints derived from floorplan layout are applied as a hard filter during token selection, rejecting transitions that would require physically impossible movement (e.g., through walls) and triggering resampling (up to 3 attempts).
- **Core assumption:** The environment's sensor adjacency matrix accurately captures valid human movement paths, and violation of adjacency implies semantic invalidity rather than tolerable noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "context- and layout-aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences"
  - [section 3.1]: "accept it only if it forms a valid transition with the previous token... according to Amap"
  - [corpus]: MARAudor's Map (2511.05773) explicitly incorporates layout-based trajectories for HAR; DomusFM (2602.01910) highlights spatial grounding challenges but does not implement explicit adjacency filtering.
- **Break condition:** If sensors are mobile (not fixed to locations) or if multi-floor open-plan layouts produce ambiguous adjacency definitions, the adjacency matrix becomes a constraint that limits rather than enables valid sequences.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hierarchical LLM evaluation with automated rule generation corrects semantic violations without domain-specific manual tuning.
- **Mechanism:** Generated sequences are converted to natural language via TDOST, then evaluated hierarchically: (1) fundamental logic (physical feasibility, status transitions), (2) behavioral coherence (room-function alignment, action ordering), (3) temporal consistency. For violations, the LLM generates executable correction rules (insert/delete/reorder) applied programmatically or via LLM-driven modification.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs possess sufficient world knowledge about human activities and spatial reasoning to reliably detect and correct semantic violations across diverse ADL classes without environment-specific fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "LLM-driven automatic generate-evaluate-refine loop verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates correction rules without manual intervention"
  - [section 3.2]: "Two-Tiered Evaluation... sequences that pass Test A proceed to Test B... For identified violations, the LLM automatically generates executable refinement rules"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support; DomusFM (2602.01910) uses foundation models for sensor data but does not integrate LLM-based semantic evaluation; no neighbor paper directly implements LLM-driven refinement loops for ADL sequences.
- **Break condition:** If LLM evaluation produces inconsistent scores across semantically equivalent sequences, or if correction rules introduce artifacts (overcorrection), the refinement loop degrades rather than improves fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Conditional autoregressive sequence generation with decoder-only Transformers
  - **Why needed here:** ADLGen models p(seq|a) by predicting each event conditioned on prior events and activity label; understanding autoregressive factorization and causal masking is prerequisite to grasping how the model generates sequentially coherent outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a sequence of 3 prior sensor events and activity label "cooking," does the model predict the full next-event tuple or each component independently?

- **Concept:** Tokenization vocabulary design and embedding decoupling
  - **Why needed here:** The sign-based encoding compresses sensor-state pairs; the symbolic-temporal decoupling separates two information modalities into parallel embedding pathways before fusion.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have 40 sensors with binary states, how many vocabulary entries does sign-based encoding require versus composite encoding?

- **Concept:** Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for distributional fidelity
  - **Why needed here:** MMD2 is the primary realism metric; understanding how kernel-based distance compares real and generated distributions is essential to interpreting intrinsic evaluation results.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a lower MMD2 value indicate higher or lower statistical fidelity between real and synthetic distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Activity label + sign-based sensor token sequence + temporal feature sequence -> Esens + Etemp embeddings -> 6-layer decoder-only Transformer -> Sensor ID, sign, timestamp, special token predictions -> LLM semantic evaluator -> Rule-based refiner

- **Critical path:** Sign-based tokenization correctness -> symbolic-temporal embedding fusion -> context-aware temperature modulation -> adjacency-constrained sampling -> LLM refinement loop. Errors in tokenization (wrong sign, wrong sensor ID mapping) propagate through all downstream stages and cannot be corrected by sampling constraints alone.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Sign-based vs. composite vocabulary: Sign-based generalizes better for sparse/imbalanced data; composite may produce more coherent transitions in balanced settings but requires 2× vocabulary.
  - Hard adjacency constraints vs. soft spatial attention: Hard constraints guarantee physical plausibility but may reduce diversity in complex layouts; soft attention (not implemented here) would allow the model to learn spatial patterns but risks implausible outputs.
  - LLM refinement vs. training-time semantic loss: LLM refinement is post-hoc and modular but adds inference overhead and LLM API dependency; semantic loss integrated into training would be end-to-end but requires ground-truth semantic annotations.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Repeated ON/OFF cycles for same sensor without intermediate transitions: likely adjacency matrix too restrictive or temperature too low.
  - Low semantic quality scores despite high MMD fidelity: indicates statistical similarity without behavioral coherence; LLM refinement should improve this.
  - Vocabulary inflation symptoms (slow convergence, high loss on sensor ID prediction): verify sign-based encoding is correctly mapping states to signs; check for accidental use of composite tokenization.
  - Cross-floorplan transfer failure: model overfits to specific sensor layout; requires layout-agnostic conditioning or retraining on target environment data.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Tokenization ablation:** Replace sign-based encoding with composite vocabulary; compare MMD2, validity rate, and semantic quality to isolate contribution of vocabulary design.
  2. **Adjacency constraint relaxation:** Set adjacency matrix to all-ones (no spatial constraints); measure impact on physical plausibility (validity rate) and diversity to quantify constraint value.
  3. **LLM refinement necessity test:** Run full pipeline with and without LLM refinement on held-out rare activities (e.g., "Housekeeping" with ≤30 samples); report semantic quality delta and downstream F1 improvement to justify inference overhead.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can explicit spatial encodings or graph-based representations be integrated to enhance physical plausibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the model currently lacks explicit modeling of floorplan topology, relying instead on implicit relationships via sensor IDs.
- Why unresolved: Structural information like room types or adjacency is not currently encoded in the framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating graph neural networks or coordinate embeddings that yield higher validity rates in complex layouts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can self-supervised metrics be developed to evaluate sequence quality directly without LLM translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that LLM-based evaluation is an "indirect proxy" and suggests developing direct, domain-specific metrics is an important challenge.
- Why unresolved: Current semantic validation requires converting sensor events to natural language, which is computationally expensive.
- What evidence would resolve it: A self-supervised evaluator trained on raw sensor data that correlates strongly with human or LLM-based semantic assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the generation process be conditioned on specific constraints like activity duration or starting location?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list the inability to condition on contextual information like duration or starting location at inference time as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture focuses on activity class and partial prefixes as the primary conditioning signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating controlled generation where the output sequence strictly adheres to user-defined temporal or spatial constraints.

## Limitations
- **LLM Dependency:** Reliance on LLM-driven semantic evaluation introduces potential reproducibility issues and computational overhead.
- **Physical Plausibility vs. Diversity:** Hard adjacency constraints may artificially restrict sequence diversity in complex layouts.
- **Temporal Granularity:** Discretized timestamp prediction may lose fine-grained temporal patterns important for activity discrimination.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Sign-based symbolic-temporal encoding provides vocabulary efficiency and spatial-temporal separation benefits
- **Medium Confidence:** Context-aware sampling with adjacency constraints improves physical plausibility
- **Medium Confidence:** LLM-driven semantic refinement improves downstream recognition performance
- **Low Confidence:** Framework achieves strong cross-environment generalization

## Next Checks
1. **LLM Evaluation Consistency Test:** Run the same generated sequences through three different LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, and an open-source alternative) using identical evaluation prompts. Report semantic quality score variance to quantify reproducibility and identify potential LLM-specific biases in semantic assessment.

2. **Cross-Layout Transfer Experiment:** Train ADLGen on CASAS datasets with multiple distinct floorplans (e.g., tworoom, threehouse, and different apartment layouts). Evaluate whether the model can generate physically plausible sequences for unseen layouts without retraining, or quantify the performance drop when transferring to new spatial configurations.

3. **Temporal Pattern Preservation Analysis:** Compare the temporal distribution characteristics (e.g., inter-event intervals, activity duration distributions) between real and generated sequences for activities with distinct timing patterns. Use statistical tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Wasserstein distance) to quantify whether the discretized timestamp prediction preserves critical temporal semantics beyond simple chronological order.
