# InternBootcamp Technical Report: Boosting LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Task Scaling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.08636
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08636
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Open-source framework with 1,000+ diverse reasoning tasks that enables large-scale RLVR training, showing task scaling improves reasoning performance and efficiency

## Executive Summary
INTERN BOOTCAMP is an open-source framework that addresses the challenge of scaling reinforcement learning for reasoning in language models. The framework provides 1,000+ diverse, verifiable training tasks across 8 domains, enabling automated generation of training cases and evaluation through unified interfaces. The core innovation is demonstrating that increasing task diversity through "task scaling" significantly improves reasoning capabilities compared to narrow-domain approaches. A 32B model trained with this framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the Bootcamp-Eval benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization across multiple reasoning domains.

## Method Summary
The framework combines automated task synthesis with evolutionary agent workflows and self-consistent filtering to generate high-quality, executable task environments at scale. Tasks are implemented as unified Bootcamp classes with standardized interfaces for case generation, prompt formatting, and verification. Training uses DAPO-like RL with dynamic sampling, where batch size, response count, and temperature settings prevent entropy collapse. The system scales from 100 manually-curated tasks to 704 through iterative refinement, with quality controlled by filtering heuristics that identify overly-simplified or semantically-wrong implementations based on accuracy extremities.

## Key Results
- Training on diverse task sets (512 tasks) significantly outperforms narrow-domain approaches (8 tasks) on both reasoning performance and training efficiency
- The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-Eval benchmark with a 32B model
- Multi-task training enables emergent learning on tasks that fail to learn under isolated single-task conditions
- Automated evolutionary workflow with self-consistent filtering successfully scales task generation while maintaining quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scaling the number of diverse, verifiable training tasks improves both reasoning performance and training efficiency in RLVR.
- Mechanism: Diverse task distributions maintain stable gradient signal diversity during rollout, preventing entropy collapse where models produce only all-correct or all-incorrect responses. This sustains meaningful preference data for optimization.
- Core assumption: Cross-task reasoning patterns transfer, so breadth of experience compounds rather than dilutes learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Task scaling experiments show that training on more diverse tasks significantly improves both reasoning performance and training efficiency compared to narrow-domain approaches."
  - [Section 4.2.1, Figure 5b] "A linear fit between task count and performance suggests a systematic improvement from task scaling."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers (Compass-Thinker-7B, CoreThink) explore RLVR but focus on test-time scaling or specialized reasoning; no direct corpus evidence refutes or validates task scaling specifically.
- Break condition: If per-task data exposure drops below a critical threshold (fixed batch size divided by too many tasks), models may underfit individual task patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task training enables emergent learning on tasks that fail to learn under isolated single-task training conditions.
- Mechanism: Cross-task knowledge transfer allows reasoning patterns learned on one task type to scaffold learning on related but previously unsolvable tasks. The paper terms this the "Emergent Moment"—a critical transition point after sufficient mixed-task exposure.
- Core assumption: Shared underlying reasoning primitives exist across seemingly distinct task types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The work demonstrates that increasing task diversity in reinforcement learning enhances reasoning capabilities more effectively than deep specialization in narrow domains."
  - [Section 4.2.2, Figure 8] "The 7B model fails to achieve performance gains when trained individually on these three tasks. However, significant improvements are observed after approximately 300 steps when the model is trained on a diverse mixture of 512 tasks."
  - [corpus] No corpus neighbors directly examine this emergent learning phenomenon.
- Break condition: If tasks are insufficiently related or curriculum sequencing is adversarial rather than random, transfer may not occur or could harm performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evolutionary agent workflow with self-consistent unittest filtering can synthesize high-quality, executable task environments at scale.
- Mechanism: Iterative refinement using execution feedback reduces LLMs' tendency to oversimplify task implementations. Self-consistent unittests identify problematic bootcamps by detecting abnormally high (>0.85) or low (<0.03) solution accuracy, which signals over-simplification or semantic errors respectively.
- Core assumption: Accuracy extremities correlate reliably with implementation quality flaws.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3, Table 3] "We confirm through manual inspection that the given threshold indeed distinguishes overly simplified and semantically wrong bootcamps effectively."
  - [Section 3.3] "Statistical analysis shows that with more iterations, language models are less likely to oversimplify the generated bootcamps."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is sparse on automated task synthesis for RLVR; neighbor papers focus on model training rather than environment generation.
- Break condition: If the judge model (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) has systematic blind spots, filtering will propagate those gaps into the task library.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**
  - Why needed here: The entire InternBootcamp framework is built around providing verifiable reward signals for RL training. Without understanding RLVR, the design rationale for unified verification interfaces is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why verifiable rewards are preferable to learned reward models for reasoning tasks?

- Concept: **Entropy Collapse in RL Rollout**
  - Why needed here: The paper diagnoses training failure in narrow-task settings through entropy collapse—when model outputs become deterministic (all correct or all wrong), gradient updates become uninformative.
  - Quick check question: What metric would you monitor to detect early signs of entropy collapse during training?

- Concept: **Self-Consistency for Verification**
  - Why needed here: The filtering pipeline uses self-consistent unittests as a quality signal, assuming that extreme accuracy on generated problems indicates implementation flaws.
  - Quick check question: Why might extremely high accuracy on a generated task indicate a problem rather than success?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BaseBootcamp (abstract base class) → defines contract → Concrete Bootcamp classes (e.g., Game24Bootcamp) → implement per-task logic → case_generator → produces problem instances with configurable difficulty → prompt_function → formats instances into natural language prompts → verify_function → scores model responses against ground truth → Configuration files → hyperparameters for difficulty control

- Critical path: 1. Initialize Bootcamp with config → 2. Generate identity via case_generator → 3. Format prompt via prompt_function → 4. Model produces response → 5. Score via verify_function

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Unified interface vs. task-specific optimization**: Standardized methods enable parallel management of 1000+ tasks but may constrain highly specialized task designs.
  - **Automated synthesis vs. manual curation**: Agent workflow scales rapidly but requires filtering heuristics; manual curation is precise but slow.
  - **Difficulty configuration**: Flexible but places burden on users to tune appropriately for their training regime.

- Failure signatures:
  - Rollout generates excessive batches per step → entropy collapse likely; consider increasing task diversity
  - Filtered bootcamp produces accuracy near 0 or 1 → likely over-simplified or semantically broken
  - Model fails to learn on specific task in isolation → may require multi-task mixture training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the 8-task vs. 512-task comparison on a smaller model (e.g., 7B) to validate entropy collapse diagnosis on your infrastructure.
  2. Test integration with your preferred RL framework (VeRL or XTuner) using a single Bootcamp class to verify the reward computation pipeline.
  3. Generate a new Bootcamp class using the evolutionary workflow and validate it passes self-consistent unittest filtering before adding to your task pool.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does task scaling continue to provide consistent performance gains beyond 512 tasks, or does it exhibit diminishing returns at larger scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper validates task scaling "over two orders of magnitude" (8 to 512 tasks) and notes it offers "a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist," leaving the scalability ceiling unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested up to 512 tasks, and the linear trend in Figure 5b may not extrapolate to larger task counts where interference or capacity constraints could emerge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training models on 1000+ and 10,000+ diverse tasks with controlled evaluation to assess whether performance gains plateau.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms enable the "Emergent Moment" phenomenon where tasks unsolvable in isolation become learnable through diverse multi-task training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that Hyperbaton, PropositionalLogicFormalization, and Wordscapes tasks "fail to learn under isolated training conditions" but show "significant performance improvements after approximately 300 steps" in mixed training.
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the phenomenon but does not explain the underlying transfer mechanisms or identify which task combinations enable emergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies identifying critical task pairs, analysis of shared reasoning patterns, and mechanistic interpretability of cross-task knowledge transfer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does task scaling effectiveness vary across different model sizes and RL algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments primarily use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for scaling experiments and a DAPO-like algorithm, with 32B models only tested on the full task set without systematic scaling analysis.
- Why unresolved: The interaction between model capacity, algorithm design, and task diversity benefits remains unclear, limiting generalization of findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments across model sizes (1B to 70B) and multiple RL algorithms (DAPO, GRPO, PPO) with controlled task scaling.

## Limitations

- The evolutionary bootcamp generation process lacks full specification, particularly exact prompts and precise filtering thresholds beyond accuracy bounds
- DAPO hyperparameters are incompletely specified, including learning rate schedules and KL penalty values
- Claims about task diversity compounding learning rather than diluting it remain correlational without controlling for total training compute

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The empirical observation that entropy collapse occurs with narrow task sets (verified through batch generation monitoring). The self-consistent filtering heuristic effectively identifies problematic bootcamps based on accuracy extremities.
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalization benefits from task scaling, as the improvement trend is observed but may conflate task diversity with increased training compute. The emergent learning phenomenon where multi-task training enables learning on previously unsolvable tasks needs more rigorous ablation studies.
- **Low Confidence**: The precise mechanism by which cross-task reasoning patterns transfer, and whether the observed improvements stem from task diversity per se or from increased effective training volume.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments holding total training tokens constant while varying task diversity to isolate the effect of task scaling from compute scaling.
2. Implement curriculum learning strategies (progressive task introduction vs. random mixing) to test whether task sequencing affects emergent learning outcomes.
3. Perform ablation studies on the evolutionary generation pipeline by comparing fully automated synthesis against manually-curated task sets with matched diversity profiles.
