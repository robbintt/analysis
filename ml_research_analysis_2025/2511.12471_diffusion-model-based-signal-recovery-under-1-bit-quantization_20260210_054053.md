## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of signal recovery from 1-bit quantized measurements, which is particularly relevant for 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks. The key difficulty arises from the non-linear and often non-differentiable link functions that prevent direct application of diffusion models. The authors propose Diff-OneBit, a novel method that leverages a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization within a plug-and-play framework. This approach effectively decouples data fidelity from the diffusion prior, allowing pretrained diffusion models to act as denoisers in iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments on FFHQ, CelebA, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit achieves superior reconstruction quality and computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
Diff-OneBit addresses 1-bit quantization recovery by introducing a differentiable surrogate likelihood function that approximates the non-differentiable quantization process. This surrogate is integrated into a plug-and-play framework where any pretrained diffusion model serves as a denoiser. The method alternates between diffusion model-based denoising steps and data fidelity updates using the surrogate likelihood, effectively combining the strengths of diffusion priors with rigorous statistical modeling of the quantization process. This decoupling strategy allows for flexible integration with existing diffusion models while maintaining theoretical guarantees through the surrogate likelihood framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR values up to 22.48 and SSIM up to 0.66 on CelebA dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods including SIM-DMIS, DiffPIR, DPS, and DAPS across all metrics
- Demonstrates superior reconstruction quality and computational efficiency
- Validated across multiple datasets: FFHQ, CelebA, and ImageNet

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental challenge of non-differentiable link functions in 1-bit quantization through a surrogate likelihood approach. By creating a differentiable approximation of the quantization process, the framework enables gradient-based optimization while maintaining the statistical properties of the original problem. The plug-and-play architecture allows leveraging powerful pretrained diffusion models as denoisers without requiring model-specific modifications, while the iterative structure ensures proper integration of both the diffusion prior and the data fidelity term derived from the surrogate likelihood.

## Foundational Learning

1. **1-bit quantization and compressed sensing**
   - Why needed: Forms the core problem setting where measurements are reduced to binary values, creating severe information loss
   - Quick check: Understanding that 1-bit measurements preserve sign information but discard magnitude

2. **Diffusion models and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)**
   - Why needed: Provide powerful generative priors for signal reconstruction in the denoiser role
   - Quick check: Recognizing that diffusion models learn to reverse a noising process through iterative denoising

3. **Surrogate likelihood functions**
   - Why needed: Enable optimization in non-differentiable settings by providing smooth approximations
   - Quick check: Verifying that the surrogate maintains key statistical properties while being differentiable

4. **Plug-and-play frameworks**
   - Why needed: Allow modular integration of different denoisers with iterative reconstruction algorithms
   - Quick check: Understanding the alternating minimization structure between prior and data fidelity

5. **Iterative reconstruction algorithms**
   - Why needed: Provide the computational framework for combining priors with measurement constraints
   - Quick check: Recognizing the convergence properties of alternating optimization schemes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Measurements → Surrogate likelihood module → Diffusion model denoiser ↔ Iterative reconstruction loop → Recovered signal

**Critical path:** The most critical computational path is the iterative loop alternating between surrogate likelihood gradient computation and diffusion model denoising. This path directly determines reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

**Design tradeoffs:** The method trades implementation complexity for reconstruction quality by requiring careful integration of the surrogate likelihood with pretrained diffusion models. The choice of surrogate function must balance approximation accuracy with computational tractability.

**Failure signatures:** Potential failures include poor convergence if the surrogate likelihood poorly approximates the true quantization likelihood, and degraded performance if the diffusion model's prior is mismatched to the target signal distribution.

**Three first experiments:**
1. Verify convergence properties on simple synthetic 1-bit compressed sensing problems with known ground truth
2. Test reconstruction quality across different signal-to-noise ratios to understand robustness
3. Compare computational runtime against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets

## Limitations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments on diverse signal types beyond images, including audio signals, time-series data, and other modalities, to validate generalizability across different data domains.

2. Perform comprehensive runtime analysis comparing computational requirements and execution times against state-of-the-art methods across various dataset sizes and signal dimensions to substantiate efficiency claims.

3. Extend the method to handle multi-bit quantization scenarios and evaluate performance against existing approaches in this more common and practical setting.
