# PROTOCOL: Partial Optimal Transport-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imbalanced Multi-view Clustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12408
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12408
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Achieves up to 6.7% higher accuracy than second-best method under R=0.1 imbalance ratio

## Executive Summary
PROTOCOL addresses imbalanced multi-view clustering by combining partial optimal transport with class-rebalanced contrastive learning. The method introduces a two-stage approach that first perceives class imbalance distributions through POT-based label assignment, then mitigates representation degradation of minority samples through logit adjustment and weighted prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets and varying imbalance levels.

## Method Summary
PROTOCOL reformulates imbalanced clustering as a partial optimal transport problem augmented with progressive mass constraints and KL divergence regularization. The framework consists of three training stages: view-specific reconstruction, multi-view alignment, and imbalanced learning with POT labels. A key innovation is the combination of feature-level logit adjustment and class-level weighted prototypes within contrastive learning to specifically address minority class representation degradation.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 6.7% higher accuracy than second-best method under R=0.1 imbalance ratio
- Maintains robust performance across varying imbalance levels (R=0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of both POT-based label assignment and class-rebalanced contrastive learning strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Partial Optimal Transport for Imbalance Perception
Reformulating imbalanced clustering as partial optimal transport enables perception of underlying class distributions without supervision. The method combines unbalanced OT (KL divergence relaxation) with partial OT (λ mass constraint) to create transport plans that dynamically map samples to imbalanced class distributions.

### Mechanism 2: Progressive Mass Assignment via Curriculum
Gradually increasing transported mass λ from λbase to λmax enables stable label assignment that respects confidence hierarchies. Early training assigns labels only to high-confidence predictions, preventing noisy labels from corrupting representation learning.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Level Rebalancing in Contrastive Learning
Logit adjustment at feature level combined with class-weighted prototypes at class level mitigates representation degradation of minority samples. Feature-level: ηi = −log p(T*i) amplifies minority gradients. Class-level: Weighted prototypes wc = nc/Σnk ensure proportional contribution despite underrepresentation.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Optimal Transport Fundamentals
- Why needed: The label assignment mechanism depends on understanding transport plans, KL divergence relaxation, and efficient scaling algorithms.
- Quick check: Can you explain why Eq. 5 relaxes constraints compared to Eq. 3?

### Concept: Contrastive Learning with InfoNCE-style objectives
- Why needed: The baseline multi-view contrastive loss and modified rebalanced versions are modifications of standard contrastive objectives.
- Quick check: In Eq. 19, what makes Hv_i and U_i a "positive pair" versus Hv_i and U_j (j≠i)?

### Concept: Long-tailed/Imbalanced Learning
- Why needed: The paper adapts supervised imbalanced learning techniques to unsupervised settings.
- Quick check: Why does subtracting log class frequency from logits increase the effective learning signal for minority classes?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Input {X^v} → Encoders f_θv → Z^v → Transformer attention → S^v → Aggregation → U → Classifier h → P (predictions) → POT Module → T* (pseudo-labels) → Rebalanced Contrastive Loss

### Critical path:
Encoder → Consensus representation U → POT label assignment T* → Rebalanced loss. Errors in U propagate to T* and corrupt the entire rebalancing mechanism.

### Design tradeoffs:
- α ∈ [0,1] balances consensus vs. view-specific predictions; α=0.5 per experiments
- λbase/λmax control curriculum aggressiveness; too aggressive risks early noise
- Temperature parameters τf, τl control softmax sharpness; paper uses τf=0.5, τl=1.0

### Failure signatures:
- Clustering accuracy stuck near random (ACC ≈ 1/K): POT labels not converging; check λ schedule
- Majority class dominates (ACC high but per-class recall shows minority collapse): Rebalancing insufficient; increase logit adjustment weight
- Slow convergence (>50 epochs with flat loss): Transport cost matrix may be degenerate; check prediction entropy

### First 3 experiments:
1. Reproduce ablation (Table 5) on a single dataset: Train Base → w/ POT → w/ POT+CLR variants. Expected: ~15% ACC improvement from POT addition alone.
2. Visualize transport plan T* during training: Plot the column sums (assigned class frequencies) across epochs. Expected: Should stabilize to imbalanced distribution matching data.
3. Sanity check on synthetic balanced data (R=1.0): PROTOCOL should match baseline methods, not degrade.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness critically depends on consensus representation U preserving cross-view cluster structure
- Progressive mass curriculum assumes prediction confidence correlates with label correctness
- Rebalancing mechanisms rely on POT pseudo-label accuracy; errors in minority classes will be amplified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation of POT with progressive mass constraints and two-level rebalancing mechanism
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that POT labels accurately reflect true class distributions requires validation
- **Low Confidence**: Specific impact of Transformer module for structure-aware features not fully explored

## Next Checks
1. **Label Quality Analysis**: Visualize evolution of POT pseudo-labels T*, plot class frequency distributions against true imbalance ratios, quantify error rates for minority vs. majority classes.
2. **Curriculum Schedule Sensitivity**: Systematically vary λbase and λmax parameters to test progressive mass assignment robustness and identify optimal ranges.
3. **Architecture Ablation**: Replace Transformer module with simpler attention mechanism or remove entirely to isolate its contribution to performance gain.
