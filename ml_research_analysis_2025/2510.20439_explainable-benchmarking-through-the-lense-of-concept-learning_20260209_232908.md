# Explainable Benchmarking through the Lense of Concept Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20439
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20439
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A new explainable benchmarking paradigm using concept learning on knowledge graphs, with PruneCEL algorithm achieving up to 0.55 points higher F1 than state-of-the-art on QA datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces explainable benchmarking, a novel approach that transforms benchmarking data into structured knowledge graphs and uses concept learning to automatically generate insights into system performance. The core contribution is PruneCEL, a concept learning algorithm that prunes the search space by avoiding unsatisfiable concepts, achieving scalability on large knowledge graphs where standard approaches fail. The framework was evaluated on knowledge-graph-based question answering datasets, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods, and validated through a user study demonstrating that human participants could accurately predict system behavior based on the generated explanations.

## Method Summary
The approach transforms benchmark data (questions, queries, system outputs) into structured knowledge graphs using semantic enrichment, then applies concept learning algorithms to find logical concepts that distinguish between high and low performance cases. The PruneCEL algorithm implements an efficient refinement operator guided by an oracle implemented via SPARQL queries, which filters out candidate concepts that would cover zero training examples. This pruning strategy trades theoretical completeness for computational tractability, allowing the system to scale to large knowledge graphs while maintaining strong F1 scores. Generated concepts are verbalized into natural language explanations for human interpretation.

## Key Results
- PruneCEL outperforms state-of-the-art concept learning approaches (CELOE, Drill) by up to 0.55 points F1 measure on knowledge-graph-based question answering datasets
- The pruning mechanism enables completion of concept learning tasks where CELOE and Drill time out after 10 minutes
- A user study with 41 participants found that 80% of the time, the majority could accurately predict system behavior based on the generated verbalized explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pruning via Monotonicity and Oracle Filtering
The algorithm achieves scalability by avoiding generation of "unsatisfiable" concepts that cover zero positive or negative examples. Using a refinement operator guided by a SPARQL-based oracle, PruneCEL checks the knowledge base before generating full concepts to ensure candidates cover at least one example. This exploits monotonicity of subset inclusion to prune entire branches of the search tree that would yield zero-information concepts, trading theoretical completeness for computational tractability.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Enrichment of Benchmark Data
Raw benchmark metrics are insufficient for debugging; transforming questions and queries into structured Knowledge Graphs allows discovery of semantic patterns in performance. Features from the QA pipeline (natural language features, answer types, SPARQL query structures) are extracted and mapped to a common ontology, enabling concept learning algorithms to operate on enriched semantic data rather than just numerical metrics.

### Mechanism 3: Verbalization for Human Predictability
Symbolic concepts in Description Logic generated by the learner are translated into natural language explanations using LLM tools. Users apply these "If/Then" rules to new inputs to judge system success likelihood. The approach assumes faithful representation of underlying logic and generalization to unseen cases, though LLM verbalization can introduce semantic drift.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Description Logics (specifically $\mathcal{ALC}$)
  - **Why needed here:** PruneCEL outputs explanations in $\mathcal{ALC}$ syntax (e.g., $\exists r.C$). Understanding conjunctions ($\sqcap$), disjunctions ($\sqcup$), and existential restrictions ($\exists$) is essential for interpreting raw results.
  - **Quick check question:** Given $\text{Person} \sqcap \exists \text{hasChild}.\text{Doctor}$, does this describe a person who has at least one child that is a doctor, or a person all of whose children are doctors? (Answer: At least one)

- **Concept:** Refinement Operators (Top-Down)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames PruneCEL against classic top-down approaches. Understanding that search starts from generic concept $\top$ and specializes downward until matching positive examples is crucial.
  - **Quick check question:** In a top-down approach, if current concept is too broad (covers both positives and negatives), does refinement operator make it more specific or more general?

- **Concept:** Knowledge Graphs & SPARQL
  - **Why needed here:** The "Oracle" in PruneCEL is implemented via SPARQL queries against a triple store. Understanding how the system queries the graph to check instance counts is key to debugging performance bottlenecks.
  - **Quick check question:** If Oracle runs SPARQL query to check for instances of a concept and the query times out, how does that affect the concept learner's ability to prune the search space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion -> KB Generator -> Triple Store -> PruneCEL Engine (Refinement Operator + Oracle) -> Verbalizer
- **Critical path:** The KB Generation step. If extracted features (e.g., "question word," "answer type") don't correlate with system failure modes, PruneCEL will return low-confidence concepts regardless of algorithm efficiency. The learner can only select from what's encoded in the graph.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Completeness vs. Speed: PruneCEL sacrifices "weak completeness" (might miss some valid concepts) to ensure completion on large KBs
  - Accuracy vs. Interpretability: Longer concepts are penalized ($\eta$ parameter) to force simpler explanations but might hide complex logical truths
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Top" Result: Output concept is just $\top$, indicating failure to distinguish positive from negative examples (likely data feature issue)
  - ChatGPT Hallucination: Explanation text claims something (e.g., "non-agent") that doesn't strictly map to ontology logic, leading to user confusion
  - Runtime Timeout: KB is too massive or Oracle queries are inefficient, system hits time limit (e.g., 10 mins) and returns best concept found so far
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Run PruneCEL on synthetic dataset with known ground truth concept (e.g., all questions with "boolean" answers are correct). Verify it returns $\exists \text{hasBooleanAnswer}.\top$
  2. Ablation on Pruning: Run PruneCEL vs. CELOE on subset of QALD data. Measure *number of SPARQL queries* issued. PruneCEL should issue significantly fewer queries by skipping empty concepts
  3. Verbalization Fidelity: Take output concept for failing system, manually translate to English, compare against ChatGPT verbalization. Check for "non-agent" style semantic drift

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do generated explanations enable users to significantly improve system performance over time?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion states "large scale experiment is needed to ensure generated explanations support them in improving the benchmarked system over time"
  - **Why unresolved:** Current user study only measured prediction ability, not modification/tuning based on explanation
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal study where developers use explanations to implement changes resulting in statistically significant performance gains on subsequent benchmarks

- **Open Question 2:** Can the framework be effectively generalized to application areas beyond knowledge-graph-based question answering?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion lists "apply our generic approach to other application areas" as future work
  - **Why unresolved:** Evaluation restricted to KG-QA domain (QALD datasets); untested whether structured knowledge bases can be generated for other modalities
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful instantiation on non-QA benchmarks (e.g., image classification, machine translation) yielding high F1 scores and human-readable explanations

- **Open Question 3:** How can verbalization be made robust against LLM hallucinations and reliance on external background knowledge?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Discussion notes "future work will have to take two identified sources of errors into account" - ChatGPT mistranslation and reliance on background knowledge not present in KB
  - **Why unresolved:** Current reliance on ChatGPT introduced semantic drift, leading users to misunderstand concepts (e.g., misinterpreting "non-agent")
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** User study comparing standard LLM verbalization against constrained method showing significantly lower error rate in user interpretation

## Limitations
- The trade-off between completeness and scalability means PruneCEL may miss optimal explanations when true distinguishing concepts happen to cover zero training examples
- Effectiveness heavily depends on quality of semantic enrichment - if extracted features don't correlate with actual system failure modes, concept learning produces low-confidence results
- The approach assumes benchmark data contains sufficient semantic metadata to differentiate between easy and hard cases, which may not hold for all domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Pruning mechanism's basic validity (avoiding zero-coverage concepts improves efficiency) | High |
| Core concept learning approach | High |
| User study results showing 80% prediction accuracy | Medium (small sample size, potential LLM issues) |
| Scalability claims (finishing where CELOE/Drill time out) | Medium (limited absolute runtime data) |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying pruning aggressiveness to quantify completeness-speed tradeoff on synthetic datasets with known ground truth concepts
2. Test KB generation pipeline with systematically corrupted or irrelevant features to measure how feature quality affects concept learning F1 scores
3. Perform follow-up user study with blinded comparisons between human-translated and LLM-translated explanations to isolate impact of verbalization fidelity on prediction accuracy
