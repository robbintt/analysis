# INR-Bench: A Unified Benchmark for Implicit Neural Representations in Multi-Domain Regression and Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.10188
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10188
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** INR-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit neural representations, analyzing MLP vs KAN architectures across 9 multimodal tasks and showing KANs have better low-frequency spectral bias but training challenges.

## Executive Summary
INR-Bench introduces a unified benchmark for evaluating implicit neural representations (INRs) across 9 multimodal tasks including audio, image, and 3D shape regression, as well as inverse problems like inpainting and denoising. The benchmark analyzes how model architectures (MLP vs KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the Neural Tangent Kernel spectrum and consequently the ability to learn signals of varying frequencies. Results show KANs have smaller spectral bias for low frequencies but face training complexity, positional encoding enhances high-frequency learning, and nonlinear primitives significantly impact frequency response. The benchmark includes 56 Coordinate-MLP models and 22 Coordinate-KAN models evaluated on diverse tasks.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates 56 Coordinate-MLP models (14 activations × 4 positional encodings) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models (4 basis function types) across 9 tasks. Architecture specifications include MLPs with 6 layers and width 256, and KANs with 6 layers and width 64. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 4e-4, batch size 8192, and CosineAnnealingLR scheduler. Positional encodings include fixed frequency mappings and a learnable FKAN encoding. Evaluation metrics include PSNR for images, SNR for audio, and IoU for SDF. Datasets span audio (GTZAN), images (Natural, DIV2K), 3D shapes (Stanford), and CT scans (Kaggle Lung Nodule).

## Key Results
- KANs exhibit smaller spectral bias for low-frequency components compared to MLPs, but suffer from higher training complexity and instability
- Positional encoding significantly enhances high-frequency learning, with FKAN outperforming existing methods in generalization
- MLP remains the most effective model for INR tasks due to training stability and efficiency
- Nonlinear primitives (activation functions) substantially impact frequency response and convergence behavior
- FKAN positional encoding demonstrates superior generalization compared to fixed frequency mappings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically analyzing the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) spectrum of different INR architectures to understand their frequency learning capabilities. By evaluating models across diverse signal types with varying frequency distributions, the study reveals how architectural choices affect spectral bias. The unified framework enables direct comparison of MLP and KAN models under consistent training conditions, revealing that while KANs theoretically have better low-frequency spectral properties, practical training challenges limit their effectiveness compared to MLPs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Implicit Neural Representations (INRs):** Continuous functions that map coordinates to signal values, replacing discrete grids with neural networks. Needed to understand the fundamental concept being benchmarked.
- **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK):** Analyzes how neural network architectures learn frequencies during training. Quick check: Verify NTK spectrum analysis methodology matches standard implementations.
- **Spectral Bias:** The tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies before high frequencies during training. Quick check: Confirm frequency learning curves match expected spectral bias patterns.
- **Positional Encoding:** Mapping input coordinates to higher-dimensional spaces using fixed or learnable functions. Quick check: Validate positional encoding implementations against reference code.
- **Coordinate-KAN:** KAN architecture that operates on coordinate inputs with specialized basis functions. Quick check: Verify basis function implementations match specified types.
- **Frequency Generalization:** Ability to learn and reconstruct signals across different frequency ranges. Quick check: Test models on held-out frequency components.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data -> Coordinate Encoding -> INR Model (MLP/KAN) -> Training Loop -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing → Model architecture selection → Training with positional encoding → NTK spectral analysis → Task-specific evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** MLPs offer training stability and efficiency but suffer from high spectral bias, while KANs have better low-frequency learning but face computational complexity and convergence challenges. Positional encoding improves high-frequency learning at the cost of increased parameter count and potential overfitting.

**Failure Signatures:** KANs failing to converge on complex tasks, high-frequency underfitting in audio tasks with basic MLPs, out-of-memory errors with large batch sizes, and generalization issues with fixed positional encodings.

**First Experiments:**
1. Run image regression task with FKAN+Gaussian MLP configuration to verify baseline PSNR (~35 dB)
2. Test KAN convergence on simple 3D shape regression to identify training instability patterns
3. Compare spectral bias across different activation functions on audio task to validate frequency learning analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can Coordinate-KAN architecture be modified to reduce computational complexity while maintaining favorable low-frequency spectral bias?
- How can Coordinate-KAN generalization capability be improved to converge across diverse INR tasks without task-specific tuning?
- Can learnable positional encodings like FKAN be enhanced to stabilize training for complex signals like Neural Radiance Fields?
- To what extent can specialized basis functions effective in Poisson reconstruction be generalized to broader classes of physics-informed PDEs?

## Limitations
- Benchmark lacks analysis of structured sparsity, adaptive width, and attention-based architectures
- Some tasks exhibit highly variable convergence rates requiring task-specific hyperparameter tuning
- Theoretical link between NTK spectra and generalization remains qualitative rather than rigorously quantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** MLP architecture effectiveness, positional encoding benefits, FKAN generalization improvements
- **Medium confidence:** KAN performance claims (limited by training instability and documentation gaps)
- **Medium confidence:** Spectral bias analysis (empirical but not fully validated through ablation studies)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate NTK spectral analysis on image regression task to verify frequency-response correlations
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating KAN basis function granularity impact on training stability
3. Benchmark additional INR architectures (SIREN variants, attention models) to assess MLP vs KAN trends across broader families
