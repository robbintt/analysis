# Eeyore: Realistic Depression Simulation via Supervised and Preference Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00018
- Reference count: 25
- An 8B LLM optimized for realistic depression simulation through structured alignment, outperforming GPT-4o in linguistic authenticity and profile adherence

## Executive Summary
Eeyore is an 8B large language model specifically optimized for realistic depression simulation through a structured alignment framework. The authors curate real-world depression conversations, extract depressive traits, and construct psychological profiles to guide role-play. The model undergoes instruction-tuning followed by iterative preference optimization—first with model-generated preferences and then with expert-annotated preferences. Human expert evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in contrast with AI-like responses and subtle emotional expression, validating the effectiveness of structured optimization over generic prompting strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors developed Eeyore through a three-stage alignment pipeline. First, they curated real-world depression conversations from Reddit and extracted depressive traits to construct psychological profiles. Second, the base model was instruction-tuned on these curated conversations. Third, the model underwent iterative preference optimization using two approaches: initial model-based preference optimization followed by expert-annotated preference optimization. The framework aims to optimize for both linguistic authenticity and adherence to constructed psychological profiles, with evaluations conducted by human experts to validate the simulation's realism.

## Key Results
- Eeyore outperforms GPT-4o with state-of-the-art prompting in both linguistic authenticity and profile adherence
- Human expert evaluations show significant improvements in contrast with AI-like responses and subtle emotional expression
- Structured optimization approach demonstrates effectiveness over generic prompting strategies for depression simulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The structured alignment framework works by combining real-world depression data with psychological profiling to create targeted training objectives. By first instruction-tuning on authentic conversations and then refining through preference optimization with both model-generated and expert-annotated preferences, the model learns to generate responses that are both linguistically authentic and adherent to specific depressive traits. The iterative approach allows for progressive refinement of the simulation quality.

## Foundational Learning

### Depression Trait Extraction
- Why needed: To identify specific linguistic and behavioral patterns associated with depression
- Quick check: Verify that extracted traits align with clinical diagnostic criteria

### Psychological Profile Construction
- Why needed: To provide structured guidance for consistent depression simulation
- Quick check: Ensure profiles capture diverse manifestations of depression

### Preference Optimization
- Why needed: To refine model outputs based on human judgment of authenticity
- Quick check: Validate that preferences align with clinical expertise

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Base Model -> Instruction Tuning -> Model-based DPO -> Expert DPO -> Eeyore

### Critical Path
Reddit depression conversations → Trait extraction → Profile construction → Instruction tuning → Model DPO → Expert DPO → Final evaluation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Reddit data vs. clinical data: Balance authenticity with ethical considerations
- Model vs. expert preferences: Trade off scale and cost with clinical accuracy
- 8B parameter size: Balance performance with computational efficiency

### Failure Signatures
- Generic responses lacking depressive traits
- Over-dramatized or stereotypical depression expressions
- Inconsistent adherence to constructed psychological profiles

### Three First Experiments
1. Compare linguistic authenticity scores between instruction-tuned and base models
2. Evaluate profile adherence improvements after each DPO stage
3. Test model responses against clinical depression communication patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the individual contribution of each alignment stage (instruction-tuning, model-based DPO, and expert DPO) to the simulation's overall effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 states the authors "did not perform ablations of the individual contribution of each alignment component to the final model's effectiveness."
- Why unresolved: Human evaluation was too costly and automatic evaluation proved too insensitive to detect subtle differences between model iterations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study using a large enough pool of clinical experts to statistically validate the performance impact of removing each component.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can automatic evaluation methods be improved to reliably detect fine-grained deviations in psychological profile adherence?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.2.1 concludes that "automatic evaluation struggles to capture nuanced differences between models," noting that the interviewer agent assigned "near-perfect profile alignment" to all models.
- Why unresolved: Current LLM-based evaluators lack the sensitivity to distinguish between clinically authentic responses and those that are merely coherent.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of an automated evaluation metric that demonstrates a strong statistical correlation with expert human judgments on authenticity and emotional subtlety.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the selection of hyperparameters, such as the preference scaling factor (β) and noise augmentation ratios, impact the model's realism?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 notes the authors "were unable to fully explore the impact of different hyperparameter selections on model performance."
- Why unresolved: The pipeline utilized specific fixed values (e.g., β=0.1, 30% noise modification) without conducting a broader sensitivity analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive grid search over hyperparameter spaces evaluated against the model's profile adherence and linguistic authenticity scores.

## Limitations

- Reliance on Reddit data may not represent broader depression population
- Heavy dependence on human expert evaluations without clear inter-rater reliability metrics
- Vague comparison methodology with GPT-4o lacking specific prompting details

## Confidence

High Confidence: The technical implementation of the structured alignment framework, including instruction-tuning and iterative preference optimization, is well-documented and methodologically sound based on the information provided.

Medium Confidence: Claims about Eeyore outperforming GPT-4o in linguistic authenticity and profile adherence are supported by human expert evaluations, though the evaluation details are limited.

Low Confidence: The broader implications and potential applications of a depression-specific simulation model are not adequately addressed, including ethical considerations and real-world deployment scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the Reddit-derived dataset for demographic representation and potential biases, including analysis of user characteristics, depression severity distribution, and conversational context diversity.

2. Implement a blind evaluation study with multiple independent clinical psychology experts to assess Eeyore's outputs, measuring inter-rater reliability and comparing results against established depression communication assessment tools.

3. Perform a systematic error analysis comparing Eeyore's outputs against clinically validated depression communication patterns, identifying specific scenarios where the model succeeds or fails in maintaining authentic depression simulation while avoiding harmful stereotypes or misrepresentations.
