# The Use of the Simplex Architecture to Enhance Safety in Deep-Learning-Powered Autonomous Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21014
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a hypervisor-based architecture that isolates untrustworthy AI components from safety-critical functions using a Simplex-inspired safety monitor.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses safety, security, and predictability challenges in deep learning-powered autonomous systems by proposing a hypervisor-based architecture that isolates untrustworthy AI components from safety-critical functions. The core method employs two execution domains managed by a real-time hypervisor, with a Simplex-inspired safety monitor that can switch to a simpler backup controller when AI behavior becomes untrustworthy. The architecture was implemented on an AMD Zynq Ultrascale+ platform for two use cases: controlling a Furuta pendulum and enabling autonomous navigation for an AgileX Scout Mini rover. Experimental results demonstrated effective fault tolerance - the safety monitor successfully prevented unsafe behavior in both systems by switching to backup controllers when needed. The inter-domain communication introduced minimal overhead (typically under 10 microseconds), and both implementations met their real-time deadlines while maintaining system safety even under simulated cyber-attacks or unexpected obstacles.

## Method Summary
The architecture employs a type-1 real-time hypervisor (CLARE) to partition execution into two isolated domains: a safe domain running an RTOS with safety-critical functions, and a rich domain running Linux with neural network frameworks. The safety monitor continuously evaluates system state against precomputed safety criteria (ROA membership for the pendulum, distance thresholds for the rover) and triggers controller switching when necessary. For the Furuta pendulum, a Lyapunov-based ROA estimation provides the safety boundary, while the rover uses LiDAR-defined safety zones. Both systems use neural networks for high-performance control but can fall back to simpler, verified controllers when safety is compromised. The approach was validated on physical hardware with successful fault tolerance demonstrations.

## Key Results
- Safety monitor successfully prevented unsafe behavior in both Furuta pendulum and rover systems by switching to backup controllers when needed
- Inter-domain communication introduced minimal overhead (typically under 10 microseconds) without compromising real-time deadlines
- Architecture maintained system safety under simulated cyber-attacks and unexpected obstacles
- Both implementations met their real-time deadlines while demonstrating effective fault tolerance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spatial-Temporal Isolation via Type-1 Hypervisor
- **Claim:** Partitioning execution into isolated "safe" and "rich" domains prevents faults in the untrusted neural network stack from compromising safety-critical functions.
- **Mechanism:** A type-1 real-time hypervisor (CLARE) statically partitions CPU cores, memory banks, and device access between two VMs. The safe domain runs an RTOS with guaranteed timing; the rich domain runs Linux with neural network frameworks. Inter-domain communication uses shared memory buffers with bounded latency.
- **Core assumption:** The hypervisor itself is trustworthy and correctly enforces isolation; timing bounds on inter-domain communication hold under load.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "isolated through a type-1 real-time hypervisor with fast inter-domain communication"
  - [Section 3] Describes CLARE-Hypervisor managing two VMs with exclusive resource assignment and cache partitioning
  - [corpus] "Towards Safe Path Tracking Using the Simplex Architecture" similarly applies Simplex with safety/performance separation
- **Break condition:** Hypervisor misconfiguration (e.g., shared cache not partitioned), hardware-level side channels, or inter-domain latency exceeding control loop deadlines.

### Mechanism 2: Simplex-Based Runtime Safety Switching
- **Claim:** A safety monitor can reliably detect when the neural controller's behavior risks system safety and trigger a fallback to a verified safe controller.
- **Mechanism:** The safety monitor continuously evaluates system state against a precomputed safety criterion (e.g., ROA membership for the pendulum, distance thresholds for the rover). When violated, control authority transfers to the safe controller, which is designed to recover the system to a known-safe state.
- **Core assumption:** The safety criterion is conservative enough to avoid false negatives; the safe controller can recover from any state the monitor permits; switch latency is fast enough to prevent state escape.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor that oversees system state and switches to a simpler backup module when necessary"
  - [Section 4.2] "As soon as the current state exits R, the safety monitor switches to the safe controller"
  - [corpus] HALO architecture similarly uses redundant safety modules with failover
- **Break condition:** Safety criterion has false negatives (classifying unsafe states as safe); safe controller cannot recover from boundary states; switching delay allows state to exit recoverable region.

### Mechanism 3: Conservative Approximation of Recoverable State Regions
- **Claim:** For systems with known dynamics, Lyapunov-based ROA estimation provides a mathematically grounded boundary for when the safe controller can guarantee recovery.
- **Mechanism:** The ROA is approximated as an ellipsoid R = {x | x^T P x < 1} where P is optimized for maximal volume. A smaller "safe subset" S ⊂ R triggers return to high-performance control only when well within recoverable territory.
- **Core assumption:** System dynamics model is sufficiently accurate; ROA under-approximation is conservative enough to handle modeling errors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.2] "ROA of a non-linear system cannot be computed in closed form... estimated numerically... R = {x | x^T P x < 1} ⊂ ROA"
  - [Section 4.2] "With a 5% variation and a grid size of 0.05 in the state space we found no false positives"
  - [corpus] Control barrier function approaches (e.g., "Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions") offer alternative formal safety bounds
- **Break condition:** Model mismatch larger than tested; unmodeled disturbances push state outside true ROA before switch; high-dimensional systems where ellipsoid approximation is too loose.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Lyapunov Stability and Region of Asymptotic Attraction (ROA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The pendulum safety monitor relies on ROA estimation to determine recoverable states. Without understanding Lyapunov functions, you cannot verify or tune the safety boundary.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a candidate Lyapunov function V(x), what condition guarantees that a state x is inside the ROA?

- **Concept: Type-1 Hypervisor Isolation (Spatial and Temporal Partitioning)**
  - **Why needed here:** The architecture's security claim depends on the hypervisor correctly isolating the rich domain from the safe domain. Understanding partitioning mechanisms helps debug cross-domain interference.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between a Type-1 hypervisor and a Type-2 hypervisor, and why does the paper insist on Type-1?

- **Concept: Simplex Architecture Components**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper extends Simplex to learning-based controllers. You need to understand the original three-component structure (high-performance controller, safe controller, safety monitor) to adapt it.
  - **Quick check question:** In a Simplex architecture, what happens if the safety monitor itself fails?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Safe VM: RTOS (Erika3 or minimal Linux), safety monitor, safe controller, sensing/actuation interfaces, telemetry
  - Rich VM: Linux with neural network framework (Caffe/PyTorch), high-performance controller, camera/secondary sensors
  - CLARE Hypervisor: Static resource partitioning, inter-domain shared memory buffers (CABs), optional security monitoring
  - Safety Monitor: State machine comparing system state against ROA (pendulum) or safety zones (rover); triggers controller switch

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sense → 2. Safe VM receives state → 3. State sent to Rich VM → 4. Neural inference → 5. Output returned to Safe VM → 6. Safety monitor evaluates → 7. Actuation command sent
  - **Latency budget:** End-to-end must fit within control period (4ms for pendulum, 100ms for rover). Paper reports max 3.98ms for pendulum, ~10µs inter-domain overhead for rover.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **ROA conservativeness vs performance:** Tighter S region (lower Θs) means more time in safe controller, less neural controller utilization
  - **Control period vs inference time:** Faster rates improve stability but reduce time for neural inference
  - **Device partitioning:** Assigning sensors to safe domain increases safety but may starve rich domain of data

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Frequent false switches:** Safety criterion too aggressive; Θs threshold may need adjustment
  - **Missed deadline detection:** Safety monitor should detect stale neural outputs (port freshness check)
  - **Collision despite safety zones:** Zone thresholds don't account for braking distance at max velocity

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Latency characterization:** Measure round-trip inter-domain communication and neural inference time under load; verify headroom below control period
  2. **ROA boundary stress test:** Inject disturbances at increasing distances from equilibrium to validate switch timing before state exits recoverable region
  3. **Simulated attack on rich domain:** Modify neural network output (as in Section 5.4 "simulated attack") and verify safe controller correctly overrides unsafe commands

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of FPGA-accelerated deep neural networks affect the power consumption and real-time latency guarantees of the proposed dual-domain architecture?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "The role of heterogeneous hardware for neural network acceleration" and "Benchmarking the real-time and power properties" as key directions for future work.
- Why unresolved: The case studies utilized shallow networks executed on CPUs; the overhead of managing accelerated hardware (FPGAs) within the isolated domains remains unmeasured.
- What evidence would resolve it: A performance analysis of the architecture running complex visual models (e.g., object detection) on the FPGA, measuring end-to-end latency and power draw.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the safety monitor effectively detect and mitigate physical adversarial attacks targeting the visual perception components of the system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes future work will investigate "Evaluating the robustness of visual perception models" and using detection algorithms as triggers for the safety monitor.
- Why unresolved: The current rover implementation relies on LiDAR-defined safety zones and does not validate the system's resilience against adversarial patches or visual spoofing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results subjecting the camera-based high-performance controller to physical adversarial attacks to verify if the monitor triggers a safe fallback.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the omission of one-step-ahead state prediction in the safety monitor compromise the stability guarantees for high-dynamic systems like the Furuta pendulum?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.2 states that formal stability requires simulating the state one step ahead, but this was "ignored" due to resource constraints and never occurred during testing.
- Why unresolved: While empirically stable, the architecture lacks a formal proof that the high-performance controller cannot drive the system into an unrecoverable state in a single time step.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal verification or stress-test of the Furuta pendulum controller showing state evolution relative to the Region of Asymptotic Attraction (ROA) boundary without prediction.

## Limitations
- Architecture requires significant static configuration and cannot adapt to changing system conditions
- Safety guarantees depend on accurate system models, which may not hold in unstructured environments
- Commercial nature of the CLARE hypervisor limits reproducibility of the exact implementation

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The experimental demonstration of fault tolerance on the Furuta pendulum and rover systems is well-documented. The inter-domain communication overhead measurements (typically under 10 microseconds) and real-time deadline compliance are directly measurable outcomes.

**Medium confidence:** The safety claims depend heavily on the correctness of the hypervisor configuration and the conservatism of the ROA estimation. While the paper reports successful operation, the security model assumes a correctly configured hypervisor without addressing potential hardware-level attacks or misconfigurations that could compromise isolation.

**Low confidence:** The generalizability of the approach to more complex autonomous systems with higher-dimensional state spaces and uncertain dynamics is not demonstrated. The ROA estimation method relies on Lyapunov function analysis that becomes increasingly difficult for complex systems.

## Next Checks

1. Stress-test the ROA boundary estimation by introducing unmodeled disturbances at increasing distances from the equilibrium point
2. Measure inter-domain communication latency under varying CPU loads to verify timing bounds hold under realistic operating conditions
3. Conduct penetration testing on the hypervisor configuration to identify potential isolation bypass vectors
