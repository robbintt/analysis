# The Procrustean Bed of Time Series: The Optimization Bias of Point-wise Loss

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.18610
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18610
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Standard point-wise losses (MSE, MAE) implicitly assume independence among time steps, leading to an optimization bias that penalizes more deterministic processes more severely. The authors propose a principled debiasing program using sequence length reduction, structural orthogonalization (DFT/DWT), and harmonized ℓp norms, achieving 5.2% MSE and 5.1% MAE improvements on 11 datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a fundamental flaw in standard point-wise loss functions for time series modeling: they implicitly assume independence among time steps, disregarding the inherent temporal structure. This leads to an optimization bias that penalizes more deterministic processes more severely. The authors formalize this "Optimization Bias" and derive its lower bound as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true joint distribution and the factorized distribution assumed by point-wise losses. They show this lower bound is governed by sequence length and Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR), with more deterministic series suffering greater bias. To address this, the authors propose a principled debiasing program involving sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization, implemented using DFT or DWT, along with a harmonized ℓp norm framework to improve optimization robustness for high-variance sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains across various architectures and tasks.

## Method Summary
The method involves transforming time series data into an orthogonal domain (DFT or DWT) to decorrelate components, then applying a harmonized ℓp norm loss that scales each component by its exponentially moving average (EMA) magnitude. This loss replaces the standard temporal MSE/MAE during training. The framework consists of: 1) EOB theoretical core formalizing bias as KL divergence, 2) quantification module linking EOB to SSNR and sequence length, 3) debiasing pipeline with orthogonal transforms and harmonized norms, and 4) integration as a plug-and-play loss function. The harmonized loss uses hyperparameters γ (scaling factor) and β (EMA smoothing) to balance gradient dominance and fatigue.

## Key Results
- Standard point-wise losses induce optimization bias formalized as KL divergence between true joint distribution and factorized approximation
- Non-deterministic EOB lower bound governed by sequence length T and Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR)
- Proposed debiasing approach achieves 5.2% MSE and 5.1% MAE improvements on 11 datasets
- Consistent gains across various architectures including iTransformer, Transformer, MLP, and CNN

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Point-wise loss functions (e.g., MSE, MAE) implicitly impose a factorized (i.i.d.) distribution assumption that conflicts with the true joint distribution of time series, inducing an optimization bias formalized as KL divergence. The expectation of optimization bias (EOB) is defined as the KL divergence between the true joint distribution p(x₁:ᵀ) and the factorized approximation q(x₁:ᵀ) = ∏ₜ p(xₜ) assumed by point-wise losses. This bias accumulates because the loss ignores temporal dependencies captured by the true conditional structure p(xₜ|x₁:ₜ₋₁). Core assumption: Covariance-stationarity and Gaussianity for closed-form quantification; independence between deterministic and stochastic components. Evidence anchors: [abstract] formalizing EOB information-theoretically; [section 2.1] Eq. (3) decomposing log-likelihood; [corpus] Patch-wise Structural Loss corroborating independence issue. Break condition: If the time series is genuinely i.i.d. (white noise), the factorization becomes valid and EOB→0.

### Mechanism 2
The non-deterministic EOB lower bound is governed exclusively by sequence length T and the Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR), defined as total variance divided by one-step-ahead prediction error variance. For Gaussian, covariance-stationary processes, the non-deterministic EOB equals -½ log |R| (Eq. 10), where |R| is the correlation matrix determinant. This links to T and SSNR via |R|^(1/T) → 1/SSNR (Lemma D.1), yielding asymptotic form (T/2) log(SSNR) + c. Core assumption: Gaussianity and stationarity; linear or linearizable dynamics for closed-form; SSNR > 1 for non-trivial bias. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR)"; [section 2.2.2] Proposition 2.5 giving E[B_z] = -½ log |R|; [corpus] RI-Loss critiques point-wise error computation but lacks same formalization. Break condition: If SSNR = 1 (e.g., perfectly orthogonalized/whitened data), the per-step bias vanishes and EOB depends only on finite-horizon constants.

### Mechanism 3
Structural orthogonalization (e.g., via DFT or DWT) plus harmonized ℓp norms can mitigate optimization bias and gradient pathologies. Orthogonal transforms decorrelate components, reducing SSNR toward 1 in the transformed domain. DFT/DWT provide approximate orthogonal decomposition with O(L log L)/O(L) complexity. The harmonized ℓp norm (Eqs. 21–22) uses EMA-based component magnitude scaling to balance gradient dominance (ℓ₂) and fatigue (ℓ₁). Core assumption: Orthogonal transform approximately diagonalizes the temporal covariance; EMA provides stable magnitude estimates; γ, β chosen to avoid numerical instability. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "principled debiasing program involving sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization"; [section 5] DFT/DWT characteristics and harmonized norm definitions; [corpus] COGNOS uses constrained Gaussian-noise optimization to address MSE flaws but not orthogonalization. Break condition: If original series has non-stationary dynamics not captured by global DFT, DWT may perform better; extremely non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed data may violate EMA stability assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: KL divergence and mutual information
  - **Why needed here**: The paper formalizes EOB as KL divergence between joint and factorized distributions, and uses mutual information to bound the bias.
  - **Quick check question**: If two distributions are identical, what is their KL divergence? (Answer: Zero.)

- **Concept**: Autoregressive (AR) models and correlation matrix determinant
  - **Why needed here**: The AR(p) model provides a tractable way to connect SSNR to the correlation matrix structure, enabling closed-form EOB quantification.
  - **Quick check question**: For an AR(1) process with coefficient φ, does increasing |φ| increase or decrease |R|? (Answer: Decrease, because stronger autocorrelation leads to more singular correlation matrix.)

- **Concept**: Unitary/orthogonal transforms (DFT, DWT) and Parseval's theorem
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding that unitary transforms preserve energy but not ℓp norms for p ≠ 2, which is why ℓ₂ alone is insufficient for debiasing.
  - **Quick check question**: Does applying a unitary transform change the Euclidean distance between two vectors? (Answer: No, by definition of unitarity.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: EOB Theoretical Core -> Quantification Module (AR/MGM models) -> Debiasing Pipeline (DFT/DWT + Harmonized ℓp) -> Integration (plug-and-play loss function)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Measure/estimate SSNR and T on your dataset to gauge potential bias magnitude
  2. Choose DFT (global, non-stationary-challenged) or DWT (localized, more robust to non-stationarity) based on data characteristics
  3. Implement harmonized ℓp loss with EMA (β) and scaling (γ); start with γ=0.5, β=0.3 as in experiments
  4. Train model using only L_Harm,ℓp (exclude temporal MSE), then invert transform for predictions

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **DFT vs DWT**: DFT is simpler and faster (O(L log L)) but assumes global stationarity; DWT (O(L)) handles non-stationarity and local patterns better
  - **ℓ₁ vs ℓ₂ base norm**: ℓ₂ (hMSE) emphasizes gradient dominance correction; ℓ₁ (hMAE) addresses gradient fatigue and is more robust to outliers
  - **Harmonization parameters**: Larger γ increases correction strength but may destabilize training; smaller β makes EMA more responsive but noisier

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Gradient explosion**: Occurs if γ is too large or EMA denominators near zero (add ε as in Eq. 21)
  - **No improvement**: Check if original series already has low SSNR (e.g., near-white noise) or if transform choice mismatches data non-stationarity
  - **Numerical instability in phase gradients**: When using separate amplitude/phase losses with ℓp norms, small amplitudes cause division-by-near-zero (avoid by using real/imaginary components or error amplitude/phase with harmonized norms)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline EOB estimation**: On a synthetic AR(1) process with known φ, compute theoretical EOB via Eq. (7) and compare with empirical D_KL estimated from samples
  2. **Debiasing ablation**: Train a Transformer (e.g., iTransformer) on a dataset (e.g., ETTh1) with three losses: standard MSE, DFT+MSE, and DFT+hMSE. Report MSE/MAE and inefficiency ratio η
  3. **SSNR sensitivity**: Generate synthetic data with varying SSNR (by changing deterministic sinusoidal amplitude) and fixed T; plot actual vs. optimal MSE and η to verify paradigm paradox (higher SSNR → higher η)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB) theory be generalized to non-stationary processes through a piecewise stationary framework? Basis in paper: [explicit] Section F.3 identifies "Non-stationarity" as a theoretical limitation and suggests "piecewise stationary framework" and "change-point detection" as future work. Why unresolved: Current derivation relies on covariance-stationarity to formulate SSNR and correlation matrix determinant |R|. What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of EOB bounds for processes with time-varying statistics or empirical results validating debiasing on non-stationary segments identified by change-point detection.

### Open Question 2
How does the quantification of EOB change for processes governed by heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian innovations (e.g., Lévy stable distributions)? Basis in paper: [explicit] Section F.3 notes current analysis is predicated on "Gaussianity" and suggests future work could incorporate "Lévy skew α-stable" or "Middleton's class" models. Why unresolved: Closed-form EOB formula depends on Gaussian distribution properties; non-Gaussian distributions introduce complex dependence structures not captured by standard correlation metrics. What evidence would resolve it: Analytical bounds for EOB in systems with impulsive noise, or experiments testing if structural orthogonalization remains robust under heavy-tailed innovation noise.

### Open Question 3
Does the debiasing program effectively mitigate manifold collapse or statistical deviation in conditional time series synthesis tasks? Basis in paper: [inferred] Section F.2.1 and F.2.2 theoretically classify "Conditional Synthesis" as a manifold-based task suffering from EOB, yet experimental validation (Section 6) is restricted to forecasting and imputation. Why unresolved: Paper theoretically links EOB to deviation of synthesized data characteristics but lacks empirical evidence on generative models. What evidence would resolve it: Application of Harmonized ℓp norm to generative architecture (e.g., diffusion or VAE), evaluated using diversity and fidelity metrics against standard MSE baseline.

### Open Question 4
Is there an optimal, SSNR-dependent configuration for the harmonization factor γ and smoothing factor β in the Harmonized ℓp norm? Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper sets γ=0.5 and β=0.3 as fixed constants in experimental setup without providing theoretical justification for optimality across varying data properties. Why unresolved: Weights w_k are dynamically updated, but interaction between hyperparameters and data's SSNR is uncharacterized. What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis demonstrating relationship between (γ, β) values, SSNR levels, and optimization convergence stability.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework relies heavily on Gaussianity and covariance-stationarity assumptions, which may not hold for many real-world time series
- The harmonized ℓp framework introduces hyperparameters (γ, β) that require careful tuning without systematic selection guidance
- The choice between DFT and DWT lacks clear selection criteria, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism linking point-wise losses to optimization bias through KL divergence is theoretically sound and well-supported by information theory principles. The empirical improvements (5.2% MSE, 5.1% MAE) on 11 datasets are substantial and consistently reported across different architectures.

**Medium Confidence**: The SSNR-based quantification provides useful intuition but depends on the AR model assumption and may not generalize to highly non-linear processes. The choice between DFT and DWT lacks clear selection criteria, potentially affecting reproducibility.

**Low Confidence**: The asymptotic analysis showing EOB → -∞ for highly deterministic processes relies on Gaussianity and stationarity, which may not reflect practical scenarios where other pathologies dominate.

## Next Checks

1. **Non-Gaussian Validation**: Test EOB quantification on synthetic time series with heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Student's t) to assess robustness beyond Gaussian assumptions.

2. **Non-Stationary Assessment**: Apply the framework to time series with structural breaks or regime shifts to evaluate how well the correlation matrix-based SSNR captures temporal dependencies in non-stationary contexts.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary γ and β across multiple datasets to determine optimal ranges and identify conditions where harmonization parameters become critical for performance.
