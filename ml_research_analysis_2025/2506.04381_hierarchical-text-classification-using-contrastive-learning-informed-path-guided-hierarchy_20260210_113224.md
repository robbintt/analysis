# Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: HTC-CLIP achieves 0.99-2.37% improvement in Macro F1 scores over state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of categorizing text into labels organized in a structured hierarchy through Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC). The proposed method, HTC-CLIP, innovatively combines contrastive learning with path-guided hierarchy to improve HTC performance. By learning two complementary classifiers—one using contrastive learning for hierarchy-aware text representation and another using path-guided hierarchy—the approach aims to capture both local and global hierarchical relationships. During inference, outputs from both classifiers are pooled to produce final predictions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes HTC-CLIP, which combines contrastive learning with path-guided hierarchy to improve hierarchical text classification performance. The method learns two complementary classifiers—one using contrastive learning for hierarchy-aware text representation and another using path-guided hierarchy. During inference, it pools outputs from both classifiers. Experiments on WOS and NYT datasets show HTC-CLIP achieves 0.99-2.37% improvement in Macro F1 scores over state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining these approaches.

## Key Results
- HTC-CLIP achieves 0.99-2.37% improvement in Macro F1 scores over state-of-the-art models
- Experiments conducted on WOS and NYT datasets demonstrate effectiveness
- Method combines contrastive learning with path-guided hierarchy for hierarchy-aware text representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's mechanism works by explicitly leveraging contrastive learning to capture hierarchy-aware text representations while simultaneously using path-guided hierarchy to ensure label relationships are preserved. The dual-classifier approach allows the model to capture complementary information: contrastive learning helps in distinguishing between similar hierarchical categories, while path-guided hierarchy ensures the structural relationships between labels are maintained. The pooling of both classifiers' outputs during inference creates a more robust prediction mechanism that benefits from both approaches.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Contrastive Learning** - why needed: To learn hierarchy-aware text representations by pulling similar instances together and pushing dissimilar ones apart
   - quick check: Verify if the contrastive loss effectively separates hierarchical levels

2. **Path-Guided Hierarchy** - why needed: To ensure structural relationships between labels are preserved during classification
   - quick check: Confirm path information is correctly encoded in the hierarchy representation

3. **Macro F1 Score** - why needed: To evaluate classification performance across all hierarchical levels equally
   - quick check: Ensure F1 scores are calculated correctly for each hierarchy level

4. **HTC (Hierarchical Text Classification)** - why needed: To categorize text into labels organized in a structured hierarchy
   - quick check: Verify hierarchy structure is properly defined in datasets

5. **Pooling Strategy** - why needed: To combine outputs from two complementary classifiers effectively
   - quick check: Test different pooling methods (e.g., averaging, weighted sum) for optimal performance

6. **Text Representation Learning** - why needed: To convert raw text into meaningful hierarchical representations
   - quick check: Validate that learned representations capture semantic and hierarchical information

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Text Input -> Encoder -> Contrastive Classifier & Path-Guided Classifier -> Pooling Layer -> Final Prediction

**Critical Path:**
Text Input → Encoder → Both Classifiers → Pooling → Final Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Using two classifiers increases computational overhead but provides complementary information
- Pooling strategy choice affects final performance and requires careful tuning
- Balance between contrastive learning strength and path-guided hierarchy importance

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on lower hierarchy levels may indicate path-guided hierarchy weakness
- Degradation in overall F1 scores could suggest contrastive learning is not capturing hierarchy effectively
- Computational bottlenecks during inference due to dual-classifier approach

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate individual classifier performance before combining them
2. Test different pooling strategies (averaging, weighted sum, max) to find optimal combination
3. Conduct ablation study to quantify contribution of each component to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to only two datasets (WOS and NYT), restricting generalizability
- Evaluation focuses solely on Macro F1 scores, potentially missing other performance aspects
- Computational overhead of maintaining two classifiers during inference not thoroughly discussed
- Reported improvements of 0.99-2.37% represent relatively modest gains that may be sensitive to implementation details

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology combining contrastive learning with path-guided hierarchy is technically sound and well-motivated
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements are likely accurate for the tested datasets but may not generalize to other domains
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this is the first method to explicitly leverage contrastive learning for hierarchy-aware text representation in HTC

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's performance on additional hierarchical datasets beyond WOS and NYT to establish broader generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of contrastive learning versus path-guided hierarchy components
3. Evaluate the model's scalability and computational efficiency on deeper hierarchies with more levels than those tested in the current study
