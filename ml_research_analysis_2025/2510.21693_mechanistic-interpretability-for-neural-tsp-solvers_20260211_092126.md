# Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural TSP Solvers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21693
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: First application of sparse autoencoders to reveal interpretable geometric features in transformer-based neural TSP solvers

## Executive Summary
This work introduces the first application of mechanistic interpretability techniques to neural solvers for combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the black-box nature of transformer-based models on the Traveling Salesman Problem. By attaching sparse autoencoders to a pointer-network TSP solver trained with reinforcement learning, the authors discover interpretable features that activate on geometric patterns such as convex-hull boundaries, dense clusters, and linear separators. The SAE learns an overcomplete, sparse dictionary from encoder activations, revealing that the model develops human-aligned geometric reasoning without explicit supervision. An interactive feature explorer enables qualitative analysis. While findings are correlational and limited to 100-node uniform instances, the study lays groundwork for transparent, trustworthy hybrid systems combining neural speed with algorithmic interpretability in operations research.

## Method Summary
The study trains a pointer-network TSP solver using reinforcement learning, then applies sparse autoencoders to the encoder's residual activations to discover interpretable geometric features. The RL4CO implementation trains the model with REINFORCE, achieving ~99% optimality against Concorde on uniform 100-node instances. Encoder activations from 100,000 inference passes are collected and processed by a top-k SAE with expansion=4, k-ratio=0.1, and ℓ1=0.001 regularization. The SAE learns an overcomplete dictionary that decomposes activations into interpretable geometric patterns. Features are qualitatively analyzed through visualization overlays on instance graphs.

## Key Results
- Sparse autoencoders discover interpretable geometric features in TSP solver encoder activations
- Features align with human geometric reasoning: convex hull boundaries, dense clusters, linear separators
- Interactive feature explorer enables qualitative analysis of discovered patterns
- Findings remain correlational without causal intervention experiments
- Results limited to 100-node uniform instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The transformer-based TSP solver learns to represent geometric relationships through its attention mechanisms during reinforcement learning. The sparse autoencoder provides an overcomplete dictionary that can decompose these high-dimensional encoder activations into interpretable features. By enforcing sparsity through ℓ1 regularization and top-k activation selection, the SAE learns to extract the most salient geometric patterns that correlate with the solver's decision-making process. The resulting features reflect how the neural model internally represents spatial relationships between nodes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: Overcomplete linear autoencoders with sparsity constraints that learn interpretable feature dictionaries from activations
  - Why needed: Standard autoencoders produce dense, uninterpretable features; SAEs force sparse, human-readable representations
  - Quick check: Monitor reconstruction error and feature activation histograms during training

- **Pointer Networks**: Sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanism that can output discrete pointers to input elements
  - Why needed: Standard seq2-seq fails on variable-length outputs; pointer mechanism directly selects input positions
  - Quick check: Verify pointer distribution sums to 1 across candidate nodes

- **REINFORCE**: Policy gradient method that directly optimizes expected reward without differentiable loss
  - Why needed: TSP tour length is non-differentiable; REINFORCE handles discrete action spaces
  - Quick check: Track policy entropy to ensure sufficient exploration

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** TSP Instance → Node Features → Encoder → Residual Stream → SAE → Interpretable Features

**Critical Path:** Input coordinates → RL training → Encoder activations → SAE training → Feature visualization

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study trades computational complexity (100,000 inference passes for SAE training) for interpretability gains. Using an overcomplete SAE expansion factor of 4 increases feature diversity but requires careful sparsity regularization to avoid noise.

**Failure Signatures:**
- High SAE reconstruction error (>1%) indicates poor feature learning
- Polysemantic features (activating on multiple geometric patterns) suggest inadequate sparsity
- Solver performance degradation during SAE analysis may indicate interference with model weights

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify TSP solver achieves ~99% optimality on held-out uniform instances
2. Train SAE with minimal configuration and check basic reconstruction capability
3. Visualize top-5 features on 10 instances to confirm geometric patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Do the discovered geometric features causally determine node selection, or are they merely correlational byproducts of the encoder's processing? The analysis currently relies on correlational overlays without causal intervention experiments like activation patching.

**Open Question 2:** Do the identified geometric features persist when the solver is trained on larger instances (e.g., N=500) or non-uniform distributions (e.g., clustered, ring)? The study limits claims to 100-node uniform instances, leaving generalization uncertain.

**Open Question 3:** Are the interpretable features robust to changes in SAE hyperparameters (expansion factor, sparsity) and RL training seeds? The study uses a specific configuration without verifying feature stability across different settings.

## Limitations

- Findings remain correlational without causal intervention experiments to verify feature importance
- Results limited to uniform 100-node instances, leaving generalization to other distributions uncertain
- Unknown encoder architecture details (embedding dimension, layer count) necessary for exact reproduction
- Unspecified SAE training hyperparameters that could affect feature quality

## Confidence

**Medium confidence** in core claims about interpretable geometric feature discovery, constrained by correlational analysis, limited scope to uniform instances, and missing architectural details.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies by masking top geometric features during inference to measure impact on solution quality and verify causal relevance
2. Train and analyze SAEs on non-uniform TSP distributions (e.g., clustered, Gaussian) to assess feature generalization beyond uniform squares
3. Implement the identified geometric features as explicit inductive biases in a traditional TSP solver and compare performance against the neural approach
