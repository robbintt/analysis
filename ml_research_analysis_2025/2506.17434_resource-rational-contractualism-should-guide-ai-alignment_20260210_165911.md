- LLMs can approximate ideal contractualist moral solutions by dynamically selecting reasoning strategies based on case difficulty and stakes

## Executive Summary
Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC) is proposed as an AI alignment framework that approximates ideal contractualist solutions by selecting among cognitively-inspired, normatively-grounded heuristics based on available resources. Instead of implementing the computationally intensive ideal (e.g., full stakeholder negotiation), RRC suggests models use simpler strategies like rule-following when appropriate and switch to more complex reasoning (e.g., simulated bargaining) for novel or high-stakes cases. An experiment with four prompting strategies (minimal, rule-based, simulated bargaining, and RRC) demonstrated that RRC-guided models trade off accuracy and effort effectively: they use few tokens for easy cases (achieving high accuracy) but increase computation for hard cases requiring nuanced moral judgment. RRC thus enables efficient, adaptable alignment that can interpret human rules, respond to changing contexts, and support human decision-making while maintaining bounded steerability.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated whether LLMs could approximate ideal contractualist moral solutions by dynamically selecting between low-compute heuristics (rule-following) and high-compute reasoning (simulated bargaining) based on case difficulty. Four prompting strategies were compared on two test sets: 130 human-centric vignettes from cognitive science literature and 240 AI agent scenarios (120 easy, 120 hard) synthetically generated. Gold labels were established by authors based on "mutual benefit" outcomes. Models (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, OpenAI o3, OpenAI o4-mini) were prompted via inference-time templates to either provide minimal binary answers, apply rules, simulate stakeholder bargaining, or use RRC meta-reasoning to select between rule-based or bargaining approaches. Accuracy (matching gold labels) and effort (output token count) were measured.

## Key Results
- RRC-guided models effectively trade off accuracy and effort: using few tokens for easy cases while achieving high accuracy, but increasing computation for hard cases requiring nuanced moral judgment
- RRC struck a middle ground, using rule-based approaches on easy cases but selecting simulated bargaining for hard cases
- Simulated bargaining achieved nearly perfect performance on both test sets
- RRC achieved the goal of high accuracy on both easy/hard cases while using significantly fewer tokens on easy cases compared to full simulated bargaining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Models can be steered to dynamically select reasoning strategies based on case characteristics, trading off computational cost against accuracy.
- Mechanism: A meta-reasoning prompt instructs the model to first classify case difficulty (usual/unusual, low/high stakes), then select either rule-based or simulated bargaining strategies accordingly. This creates conditional compute allocation: simple cases get fast heuristic processing, complex cases trigger expensive stakeholder simulation.
- Core assumption: Models can reliably assess case difficulty and stakes from the vignette alone without external calibration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RRC-guided models trade off accuracy and effort effectively: they use few tokens for easy cases... but increase computation for hard cases"
  - [section 4.2] "The RRC Approach strikes a middle ground: it tends to use the rule-based approach... on the easy cases, but more often selects the compute-intensive simulated bargaining approach when the cases were hard"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work on game-theoretic priors (arXiv:2509.21873) suggests structured priors improve prediction, but no direct RRC validation exists in corpus.
- Break condition: When case difficulty classification fails (ambiguous stakes, novel domains not in training distribution), RRC may over-compute simple cases or under-compute complex ones.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Simulated bargaining approximates ideal contractualist agreements by modeling stakeholder consent under idealized conditions.
- Mechanism: The model enumerates affected parties, generates possible actions including creative solutions, then simulates rational negotiation assuming perfect information, unlimited time, and no precedent constraints. The negotiated outcome is treated as the moral answer.
- Core assumption: LLMs can accurately simulate diverse stakeholder preferences and rational bargaining dynamics without systematic bias toward certain value systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Virtual bargaining... involves simulating the relevant information that all the affected parties would bring to the bargain in a specific case"
  - [section 4.2] "The Simulated Bargaining Approach achieved nearly perfect performance on both test sets"
  - [corpus] No corpus validation; this is a proposed mechanism without external experimental grounding.
- Break condition: When stakeholders have incommensurable values, power imbalances, or when the model lacks accurate priors about specific populations' preferences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rule-based reasoning serves as a cached approximation of contractualist outcomes for routine cases within the rule's design distribution.
- Mechanism: Rules encode pre-computed bargaining solutions. When cases fall within the rule's intended scope, applying the rule bypasses expensive simulation while preserving accuracy. Rules become unreliable for out-of-distribution cases where their underlying contractualist assumptions no longer hold.
- Core assumption: Human-created rules are generally designed as resource-rational approximations of contractualist agreements (an empirical claim about human norm-design).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "selecting an action by using cached action standards, or rules, is likely to be highly computationally efficient"
  - [section 5] "human-made rules are often designed to be understood in an RRC manner"
  - [corpus] Weak indirect support; arXiv:2512.15584 discusses alignment under uncertainty but doesn't validate rule-as-approximation.
- Break condition: When novel contexts make cached rules obsolete (emergency resolved, technology changed) or when rules were never contractualist in origin (coercive, arbitrary).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contractualist moral theory**
  - Why needed here: RRC's normative target is the agreement rational parties would reach. Without understanding contractualism (Scanlon, Rawls, Gauthier), engineers cannot evaluate whether approximations preserve the normative core or simply optimize for surface-level agreement.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why contractualism avoids the "domination problem" that the paper mentions, and how this differs from utilitarian aggregation?

- Concept: **Resource rationality (cognitive science)**
  - Why needed here: The framework depends on bounded rationality principles—that accuracy/effort tradeoffs are principled, not just practical. Engineers need this to distinguish RRC from simple caching.
  - Quick check question: If you doubled available compute, should an RRC system always use more expensive mechanisms? Why or why not?

- Concept: **Mechanism selection / meta-reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The core technical challenge is determining which approximation to deploy when. This requires understanding meta-level decision procedures, not just the object-level moral reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Given a novel case with moderate stakes and unusual features, what information would an RRC system need to select between rule-following and simulated bargaining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Case classifier: Assesses case difficulty, stakes, novelty (input: vignette + context → output: mechanism selection signal)
  - Rule retrieval: Matches case to applicable cached rules/norms (may be empty)
  - Stakeholder modeler: Generates preference models for affected parties (used by simulated bargaining)
  - Bargaining simulator: Runs negotiation process (high compute)
  - Output adjudicator: Converts mechanism outputs to action recommendations

- Critical path:
  1. Input vignette → Case classifier determines mechanism
  2a. If rule-appropriate: Rule retrieval → Apply rule → Output
  2b. If simulation-required: Stakeholder modeler → Bargaining simulator → Output
  3. Log mechanism used and compute spent for monitoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Granularity of case classification**: Coarse (easy/hard) vs. fine-grained (rule/virtual-bargaining/universalization/modeling-implied-valuation). Finer increases accuracy but raises meta-reasoning costs.
  - **Rule caching strategy**: Pre-compute rules via actual human bargaining vs. extract from existing legal/corporate codes. Former is principled but expensive; latter may inherit non-contractualist rules.
  - **Stakeholder simulation depth**: Full persona models vs. welfare-weights-only. Full models capture nuance but may introduce bias.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Over-computation**: RRC system uses simulated bargaining for routine cases (check: high token counts on easy cases in logs)
  - **Under-computation**: System applies inappropriate rules to novel high-stakes cases (check: low accuracy on hard cases)
  - **Stakeholder omission**: Simulation misses affected parties not explicitly mentioned in vignette (check: systematically different answers from human expert baselines)
  - **Rule drift**: Cached rules become stale as environment changes (check: periodic accuracy audits against fresh human bargaining data)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Mechanism selection calibration**: Vary case difficulty and stakes systematically; verify classifier selects cheaper mechanisms when appropriate. Success criterion: RRC matches or exceeds rule-based accuracy on easy cases while using <50% of simulated-bargaining compute.
  2. **Out-of-distribution detection**: Present cases where rules should not apply (emergencies resolved, parties changed); verify system escalates to simulation rather than misapplying rules. Success criterion: >90% escalation rate on synthetic OOD cases.
  3. **Stakeholder coverage audit**: Run simulated bargaining on cases with implicit stakeholders (future generations, non-human animals, AI agents); compare against human expert stakeholder enumeration. Success criterion: >80% overlap in identified stakeholders.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the space of RRC mechanisms be fully parameterized, and how can their resource demands and accuracy be explicitly modeled to enable optimal mechanism selection for any given case?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "future work is need[ed] to fully parameterize the space of mechanisms that could approximate the contractaulist ideal and then explicitly model their resource demands and accuracy to be able to select the optimally efficient mechanism for a given case."
- Why unresolved: The current experiment only tests two mechanisms (rule-based and simulated bargaining), but the framework proposes many others (e.g., universalization, welfare trade-off ratios, cached action standards) whose resource-accuracy trade-offs remain unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic empirical study measuring computational costs and accuracy across the full mechanism space on diverse moral scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there a causal connection between computational resource usage and accuracy in RRC-guided reasoning, or do other factors mediate this relationship?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "despite the fact that computational effort seemed to directly impact accuracy based on the reasoning mechanism selected... more work is needed to verify the causal connection between resource usage and accuracy."
- Why unresolved: The experiment showed correlation between token usage and accuracy, but did not manipulate resource availability directly to establish causation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments where compute budget is externally constrained, or where reasoning depth is systematically varied while holding other factors constant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How well does RRC prompting generalize to a broader range of moral trade-offs beyond the specific rule-violation-for-mutual-benefit structure tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "future work should use datasets that reflect a larger range of moral trade-offs, larger range of possible RRC mechanisms that can be selected, and cases that are representative of the distribution of situations that AI agents navigate."
- Why unresolved: The experimental vignettes all shared a similar structure (break rule for mutual benefit vs. follow rule), potentially limiting generalizability to the full spectrum of moral decisions AI agents face.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing RRC on diverse moral dilemmas (e.g., distributional fairness, harm trade-offs, deontological conflicts) and real-world AI deployment scenarios.

### Open Question 4
- Question: When should RRC-aligned systems deploy actual human bargaining versus simulated bargaining, and how can systems determine when to re-engage human stakeholders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "A central question for RRC alignment concerns several key determinations: first, when circumstances warrant the deployment of this resource-intensive 'actual bargaining' approach; second, what specific information must be collected and which negotiation procedures should be arranged; and third, how to effectively re-engage human stakeholders for their input."
- Why unresolved: The paper describes actual bargaining as crucial for novel, multi-party situations but provides no systematic criteria or decision procedure for when human input is required.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical work identifying features of cases where simulated vs. actual bargaining diverge, and development of meta-reasoning criteria for triggering human consultation.

## Limitations

- The framework critically depends on models reliably classifying case difficulty and stakes without external calibration, which remains an empirical question
- The claim that simulated bargaining approximates ideal contractualist agreements is largely theoretical with minimal empirical validation against actual human bargaining outcomes
- The assumption that human rules are generally designed as contractualist approximations is a strong empirical claim about human norm-design requiring systematic validation
- Performance on genuinely novel domains (AGI scenarios, non-human stakeholders) remains untested, as evaluation focused on familiar human-centric moral contexts

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The basic feasibility of meta-reasoning to select between computation strategies is well-supported by experimental results showing RRC achieves accuracy trade-offs between rule-based and simulated bargaining approaches.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that RRC enables efficient, adaptable alignment that can interpret human rules and respond to changing contexts is supported but depends on the strength of underlying assumptions about case classification and stakeholder modeling.

**Low Confidence:** The core normative claim that simulated bargaining approximates ideal contractualist agreements is largely theoretical, with minimal empirical validation against actual human bargaining outcomes or contractualist benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Stakeholder Coverage Validation:** Run simulated bargaining on cases with implicit stakeholders (future generations, non-human animals, AI agents) and compare against expert human stakeholder enumeration to measure systematic omissions.

2. **Out-of-Distribution Detection Calibration:** Systematically generate cases where rules should not apply (resolved emergencies, changed parties) and measure escalation rates to ensure RRC doesn't misapply cached rules to novel high-stakes scenarios.

3. **Case Classification Reliability:** Vary case difficulty and stakes systematically in controlled experiments to verify the classifier reliably selects cheaper mechanisms for appropriate cases, with success criterion of RRC matching or exceeding rule-based accuracy on easy cases while using less than 50% of simulated-bargaining compute.
