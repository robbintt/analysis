# AIDOVECL: AI-generated Dataset of Outpainted Vehicles for Eye-level Classification and Localization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.24116
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24116
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Up to 10% overall performance gain in vehicle detection, with 40-50% improvements for underrepresented classes via synthetic outpainting.

## Executive Summary
AIDOVECL addresses the scarcity of annotated, eye-level vehicle images for classification and localization by automatically generating synthetic scenes via outpainting. Vehicles are detected and cropped from real images, placed on larger canvases, and outpainted using prompt-guided diffusion models to create diverse backgrounds and annotations. Image quality is ensured through BRISQUE, CLIP-IQA, and QualiCLIP metrics. Ablation results show up to 10% overall performance gain across detection architectures, with improvements of up to 40% under diverse contexts and 50% for underrepresented classes. This approach effectively augments training data, improves robustness, and offers a scalable solution for building fine-grained datasets with reduced labeling effort.

## Method Summary
The AIDOVECL pipeline generates synthetic vehicle images through a multi-step process: (1) Extract vehicle seeds using an ensemble of pre-trained detectors (FCOS, RetinaNet) with consensus voting; (2) Place cropped vehicles on larger 512x512 canvases with random scaling and positioning, adding a 15% buffer around the vehicle; (3) Use Stable Diffusion Inpainting to generate backgrounds conditioned on structured prompts (location, time, season) and negative prompts (avoiding traffic, cars, trucks); (4) Filter outputs using BRISQUE (<20), CLIP-IQA (>0.5), and QualiCLIP (>0.85) metrics; (5) Calculate ground truth bounding boxes deterministically from canvas placement; (6) Train detection models (YOLOv8 variants) on the combined real and synthetic dataset for 1000 epochs.

## Key Results
- Up to 10% overall performance gain across detection architectures (YOLOv8 nano, m, l) when training with synthetic data
- 40% improvement in settings with greater diversity of context (Real/Aug. vs. Aug./Aug. testing)
- 50% higher true positives for underrepresented vehicle classes (e.g., vans) through class-balanced synthetic oversampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Decoupling via Synthetic Outpainting
Training on outpainted images improves detection robustness when inference contexts differ from the original training distribution. By retaining the vehicle "seed" pixels while replacing the background via diffusion-based outpainting, the model is forced to learn vehicle features independent of specific background correlations. This simulates distribution shift in a controlled manner, reducing overfitting to the original backgrounds of the real images.

### Mechanism 2: Class-Balanced Synthetic Oversampling
Synthetic augmentation yields disproportionate performance gains for underrepresented vehicle classes. The pipeline generates multiple unique instances (varying scale, position, background) from a single seed image of a rare class. This increases the effective sample count and variance for minority classes (e.g., "van" or "minibus") without requiring manual collection of new real-world data.

### Mechanism 3: Automated Annotation Preservation
Deterministic calculation of bounding boxes from canvas placement eliminates manual labeling costs while maintaining geometric accuracy. Since the seed image is placed on the canvas at a known coordinate and scale, the ground truth bounding box is calculated mathematically rather than annotated by a human. This ensures perfect alignment between the object pixels and the label.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for Inpainting/Outpainting**
  - **Why needed here:** The pipeline relies on Stable Diffusion (an LDM) to generate backgrounds. Users must understand that LDMs denoise latent representations conditioned on text prompts and image context, which determines how seamlessly the new background blends with the vehicle seed.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "masked area" (the seed) influence the generation of the "unmasked area" (the background) in an LDM?

- **Concept: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The pipeline filters out "bad" generations using BRISQUE, CLIP-IQA, and QualiCLIP without a human in the loop. Understanding what these metrics capture (naturalness vs. semantic alignment) is critical to debugging why valid images might be rejected or artifacts accepted.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might an image with perfect semantic alignment (correct vehicle class) still fail a BRISQUE quality check?

- **Concept: Object Detection Metrics (mAP, IoU)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper validates success using mAP50 and mAP50-95. Understanding the difference is vital: mAP50 tests basic localization, while mAP50-95 requires precise bounding box fitting—a key factor when evaluating if synthetic data trains "better" detectors.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model trained on synthetic data achieves higher Recall but lower Precision than a baseline, what does that imply about the synthetic data distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Seed Extractor -> Canvas Engine -> Outpainter -> Quality Gate -> Dataset Loader
- **Critical path:** The prompt engineering and mask blurring. If the negative prompt (e.g., "no traffic") fails, unannotated vehicles appear in the background, creating false negatives during training. If the mask isn't blurred, hard edges form between the vehicle and the generated background.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Realism vs. Diversity:** Aggressive scaling/positioning of seeds increases diversity but risks unrealistic vehicle sizes relative to the generated background.
  - **Throughput vs. Quality:** Setting strict QualiCLIP thresholds (>0.85) ensures high quality but requires more generation iterations per seed (30-60s/image), increasing compute costs.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Patchwork" Artifacts:** Visible seams or texture mismatches around the seed vehicle.
  - **Semantic Bleeding:** The model generates extra, unannotated vehicles because the negative prompt failed or the masked region was too small.
  - **Distorted Roads:** The background logic creates physically impossible road geometries.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Buffer Size:** Re-run seed extraction with 0% vs 15% vs 30% buffer to quantify the impact on edge artifacts in the outpainted result.
  2. **Prompt Sensitivity Test:** Generate 10 backgrounds for the same seed using fixed vs. dynamic prompts (varying location/time) to visualize context diversity.
  3. **Baseline Comparison:** Train a YOLOv8 nano model on (a) Real Data only vs. (b) Real + Synthetic Data, specifically measuring the delta in mAP50-95 for the "Van" and "Truck" classes to validate the class-balancing claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can controllable diffusion techniques (e.g., GLIGEN, ControlNet) effectively resolve the cross-attention competition and global coherence issues inherent in single-pass multi-object outpainting?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 suggests using grounded or structural conditioning (GLIGEN, ControlNet) to overcome limitations where disconnected masked regions compete for attention and coherence.
- Why unresolved: The current Latent Diffusion Model architecture encodes disconnected masked areas as a single coherent latent feature map, causing object omissions or partial presence in multi-object scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation showing improved object fidelity and scene consistency when generating canvases with multiple seed objects using controlled diffusion versus the current single-pass method.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can active learning strategies (e.g., uncertainty sampling, core-set selection) reduce the manual effort required to classify seed images while maintaining dataset diversity?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 proposes active learning to prioritize unlabeled vehicle crops for manual classification, hypothesizing it could accelerate seed pool growth.
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline relies on manual selection and classification; the efficiency gains and performance impacts of using active learning for seed curation are untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study measuring the reduction in human labeling time against the downstream detection model's accuracy when using active learning versus random seed selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does fine-tuning the Latent Diffusion Model on vehicle-centric datasets significantly reduce the 5.5% artifact rate (e.g., boundary artifacts, seasonal mismatches) observed in outpainted images?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 suggests fine-tuning on underrepresented classes and using artifact detectors to improve generation fidelity for heavy vehicles.
- Why unresolved: The current reliance on generic pretrained models results in visual defects because the model was not trained specifically on vehicle-centric scenes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A statistically significant decrease in the percentage of manually identified artifacts or improved no-reference quality scores following domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Limitations
- **Prompt Generalization:** The method relies on fixed prompt templates, which may not scale to new vehicle types or extreme environments without manual prompt engineering.
- **Artifact Persistence:** Diffusion models can still generate subtle inconsistencies that may not be fully captured by reported metrics, potentially impacting long-term model robustness.
- **Compute Cost Scaling:** The 30-60s/image generation time becomes prohibitive if frequent retraining or rapid domain adaptation is required.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core mechanism (synthetic outpainting + deterministic annotation) is technically sound and validated by ablation results (10% overall gain, 40-50% for underrepresented classes).
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims of improved robustness to context/scale variance are supported by "Real/Aug. vs. Aug./Aug." performance deltas, but the synthetic-to-real generalization gap is not fully explored.
- **Low Confidence:** Long-term generalization to unseen domains (e.g., different countries, weather conditions) is not tested; the paper focuses on controlled diversity via prompt variation.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test:** Train the same pipeline on AIDOVECL and evaluate on a geographically distinct dataset (e.g., KITTI) to quantify synthetic data's real-world generalization.
2. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the positive/negative prompts (e.g., test "A rural road during sunrise" vs. "A highway during sunset") to measure impact on detection performance and artifact frequency.
3. **Artifact Localization Study:** Use a fine-grained artifact detector to quantify the frequency and severity of inpainting artifacts in AIDOVECL, correlating with mAP drops.
