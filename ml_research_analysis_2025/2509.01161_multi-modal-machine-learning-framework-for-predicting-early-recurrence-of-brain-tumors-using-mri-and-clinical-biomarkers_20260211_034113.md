# Multi-Modal Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Early Recurrence of Brain Tumors Using MRI and Clinical Biomarkers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.01161
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01161
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-modal XGBoost model achieves C-index of 0.782 for predicting brain tumor recurrence using MRI radiomics and clinical biomarkers.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a multi-modal machine learning framework for predicting early recurrence in brain tumor patients using preoperative MRI radiomic features and clinical biomarkers. The framework integrates four machine learning algorithms—Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Survival Forest, CoxBoost, and XGBoost—and evaluates their performance using concordance index, time-dependent AUC, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. XGBoost achieved the highest C-index of 0.782 and time-dependent AUC values of 0.804 (1-year) and 0.767 (2-year), outperforming other models. Feature selection identified MGMT methylation, GLCM entropy, and Ki-67 index as key predictors. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, showing significant differences in recurrence-free survival (9.6 vs. 21.2 months, p < 0.001). The model offers a promising tool for risk stratification and personalized follow-up planning.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts 107 IBSI-compliant radiomic features from preoperative MRI using PyRadiomics, combines them with clinical biomarkers (MGMT methylation, IDH1/2, Ki-67, Age, Tumor Volume), and applies feature selection via univariate Cox regression (p<0.05) followed by multicollinearity filtering (GVIF > 5 removed). Four survival models are trained: GBM, RSF, CoxBoost, and XGBoost, with XGBoost achieving the best performance. The model outputs risk scores for stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups based on median cutoff, with survival differences assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieved the highest C-index of 0.782 and time-dependent AUC values of 0.804 (1-year) and 0.767 (2-year)
- MGMT methylation, GLCM entropy, and Ki-67 index were identified as key predictive features
- High-risk group showed significantly worse recurrence-free survival (9.6 vs. 21.2 months, p < 0.001)
- Multi-modal model outperformed CNN-based unimodal baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating radiomic textures with molecular markers captures complementary prognostic information that single modality models miss. Radiomic features (e.g., GLCM entropy) serve as proxies for intra-tumoral heterogeneity and spatial complexity, while clinical biomarkers (e.g., MGMT methylation) define molecular susceptibility. By concatenating these into a shared feature vector, tree-based models can learn interaction effects—e.g., high texture entropy combined with unmethylated MGMT may yield a non-linear risk score impossible to derive from either source alone. The core assumption is that preoperative MRI textures are stable, reproducible representations of biological aggression, and the feature extraction is robust to scanner variations.

### Mechanism 2
Optimizing the Cox partial likelihood using gradient boosting (XGBoost) handles complex, non-linear risk boundaries better than linear statistical methods. Standard Cox regression assumes a linear log-hazard. XGBoost replaces the linear predictor $f(x) = \beta^T x$ with an ensemble of regression trees $f(x) = \sum \text{tree}_k(x)$. This allows the model to approximate non-linear hazard functions (e.g., risk spikes at specific tumor volumes) while retaining the censorship handling capabilities of survival analysis. The core assumption is that the proportional hazards assumption holds sufficiently for the gradient boosting approximation to remain valid, and the ranking of relative risks is consistent over time.

### Mechanism 3
Aggressive dimensionality reduction via univariate screening prevents overfitting given the "small N, large p" problem typical in medical datasets. Radiomics generates >100 features (high dimensionality) for ~186 patients. By filtering features via univariate Cox regression ($p < 0.05$) and removing multicollinearity (GVIF > 5), the model restricts the hypothesis space. This forces the learner to focus on robust signals (like MGMT) rather than spurious correlations in noise-filled texture features. The core assumption is that features useful for prediction have some individual marginal correlation with the outcome, and collinearity implies redundancy rather than complementary interaction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Survival Analysis (Censoring & Concordance)**
  - Why needed here: You cannot use standard regression or binary classification because patients who haven't recurred yet are "censored"—we don't know their true failure time, only that they survived *at least* until now.
  - Quick check question: If a patient is lost to follow-up at 12 months with no recurrence, do you treat them as "cured" or "censored"? (Answer: Censored).

- **Concept: Radiomics (Texture Analysis)**
  - Why needed here: The model relies on "GLCM Entropy" and "Sphericity." You must understand that these are mathematical descriptors of pixel intensity distributions, acting as proxies for tumor heterogeneity, not just visual descriptors.
  - Quick check question: Does a higher "GLCM Entropy" imply a more homogeneous or heterogeneous tumor texture? (Answer: Heterogeneous/Complex).

- **Concept: Tree-based Ensembles (Boosting)**
  - Why needed here: The winning model is XGBoost. You need to grasp that it sequentially builds trees, where each new tree corrects the errors (residuals) of the previous ensemble, differing from Random Forest which builds trees independently.
  - Quick check question: In Gradient Boosting, does the 100th tree try to predict the raw survival time, or the error residuals of the first 99 trees? (Answer: Residuals).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preoperative MRI (DICOM) + Clinical Spreadsheet -> Tumor Segmentation -> PyRadiomics (107 features) -> Z-score normalization + Missing value imputation -> Univariate Cox filter -> GVIF Collinearity filter -> XGBoost Engine (Objective: Survival/Cox) -> Risk Score -> Risk Group Stratification

- **Critical path:** The linkage between **Segmentation accuracy** and **Feature stability** is the critical dependency. If the tumor segmentation (semi-automatic) varies by even a few pixels, texture features like GLCM can fluctuate wildly, introducing noise that breaks the downstream XGBoost learning.

- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Interpretability vs. Accuracy: The study chose XGBoost (black-box-ish but SHAP explainable) over Deep Learning (CNNs on raw images). This trades raw potential accuracy for the ability to identify specific drivers like MGMT methylation.
  - Univariate Filtering: Fast and reduces overfitting, but risks dropping features that are only predictive in combination (interaction effects).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Calibration Error: Model predicts 80% risk, but only 40% recur. Check if the Brier score is high (Table 3 shows XGBoost was lowest, but checks are needed).
  - Dominance of Clinical Features: If radiomics features have near-zero SHAP values, the MRI pipeline is likely failing to capture signal, perhaps due to poor standardization.
  - GVIF Over-pruning: If the model underfits (C-index < 0.65), the GVIF threshold (5.0) may be too aggressive, removing too many variables.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Sanity Check:** Run a linear Cox Proportional Hazards model on the *selected* 13 features. If XGBoost doesn't beat this significantly, the non-linear modeling isn't working or the data is too noisy.
  2. **Ablation Study:** Train two models: (A) Clinical only, (B) Radiomics only. Compare C-indices to the Multi-modal model. This quantifies the value add of the MRI integration.
  3. **Stability Analysis:** Perturb the tumor segmentation masks by 1-2 pixels (erosion/dilation) and re-extract features. Check if the risk scores change significantly. If they do, the model is fragile to segmentation error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the proposed multi-modal framework maintain high predictive accuracy when validated across multi-institutional datasets with heterogeneous imaging protocols? The authors state in the Discussion that the study is "retrospective and single-center, limiting generalizability," and explicitly call for "external validation" in future work. The current validation relies on a single institutional cohort ($N=186$), which does not account for variations in MRI scanners or population demographics found in broader clinical settings.

- Do advanced temporal architectures, such as transformers or recurrent models, significantly outperform the "shallow" time-series representation used in the current study? The Discussion notes that "our time-series representation was relatively shallow and warrants further exploration using advanced architectures like transformers or recurrent models." While the theoretical framework includes temporal encoding, the authors acknowledge the implementation was limited, leaving the potential performance gain of deeper temporal modeling unquantified.

- Does the real-time implementation of this framework in clinical workflows lead to improved risk-adaptive surveillance outcomes compared to standard care? The Conclusion lists "investigate real-time implementation in clinical workflow for risk-adaptive surveillance strategies" as a specific avenue for future work. The study establishes retrospective predictive power but has not tested if the model's output effectively alters clinical decision-making or patient outcomes in a live environment.

## Limitations
- The study is retrospective and single-center, limiting generalizability across different imaging protocols and populations
- Specific hyperparameters for XGBoost and other models are not published, making exact replication difficult
- Radiomics extraction settings are only described as "IBSI-compliant" without specific parameters

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** XGBoost's superior performance (C-index 0.782) is well-supported by the reported metrics and ablation study showing multi-modal superiority over unimodal baselines
- **Medium confidence:** The feature selection methodology (univariate Cox + GVIF filtering) is sound but may discard predictive interaction effects. The generalizability is limited by single-center data and specific MRI protocols
- **Low confidence:** The clinical impact claims require external validation, as the study relies on internal cross-validation only

## Next Checks
1. **External validation:** Test the model on an independent dataset from a different institution to assess generalizability across scanner types and protocols
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary XGBoost parameters (learning rate, tree depth, number of estimators) to determine if performance is robust or highly tuned
3. **Segmentation stability test:** Perturb tumor masks by 1-2 pixels and measure feature/risk score variability to quantify the model's sensitivity to segmentation errors
