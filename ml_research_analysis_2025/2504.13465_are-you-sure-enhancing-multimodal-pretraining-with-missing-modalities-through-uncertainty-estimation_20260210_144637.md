# Are you SURE? Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13465
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465
- Reference count: 40
- Method reconstructs missing modalities in latent space and estimates uncertainties using Pearson Correlation loss

## Executive Summary
SURE addresses missing modalities in multimodal learning by reconstructing absent inputs in the latent space and estimating their uncertainties. The method introduces a Pearson Correlation-based loss that learns uncertainty without restrictive distributional assumptions, and adapts error propagation techniques to quantify uncertainty from reconstructed inputs. SURE integrates with pretrained multimodal models, enabling robust performance on small-scale and incomplete datasets. Experiments across sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art results with improved uncertainty-error correlation and reliable predictions under missing modality conditions.

## Method Summary
SURE reconstructs missing modalities using latent space representations from available modalities, then estimates uncertainty through a Pearson Correlation-based loss and error propagation through frozen pretrained layers. The method operates in two phases: first training reconstruction modules to predict missing latents and their uncertainties, then training a classifier with propagated uncertainty estimates. SURE is designed to work with any pretrained multimodal model (MMML, MMBT, HAMLET) by inserting reconstruction modules after unimodal projectors and before fusion layers, maintaining compatibility with frozen weights while handling incomplete inputs.

## Key Results
- Consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across CMU-MOSI, MM-IMDB, and MMAct datasets with missing modalities
- PCC loss maintains stable uncertainty-error correlation over training epochs compared to NLL loss which degrades
- Error propagation effectively quantifies uncertainty from reconstructed inputs, with output uncertainty correlating with reconstruction uncertainty
- Reliable uncertainty estimates enable better decision-making deferral based on confidence thresholds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Space Reconstruction for Missing Modalities
Reconstructing missing modalities in latent space enables pretrained models to process incomplete inputs while preserving learned representations. Trainable reconstruction modules take available modality latents and generate approximations for missing ones, which flow through frozen pretrained fusion layers. This works when available modalities contain sufficient cross-modal information to approximate missing modalities, but fails when modalities are largely independent.

### Mechanism 2: Pearson Correlation-based Loss for Distribution-Free Uncertainty Estimation
Optimizing for correlation between estimated uncertainty and prediction error, rather than enforcing Gaussian likelihood, produces more stable uncertainty estimates. The PCC loss normalizes covariance between uncertainty and error, avoiding magnitude constraints that force uncertainty to scale with error. This enables flexible learning while preserving reliability ranking, though small batch sizes may hinder correlation estimation.

### Mechanism 3: Error Propagation from Reconstructed Inputs to Output Uncertainty
Classical error propagation theory adapted to deep networks quantifies how uncertainty from reconstructed inputs propagates through frozen layers to final predictions. Using first-order Taylor expansion, the method computes uncertainty contribution from each reconstructed input and combines with model-intrinsic uncertainty. This assumes uncertainty sources are independent, which may not hold for highly non-linear activation regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Heteroscedastic vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**: SURE distinguishes input-induced (reconstruction) uncertainty from model-intrinsic uncertainty. Quick check: Can you explain why aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced with more training data, but epistemic uncertainty can?

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: The core loss function relies on PCC properties and its normalization behavior vs. covariance. Quick check: If your PCC loss converges to 0.5 instead of 0, what does this tell you about the relationship between your uncertainty estimates and errors?

- **Jacobian-based Sensitivity Analysis**: Error propagation requires computing partial derivatives through frozen networks. Quick check: How would you efficiently compute partial derivatives through a frozen pretrained transformer without modifying its forward pass?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input modalities → frozen projectors → reconstruction modules → frozen fusion → classifier with uncertainty output

- **Critical path**: 1) Input modalities → frozen f_i(.) → latent representations Z_i 2) Missing modality detection → available Z_j → r_i(Z_j) → Z̃_i and σ̃²_{Z̃_i} 3) All latents → frozen ω(.) → fused representation 4) Fused → g(.) → prediction ŷ + σ̃²_ω 5) Error propagation computes ∂ω/∂Z̃_i → combines σ̃²_input + σ̃²_ω → final σ̃²_Y

- **Design tradeoffs**: Reconstruction module depth vs. efficiency (6 FC layers used); two-phase vs. joint training (simplifies optimization but may miss joint improvements); frozen backbone assumption may degrade with domain shift

- **Failure signatures**: Reconstruction uncertainty near zero but output error high (r_i(.) collapsed); σ̃²_input dominates σ̃²_ω excessively (increase λ in L_rec); PCC loss oscillates (increase batch size); modality imbalance (one modality carries reconstruction burden)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Single missing modality reconstruction validation measuring reconstruction error vs. ground-truth latents 2) Uncertainty-error correlation baseline comparing PCC vs. NLL loss correlation over epochs 3) Two-phase training validation comparing frozen reconstructors vs. end-to-end fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can the framework be adapted to prevent performance degradation when dominant modalities are missing? The current approach relies heavily on dominant modalities for reconstruction, causing significant performance drops when unavailable. Evidence would require modifications maintaining performance metrics when dominant modalities are masked.

**Open Question 2**: How can the tendency to overestimate reconstruction and output uncertainties be corrected? The method shows a consistent overestimation pattern in both reconstruction and output uncertainties, affecting confidence reliability. Calibration analysis showing predicted uncertainty matching empirical error distribution would resolve this.

**Open Question 3**: How can optimal uncertainty thresholds be dynamically determined for decision-making deferral when input modality combinations vary? Static thresholds are suboptimal as the relationship between uncertainty scores and correctness shifts depending on missing modalities. A mechanism adapting thresholds based on specific missing modality masks would improve deferral rates.

## Limitations
- Certain modalities dominate the reconstruction process, causing significant performance drops when unavailable
- Tendency to overestimate both reconstruction and output uncertainties, affecting confidence calibration
- Fixed uncertainty thresholds may be suboptimal as optimal values differ depending on input modality combinations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Latent space reconstruction approach and its integration with frozen pretrained models; theoretical derivation of error propagation following classical statistical methods

**Medium Confidence**: Pearson Correlation-based loss shows promising results but lacks extensive ablation studies; independent uncertainty source assumption may not hold in all scenarios

**Low Confidence**: Generalization performance across diverse domain shifts; potential overfitting when training reconstruction modules on small-scale datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Correlation Loss Variants**: Compare PCC loss against alternative correlation-based losses (Spearman, Kendall) and traditional uncertainty estimation methods across multiple datasets to isolate the contribution of the correlation-based approach.

2. **Error Propagation Accuracy Assessment**: Quantify the approximation error introduced by first-order Taylor expansion by comparing propagated uncertainty estimates against Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble-based uncertainty estimates on the same pretrained backbone.

3. **Modality Independence Stress Test**: Design experiments with artificially decorrelated modalities to identify the breaking point where reconstruction becomes unreliable, and measure the resulting impact on downstream task performance and uncertainty calibration.
