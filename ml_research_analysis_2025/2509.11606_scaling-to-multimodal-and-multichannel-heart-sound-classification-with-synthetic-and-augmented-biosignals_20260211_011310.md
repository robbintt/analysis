# Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.11606
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11606
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on heart sound classification using transformer-based models with synthetic data augmentation

## Executive Summary
This work tackles the challenge of classifying abnormal heart sounds indicative of cardiovascular diseases, addressing limitations in existing datasets such as limited size, noise, and class imbalance. The authors propose a scalable transformer-based approach using Wav2Vec2 for single-channel PCG, multimodal PCG-ECG, and multichannel PCG classification. They enhance training by generating synthetic data using diffusion models (WaveGrad and DiffWave) and applying traditional augmentation techniques. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the CinC 2016 dataset (92.48% accuracy, 93.05% UAR, 0.8283 MCC) and the smaller training-a subset (93.14% accuracy, 92.21% UAR, 0.8380 MCC), while also delivering strong performance on a challenging real-world multichannel vest dataset (77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 0.5082 MCC). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a transformer-based approach for heart sound classification using Wav2Vec2 as the backbone architecture. They employed diffusion models (WaveGrad and DiffWave) to generate synthetic PCG data, combined with traditional augmentation techniques including time masking, noise addition, and frequency masking. The system was evaluated across three scenarios: single-channel PCG classification, multimodal PCG-ECG classification, and multichannel PCG classification using chest vest recordings. The approach addresses common challenges in biomedical signal processing including limited dataset sizes, class imbalance, and the need for robust classification across multiple sensor configurations.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CinC 2016 dataset with 92.48% accuracy, 93.05% UAR, and 0.8283 MCC
- Outperformed existing methods on the smaller training-a subset with 93.14% accuracy, 92.21% UAR, and 0.8380 MCC
- Demonstrated strong generalization to real-world multichannel vest dataset with 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, and 0.5082 MCC

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The transformer-based architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in heart sound signals, which is crucial for distinguishing between normal and pathological patterns. The use of Wav2Vec2 provides a powerful pretrained representation that captures both temporal and spectral features essential for heart sound analysis. Synthetic data generation through diffusion models addresses the fundamental limitation of limited annotated biomedical data by creating diverse training examples that improve model robustness. The multimodal approach combining PCG with ECG signals provides complementary physiological information that enhances diagnostic accuracy. The multichannel configuration exploits spatial information from multiple chest locations to improve signal quality and classification reliability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion models for biosignal synthesis**: Why needed - To address data scarcity in biomedical applications; Quick check - Generated samples should maintain physiological plausibility and statistical properties of real heart sounds
- **Wav2Vec2 for biomedical signals**: Why needed - Provides pretrained representations that capture relevant acoustic features; Quick check - Model should extract meaningful features across different heart sound patterns
- **Multimodal fusion strategies**: Why needed - Combining PCG with ECG provides complementary diagnostic information; Quick check - Fusion should improve performance over individual modalities
- **Multichannel signal processing**: Why needed - Spatial diversity improves signal quality and robustness; Quick check - Performance should benefit from multiple sensor locations
- **Transformer architectures for sequential data**: Why needed - Captures long-range dependencies in temporal signals; Quick check - Self-attention should identify relevant temporal patterns for classification

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw audio -> Preprocessing -> Wav2Vec2 encoder -> Transformer layers -> Classification head

**Critical Path**: The core processing pipeline consists of signal preprocessing (filtering, normalization), feature extraction through Wav2Vec2, transformer-based temporal modeling, and final classification through a linear layer with softmax activation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The authors chose transformer-based architectures over traditional CNN approaches to better capture long-range temporal dependencies in heart sounds. While transformers are computationally more expensive, they provide superior performance for this task. The use of diffusion models for synthetic data generation adds computational overhead during training but significantly improves model generalization. The multimodal approach increases system complexity but provides substantial performance gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur with poor signal quality, excessive noise, or when heart sounds deviate significantly from training distribution. The system may struggle with rare pathological patterns not well-represented in training data. Multichannel approaches could fail if sensor placement is inconsistent or if cross-channel synchronization is imperfect.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation on CinC 2016 dataset using only real training data without augmentation
2. Ablation study comparing performance with and without synthetic data augmentation
3. Cross-validation across different channel configurations to assess robustness to sensor placement variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation is restricted to specific datasets (CinC 2016 and one multichannel vest dataset), limiting generalizability assessment
- The synthetic data generation process may introduce artifacts or biases not present in authentic recordings
- Multichannel evaluation is limited to a single vest-based dataset, not testing the approach across diverse sensor configurations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Transformer-based architecture's effectiveness for heart sound classification is well-supported by consistent improvements across multiple metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Contribution of synthetic data augmentation to performance gains is demonstrated but not fully isolated through ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of the multichannel approach to completely different sensor configurations remains uncertain due to limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Test the trained models on multiple independent datasets with different acquisition methods and patient populations to assess true generalizability
2. Ablation studies: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each augmentation technique (diffusion models vs traditional methods) and model component to isolate their individual impacts on performance
3. Clinical validation: Conduct prospective studies in clinical settings with real-time classification to verify that laboratory performance translates to practical diagnostic utility, including assessment of false positive/negative rates in actual patient populations
