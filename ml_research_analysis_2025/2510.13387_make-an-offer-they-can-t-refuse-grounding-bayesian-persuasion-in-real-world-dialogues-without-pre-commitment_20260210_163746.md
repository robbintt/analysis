# Make an Offer They Can't Refuse: Grounding Bayesian Persuasion in Real-World Dialogues without Pre-Commitment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13387
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13387
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: BP-guided LLMs achieve 0.82 SFNL and 0.77 FNL persuasion success rates, outperforming NBP baselines (0.59-0.60)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of implementing Bayesian persuasion in natural language dialogue without pre-commitment. The proposed framework enables persuaders to verbally articulate information schemas through type disclosure, bridging formal game-theoretic models with authentic language use. The method incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism where the persuader narrates potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest) to guide Bayesian belief updates in the persuadee. Experimental results demonstrate that BP-guided LLMs significantly outperform non-BP baselines in persuasion success, achieving rates of 0.82 (SFNL) and 0.77 (FNL) compared to 0.59 and 0.60 for naive and strong NBP baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces two verbalization variants: Semi-Formal Natural Language (SFNL) that blends calculations with narrative, and Fully Natural Language (FNL) that uses pure narrative structures. The persuader constructs a composite signal consisting of m_basic (background), m_type (sender type narrative), m_des (state description), and m_inf (expected payoff inference). Type disclosure enables commitment communication without external schema pre-commitment by inducing belief distributions in receivers. The approach works in both explicit view (setup provided) and self-derived view (model infers setup). Fine-tuning with ~1,700 trajectories distilled from DeepSeek-V3.1 enables smaller models to match larger model performance, achieving 0.98 success rate in SFNL settings.

## Key Results
- BP-guided LLMs significantly outperform non-BP baselines: 0.82 (SFNL) and 0.77 (FNL) vs 0.59-0.60 for NBP methods
- Human evaluation validates findings: FNL and SFNL receive 205 and 193 preference scores respectively, substantially outperforming NBP
- Self-derived BP reasoning shows particular effectiveness: FNL achieves 0.92 success rate when models must infer setups from ambiguous scenarios
- Fine-tuning enables smaller models to match larger performance: Qwen3-4B★ achieves 0.98 success rate in SFNL settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Verbalizing type disclosure enables Bayesian persuasion without pre-commitment in single-turn dialogue. The persuader explicitly narrates their potential types (e.g., honest/dishonest) within the message, inducing a belief distribution p(θ) in the receiver. This generates an effective information schema π̄(m_des|ω) = p(θ_H)π_H(m_des|ω) + p(θ_D)π_D(m_des|ω), allowing the receiver to update priors via Bayes' rule without external schema pre-commitment. The mechanism fails if receivers cannot reliably infer p(θ) from natural language or reject the type narrative as implausible.

### Mechanism 2
Semi-formal and fully natural language verbalizations produce distinct persuasion advantages through different cognitive pathways. SFNL provides explicit calculations that signal analytical rigor, enhancing credibility and logical coherence. FNL embeds equivalent reasoning in narrative structures, producing stronger emotional resonance and accessibility for non-expert receivers. The pathway-specific advantages diminish if receivers distrust formal calculations or FNL narratives lack coherent structure.

### Mechanism 3
Self-derived BP reasoning enables robust performance without explicit scaffolding. When models independently infer priors, states, and utilities from scenarios, they develop internalized Bayesian representations that generalize across contexts. FNL particularly benefits from self-derived reasoning (0.92 vs. 0.82 success rate), suggesting natural language reasoning transfers better than semi-formal computation. The mechanism fails if inferred priors/utilities significantly diverge from true receiver preferences.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayesian Persuasion (Signaling Games)**: Understanding how informed senders design signals to influence receiver actions through belief manipulation is prerequisite to grasping the paper's core contribution. Can you explain why a sender might prefer partial information disclosure over full revelation?

- **Information Asymmetry and Commitment**: The paper's key innovation is verbalizing commitment through type disclosure; understanding pre-commitment assumptions in classical BP reveals why this matters. What happens in standard BP if the receiver doesn't know or trust the sender's signaling scheme?

- **Natural Language Grounding of Formal Mechanisms**: The framework translates formal constructs (priors, posteriors, utilities) into conversational language; understanding this translation challenge contextualizes the SFNL/FNL design choice. How would you verbalize "p(positive|recommend) = 0.93" in natural language without losing precision?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Scenario description → BP strategy selection → Type narrative construction → Signal verbalization → Receiver posterior update
- **Critical path**: 1. Scenario parsing → state space identification, 2. Prior/utility inference (self-derived) or retrieval (explicit), 3. Type narrative design (honest/dishonest policy mixture), 4. Signal verbalization (SFNL with calculations, FNL pure narrative), 5. Receiver posterior update and action selection
- **Design tradeoffs**: SFNL offers higher credibility but requires math-capable receivers; FNL provides better emotional resonance but risks ambiguity; explicit view yields higher baseline performance but requires setup annotation
- **Failure signatures**: SFNL success drops from 0.98 to 0.88 when utility+posterior removed; FNL shows gradual degradation (0.83→0.78); NBP baselines show high variance (±0.30–0.40 std dev); small models over-accept without reasoning
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate explicit view SFNL vs. FNL on 20 scenarios measuring success rates and variance, 2. Ablate type disclosure to isolate contribution of commitment communication, 3. Test cross-model transfer training on DeepSeek-generated BP trajectories and evaluating on Qwen-2.5-7B

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can Bayesian persuasion strategies be adapted to multi-turn dialogue settings where commitment mechanisms must evolve across multiple exchanges? The current framework only addresses single-turn interactions; extending to multi-turn requires handling how prior beliefs update across exchanges and how commitment credibility is maintained or lost.

### Open Question 2
How robust are BP-guided persuasion strategies against adversarial or explicitly skeptical receivers who attempt to detect manipulation? Current experiments use receivers that either apply BP reasoning or make heuristic decisions, but real-world persuadees may actively counter-argue or recognize the commitment-communication mechanism as a rhetorical device.

### Open Question 3
Can the type-induced commitment mechanism effectively transfer to other strategic communication domains beyond persuasion (e.g., negotiation, deception detection, or collaborative problem-solving)? The framework is designed specifically for persuasion tasks with binary accept/reject outcomes, but the core innovation may generalize to other asymmetric information settings.

### Open Question 4
Do BP strategies remain effective with human populations outside AI research backgrounds, and does expertise in Bayesian reasoning moderate persuasion susceptibility? The human evaluation involved only 25 participants from AI research backgrounds with limited BP familiarity, raising questions about generalizability to broader populations with different reasoning styles.

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLMs' ability to parse and respond to verbalized type narratives remains unverified beyond controlled experiments
- SFNL's dependence on formal calculations may limit accessibility in real-world applications
- Self-derived BP setup inference shows performance degradation in more complex scenarios, suggesting scalability challenges
- Cross-model transfer claims need further validation with different model families and training regimes

## Confidence
- **High**: BP-guided persuasion success rates outperforming NBP baselines (0.82 SFNL vs. 0.59 naive)
- **Medium**: Human evaluation rankings across persuasion dimensions (persuasiveness, credibility, emotional resonance)
- **Low**: Generalization claims for smaller models and cross-domain scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on Type Disclosure**: Remove m_type from the composite signal and measure persuasion success to isolate the contribution of commitment communication versus standard persuasive arguments
2. **Receiver Capability Assessment**: Test whether NBP receivers (naive and strong) can actually parse SFNL calculations by measuring acceptance rates with varying levels of mathematical complexity in the prompts
3. **Real-World Dialogue Simulation**: Evaluate the framework in multi-turn dialogue settings where receivers can ask clarifying questions about type narratives, testing robustness beyond single-turn scenarios
