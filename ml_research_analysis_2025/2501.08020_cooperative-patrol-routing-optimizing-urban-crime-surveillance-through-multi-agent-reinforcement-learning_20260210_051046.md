# Cooperative Patrol Routing: Optimizing Urban Crime Surveillance through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.08020
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08020
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Multi-agent RL model achieves >90% coverage of top 3% crime nodes in urban patrol simulations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model for optimizing police patrol routes in urban environments. The model uses Value Decomposition Proximal Policy Optimization (VDPPO) to coordinate homogeneous patrol agents, maximizing surveillance coverage of high-crime areas without predetermining specific nodes. Tested on three districts in Malaga, Spain, the approach achieves over 90% coverage of the 3% of graph nodes with highest crime incidence and 65% coverage for 20% of these nodes. The study introduces a new coverage index metric and demonstrates that strategic deployment at crime hotspots significantly improves performance over random starting positions.

## Method Summary
The approach models urban patrol as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) where homogeneous agents coordinate to maximize coverage of high-crime nodes. The environment is represented as an undirected graph from skeletonized 50x50m urban grids, with crime data serving as the target function. VDPPO algorithm with GRU-based neural networks handles credit assignment through value decomposition, enabling effective coordination among agents. A custom reward function balances exploration of hotspots, penalizes redundant visits, and discourages inefficient movement through low-interest areas. The model is trained for 100M steps and evaluated using a coverage index metric inspired by the predictive accuracy index.

## Key Results
- VDPPO-generated routes achieve >90% coverage of top 3% crime nodes and 65% coverage of top 20% crime nodes
- Coordinated routes outperform greedy algorithms in most tested zones
- Strategic deployment at crime hotspots yields significantly better coverage than random starting positions
- Model performs effectively with varying agent counts (2, 5, 10) across different district densities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The VDPPO algorithm enables effective coordination among homogeneous patrol agents by solving the credit assignment problem inherent in cooperative MARL. VDPPO decomposes the global team reward into individual agent-specific value functions, allowing centralized training to attribute performance to specific agents while maintaining decentralized execution. This prevents "lazy agent" behaviors where agents rely on peers to perform costly actions. The shared policy network assumes agents are homogeneous and contribute structurally identically to the global reward.

### Mechanism 2
The custom reward function drives agents to maximize high-value coverage while penalizing redundancy and inefficient movement. The reward divides the node's target value (crime score) by the visit count, naturally diminishing returns for over-surveillance. It adds an exploration bonus for first visits to relevant nodes and a penalty for traversing low-interest areas, effectively shaping paths that connect hotspots. This reward structure assumes stable crime data as a reliable proxy for surveillance priority.

### Mechanism 3
The "Coverage Index" metric aligns optimization with real-world criminological standards, ensuring the model prioritizes the most critical 3-20% of the area rather than minimizing average idleness. By ranking nodes by crime incidence and evaluating coverage specifically on the top subset, the model optimizes for resource allocation efficiency. This contrasts with "idleness" criteria, which are inappropriate for finite, non-cyclic patrol shifts where the goal is hotspot coverage rather than minimizing time since last visit.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)**
- Why needed: Agents operate with limited line of sight and cannot see the entire city state or exact positions of all other agents at all times
- Quick check: If an agent can only see 3 grid cells away, how does it know which distant hotspot is currently uncovered by other patrols? (Answer: It relies on the shared policy learned during centralized training to probabilistically coordinate)

**Concept: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
- Why needed: The environment is not fully observable; agents need memory to track where they (and others, via observed visits) have recently been to avoid redundant coverage
- Quick check: Why use a GRU instead of a simple feed-forward network? (Answer: To handle the sequential dependency of observations and remember visit history)

**Concept: Skeletonization (Environment Modeling)**
- Why needed: Converting a complex continuous urban environment into an undirected graph with a 50x50m grid discretizes the action space, making the RL problem tractable
- Quick check: How does the graph handle non-navigable areas like parks or water? (Answer: Nodes are removed/edges are weighted based on road network data)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Urban Grid + Crime Data -> VDPPO Algorithm (Actor-Critic with GRU) -> Coverage Index Evaluation

**Critical path:**
1. Pre-process raw crime data into the target function (per node)
2. Define the Reward Function (specific to zone density)
3. Train the shared policy via VDPPO (Centralized Critic)
4. Evaluate generated routes against the Coverage Index

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Observability (Line of Sight): Higher LoS (e.g., 6) yields better coordination but increases observation space and training time; LoS=1 is fast but unstable
- Starting Position: "Best" starting positions (top crime nodes) guarantee initial high coverage but lower route entropy; random starts increase unpredictability but risk lower initial coverage

**Failure signatures:**
- Agent Clustering: All agents converging on the single highest-value node (indicates exploration reward or visit penalty is too low)
- Sparse Exploration: Agents moving randomly or circling (indicates reward signal is too sparse or target function is flat)
- Training Instability: Loss spikes or failure to converge (common in MARL; may require tuning PPO clipping or learning rate)

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Baseline Validation: Run Greedy Algorithm vs. Random Agents in Zone 3 to establish lower bounds for the Coverage Index
2. Observability Ablation: Train VDPPO with Line of Sight = 1 vs. 3 vs. 6 in Zone 9 to quantify performance gap from partial observability
3. Scaling Test: Fix agent count to 5 and compare training convergence time and final Coverage Index between dense (Zone 3) and sparse (Zone 10) crime zones

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the proposed model maintain performance when the number of agents is modified dynamically during a simulation to handle real-time incidents? The current model assumes a static number of homogeneous agents and does not accommodate deviations for incidents like accidents or arrests.

**Open Question 2:** Would a transformer-based neural network architecture outperform the current GRU-based implementation in terms of convergence speed and route coordination? While GRUs were effective, the authors suggest Transformers may offer improved handling of sequential decision-making.

**Open Question 3:** Does reducing the required monitoring time per node to allow for a higher number of steps improve coverage in larger urban areas? The current model assumes fixed time spent per node, which limits the number of nodes visited in larger districts.

**Open Question 4:** Can the model effectively adapt to non-urban environments or areas with extremely sparse crime data where geographic points drive activity? The current dense-reward structure may fail in sparse contexts where geographic points rather than continuous areas define activity.

## Limitations

- Confidential crime data cannot be independently validated or tested against dynamic crime patterns
- The assumption that visiting a node constitutes effective surveillance remains unverified without modeling actual deterrence or dwell time
- 50x50m grid discretization may oversimplify complex urban environments with irregular road networks or restricted access zones

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The VDPPO algorithm's ability to generate coordinated routes with over 90% coverage of the top 3% crime nodes is well-supported by experimental results across multiple zones.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that VDPPO outperforms greedy algorithms requires caution due to sensitivity to parameter tuning mentioned in results.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the custom reward function to different urban environments or crime patterns is uncertain, as this appears to be a novel contribution without extensive cross-validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Dynamic Crime Pattern Test:** Re-run the model using crime data from different time periods or synthetic data with shifting hotspots to evaluate robustness against temporal crime variation.

2. **Heterogeneous Agent Configuration:** Test the model with agents having different speeds or capabilities to assess whether the homogeneous VDPPO approach maintains performance when agents are no longer interchangeable.

3. **Field Implementation Pilot:** Partner with local law enforcement to conduct a limited field trial comparing VDPPO-generated routes against existing patrol schedules, measuring actual crime incidence in covered vs. uncovered areas during the patrol shift.
