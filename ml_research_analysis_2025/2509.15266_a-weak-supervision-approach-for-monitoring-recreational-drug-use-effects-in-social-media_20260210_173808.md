- Primary result: Achieved F1 = 0.885 and AUPRC = 0.934 using weak supervision for recreational drug effect classification on Twitter

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a weak supervision approach for detecting and classifying recreational drug use effects in Twitter data. The authors developed a methodology that combines slang term lexicons and biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap to weakly annotate over 92,000 tweets mentioning ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. Each tweet was labeled with polarity reflecting positive or negative drug effects based on expert-guided heuristics. Machine learning classifiers were trained to predict polarity from tweet content, addressing class imbalance through cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier with cost-sensitive learning achieved the highest performance (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934) on the test set.

## Method Summary
The authors collected over 92,000 tweets mentioning ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B, then applied weak supervision through a combination of slang term lexicons and biomedical concept extraction using MetaMap. Expert-guided heuristics were used to label tweets with polarity scores reflecting positive or negative drug effects. The labeled dataset was used to train machine learning classifiers, with particular attention to class imbalance through cost-sensitive learning techniques and synthetic oversampling methods. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier with cost-sensitive learning demonstrated the best performance metrics.

## Key Results
- eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier achieved F1 = 0.885 and AUPRC = 0.934 on test set
- Weak supervision approach successfully labeled over 92,000 tweets using expert-guided heuristics
- Twitter data effectively captures substance-specific phenotypic effects for pharmacovigilance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages domain expertise through weak supervision to overcome the challenge of manually labeling large volumes of social media data. By combining slang term recognition with biomedical concept extraction, the method can identify drug-related content and its associated effects. The use of expert-guided heuristics provides a scalable way to annotate data while maintaining quality, and the application of cost-sensitive learning addresses the inherent class imbalance in drug effect polarity classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weak Supervision**: Automated labeling technique using heuristics and rules instead of manual annotation
  - Why needed: Manual annotation of large social media datasets is prohibitively time-consuming and expensive
  - Quick check: Verify that heuristics produce consistent labels across different annotators

- **MetaMap Biomedical Concept Extraction**: Tool for mapping biomedical text to standardized concepts
  - Why needed: Enables systematic identification of drug effects and related terminology in unstructured text
  - Quick check: Validate extraction accuracy against known drug effect vocabularies

- **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Machine learning approach that accounts for different misclassification costs
  - Why needed: Drug effect classification datasets typically exhibit severe class imbalance
  - Quick check: Compare performance with and without cost-sensitive adjustments

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Twitter data collection -> Weak annotation (slang + MetaMap + heuristics) -> Feature extraction -> Cost-sensitive ML classification
- **Critical Path**: Data collection → Weak labeling → Model training → Performance evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Weak supervision enables scalability but may introduce labeling noise; expert heuristics provide quality but limit generalizability
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on specific drug classes suggests weak supervision
