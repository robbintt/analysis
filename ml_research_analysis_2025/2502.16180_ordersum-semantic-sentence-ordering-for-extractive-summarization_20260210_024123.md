# OrderSum: Semantic Sentence Ordering for Extractive Summarization
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16180
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: OrderSum improves extractive summarization by incorporating sentence order into summary embeddings and training with a new objective function. It generates candidate summaries with different sentence orders and uses contrastive learning to identify the best ordering in the semantic space. On CNN/DailyMail, OrderSum achieves a ROUGE-L score of 30.52, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 2.54.

## Executive Summary
OrderSum addresses a critical gap in extractive summarization by recognizing that the order of selected sentences significantly impacts summary quality. Traditional approaches treat sentence selection and ordering as separate problems, often ignoring the sequential structure that enhances coherence and readability. This work introduces a unified framework that jointly optimizes sentence selection and ordering through semantic embeddings and contrastive learning.

The proposed method generates multiple candidate summaries with different sentence orderings and uses a novel contrastive learning objective to identify the most semantically coherent arrangement. By incorporating sentence order directly into the summary embeddings, OrderSum captures the temporal and logical dependencies between sentences that are essential for producing fluent summaries. The approach demonstrates substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

## Method Summary
OrderSum introduces a novel framework for extractive summarization that jointly optimizes sentence selection and ordering. The method generates multiple candidate summaries by permuting the order of selected sentences, then uses contrastive learning to identify the optimal ordering in the semantic space. The core innovation lies in incorporating sentence order into summary embeddings and training with a new objective function that encourages coherent temporal and logical flow. The model operates by first selecting sentences using standard extractive methods, then generating candidate summaries with different orderings, and finally applying contrastive learning to rank these candidates based on semantic coherence.

## Key Results
- Achieves ROUGE-L score of 30.52 on CNN/DailyMail dataset
- Outperforms previous state-of-the-art by 2.54 points
- Demonstrates that sentence ordering significantly impacts summary quality
- Shows effectiveness of contrastive learning for identifying optimal sentence sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of OrderSum stems from its recognition that sentence order is not merely a presentation issue but a fundamental aspect of semantic coherence. By generating multiple candidate summaries with different sentence orderings and using contrastive learning to identify the optimal arrangement, the model learns to recognize which sequences preserve logical flow and temporal consistency. The incorporation of sentence order into summary embeddings allows the model to capture dependencies between sentences that are crucial for maintaining context and readability. This approach addresses the limitation of traditional extractive methods that treat sentence selection and ordering as independent problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Needed to differentiate between semantically coherent and incoherent sentence orderings; quick check: verify margin between positive and negative samples
- **Sentence Embeddings**: Required to represent semantic content of individual sentences; quick check: ensure embeddings capture both content and positional information
- **Summary Coherence Modeling**: Essential for evaluating the quality of sentence sequences; quick check: test on human-annotated coherence scores
- **Permutation Generation**: Necessary for creating diverse candidate summaries; quick check: verify coverage of possible orderings
- **Extractive Selection**: Foundation for identifying candidate sentences; quick check: compare with baseline selection methods
- **Semantic Space Optimization**: Required for learning optimal sentence arrangements; quick check: visualize embedding spaces for different orderings

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Document -> Sentence Selector -> Candidate Generator -> Contrastive Ranker -> Optimal Summary
- **Critical Path**: The contrastive learning objective is the critical component that differentiates OrderSum from standard extractive methods
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Computational cost of generating multiple candidates vs. quality improvement; potential overfitting to specific document structures
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on documents with non-linear narratives; degraded quality when candidate generation is limited
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test candidate generation with varying numbers of permutations
  2. Evaluate impact of different contrastive learning margins
  3. Compare with baseline that ignores sentence ordering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains may not generalize equally well across diverse document types or domains
- Computational overhead from generating multiple candidate summaries could scale poorly with document length
- Model's effectiveness appears highly dependent on specific contrastive learning objective and candidate generation strategy

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The claim that OrderSum improves ROUGE-L scores on CNN/DailyMail by 2.54 points over previous state-of-the-art, given the specific experimental setup and dataset
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of the contrastive learning approach to other extractive summarization datasets and domains
- **Medium Confidence**: The computational efficiency claims, given the candidate generation process

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate OrderSum on multiple summarization datasets (e.g., XSum, Newsroom) to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the contrastive learning component to quantify its specific contribution
3. Benchmark inference time and memory usage against baseline models to verify practical deployment feasibility
