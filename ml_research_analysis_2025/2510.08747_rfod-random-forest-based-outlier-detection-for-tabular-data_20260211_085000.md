# RFOD: Random Forest-based Outlier Detection for Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08747
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08747
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RFOD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy on mixed-type tabular data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RFOD, a novel Random Forest-based outlier detection framework designed for mixed-type tabular data. RFOD reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction problem, training dedicated Random Forests for each feature conditioned on the others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving semantic integrity. To enhance precision and interpretability, RFOD combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD) for cell-level scoring—adapting to skewed numerical data and accounting for categorical confidence—with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores.

Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that RFOD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, achieving up to a 9.1% gain in AUC-ROC and a 91.2% reduction in test-time latency. RFOD offers superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular data.

## Method Summary
RFOD is a Random Forest-based outlier detection framework for mixed-type tabular data. It reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction problem, training dedicated Random Forests for each feature conditioned on the others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving semantic integrity. RFOD uses Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD) for cell-level scoring, adapting to skewed numerical data and accounting for categorical confidence. Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) aggregates cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. The framework demonstrates superior detection accuracy and reduced test-time latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Key Results
- RFOD achieves up to 9.1% gain in AUC-ROC compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- RFOD demonstrates 91.2% reduction in test-time latency
- RFOD consistently outperforms baselines in detection accuracy across 15 real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RFOD works by reframing anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction problem. By training dedicated Random Forests for each feature conditioned on the others, it can effectively handle heterogeneous data types while preserving semantic integrity. The Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD) adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for categorical confidence at the cell level, providing more accurate scoring. The Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) method then aggregates these cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores, improving overall detection precision and interpretability.

## Foundational Learning
- Random Forest: Ensemble learning method for classification and regression; needed for robust feature-wise conditional reconstruction; quick check: verify implementation correctly handles mixed data types
- Gower's Distance: Metric for mixed-type data similarity; needed for cell-level scoring; quick check: ensure AGD correctly adapts to skewed numerical distributions
- Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging: Method for aggregating scores with uncertainty consideration; needed for robust row-level anomaly scoring; quick check: validate UWA properly weights uncertain predictions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Data Preprocessing -> Feature-wise RF Training -> Cell-level Scoring (AGD) -> Row-level Aggregation (UWA) -> Outlier Detection

Critical path:
Feature-wise Random Forest training is the critical path, as it forms the basis for all subsequent scoring and aggregation steps. Efficient implementation of this component is crucial for overall framework performance.

Design tradeoffs:
- RFOD trades off computational complexity during training for improved detection accuracy and interpretability
- The feature-wise conditional reconstruction approach increases model complexity but allows for better handling of mixed-type data

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance on extremely high-dimensional datasets may indicate scalability issues with the feature-wise RF approach
- Inaccurate handling of missing values could lead to false positives or negatives in outlier detection

First experiments:
1. Benchmark RFOD against a simple baseline (e.g., Isolation Forest) on a small mixed-type dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of AGD and UWA to overall performance
3. Test RFOD's robustness to various missing data scenarios on a controlled dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of comprehensive evaluation on extremely high-dimensional datasets
- Potential scalability concerns with the Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging approach for very large datasets
- Framework's handling of missing values is not thoroughly addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence in the framework's ability to handle mixed-type data and achieve superior detection accuracy on tested datasets
- Medium confidence in the claimed latency improvements and interpretability benefits
- Low confidence in the framework's scalability to extremely large datasets and its robustness to missing values

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RFOD's performance on datasets with hundreds of features and millions of instances to assess scalability claims
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Adjusted Gower's Distance and Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging to overall performance
3. Test RFOD's robustness to various missing data scenarios and compare its handling of missing values to state-of-the-art baselines
