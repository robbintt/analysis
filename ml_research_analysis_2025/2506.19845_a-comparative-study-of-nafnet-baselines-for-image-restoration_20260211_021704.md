# A Comparative Study of NAFNet Baselines for Image Restoration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19845
- Authors: Vladislav Esaulov; M. Moein Esfahani
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: NAFNet baseline achieves PSNR 29.37 dB, SSIM 0.9565 on CIFAR10 with noise/blur

## Executive Summary
This study investigates NAFNet, a simplified baseline architecture for image restoration, using CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise and blur. The authors conducted an ablation study to evaluate the impact of key design choices: SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Attention (SCA), and LayerNormalization. Their results show that carefully streamlined architectures can deliver competitive restoration performance without heavy complexity, validating NAFNet's design philosophy for resource-constrained applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates NAFNet as a baseline architecture for image restoration through systematic ablation experiments. Using 32x32 CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise and blur, the authors test different configurations of activation functions (SimpleGate vs GELU), attention mechanisms (SCA vs ECA vs no attention), and normalization methods (LayerNorm vs GroupNorm). All models are trained using Mean Squared Error loss, with performance measured using PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Key Results
- Baseline model (SimpleGate + SCA + LayerNorm) achieved PSNR 29.37 dB and SSIM 0.9565
- Replacing SimpleGate with GELU slightly reduced performance
- Substituting SCA with ECA caused a more significant drop in restoration quality
- GroupNorm yielded marginally higher PSNR (29.38 dB) than LayerNorm for small-scale images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in the paper.

## Foundational Learning

**SimpleGate activation function**: A lightweight gating mechanism that controls information flow through neural networks. Why needed: Provides computational efficiency compared to traditional activations while maintaining representational power. Quick check: Verify that the activation introduces minimal computational overhead compared to ReLU or GELU.

**Simplified Channel Attention (SCA)**: A streamlined attention mechanism that captures cross-channel dependencies. Why needed: Enables the model to focus on important features without the complexity of full self-attention. Quick check: Confirm that SCA operates in linear time relative to channel dimensions.

**Layer Normalization vs Group Normalization**: Different approaches to normalizing activations across layers. Why needed: Normalization stabilizes training and can impact restoration quality. Quick check: Test whether normalization choice affects convergence speed and final performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input -> SimpleGate/GELU -> SCA/ECA/NoAttention -> LayerNorm/GroupNorm -> Output

**Critical path**: The forward pass follows a simplified U-Net structure with attention modules inserted at key locations, where normalization occurs after each attention block.

**Design tradeoffs**: The architecture prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over maximum possible performance, using simplified components that reduce computational complexity while maintaining competitive results.

**Failure signatures**: Removing attention entirely causes clear performance decline; using more complex components like ECA instead of SCA degrades performance, suggesting that over-engineering can harm results.

**First experiments**: 1) Test baseline model on different corruption types beyond noise and blur, 2) Compare runtime efficiency against established restoration methods, 3) Evaluate performance on higher-resolution images to test scalability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the component preferences identified (specifically GroupNorm over LayerNorm) generalize to high-resolution image restoration tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI lists "Benchmark on Higher-Resolution Data" (e.g., SIDD, GoPro) as future work to test if conclusions hold on larger images.
- Why unresolved: The study was limited to 32x32 CIFAR10 images, and the authors note that GroupNorm's superiority might be specific to "small-scale image restoration tasks."
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the ablation study on standard high-resolution benchmarks to see if GroupNorm maintains its marginal PSNR advantage over LayerNorm.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can alternative normalization methods, such as InstanceNorm or spatially-adaptive normalization, improve restoration consistency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI explicitly recommends evaluating "InstanceNorm or spatially-adaptive normalizations" in future work.
- Why unresolved: The study restricted the normalization ablation to a comparison between LayerNorm and GroupNorm.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the ablation study (Experiment A3) to include InstanceNorm and comparing the resulting PSNR and SSIM scores against the GroupNorm variant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating perceptual or adversarial losses significantly improve visual realism (lower LPIPS) without sacrificing PSNR?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI suggests "Enhanced Training Strategies" using these losses to target lower LPIPS scores.
- Why unresolved: The current models were trained solely using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, which often fails to capture perceptual quality effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Retraining the baseline model with a perceptual loss component and comparing the LPIPS scores against the MSE-trained baseline.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to CIFAR10 with only noise and blur corruption types
- Missing comparisons against established state-of-the-art restoration architectures
- Marginal PSNR improvement (0.01 dB) lacks statistical validation
- No runtime efficiency, memory usage, or power consumption analysis provided

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in relative ablation comparisons (activation and attention choices)
- Low confidence in absolute performance claims due to missing baseline comparisons
- Medium confidence in design philosophy validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the same ablation configurations on multiple datasets (Set5, Set14, DIV2K) and degradation types to assess generalizability
2. Include established state-of-the-art restoration methods in the comparison to properly contextualize performance claims
3. Conduct statistical significance testing with multiple runs and report standard deviations to verify that the GroupNorm improvement is not within measurement noise
