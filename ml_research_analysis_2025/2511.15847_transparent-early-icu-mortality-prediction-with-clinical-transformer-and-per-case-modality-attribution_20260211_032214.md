- Primary result: Multimodal late-fusion ensemble achieves AUPRC 0.565 and AUROC 0.891 on MIMIC-III ICU mortality prediction with calibrated fallback for missing modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a transparent multimodal ensemble for early ICU mortality prediction that combines physiological time-series measurements with clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. The method uses probability-level stacking via logistic regression on standardized logits from independently trained specialists: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This architecture enables multilevel interpretability through feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, the late-fusion ensemble achieves an AUPRC of 0.565 (versus 0.526 for the best single model) and AUROC of 0.891 (versus 0.876), while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing, demonstrating graceful degradation with only modest performance drops (AUPRC from 0.565 to 0.456-0.473 when either modality is absent).

## Method Summary
The approach trains two independent specialists on the same ICU cohort: a bidirectional LSTM processes 48-hour multivariate vitals time-series (76 features/hour) while a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer processes concatenated clinical notes (0-48hr). Both models are independently calibrated using isotonic regression. A logistic regression meta-learner combines their standardized logits at the probability level, enabling exact per-case modality attribution through coefficient-weighted logits. Integrated Gradients provides feature-level attributions within each specialist (all-zero baseline for vitals, PAD embeddings for notes), with aggregations forming risk-increasing vs. risk-reducing evidence. When a modality is missing, the calibrated fallback uses the available specialist's probability as the ensemble output.

## Key Results
- Multimodal ensemble achieves AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526 for best single model and AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876
- Per-case modality attributions enable direct quantification of vitals vs. notes contribution to each decision
- Calibrated fallback maintains reasonable performance when modalities are missing (AUPRC drops only to 0.456-0.473)
- All models show well-calibrated predictions with ECE values between 0.130-0.144

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Probability-level late fusion with a linear meta-learner improves discrimination while preserving modality-level interpretability.
- Mechanism: Independent specialist models (LSTM for vitals, ClinicalModernBERT for notes) produce calibrated probabilities that are converted to standardized logits and combined via logistic regression. The linear combination enables exact per-case decomposition of each modality's contribution via coefficient-weighted logits.
- Core assumption: Complementary errors across modalities—when one branch is uncertain or wrong, the other provides corrective signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models... This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability."
  - [section 3.3.2] Equation (2) shows `logit(p_meta) = b_eff + Σw_i·z_i`, enabling direct attribution.
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2510.11745) similarly emphasizes interpretability as essential for ICU mortality prediction.
- Break condition: If both modalities are systematically miscalibrated in the same direction, the ensemble may amplify rather than correct errors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Integrated Gradients (IG) provides feature-level attributions with formal sensitivity guarantees within each specialist.
- Mechanism: IG computes attribution by integrating gradients along a linear path from a baseline (zero sequence for vitals; PAD embeddings for notes) to the input. Attributions are aggregated to variable/timestep level for vitals and token level for notes, with sign indicating risk-increasing vs. risk-reducing evidence.
- Core assumption: The baseline represents "absence of information" and the linear integration path captures feature importance faithfully.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4.1] "The baseline x₀ is the all-zero sequence, consistent with the model's Masking layer, representing absence of measurements."
  - [section 3.4.1] For notes: "merge subword pieces into surface words... form negation-aware bigrams (e.g., 'denies pain', 'no insulin')."
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; corpus papers do not specifically evaluate IG against clinical ground truth.
- Break condition: Attribution quality degrades if the model relies on spurious correlations not grounded in clinical reality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Calibrated fallback ensures graceful degradation when a modality is missing.
- Mechanism: Each specialist is independently calibrated (via isotonic regression selected on validation ECE). When one modality is absent, the system uses the calibrated probability from the available specialist as the ensemble output.
- Core assumption: Single-modality calibrated predictions remain reliable when the ensemble cannot fuse both sources.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing."
  - [section 4.5] AUPRC drops from 0.565 to 0.456–0.473 under missing modalities, with stable calibration metrics (ECE 0.133–0.144).
  - [corpus] Related multimodal ICU work (arXiv:2512.19716) does not explicitly report missing-modality robustness.
- Break condition: If the missing modality contained the primary discriminative signal for a subset of patients, the fallback may produce systematically misaligned risk estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Late fusion vs. early/intermediate fusion**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why the authors chose probability-level stacking over joint representation learning clarifies the interpretability–accuracy tradeoff.
  - Quick check question: If you wanted cross-modal attention between vitals and notes, would you still get per-case modality attribution for free?

- **Concept: Probability calibration (Brier score, ECE, reliability diagrams)**
  - Why needed here: Clinical decisions depend on well-calibrated probabilities; the paper reports calibration explicitly and uses post-hoc calibration.
  - Quick check question: A model with AUROC 0.95 and ECE 0.30—is it clinically useful if the threshold is 0.5?

- **Concept: Integrated Gradients baselines**
  - Why needed here: IG attributions depend on baseline choice; understanding this helps interpret the vitals and notes explanations correctly.
  - Quick check question: For a vitals model with masking at zero, what does a negative attribution on an imputed "normal" value mean?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Vitals branch: 48-hour multivariate sequence (76 features/hour) → Bidirectional LSTM (8 units) + unidirectional LSTM (16 units) → sigmoid output
  - Notes branch: Concatenated 0–48hr text (≤8192 tokens) → Finetuned ClinicalModernBERT → [CLS] → classification head
  - Meta-learner: Standardized logits from both branches → Logistic regression → calibrated probability
  - Explainability: IG for each branch + coefficient-based modality attribution at fusion layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocess vitals using Harutyunyan et al. pipeline (resampling, imputation, masking)
  2. Preprocess notes using Khadanga et al. pipeline (concatenate 0–48hr, exclude invalid chart times)
  3. Train specialists independently; calibrate each on validation set
  4. Train logistic meta-learner on validation-set logits; evaluate on held-out test

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Linear meta-learner: Enables exact attribution but cannot model nonlinear interactions between modalities
  - Independent specialist training: Decouples maintenance but prevents cross-modal representation learning
  - 48-hour window: Standardized benchmark but may miss earlier prediction opportunities

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Ensemble underperforms best single model → check logit standardization; verify meta-learner trained on out-of-sample predictions
  - Attributions highlight noise (e.g., stopwords) → revisit baseline choice or apply stricter pruning
  - Large calibration error at deployment → recalibrate on local data; check for distribution shift

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate the LSTM + ft_ClinicalModernBERT ensemble on the provided MIMIC-III splits; verify AUPRC ~0.565 and calibration metrics match Table 3.
  2. Ablate the meta-learner: compare LOGREG vs. AVG vs. MLP on the same specialist pair to quantify interpretability cost (if any).
  3. Stress-test missing-modality robustness: randomly drop notes at inference with varying probabilities and plot AUPRC degradation curve.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the multimodal ensemble maintain its discrimination (AUPRC ~0.565) and calibration advantages when validated on external ICU datasets such as MIMIC-IV, eICU, or institutional cohorts with different documentation practices?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "External validation on other ICU datasets would assess generalizability of both predictive performance and the explainability framework."
- Why unresolved: The study uses only MIMIC-III from a single center; the authors acknowledge this limits generalizability across institutions, patient populations, and clinical workflows.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the experimental protocol on MIMIC-IV, eICU-CRD, or other ICU databases, reporting AUPRC, AUROC, and calibration metrics with confidence intervals.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do modality contributions and ensemble performance shift when the prediction window is reduced from 48 hours to earlier horizons (6, 12, or 24 hours), where clinical notes may be sparser or absent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Evaluating at earlier decision horizons (for example, 6, 12, and 24 hours) would clarify how modality shifts when data accumulates."
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates at 48 hours; clinical value for earlier intervention requires understanding performance trajectories as data accrues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating separate models for 6h, 12h, and 24h windows, reporting per-horizon performance metrics and modality share distributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can per-case uncertainty estimates be integrated to enable selective abstention, and does this improve clinical utility by flagging high-uncertainty predictions for clinician review?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Integrating per-case uncertainty estimates would enable selective abstention, allowing the system to defer high-uncertainty predictions to clinicians."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture produces point predictions without confidence bounds; no mechanism exists to withhold predictions when evidence is ambiguous.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of uncertainty quantification (e.g., MC dropout, deep ensembles), calibration of uncertainty thresholds, and measurement of downstream clinical utility when abstention is allowed.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the ensemble degrade under realistic data quality perturbations such as variable clinical notes length, documentation style shifts, or high ratios of imputed versus observed vitals?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors evaluate only deterministic modality absence; they note that "robustness evaluation can be broadened... to include variability in clinical notes length and coverage, distribution shifts in clinical language, and the ratio of imputed versus observed vitals."
- Why unresolved: Real deployments face partial degradation rather than complete modality loss, yet this was not systematically evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying notes length, introducing synthetic distribution shifts in vocabulary, and subsampling vitals to increase imputation rates, with performance and calibration tracked across conditions.

## Limitations
- Performance validation limited to single-center MIMIC-III dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Missing training hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, epochs) may affect exact reproducibility
- Attribution quality depends on baseline choice and may not reflect true clinical relevance without expert validation

## Confidence
- **High**: Multimodal late-fusion architecture design and its impact on interpretability; ensemble calibration methodology; AUPRC improvement over single models (0.565 vs 0.526)
- **Medium**: Integrated Gradients attribution quality and clinical validity; exact performance numbers given missing hyperparameters
- **Low**: Clinical utility of specific attributions without expert validation; generalizability beyond MIMIC-III population

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct the exact cohort filtering and preprocessing pipeline to verify episode counts match (10,978 train / 2,435 val / 2,448 test)
2. Perform ablation studies comparing LOGREG, AVG, and MLP meta-learners on the same specialist pair to quantify interpretability costs
3. Stress-test the calibrated fallback mechanism by systematically removing notes during inference and measuring performance degradation across varying missing rates
