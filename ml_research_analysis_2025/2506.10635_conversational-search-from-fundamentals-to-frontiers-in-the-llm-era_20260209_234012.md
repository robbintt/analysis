## Executive Summary
This tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of conversational search systems, bridging foundational concepts with emerging LLM-driven advancements. The tutorial addresses the challenge of understanding context-dependent user queries in multi-turn conversations, where traditional keyword-based search falls short. It covers two main paradigms: query-rewriting-based retrieval, which reformulates conversational queries into self-contained forms, and conversational dense retrieval, which encodes queries within their conversational context into contextualized embeddings. The tutorial also explores mixed-initiative strategies, where systems proactively clarify ambiguities or provide suggestions. With the rise of LLMs, new directions such as generation-augmented retrieval (GAR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agentic conversational search are introduced, enabling more dynamic and personalized interactions. The tutorial aims to equip researchers and practitioners with both theoretical foundations and practical insights into next-generation conversational search systems.

## Method Summary
The tutorial synthesizes two main paradigms for conversational search: (1) Query-rewriting-based retrieval, which reformulates context-dependent queries into self-contained forms using expansion or sequence generation with PLMs; and (2) Conversational dense retrieval, which encodes the full conversation history with the current query into contextualized embeddings. LLM-era methods include GAR (generating pseudo data to enrich search space), RAG (grounding responses in retrieved evidence to reduce hallucinations), and agentic search with planning capabilities. The tutorial provides theoretical frameworks and practical insights but lacks specific implementation details, requiring consultation of cited papers for reproduction.

## Key Results
- Conversational search systems must resolve context-dependent user queries through either explicit rewriting or implicit encoding
- LLM integration enables generation-augmented retrieval (GAR) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for more dynamic interactions
- Mixed-initiative strategies allow systems to proactively clarify ambiguities or provide suggestions
- Agentic conversational search represents an emerging frontier with intelligent planning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Resolving context-dependent intent via explicit rewriting or implicit encoding bridges the gap between ambiguous multi-turn user inputs and standard retrieval indexes.
- **Mechanism:** The system either generates a de-contextualized "standalone" query (Query Rewriting) or encodes the conversation history jointly with the current query into a contextualized vector (Conversational Dense Retrieval). This allows the retriever to match relevant documents even when the user's latest utterance lacks specific keywords.
- **Core assumption:** Users naturally engage in ellipsis and co-reference, assuming the system maintains state; retrievers require self-contained representations to function effectively.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...understanding context-dependent user queries... covers two main paradigms: query-rewriting-based retrieval... and conversational dense retrieval..."
  - [section] "Part I: Fundamentals... Recovering the underlying information need from conversational history is a key challenge... two main approaches... query-rewriting-based retrieval... [and] conversational dense retrieval."
  - [corpus] "Query Understanding in LLM-based Conversational Information Seeking" supports the difficulty of resolving ambiguities and refining queries in this context.
- **Break condition:** If the retriever's index is significantly out-of-domain or the conversation history exceeds the model's context window limit, these methods may fail to retrieve relevant novel information.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the retrieval loop via Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) potentially addresses sparse or ambiguous query terms by expanding the search space with generated context.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of solely relying on the user's limited words, the system uses an LLM to generate pseudo-documents, query expansions, or hypothetical answers. These generated terms are then used to query the index, enriching the semantic matching capability beyond the original input.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient parametric knowledge to generate relevant expansions or "hallucinations" that align with the target corpus domain.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Part II... Conversational generation-augmented retrieval (GAR)... can enhance the search systems by generating pseudo data... producing fluent and consistent interaction... and decomposing complex or instruction-based queries."
  - [abstract] "...new directions such as generation-augmented retrieval (GAR)... enabling more dynamic and personalized interactions."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals regarding "Adaptive Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval" suggest generating context is key for complex needs, though specific GAR mechanisms are not detailed in the provided neighbors.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM hallucinates convincing but factually incorrect expansions, retrieval may retrieve plausible but non-factual documents, reinforcing errors.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) likely reduces hallucination rates by grounding the LLM's final response in evidence retrieved from an external, authoritative corpus.
- **Mechanism:** The system retrieves documents based on the conversation context first. These documents are injected into the LLM's prompt as context. The LLM then generates an answer conditioned on both the user query and the retrieved text, anchoring the output in specific evidence.
- **Core assumption:** The retrieval step successfully fetches relevant, high-quality evidence; the LLM can effectively synthesize this evidence without ignoring it in favor of its parametric memory.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Conversational RAG... integrates conversational search results into the prompt... improving truthfulness... by grounding answers in the retrieved documents, thus reducing hallucinations."
  - [abstract] "...retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)... enabling more dynamic... interactions."
  - [corpus] "Evolving Paradigms in Task-Based Search..." notes LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning without support, implying RAG as the fix.
- **Break condition:** If the retrieval step fails (e.g., returns irrelevant docs), the LLM may disregard the context ("negative retrieval") or generate a confused response, degrading performance compared to a parametric-only approach.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Contextual Query Embedding (Dense Retrieval)**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike keyword search, conversational dense retrieval requires encoding the entire conversation history into a vector to capture intent.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a vector representing "How much is it?" requires the previous turn's context "The new iPhone" to be mathematically useful?

- **Concept:** **Mixed-Initiative Interaction**
  - **Why needed here:** Systems must decide *when* to ask clarifying questions rather than guessing, a core component of the "Part I" fundamentals described.
  - **Quick check question:** If a user asks "Is it good?", should the system immediately retrieve reviews or ask "What specifically are you referring to?"?

- **Concept:** **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the central architecture for the "Emerging Topics" section, bridging search results with generative AI.
  - **Quick check question:** In a RAG pipeline, does the retriever feed the generator, or does the generator feed the retriever?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Multi-turn Chat History + Current Query
  - Context Handler: (Option A) Query Rewriter OR (Option B) Conversational Encoder
  - Retriever: Dense Index (Vector DB) or Sparse Index (Search Engine)
  - Generator (LLM): Takes retrieved chunks + context -> Generates response/clarification
  - Decision Module: Predicts if a clarification is needed (Mixed-Initiative)

- **Critical path:** The **Query Resolution** step (rewriting or encoding). If the system fails to resolve "Who is the CEO?" to "Who is the CEO of [Company discussed previously]?", the retrieval fails, and the subsequent generation is hallucinated or irrelevant.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Rewriting vs. Dense Retrieval:** Rewriting allows using standard off-the-shelf search engines (easier integration) but introduces error propagation if the rewrite is bad. Dense Retrieval is end-to-end optimizable but requires training specific models and maintaining a vector index.
  - **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Asking too many clarifying questions (Mixed-Initiative) improves precision but increases user friction.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Lost Context" Error:** The system answers the last query correctly but ignores constraints from 3 turns ago (e.g., "cheap", "nearby").
  - **Hallucinated grounding:** The system cites a retrieved document that doesn't actually contain the answer, or answers from internal weights despite irrelevant retrieval.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Rewrite Validation:** Implement a simple LLM-based query rewriter. Feed conversational queries into it and manually inspect if the "standalone" queries are factually consistent with the conversation history.
  2. **Dense vs. Sparse Baseline:** Compare a baseline that uses only the last user utterance (sparse retrieval) vs. one that uses the full context (dense/rewritten) on a dataset like TREC CAsT to measure the performance drop from missing context.
  3. **Clarification Trigger:** Build a binary classifier (or simple prompt) to detect ambiguous queries. If triggered, return a clarifying question instead of search results, and measure if this improves subsequent retrieval relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are the effective concrete solutions for determining the optimal timing and method for collaboration between retrieval and generation components in a single conversational system?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states that while collaboration between retrieval and generation is expected, "concrete solutions in conversational search are still under-explored, e.g., to determine the right time and way to do it."
- **Why unresolved:** Integrating GAR (Generation-Augmented Retrieval) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) involves complex dynamic dependencies that standard models have not yet mastered or standardized.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A framework capable of dynamically switching between or combining retrieval and generation based on real-time query intent and conversational state.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can user profiles and historical preferences be dynamically incorporated into each turn of a conversation without compromising efficiency?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify the "additional challenge lies in dynamically incorporating users’ profiles, preferences, or history into each turn" for personalized conversational search.
- **Why unresolved:** Static user representations may fail to capture shifting intent in multi-turn dialogues, while standard LLM context windows struggle with long-term preference history.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Architectures that can update query representations in real-time using live user data without significant latency or context loss.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can agentic systems effectively perform intelligent planning to decompose and execute complex user information tasks via search?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper highlights "agentic conversational search" where systems "dynamically perform search via intelligent planning until satisfying the users."
- **Why unresolved:** This requires moving beyond reactive retrieval to proactive, multi-step reasoning and action execution, which remains a frontier capability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrations of systems autonomously decomposing complex instructions into iterative search actions to complete multi-step tasks.

- Key architectural choices and training procedures are not specified
- Performance claims lack specific quantitative evidence without access to original research papers

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the identification of core challenges (context dependency, query ambiguity) and the two main paradigms (query rewriting and conversational dense retrieval)
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed LLM-era solutions (GAR, RAG, agentic search) due to limited technical depth in the tutorial format
- **Low confidence** in specific performance claims or architectural details without access to the original research papers

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the query-rewriting baseline on TREC CAsT 2021 using an off-the-shelf LLM and compare nDCG@3 scores against conversational dense retrieval baselines
2. Test context window limits by systematically varying conversation history length in dense retrieval experiments and measuring embedding quality degradation
3. Implement and evaluate a mixed-initiative clarification system that predicts when to ask clarifying questions versus proceeding with retrieval
