# PIKAN: Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Explainable UAV Channel Modelling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06355
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06355
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKAN) achieve competitive accuracy to deep learning models while providing symbolic, physically aligned expressions for UAV channel modeling, with only 232 parameters—37× lighter than MLP baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PIKAN, a novel Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network designed for explainable air-to-ground (A2G) channel modeling in UAV communications. By embedding physical principles such as free-space path loss and two-ray reflections into the learning process, PIKAN achieves both high accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data demonstrate that PIKAN performs competitively with deep learning models while generating symbolic expressions aligned with physical laws. The model's extreme parameter efficiency (232 parameters) makes it particularly attractive for resource-constrained UAV systems.

## Method Summary
PIKAN combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture with physics-inspired constraints, using physics-based loss terms to guide learning toward interpretable solutions. The approach leverages inductive biases from physical models (free-space path loss, two-ray reflection) to improve both accuracy and explainability. The model is trained using a symbolic retraining process that refines learned parameters while maintaining physical consistency, enabling the generation of closed-form expressions that align with underlying propagation physics.

## Key Results
- PIKAN achieves correlation coefficient of 0.92 with measurement data, competitive with deep learning models
- Model uses only 232 parameters, 37× fewer than multilayer perceptron baselines
- Generates symbolic expressions that align with physical propagation models (free-space path loss, two-ray reflections)
- Maintains high accuracy while providing interpretable, physics-aligned channel models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PIKAN works by integrating physics-inspired inductive biases directly into the KAN architecture through specialized loss functions. The physics-based constraints guide the learning process toward solutions that respect fundamental propagation principles, reducing the solution space to physically meaningful regions. This approach combines the universal approximation capabilities of KANs with domain knowledge from wireless propagation theory, resulting in models that are both accurate and interpretable. The symbolic retraining process further refines the model while preserving physical consistency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs):** Function representation using continuous compositions; needed for flexible yet structured modeling; quick check: verify KAN's universal approximation capability.
- **Physics-Informed Learning:** Integration of physical laws into neural network training; needed to ensure physically consistent predictions; quick check: validate physics-based loss terms.
- **Free-Space Path Loss:** Theoretical model for signal attenuation; needed as baseline propagation model; quick check: compare model predictions to free-space predictions.
- **Two-Ray Reflection Model:** Model accounting for ground reflection effects; needed for realistic A2G channel modeling; quick check: verify two-ray components in symbolic expressions.
- **Symbolic Regression:** Process of finding interpretable mathematical expressions; needed for model explainability; quick check: validate generated expressions against physical principles.
- **UAV Channel Measurement:** Empirical data collection for air-to-ground communications; needed for model validation; quick check: assess correlation with measurement datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Features -> KAN Layers -> Physics-Based Loss Terms -> Symbolic Retraining -> Output Expression

**Critical Path:**
Input features → KAN layer transformations → Physics-informed regularization → Parameter optimization → Symbolic expression generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs interpretability: Physics constraints improve interpretability but may limit maximum accuracy
- Model complexity vs efficiency: 232 parameters achieve good performance but may not capture all nuances
- Generalizability vs specialization: Physics-based approach may not adapt well to non-LoS scenarios

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degraded performance when physics assumptions (LoS, two-ray model) are violated
- Symbolic retraining instability in models with complex physical constraints
- Limited effectiveness in environments with significant non-LoS components

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate KAN performance on synthetic data with known physical relationships
2. Compare PIKAN with standard KAN without physics constraints
3. Test symbolic expression accuracy against ground truth physical models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific mechanisms cause the performance degradation in the Symbolic PIKAN-2R model during affine parameter retraining, and how can this instability be mitigated?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in Section 6 and Table 2 that retraining the Symbolic PIKAN-2R model leads to a significantly higher error (MAE 8.816) compared to the base model, explicitly calling it an "open issue."
- **Why unresolved:** The current retraining strategy (Algorithm 1) fails to converge or stabilizes at a poor local minimum when combining two-ray constraints with symbolic refinement.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified retraining algorithm or regularization technique that allows the PIKAN-2R model to improve or maintain accuracy after symbolic fixing.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the PIKAN framework perform on diverse UAV environments, such as urban or obstacle-heavy settings, compared to the rural dataset used?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The "Conclusions and Future Work" section explicitly lists "cross-dataset experiments" as a necessary extension due to the current scarcity of open UAV datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The model is currently validated only on a specific rural A2G dataset (AERPAW); it is unknown if the physics-inspired inductive biases hold in complex NLoS or urban scenarios.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of the proposed PIKAN models on independent urban or indoor UAV channel datasets without architecture modification.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does PIKAN offer superior learning flexibility and accuracy compared to standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for channel modeling?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors claim PIKAN is more flexible than PINNs but list "Benchmarking with PINN" as a specific item for future work.
- **Why unresolved:** While theoretically motivated, the paper lacks empirical comparison against PINNs, making the claimed advantages in "learning flexibility" hypothetical.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study showing PIKAN and PINN performance on the same A2G dataset, particularly when measurement data deviates from theoretical assumptions.

## Limitations
- **LoS restriction:** Model focuses exclusively on Line-of-Sight UAV communications, limiting applicability to NLoS environments
- **Dataset dependency:** Validation relies on a specific rural UAV measurement dataset, raising questions about generalizability
- **Architecture specialization:** Physics-inspired design may not easily adapt to different propagation scenarios or environments
- **Symbolic approximation:** Generated expressions may not capture all nuances of real-world propagation

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- High: The model's parameter efficiency (232 parameters, 37× lighter than MLP) and the embedding of physical principles into the learning process are well-supported by the experimental results and methodology description
- Medium: The claim of achieving competitive accuracy to deep learning models while providing symbolic expressions requires further validation across diverse UAV communication scenarios and against a wider range of deep learning architectures
- Medium: The interpretability and explainability of the generated symbolic expressions, while aligned with physical principles, may require domain expert validation to ensure the expressions are truly meaningful and useful in practice

## Next Checks
1. Test PIKAN's performance on UAV communication datasets that include significant non-LoS conditions and complex propagation environments (e.g., urban canyons, foliage) to assess robustness beyond LoS scenarios
2. Benchmark PIKAN against a broader range of deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, CNN, Transformer-based models) on UAV A2G channel modeling tasks to validate claims of competitive accuracy
3. Conduct a user study with wireless communication domain experts to evaluate the practical interpretability and utility of the symbolic expressions generated by PIKAN in real-world UAV communication system design and troubleshooting
