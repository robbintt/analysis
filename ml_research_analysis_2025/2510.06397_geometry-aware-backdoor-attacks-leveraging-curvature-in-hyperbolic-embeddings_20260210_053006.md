# Geometry-Aware Backdoor Attacks: Leveraging Curvature in Hyperbolic Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06397
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06397
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** Achieves 97% ASR on 20newsgroups vs 62.7% Euclidean baselines while maintaining >95% clean accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a geometry-specific vulnerability in hyperbolic neural networks where non-uniform curvature creates regions where backdoor triggers can be simultaneously more effective and harder to detect than in Euclidean space. The conformal factor in hyperbolic geometry means that near the boundary, small input-space perturbations induce disproportionately large shifts in representation space while appearing subtle to standard input-space detectors. The authors propose a geometry-adaptive trigger that scales based on local metric distortion, making it more effective near the boundary where metric sensitivity is highest.

## Method Summary
The attack targets hyperbolic neural networks using the Poincaré ball model, exploiting the conformal factor λx = 2/(1-||x||²) that creates non-uniform metric distortion. The proposed method uses position-adaptive sparse triggers (30% sparsity) with conformal scaling s(x) = α(1-||x||²)^β, designed to be more effective near the boundary where metric sensitivity is highest. The attack is evaluated on 5-class text classification from 20newsgroups, with data preprocessed through TF-IDF, SVD to 50 dimensions, and radial redistribution to [0.2, 0.5] and [0.5, 0.85] regions. The attack achieves 97% success rate with >95% clean accuracy using 5% poisoning rate.

## Key Results
- 97% attack success rate on 20newsgroups vs 62.7% for Euclidean baselines
- Attack success increases toward boundary (93% at center vs 97% at boundary)
- Only 15.2% detection rate versus 45.8% for Euclidean approaches
- Conformal scaling is the dominant factor (ablation shows -12.5% ASR when removed)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Boundary-Amplified Trigger Effect
Small input-space perturbations near the Poincaré ball boundary produce disproportionately large shifts in hyperbolic representation space while appearing subtle to Euclidean-Lipschitz detectors. The conformal factor creates non-uniform metric distortion, scaling geodesic displacement as κ/δ(x) where δ(x) = 1-||x|| is the Euclidean margin to boundary.

### Mechanism 2: Linear Decay of Detectability in Boundary Shell
For Euclidean-Lipschitz detectors, maximum detectable change shrinks linearly with shell width δ near the boundary. The detectability bound becomes 2LE·δ·tanh(s/2), vanishing as δ → 0 when approaching the boundary.

### Mechanism 3: Defense-Utility Trade-off for Radial Defenses
Any radial defense that successfully recovers triggered inputs must induce proportional displacement on clean inputs, causing predictable utility loss. Defense effectiveness directly trades off with model sensitivity along radial directions, with output deviations scaling linearly with trigger size.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Poincaré Ball Model**
  - **Why needed here:** The attack exploits the specific metric structure of this hyperbolic model. You cannot reason about boundary effects without understanding how λx scales distances.
  - **Quick check question:** For a point at ||x|| = 0.9, what is the conformal factor λx? (Answer: 2/(1-0.81) ≈ 10.5)

- **Concept: Geodesics and Parallel Transport**
  - **Why needed here:** The trigger design uses radial geodesics and mentions parallel transport P0→x for general trigger patterns.
  - **Quick check question:** In the Poincaré ball, does a straight line (Euclidean) between two points equal the geodesic? (Answer: No, except for lines through the origin)

- **Concept: Backdoor Attack Formulation**
  - **Why needed here:** Distinguishes this from adversarial attacks. Backdoors require training-time poisoning and persist post-deployment.
  - **Quick check question:** What two metrics define backdoor success? (Answer: Attack Success Rate on triggered inputs; Clean Accuracy preservation)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input preprocessing (TF-IDF → SVD → radial redistribution) -> Trigger module (adaptive scaling + sparse direction) -> Classifier (hyperbolic feedforward network) -> Defense (Z-score/MAD outlier detection)

- **Critical path:** Conformal scaling is the dominant factor (ablation shows -12.5% ASR when removed). Adaptive sample selection (-8.8%) and sparsity (-12.5%) are secondary but non-negligible.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Higher β (curvature adaptation) → better boundary stealth but more complex trigger synthesis. Higher poisoning rate → higher ASR but increased detection risk. Radial defense strength α → better trigger suppression but proportional clean-accuracy degradation.

- **Failure signatures:** Attack fails (ASR < 70%) likely indicates trigger not reaching boundary region. High detection (>30%) suggests trigger may be too dense. Clean accuracy drops indicate possible over-poisoning.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify boundary amplification: Plot ASR vs. radial position bins (center/middle/boundary). Confirm ASR increases with ||x||.
  2. Detector comparison: Test Euclidean-Lipschitz detector vs. hyperbolic-aware detector. Expect detection rate to diverge near boundary.
  3. Defense trade-off curve: Vary radial defense strength α and measure both trigger suppression rate and clean-accuracy drop. Confirm linear trade-off predicted by Theorem 2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can non-radial or geometry-aware defense mechanisms suppress boundary-exploiting triggers without incurring the utility trade-off that radial defenses must accept? The proof applies only to radial defenses; whether fundamentally different defense architectures could avoid this trade-off is unknown.

### Open Question 2
Do the attack success and detection-evasion patterns observed on artificially redistributed text data generalize to datasets with naturally occurring hierarchical or tree-like structure? The controlled radial redistribution isolates geometric effects but may not reflect how naturally hierarchical data distributes across the Poincaré ball.

### Open Question 3
What detection rates can be achieved by detectors designed to be Lipschitz in the hyperbolic metric rather than the Euclidean metric? The theoretical analysis suggests hyperbolic-aware detectors should be more effective, but no experiments validate whether such detectors can be practically implemented and trained while maintaining reasonable false positive rates.

## Limitations

- **Geometric detector assumptions:** The stealth advantage critically depends on detectors being Euclidean-Lipschitz. If detectors operate in hyperbolic metric, the boundary amplification effect vanishes.

- **Sparse trigger synthesis:** While Equation 4 describes the optimization framework, the exact sparse trigger pattern is not specified, representing a significant gap for exact reproduction.

- **Architecture details:** The hyperbolic classifier architecture is only partially described, limiting precise replication of results.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The theoretical framework around conformal scaling and boundary amplification (Theorem 1) is mathematically sound and well-supported.
- **Medium confidence:** Empirical results showing 97% ASR vs 62.7% Euclidean baselines are convincing but depend on exact implementation details.
- **Medium confidence:** The defense-utility trade-off analysis (Theorem 2) provides valuable theoretical insight, though real-world effectiveness may vary.

## Next Checks

1. **Detector metric validation:** Implement both Euclidean-Lipschitz and hyperbolic-Lipschitz detectors. Measure detection rates across the radial spectrum (center, middle, boundary) to test the core assumption about detector geometry.

2. **Sparse trigger synthesis reproducibility:** Using the optimization framework in Equation 4, attempt to reproduce the exact 30% sparse trigger pattern. Compare ASR and detection rates with the original.

3. **Defense trade-off curve measurement:** Systematically vary radial defense strength α and measure both trigger suppression rate and clean-accuracy degradation. Plot these against each other to empirically validate the linear trade-off predicted by Theorem 2.
