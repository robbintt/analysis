## Executive Summary
This study presents the first human evaluation of activation steering, a technique for controlling the emotional tone of large language model (LLM) outputs by directly modifying internal activations. Over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants were collected to assess perceived emotional intensity and text quality across six basic emotions and eight steering strengths. Results show that moderate steering intensities reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust (η²p=0.616) and fear (η²p=0.540). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC=0.71–0.87), and human ratings closely aligned with model-based quality assessments (mean r=0.776). These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

## Method Summary
The study used a two-phase approach: first, contrastive activation vectors were extracted from the 20 billion parameter MPT-7B model using a corpus of 30,000 GoEmotions-labeled texts, creating per-layer style vectors for six basic emotions. Second, these vectors were injected during inference at various strengths (λ=0.0 to 0.35) while generating text continuations from 26 emotion-labeled prompts. The resulting 1,560 generated texts were evaluated by 190 crowd-workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, who rated emotional intensity and comprehensibility on 7-point Likert scales. Model-based evaluations used DistilRoBERTa classifiers and GPT-4-based quality scoring to compare with human judgments.

## Key Results
- Moderate steering intensities (λ≈0.15) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility
- Disgust and fear showed the strongest steering effects (η²p=0.616 and 0.540 respectively)
- Human ratings closely aligned with model-based quality assessments (mean r=0.776)
- Steering effectiveness varied dramatically across emotions, with surprise showing minimal response (η²p=0.042)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Style concepts (e.g., emotions) appear to have directionally consistent representations in LLM activation space that can be extracted via contrastive averaging.
- Mechanism: Mean activations from samples labeled with a target style are contrasted with mean activations from non-target styles, producing per-layer vectors that encode stylistic differences (Equation 1).
- Core assumption: Styles are linearly separable directions in activation space rather than distributed non-linear patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Activation steering provides a lightweight alternative... by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation."
  - [section III] "This vector encodes a direction in activation space that characterizes the unique traits of the target style t at each layer."
  - [corpus] Related work (Rimsky et al., Turner et al.) uses similar contrastive activation approaches; corpus supports mechanistic plausibility but not proof of linear separability.
- Break condition: If target and contrastive styles have overlapping or non-linear representations, the difference vector may capture corpus artifacts rather than the intended style direction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding scaled style vectors to activations during inference modulates output properties along the target dimension.
- Mechanism: At each generation step, the pre-computed style vector is added to layer activations: â^(i)(x) = a^(i)(x) + λ·v^(i)(t) (Equation 2). The scalar λ controls intensity.
- Core assumption: Perturbing activations does not push the model outside regions supporting coherent generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moderate steering strengths (λ≈0.15) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility."
  - [section VI-C] "Steering intensities up to λ≈0.15 preserve surface form and clarity, but stronger interventions progressively degrade text quality."
  - [corpus] "Steering off course" (da Silva et al.) documents reliability challenges at higher intensities, confirming the fragility assumption.
- Break condition: When λ exceeds quality thresholds (emotion-specific, typically >0.2–0.35), coherence degrades—entropy drops, lexical density changes, and comprehensibility declines sharply.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human perception of steered emotional tone correlates with both steering strength and model-based emotion classification, but with systematic differences.
- Mechanism: Increasing λ monotonically increases perceived emotional intensity for most emotions, but humans apply conservative upper bounds and perceive overlapping emotions (e.g., anger→disgust+sadness), whereas classifiers show sharper selectivity.
- Core assumption: Human emotion perception in text follows the Ekman six-basic-emotion model and can be captured via continuous intensity ratings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that moderate steering intensities reliably amplify target emotions... with the strongest effects for disgust (η²p=0.616) and fear (η²p=0.540)."
  - [section VI-B] "The average Pearson correlation was r=.776, suggesting a generally strong relationship between human perception and model output."
  - [corpus] "Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli" reports similar human-model alignment findings.
- Break condition: For emotions like surprise (η²p=0.042), steering effects are minimal—likely due to dataset representation or fundamental differences in how this emotion is encoded/expressed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Activation Space Representations**
  - Why needed here: Style vectors operate on hidden state activations; understanding that semantic/conceptual properties may be linearly encoded is prerequisite to grasping why contrastive differencing works.
  - Quick check question: If you computed the mean activation for "joyful" texts and subtracted the mean for "neutral" texts, what would the resulting vector conceptually represent?

- Concept: **Contrastive Methods**
  - Why needed here: The style vector is not computed from positive examples alone but from the difference between target and contrastive activations—this removes shared content and isolates style.
  - Quick check question: Why might using only positive examples (without contrastive subtraction) produce a vector that captures content rather than style?

- Concept: **Effect Size (η²p) and Correlation Interpretation**
  - Why needed here: The paper reports η²p for steering effectiveness and r for human-model alignment; understanding these metrics is essential for comparing across emotions and methods.
  - Quick check question: If disgust has η²p=0.616 and surprise has η²p=0.042, what does this imply about the proportion of variance explained by steering in each case?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Labeled corpus -> Forward pass per sample -> Per-layer activation collection -> Mean aggregation per style -> Contrastive differencing (target - contrastive mean) -> Store per-layer vectors -> Input prompt -> Forward pass -> At each layer, add λ·v^(i)(t) to activations -> Generate next token -> Repeat -> Human ratings + automatic classifier + comprehensibility scorer

- Critical path: Vector quality depends on corpus labeling accuracy and representativeness; inference steering depends on λ calibration and layer selection. The paper uses all-layer injection with shared λ.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher λ → stronger emotional signal but degraded coherence
  - Layer selection (all vs. subset) → affects both steering magnitude and quality
  - Dataset balance → imbalanced GoEmotions may bias vectors toward majority classes, though the paper notes frequency alone doesn't predict steerability

- Failure signatures:
  - High λ (>0.25–0.35): Reduced entropy, lower comprehensibility, semantic incoherence
  - Surprise steering: Near-zero effect regardless of λ—may indicate fundamental limitation
  - Cross-emotion bleeding: Anger steering increases perceived disgust/sadness in humans (not captured by classifier)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline calibration**: Generate outputs at λ∈{0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3} for a single target emotion (e.g., fear) using a fixed prompt set; evaluate with classifier and human rating to establish your model's quality threshold.
  2. **Layer sensitivity**: Apply steering to different layer ranges (e.g., early-only, middle-only, all) at fixed λ to test the paper's claim that layers 18–20 are particularly style-relevant (based on prior work).
  3. **Cross-emotion validation**: Test whether your extracted vectors for one emotion produce unintended effects on other emotion dimensions—measure both classifier scores and human perception to detect the overlapping-emotion phenomenon reported in the paper.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study demonstrates reliable steering for disgust and fear but shows minimal effect for surprise (η²p=0.042), suggesting fundamental limitations in capturing certain emotions through activation steering.
- Corpus imbalance in GoEmotions raises concerns about whether observed steering effectiveness correlates with emotion frequency or represents genuine mechanistic differences.
- Human ratings show systematic differences from classifier outputs—humans perceive anger as disgust+sadness, which the classifier misses—indicating incomplete capture of emotion perception.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Activation steering reliably amplifies disgust and fear at moderate intensities (λ≈0.15), supported by large effect sizes (η²p=0.616 and 0.540) and strong human-model alignment (r=0.776).
- **Medium confidence**: The quality degradation threshold at higher intensities is well-documented, but emotion-specific thresholds vary (0.2–0.35 range), and the exact boundaries depend on prompt complexity and evaluation metrics.
- **Low confidence**: The surprise emotion shows negligible steering response regardless of intensity, and the underlying reasons (dataset representation vs. fundamental encoding differences) remain unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Surprise emotion probe**: Design a controlled experiment with balanced surprise-labeled prompts and explicit syntactic markers to test whether steering failure is due to corpus bias or fundamental encoding differences.
2. **Cross-corpus replication**: Apply the same style vectors to a different emotional dataset (e.g., SemEval-2018 Task 1) to assess generalization and identify corpus-specific artifacts.
3. **Temporal stability test**: Generate steered outputs at multiple time points and evaluate whether emotional effects persist across inference sessions, addressing concerns about steering reliability and model alignment drift.
