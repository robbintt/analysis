# Maxitive Donsker-Varadhan Formulation for Possibilistic Variational Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21223
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21223
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: This paper develops a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference by establishing a maxitive analogue of the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a principled variational inference framework for possibility theory by deriving a maxitive analogue of the classical Donsker-Varadhan formula. The key innovation is replacing probability's additive integrals with possibility's maxitive operations (sup/inf), yielding a "consistency bound" (CBO) as the possibilistic counterpart to the ELBO. For exponential-family likelihoods, the framework provides conjugate priors and gradient-descent-like update rules, enabling practical VI that is robust to epistemic uncertainty and outliers while revealing distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.

## Method Summary
The method replaces probability's additive integrals with possibility's maxitive operations to derive a maxitive Donsker-Varadhan formula. Starting from a regularized loss ℓ̂ = ℓ + R and prior possibility π(θ) = exp(−R(θ)), the Consistency Bound CBO(g) = inf_θ{−ℓ(θ) − log(g(θ)/π(θ))} is defined. For exponential-family conjugate priors g_λ(θ) = exp(λ^T θ − A†(λ) − A(θ)), a subgradient update rule λ_{t+1} ≈ λ_t − ρ_t I_λ^{-1} ∇_θ ℓ̂(θ*(λ_t)) is derived, where θ*(λ) is the mode of g_λ. This update resembles gradient descent in probabilistic VI but operates in the possibilistic setting.

## Key Results
- Establishes a maxitive analogue of the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula through Theorem 2
- Introduces dual lower/upper CBO formulations that enable tunable trade-offs between conservative and optimistic uncertainty quantification
- Derives gradient-descent-like update rules for exponential-family likelihoods with conjugate priors
- Demonstrates robustness to outliers through the maxitive framework's insensitivity to extreme values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A principled variational objective (the CBO) emerges from replacing additive integrals with sup/inf operations.
- Mechanism: The classical Donsker-Varadhan formula characterizes the Bayesian posterior via an ELBO optimization involving KL divergence and integrals. Theorem 2 derives a maxitive analogue by substituting `sup`/`inf` for `∫` and introducing max-relative entropy. This yields the Consistency Bound (CBO) as the possibilistic counterpart to ELBO, which can be optimized to recover the posterior possibility function.
- Core assumption: The regularized loss `ℓ̂ = ℓ + R` allows `log` and `sup` to be exchanged, and the max-relative entropy is a valid divergence for the pre-ordered set of possibility functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper develops a principled formulation by establishing a maxitive analogue of the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula.
  - [Section 4, Theorem 2] Derives `log sup e^{-ℓ(θ)π(θ)} = sup_{g∈F(Θ)} inf_{θ} {-ℓ(θ) - log(g(θ)/π(θ))}` and defines the max-relative entropy.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for this specific maxitive formulation is weak/absent; related papers discuss possibility theory foundations but not this variational result.
- Break condition: If the sup/log exchange is invalid for the given loss/prior or if the CBO landscape has pathological non-unique solutions that undermine optimization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual lower/upper CBO formulations enable a tunable trade-off between conservative and optimistic uncertainty quantification.
- Mechanism: Two dual objectives are defined: maximizing the lower CBO yields underestimates (conservative), while minimizing the upper CBO yields overestimates (optimistic). Equation (6) combines them with weight `α∈(0,1)` to penalize both under- and over-estimation, mirroring the mode-seeking vs mass-covering behavior of reverse vs forward KL in probabilistic VI.
- Core assumption: The decomposition `log Z_max = CBO(g) + D_max(g||g*_max)` holds, and the interpolated objective provides a meaningful bound on approximation error.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4] Defines lower/upper CBOs and shows their relationship to max-relative entropy.
  - [Section 4, Eq. (6)] `{g*} = argmin_{g∈F(Θ)} α·CBO̅(g) - (1-α)·CBO(g)`.
  - [corpus] Indirect support only; "Hierarchical Maximum Entropy via the Renormalization Group" discusses related entropy-based bounds but not this dual formulation.
- Break condition: If `α` lacks a principled selection method or if the dual bounds are too loose to provide practical guidance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For exponential-family likelihoods, the framework yields conjugate priors with gradient-descent-like update rules.
- Mechanism: Proposition 1 shows the posterior possibility function for an exponential-family likelihood under an uninformative prior can be expressed via a Bregman divergence. Proposition 3 derives a sub-gradient update for the variational parameter `λ`. For the normal case (Corollary 1), this simplifies to `λ_{t+1} ≈ λ_t - ρ_t ∇_μ ℓ̂_s(λ_t)`, a standard gradient descent update.
- Core assumption: The likelihood belongs to a regular, minimal exponential family, and the gradient approximation `θ̄_t ≈ θ*(λ_t)` (gradients of regularized loss are small) is valid.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.1, Proposition 1] Links posterior possibility to Bregman divergence `D_A(θ||θ*)`.
  - [Section 5.2, Proposition 3 & Corollary 1] Derives the update rule and its simplification to gradient descent for the normal distribution.
  - [corpus] "Extending Mean-Field Variational Inference via Entropic Regularization" and "Theory and computation for structured variational inference" discuss related VI methodologies, providing weak indirect support.
- Break condition: If the likelihood is non-exponential-family, if conjugacy breaks down, or if the gradient approximation fails for large-loss regimes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Possibility Theory Basics**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework replaces probability's additive measure with a maxitive one; understanding possibility functions `f: Θ → [0,1]` with `sup_θ f(θ) = 1`, and operations like marginalization via `max` (not sum), is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given a joint possibility `f_{θ,ψ}`, how do you compute the marginal `f_θ(θ)`? (Answer: `f_θ(θ) = sup_{ψ∈Ψ} f_{θ,ψ}(θ, ψ)`.)

- Concept: **Donsker-Varadhan Variational Formula**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is a maxitive analogue of this classical result. One must understand the original: `log ∫ e^h dν = sup_{ρ∈P(Θ)} {∫ h dρ - KL(ρ||ν)}`, which characterizes the Bayesian posterior as the optimizer of the ELBO.
  - Quick check question: In the classical Donsker-Varadhan formula, what is achieved at the supremum? (Answer: The Gibbs measure `ν_h`, which is the Bayesian posterior when `h=-ℓ` and `ν=π`.)

- Concept: **Exponential Families and Bregman Divergence**
  - Why needed here: The practical VI framework is built on exponential-family likelihoods, which admit conjugate priors. The posterior possibility is shown to involve a Bregman divergence, linking optimization geometry to information geometry.
  - Quick check question: For an exponential-family likelihood `p(x|θ) ∝ exp(θ^T T(x) - A(θ))`, what is the relationship between the log-partition function `A(θ)` and the Bregman divergence? (Answer: The Bregman divergence generated by `A` is `D_A(θ||θ') = A(θ) - A(θ') - ∇A(θ')^T (θ-θ')`.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prior/Likelihood Encoder -> Variational Family Selector -> CBO Optimizer -> Posterior Approximation
- Critical path: Encode prior/likelihood → Select variational family `G` → Initialize `g_λ` → Iterate CBO optimization (Proposition 3) → Converge to posterior approximation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Lower vs Upper vs Combined CBO**: Lower is conservative (underestimates), Upper is optimistic (overestimates), Combined (Eq. 6) allows `α`-tuning but requires selecting `α`
  - **Family Complexity**: Richer `G` yields better approximations but more costly optimization; `G_A(Θ)` provides conjugacy and closed-form updates
  - **Assumption Strength**: Exponential-family assumption enables gradient-based updates; non-exponential requires alternative methods (not derived in paper)
- Failure signatures:
  - **Non-convergence**: Optimization oscillates or stalls → Check learning rate `ρ_t` and gradient approximations (Proposition 3)
  - **Degenerate posterior**: `g*` is uninformative (`g*(θ) ≈ 1` everywhere) → Check if likelihood/prior are too weak or if CBO is ill-posed
  - **Bound violation**: Combined objective (Eq. 6) yields worse results than single bound → `α` may be poorly tuned
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity Check on Known Posterior**: Implement for a Gaussian likelihood with known variance (Example 5). Verify that the update rule recovers the analytical posterior possibility.
  2. **Dual Bound Comparison**: For a Binomial likelihood (Example 6), run VI using lower CBO, upper CBO, and combined CBO with varying `α`. Plot recovered possibility functions to visualize conservative vs optimistic estimates.
  3. **Robustness to Outliers**: Introduce an outlier data point. Compare the `Z_max` (consistency) from possibilistic VI with the probabilistic evidence `Z_add`. Hypothesis: `Z_max` should be less sensitive, demonstrating robustness (as cited in paper's discussion of outlier detection).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed approximate update rule in Proposition 3 guarantee convergence to the true posterior possibility function, and under what specific conditions?
- Basis: [inferred] Proposition 3 relies on a first-order Taylor approximation and an assumption of small gradients to derive the update rule, but the text provides no theoretical convergence proof or error bounds.
- Why unresolved: The paper derives the rule but does not analyze the stability or accumulation of error caused by the approximations $\bar{\theta}_t \approx \theta^*(\lambda_t)$.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof of convergence or an empirical study showing the approximation error diminishes over iterations in high-dimensional spaces.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the practical variational inference framework be extended beyond the "special class" of exponential-family functions to non-conjugate or complex models like Bayesian neural networks?
- Basis: [inferred] The abstract claims a "practical VI framework," yet Section 5 restricts the mathematical derivation and update rules specifically to exponential families with conjugate priors.
- Why unresolved: The update rules depend on properties of the log-partition function $A$ and its Legendre transform $A^\dagger$, which may not be analytically tractable for non-exponential families.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of update rules for non-exponential models or a black-box variational strategy that does not require conjugate structure.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the maxitive formulation offer significant computational advantages over standard probabilistic VI in high-dimensional settings?
- Basis: [inferred] The introduction contrasts probabilistic integrals with possibilistic supremums, implying the latter might be computationally simpler, but no complexity analysis or timing benchmarks are provided.
- Why unresolved: Replacing an integral with a supremum (a max-affine operation) changes the complexity class, but the need to solve inner optimization problems (e.g., finding $\bar{\theta}_t$) may reintroduce computational costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Runtime benchmarks comparing the CBO optimization against ELBO optimization on equivalent high-dimensional problems.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework lacks empirical validation and does not specify how to select the interpolation weight α in Equation (6)
- The practical VI framework is restricted to exponential-family likelihoods and conjugate priors, limiting applicability to non-exponential models
- The corpus evidence for this specific maxitive Donsker-Varadhan formulation is weak, with related papers discussing possibility theory foundations but not this variational result

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical derivation of the maxitive Donsker-Varadhan formula and the definition of max-relative entropy as a valid divergence measure (Theorem 2, Section 4)
- **Medium Confidence**: The connection between the dual CBO formulations and the mode-seeking vs mass-covering behavior analogous to probabilistic VI (Section 4, Equation 6)
- **Low Confidence**: The practical implementation details for non-Gaussian cases and the numerical stability of the optimization procedures, as these are only sketched theoretically

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation**: Implement the Gaussian example (Example 5) to verify that the analytical posterior possibility can be recovered through the proposed update rules. Test with synthetic data and compare against theoretical expectations.

2. **Dual Bound Behavior**: For a Binomial likelihood (Example 6), run VI using lower CBO, upper CBO, and combined CBO with varying α. Visualize the resulting possibility functions to confirm conservative vs optimistic behavior and assess sensitivity to α selection.

3. **Robustness Demonstration**: Introduce an outlier data point in a simple normal likelihood scenario. Compare the consistency measure Z_max from possibilistic VI with the probabilistic evidence Z_add to demonstrate robustness claims.
