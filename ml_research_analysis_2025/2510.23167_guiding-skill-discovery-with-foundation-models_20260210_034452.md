core_contribution: The paper introduces FoG, a method that leverages foundation models
  to guide unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning. Unlike prior methods
  that maximize skill diversity without considering human preferences, FoG uses foundation
  models to evaluate states based on human intentions, assigning higher scores to
  desirable states and lower to undesirable ones.

# Guiding Skill Discovery with Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23167
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: FoG outperforms six baselines in unsupervised skill discovery by using foundation models to align skills with human intentions

## Executive Summary
FoG introduces a method that leverages foundation models to guide unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional approaches that maximize skill diversity without considering human preferences, FoG uses foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions, assigning higher scores to desirable states and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms, leading to diverse skills that align with specific intentions. The method is evaluated on both state-based and pixel-based tasks, demonstrating its ability to eliminate undesirable behaviors and discover skills involving complex behaviors like "twisted" postures in Humanoid.

## Method Summary
FoG leverages foundation models to guide unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning. Traditional skill discovery methods maximize skill diversity without considering human preferences, often leading to undesirable behaviors. FoG addresses this by using foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions, assigning higher scores to desirable states and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms, ensuring that the discovered skills are both diverse and aligned with specific intentions. The method is evaluated on both state-based and pixel-based tasks, outperforming six state-of-the-art baselines.

## Key Results
- FoG successfully eliminates undesirable behaviors like flipping in HalfCheetah and avoids hazardous areas in Ant.
- In pixel-based tasks, FoG learns diverse skills while eliminating undesirable behaviors and avoiding hazardous areas in Cheetah and Quadruped.
- FoG discovers skills involving behaviors that are difficult to define, such as "twisted" postures in Humanoid.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FoG works by integrating foundation models into the skill discovery process to align learned skills with human intentions. Traditional skill discovery methods focus on maximizing diversity without considering whether the resulting skills are desirable. By using foundation models to score states based on human preferences, FoG ensures that the discovered skills are both diverse and aligned with specific intentions. The re-weighting of rewards based on these scores allows the algorithm to prioritize desirable behaviors while maintaining diversity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - to enable agents to learn skills through interaction with the environment. Quick check - ensure the agent can maximize cumulative reward.
- **Skill Discovery**: Why needed - to identify useful behaviors without explicit reward signals. Quick check - verify that the skills are diverse and meaningful.
- **Foundation Models**: Why needed - to provide a way to evaluate states based on human intentions. Quick check - confirm that the model's scoring aligns with human preferences.
- **Reward Shaping**: Why needed - to guide the learning process towards desirable behaviors. Quick check - ensure that the re-weighted rewards lead to the desired outcomes.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Environment -> Foundation Model Scoring -> Skill Discovery Algorithm -> Learned Skills
- **Critical Path**: The foundation model scores states based on human intentions, which are then used to re-weight the rewards in the skill discovery algorithm. This re-weighting guides the algorithm to discover skills that are both diverse and aligned with human preferences.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using foundation models for scoring introduces computational overhead but ensures alignment with human intentions. The method balances diversity and desirability by adjusting the reward re-weighting.
- **Failure Signatures**: If the foundation model's scoring is biased or noisy, the learned skills may not align with human intentions. Poor performance in eliminating undesirable behaviors could indicate issues with the scoring mechanism.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test FoG with a simple environment to verify that it can eliminate basic undesirable behaviors.
  2. Evaluate the method's robustness to noise in the foundation model's scoring.
  3. Compare FoG's performance with a baseline skill discovery method in a controlled setting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reliance on foundation models for scoring may introduce biases based on the training data of these models.
- The extent of the method's robustness to noise in the score function is not clearly defined.
- The evaluation scope is somewhat limited, raising questions about the generalizability of FoG to a broader range of environments and objectives.

## Confidence
- High confidence in FoG's effectiveness for the specific tasks and behaviors demonstrated.
- Medium confidence in the broader applicability of the method due to the limited evaluation scope.

## Next Checks
1. Test FoG with different foundation models to assess the impact of model choice on skill discovery outcomes.
2. Evaluate the method's performance in a wider variety of environments to confirm its generalizability.
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the foundation model scoring step.
