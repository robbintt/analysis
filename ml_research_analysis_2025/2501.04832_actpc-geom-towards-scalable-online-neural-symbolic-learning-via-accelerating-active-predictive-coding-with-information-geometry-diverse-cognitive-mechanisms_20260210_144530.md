# ActPC-Geom: Towards Scalable Online Neural-Symbolic Learning via Accelerating Active Predictive Coding with Information Geometry & Diverse Cognitive Mechanisms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.04832
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04832
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed ActPC-Geom framework integrates information geometry into Active Predictive Coding for scalable online neural-symbolic learning

## Executive Summary
ActPC-Geom presents a theoretical framework that accelerates Active Predictive Coding (ActPC) through information geometry, specifically by replacing KL-divergence with Wasserstein distance for predictive error assessment. The approach aims to enhance network robustness and computational efficiency while supporting real-time online learning and seamless integration of continuous and discrete symbolic networks. The framework incorporates diverse cognitive mechanisms including Hopfield-net dynamics, transformer-like architectures, and Galois connections for concurrent processing, with a proposed specialized HPC design for optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The ActPC-Geom approach integrates information geometry into Active Predictive Coding by utilizing Wasserstein-metric-based methods instead of traditional KL-divergence. To address computational challenges, the framework employs neural approximators for inverse measure-dependent Laplacians, kernel PCA embeddings for low-rank approximations, and compositional hypervector embeddings derived from these embeddings. The architecture supports real-time online learning by combining continuous and discrete symbolic ActPC networks, implementing compositional reasoning through hypervector embeddings in transformer-like architectures, and incorporating Hopfield-net dynamics for associative memory. Galois connections are leveraged for efficient concurrent processing, while a specialized HPC design is proposed to optimize focused attention and deliberative reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Wasserstein distance replaces KL-divergence for predictive error assessment, aligning parameter updates with natural probability distribution structure
- Neural approximators and kernel PCA embeddings address computational challenges in inverse measure-dependent Laplacians
- Proposed framework enables real-time online learning with seamless integration of continuous and discrete symbolic networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ActPC-Geom works by leveraging information geometry to align learning updates with the natural structure of probability distributions through Wasserstein distance. This geometric approach provides more robust error assessment compared to KL-divergence, while neural approximators and kernel PCA embeddings reduce computational complexity. The integration of diverse cognitive mechanisms - including Hopfield-net dynamics for memory, transformer-like architectures for reasoning, and Galois connections for concurrency - creates a comprehensive system capable of handling both continuous and discrete symbolic learning tasks.
