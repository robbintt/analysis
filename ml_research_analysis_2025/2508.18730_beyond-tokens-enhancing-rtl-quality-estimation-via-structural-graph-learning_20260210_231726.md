core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating the
  quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs in electronic design automation
  (EDA), a process critical for enabling rapid feedback on design metrics like area
  and delay without costly logic synthesis. The authors propose StructRTL, a novel
  structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework that learns rich, structure-informed
  representations from control data flow graphs (CDFGs) of RTL designs, rather than
  relying on token-based embeddings from large language models.

# Beyond Tokens: Enhancing RTL Quality Estimation via Structural Graph Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18730
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18730
- Authors: Yi Liu, Hongji Zhang, Yiwen Wang, Dimitris Tsaras, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan, Qiang Xu
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: StructRTL outperforms both graph-based and LLM-based baselines on post-synthesis area and delay prediction using structural graph learning and knowledge distillation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces StructRTL, a structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework designed to improve the quality estimation of register transfer level (RTL) designs in electronic design automation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on token-based embeddings from large language models, StructRTL leverages control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to learn rich, structure-informed representations. The framework employs structure-aware masked node modeling and edge prediction pretraining tasks, and integrates knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists to enhance predictive accuracy. Experimental results on a dataset of over 13,000 RTL designs demonstrate significant improvements in post-synthesis area and delay prediction, with marked gains in R² scores over both graph-based and LLM-based baselines.

## Method Summary
StructRTL addresses the challenge of accurate RTL quality estimation by learning structure-aware representations from CDFGs instead of relying on token-based embeddings from large language models. The method uses graph self-supervised pretraining with two key tasks: structure-aware masked node modeling and edge prediction, which capture explicit structural semantics of RTL designs. To further boost performance, StructRTL integrates knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists, allowing the model to learn from both the structural properties of RTL and the mapped netlist data. The framework is evaluated on over 13,000 designs, demonstrating superior performance in predicting post-synthesis area and delay metrics compared to existing graph-based and LLM-based approaches.

## Key Results
- StructRTL significantly outperforms both graph-based and LLM-based baselines on post-synthesis area and delay prediction.
- R² scores show marked improvements, indicating better predictive accuracy and generalization.
- Integration of knowledge distillation from netlists further enhances predictive performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The key innovation of StructRTL lies in its use of structural graph learning, which captures the explicit structural semantics of RTL designs via CDFGs, as opposed to token-based embeddings that may miss critical structural information. By pretraining on structure-aware tasks like masked node modeling and edge prediction, the model learns representations that are more aligned with the actual hardware structure and its impact on design metrics. The addition of knowledge distillation from netlists enables the model to leverage post-synthesis information, bridging the gap between RTL-level structure and final implementation metrics. This combination of structural awareness and cross-stage supervision leads to more accurate quality estimation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Control Data Flow Graphs (CDFGs)**: Abstract representations of RTL designs showing data and control dependencies. *Why needed*: Capture explicit hardware structure, enabling structure-aware learning. *Quick check*: Verify CDFG accurately reflects data/control flow in RTL.
- **Graph Self-Supervised Learning**: Pretraining on unlabeled graph data via tasks like masked node modeling and edge prediction. *Why needed*: Learn rich, generalizable representations without labeled data. *Quick check*: Confirm pretraining tasks preserve and expose structural semantics.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from a teacher model (netlist-based) to a student model (RTL-based). *Why needed*: Leverage post-synthesis information to improve RTL-level predictions. *Quick check*: Ensure distilled signals are relevant and improve downstream task accuracy.
- **Post-Synthesis Area and Delay Prediction**: Estimating hardware metrics after logic synthesis but before physical design. *Why needed*: Provide rapid feedback for design optimization without costly synthesis. *Quick check*: Compare predicted vs. actual post-synthesis metrics across diverse designs.
- **Token-Based vs. Structure-Aware Embeddings**: Contrast between language model embeddings and graph-based structural representations. *Why needed*: Highlight limitations of token-based approaches for hardware structure. *Quick check*: Benchmark both approaches on same tasks and datasets.
- **R² Score**: Statistical measure of how well predictions match ground truth. *Why needed*: Quantify predictive accuracy and model improvement. *Quick check*: Ensure high R² values correlate with meaningful design quality improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: RTL designs -> CDFGs -> Graph Encoder -> Pretraining (masked node modeling, edge prediction) -> Knowledge Distillation (netlist supervision) -> Quality Estimator (area/delay prediction)

**Critical Path**: CDFG construction and graph encoding is the most critical, as errors or inefficiencies here directly impact all downstream learning and prediction accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Structure-aware pretraining improves accuracy but increases model complexity and training time. Knowledge distillation adds performance gains but requires access to netlist data, limiting early-stage applicability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor CDFG quality or incomplete edge coverage leads to degraded model performance. Overfitting to netlist-specific features can reduce generalization to new designs.

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study: Evaluate performance with and without knowledge distillation.
2. Cross-domain validation: Test on RTL designs from different hardware domains.
3. Efficiency benchmarking: Measure training and inference time versus baseline methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to designs from a single design flow and domain, raising questions about generalization to other hardware description languages or industrial-scale designs.
- The computational cost and memory footprint of the combined pretraining and knowledge distillation stages are not discussed.
- Reliance on netlist data for knowledge distillation may limit applicability in early design stages or when such data is unavailable.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: StructRTL outperforms graph-based and LLM-based baselines on the reported dataset for post-synthesis area and delay prediction.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that structural graph learning is "more effective" than token-based embeddings for RTL quality estimation is supported, but requires further validation across diverse design domains.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of "new state-of-the-art performance" are context-dependent and not yet validated beyond the specific experimental setup.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Validate StructRTL on RTL designs from multiple hardware domains (e.g., processor cores, DSP blocks, memory controllers) and from different open-source or industrial sources to assess robustness.
2. **Efficiency Benchmarking**: Measure training and inference time, memory usage, and scalability of StructRTL compared to both graph-based and LLM-based baselines, especially for large CDFGs.
3. **Early-Stage Applicability**: Evaluate StructRTL's performance when netlist data is unavailable or when only pre-synthesis RTL is accessible, and compare with purely pre-synthesis prediction methods.
