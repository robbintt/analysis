## Executive Summary
EDITLENS addresses the challenge of detecting AI-edited text by training a regression model that estimates the degree of AI editing in a document, rather than just flagging fully AI-generated text. The method uses lightweight similarity metrics between the original and edited texts as intermediate supervision, validated by human annotators. EDITLENS achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.7% F1 on binary classification and 90.4% macro-F1 on ternary classification, outperforming existing detectors by 8-16%. It also provides nuanced scoring that tracks increasing levels of AI polish and generalizes well to unseen prompts, domains, and editing scenarios.

## Method Summary
EDITLENS predicts the degree of AI editing in text as a continuous score [0,1] using a single-input architecture that learns to recognize patterns in edited text correlating with edit magnitude. The model is trained with source-edit pairs at training time but only conditions on the edited text at inference. It uses similarity metrics (cosine distance and soft n-grams) between source and edited text as intermediate supervision targets, which are validated by human annotators with moderate agreement (Krippendorff's α = 0.67-0.66). The method discretizes similarity scores into 4-6 buckets and trains a classifier with weighted-average decoding to recover continuous scores, outperforming direct regression. The model is fine-tuned with QLoRA on Mistral/Llama backbones (3B-24B) and achieves best results with 4-way classification using cosine supervision.

## Key Results
- 94.7% F1 on binary classification (human vs. any AI) on the EDITLENS dataset
- 90.4% macro-F1 on ternary classification (human/AI-edited/AI-generated)
- Outperforms existing detectors by 8-16% across benchmarks
- Graceful degradation in out-of-domain scenarios (macro-F1 drops from 0.904 to 0.866-0.850)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Similarity Metrics as Intermediate Supervision
Lightweight similarity metrics between source and edited text provide valid proxy targets for training a model to predict edit magnitude from the edited text alone. The model learns to recognize patterns in the edited text that correlate with the similarity scores computed during training (cosine distance and soft n-grams between source and edit). These patterns—lexical volatility, style drift, fluency cues—become internalized features the model uses at inference without needing the source. The core assumption is that similarity metrics capture meaningful edit magnitude that aligns with human perception of AI involvement.

### Mechanism 2: Single-Input Architecture with Latent Source Inference
A model trained with source-edit pairs at training time can learn to predict edit magnitude from the edited text alone at inference. During training, the model observes (source, edit, similarity_score) triplets but only conditions on the edited text y for prediction. It learns discriminative features that approximate the conditional expectation E[Δ(X, y) | Y=y] without reconstructing the source—absorbing inductive biases about what edited text looks like. The core assumption is that the space of possible edits has learnable regularities (style, fluency, vocabulary shifts) that generalize across edit types and source domains.

### Mechanism 3: Bucketed Classification with Weighted-Average Decoding
Discretizing similarity scores into N buckets (4–6) and training a classifier with weighted-average decoding outperforms direct regression. Classification provides more stable gradients than MSE regression on continuous scores. Weighted-average decoding (ŝ = Σ p(j|x) · m_j) recovers a continuous score while benefiting from classification's sharper decision boundaries. The core assumption is that the underlying edit magnitude distribution can be meaningfully partitioned into discrete levels.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cosine Similarity on Embeddings:**
  - Why needed here: Core supervision signal; understanding how embedding space captures semantic similarity is essential for interpreting why this works.
  - Quick check question: Given two sentences with identical meaning but different words, would you expect high or low cosine similarity between their embeddings?

- **Quantized Fine-Tuning (QLoRA):**
  - Why needed here: Paper uses QLoRA to sweep 3B–24B models on single GPUs; understanding this is necessary for reproduction.
  - Quick check question: What is the trade-off between QLoRA and full fine-tuning in terms of memory vs. performance?

- **Krippendorff's Alpha:**
  - Why needed here: Key metric for validating that automatic supervision agrees with human judgment.
  - Quick check question: Why might Krippendorff's α be preferred over simple percent agreement for multi-annotator reliability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Human text (x) → LLM edit → Edited text (y)
                    ↓
  [Linq-Embed-Mistral] → Cosine distance & Soft n-grams → Scaled score
                    ↓
  [Bucket assignment] → N-way labels (N=4–6)
                    ↓
  [Mistral/Llama backbone + QLoRA] → Classification head
                    ↓
  [Weighted-average decoding] → Continuous score ŝ ∈ [0,1]

- **Critical path:** Similarity metric computation → threshold/bucket calibration → QLoRA fine-tuning → threshold tuning for binary/ternary classification.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Cosine supervision vs. soft n-grams: Cosine captures semantic shifts; soft n-grams captures phrase-level preservation. Best model uses cosine (0.904 vs. 0.899 macro-F1).
  - 4 vs. 5 vs. 6 buckets: 4 buckets performs best; more buckets introduce noise.
  - Regression vs. classification: Classification + weighted decoding outperforms direct regression.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Binary-like output distribution (scores clustered at 0 and 1): indicates insufficient regression nuance or calibration issue.
  - Poor OOD generalization (>10% F1 drop): model overfitting to source domain or LLM style.
  - Low correlation with ground-truth similarity metrics on held-out data: supervision signal not generalizing.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sanity check:** Train a 4-way classifier on the provided dataset with Mistral-Small-24B using QLoRA; verify ternary macro-F1 ≥0.90 on test split.
  2. **Supervision ablation:** Compare cosine-only vs. soft n-grams-only vs. combined supervision; measure correlation with APT-Eval similarity metrics.
  3. **OOD probe:** Evaluate on held-out LLM (Llama-3.3-70B) and held-out domain (Enron emails); confirm macro-F1 degradation <0.06 per the paper's OOD results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does EditLens perform in complex, multi-agent workflows involving iterative cycles of human and AI editing?
- Basis in paper: In Section 2.2, the authors state that for simplicity, they "focus on the case where a human text is edited in one pass by a single AI language model," noting that real-world scenarios involve "multiple sequential edits... in an indistinguishable fashion."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates results on multi-edit texts as "case studies" (Section 4.5), but a comprehensive evaluation of how scores accumulate or fluctuate in mixed-initiative editing loops (e.g., Human → AI → Human) is not provided.
- Evidence to resolve it: Evaluation on a dataset specifically annotated with multi-turn edit histories to track score monotonicity and accuracy over iterative cycles.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the intermediate supervision metrics (cosine distance, soft n-grams) effectively distinguish between heavy human rewriting and AI editing?
- Basis in paper: The model is trained to predict a similarity score (proxy) rather than authorship directly. The paper validates that humans agree with the metric on *magnitude* (Section 3.4), but assumes that "more distance" equates to "more AI," potentially conflating drastic human revisions with AI polishing.
- Why unresolved: A high cosine distance indicates high semantic drift, but does not inherently prove AI authorship. The model might produce false positives on heavily rewritten human texts if the distance is similar to that of AI-edited texts.
- Evidence to resolve it: A controlled study comparing model scores on texts with identical semantic distances (e.g., high cosine distance) but different authors (Human vs. AI).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What modeling architectures and optimization strategies beyond QLoRA on Mistral/Llama backbones would maximize performance?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.5 explicitly states: "We leave other finetuning and modeling architecture choices to future work," noting the current use of QLoRA to sweep model sizes.
- Why unresolved: It is undetermined if encoder-only architectures (e.g., DeBERTa), full parameter finetuning, or different objective functions could improve the 94.7% F1 score or reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the regression head.
- Evidence to resolve it: A systematic benchmark comparing the current approach against encoder-only models or full finetuning on the released dataset.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic mirroring for AI-generated text detection assumes synthetic mirrors capture real AI-generated text distribution
- Moderate agreement between similarity metrics and human annotators (Krippendorff's α = 0.67-0.66) may not generalize across contexts
- Graceful but meaningful degradation in out-of-domain performance (F1 drops 5-10%)

## Confidence

**High Confidence (90-100%)**
- EDITLENS outperforms existing detectors by 8-16% on the tested benchmarks
- The methodology of using similarity metrics as intermediate supervision is sound and reproducible
- The classification + weighted-average decoding approach is superior to direct regression

**Medium Confidence (60-80%)**
- Similarity metrics adequately capture human-perceived edit magnitude (Krippendorff's α=0.67)
- The model generalizes well to unseen prompts, domains, and editing scenarios (F1 drop <0.06)
- EDITLENS can distinguish between different edit types (e.g., AI-edited human text vs. AI-edited AI text)

**Low Confidence (30-50%)**
- Synthetic mirroring accurately represents real AI-generated text distribution
- The model's performance translates to real-world deployment scenarios with adversarial editing
- The specific bucket boundaries (τ_min, τ_max) are optimal and not overfit to the training data

## Next Checks

1. **Human Validation Study**: Conduct a controlled experiment with diverse annotators (varying AI exposure, demographics, and expertise) to validate whether the similarity metrics truly capture perceived edit magnitude across different domains and edit types. Compare human rankings against EDITLENS scores and existing detectors.

2. **Adversarial Robustness Test**: Create a dataset of adversarial edits specifically designed to minimize similarity metrics while maintaining semantic meaning (e.g., controlled paraphrasing, synonym substitution patterns). Evaluate whether EDITLENS maintains its performance or whether it can be systematically evaded.

3. **Real-World Deployment Benchmark**: Test EDITLENS on a corpus of real AI-generated content (not synthetic mirrors) from multiple sources and domains. Compare performance against synthetic mirror results and assess whether the model's assumptions about AI text distribution hold in practice.
