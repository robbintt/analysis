# Air Quality Prediction Using LOESS-ARIMA and Multi-Scale CNN-BiLSTM with Residual-Gated Attention

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22818
- Reference count: 40
- Hybrid framework integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA modeling, and multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM with residual-gated attention for AQI prediction

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of forecasting Air Quality Index (AQI) in Indian megacities, where sudden pollution spikes complicate timely intervention. The proposed hybrid framework integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention mechanism, optimized using the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic Optimizer (UAMMO). The LOESS step decomposes the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata show the proposed method consistently outperforms statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R² scores (>0.94) for PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx.

## Method Summary
The hybrid framework combines statistical and deep learning approaches to address AQI forecasting challenges. LOESS decomposition separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. ARIMA models the smooth components, while a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with residual-gated attention captures complex volatility patterns in the residuals. The entire model is optimized using UAMMO. The approach aims to handle sudden pollution spikes and complex temporal dependencies in air quality data from Indian megacities.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 5-8% lower MSE compared to statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines
- R² scores exceed 0.94 for PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx pollutants
- Demonstrates robustness to sudden pollution events in Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both statistical and deep learning methods. LOESS decomposition effectively separates complex AQI patterns into interpretable components, allowing ARIMA to efficiently model smooth trends and seasonality. The multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM with residual-gated attention captures intricate volatility patterns in the residuals, particularly important for sudden pollution spikes. This complementary combination addresses the limitations of single-method approaches, providing both interpretability and accuracy in AQI forecasting.

## Foundational Learning

1. **LOESS Decomposition**
   - Why needed: Separates AQI time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components for better modeling
   - Quick check: Verify decomposition correctly identifies seasonal patterns in AQI data

2. **ARIMA Modeling**
   - Why needed: Captures linear dependencies and autocorrelation in smooth AQI components
   - Quick check: Confirm ARIMA residuals show no remaining autocorrelation

3. **Multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM**
   - Why needed: Captures both local patterns (CNN) and long-term dependencies (BiLSTM) in residuals
   - Quick check: Validate performance on varying temporal scales

4. **Residual-Gated Attention**
   - Why needed: Focuses model on important features while maintaining information flow
   - Quick check: Compare attention weight distributions across different pollution events

5. **UAMMO Optimizer**
   - Why needed: Optimizes hybrid model parameters efficiently for complex search space
   - Quick check: Benchmark convergence speed against standard optimizers

6. **AQI Index Components**
   - Why needed: Understanding PM2.5, O3, CO, NOx as key pollutants for air quality assessment
   - Quick check: Verify model performance across different pollutant types

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: AQI Data -> LOESS Decomposition -> ARIMA (Trend+Seasonal) -> CNN-BiLSTM (Residuals) -> Residual-Gated Attention -> Predictions

Critical Path: Data preprocessing and LOESS decomposition are prerequisites for all subsequent steps. The ARIMA model processes trend and seasonal components, while CNN-BiLSTM handles residuals. Attention mechanism integrates outputs for final prediction.

Design Tradeoffs: The hybrid approach balances interpretability (ARIMA) with flexibility (deep learning). Multi-scale architecture increases parameter count but improves pattern recognition. UAMMO optimization trades computational cost for potentially better local minima.

Failure Signatures: Poor LOESS decomposition leads to incorrect ARIMA modeling. Overfitting in CNN-BiLSTM manifests as poor generalization to new pollution events. Attention mechanism failure results in uniform weight distribution, losing important feature discrimination.

First Experiments:
1. Validate LOESS decomposition accuracy on synthetic AQI data with known components
2. Compare ARIMA performance with and without decomposition on clean AQI series
3. Test CNN-BiLSTM sensitivity to residual component quality by varying decomposition parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance in regions with sparse monitoring infrastructure remains untested
- Computational complexity may limit real-time deployment on resource-constrained systems
- Reliance on publicly available AQI data may not capture micro-scale pollution dynamics

- Generalization to cities outside the test set

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on AQI data from cities with different pollution profiles and monitoring densities
2. Compare computational efficiency and prediction latency against simpler hybrid models
3. Validate model robustness during extreme pollution events using historical data from 2016-2020 air quality crisis periods
