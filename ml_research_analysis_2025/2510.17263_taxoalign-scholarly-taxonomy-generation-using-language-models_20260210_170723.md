# TaxoAlign: Scholarly Taxonomy Generation Using Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17263
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17263
- Authors: Avishek Lahiri; Yufang Hou; Debarshi Kumar Sanyal
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TaxoAlign consistently outperforms baselines on structural and semantic alignment metrics for automated scholarly taxonomy generation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses automated scholarly taxonomy generation from reference papers using a three-phase approach called TaxoAlign. The method combines knowledge slice extraction, taxonomy verbalization via instruction-tuned language models, and taxonomy refinement using a reasoning model. The authors create CS-TaxoBench, a benchmark of 460 human-authored taxonomies from computer science surveys, and evaluate with new metrics including average degree score and level-order traversal. Results demonstrate that TaxoAlign achieves better structural similarity and semantic coherence compared to baselines like AutoSurvey and STORM, with average degree scores close to 1 and improved node recall.

## Method Summary
TaxoAlign uses a three-phase pipeline: (1) Knowledge slice creation extracts topic-relevant text segments from reference papers using a 7B parameter LLM to fit within context windows, (2) Taxonomy verbalization employs QLoRA-based fine-tuning on 400 training taxonomies to generate hierarchical trees with depth constraints, and (3) Taxonomy refinement uses GPT-4o-mini to evaluate and adjust parent-child relationships and tree coverage. The approach is trained on CS-TaxoBench and evaluated on 60 test taxonomies using structural metrics (average degree score, level-order traversal), semantic metrics (Node Soft/Entity Recall), and human/LLM judgments.

## Key Results
- TaxoAlign achieves average degree score (Δ) of 1.668-1.6687, close to ideal 1.0, while baselines range 4.4-7.2
- Node Entity Recall improves from 0.431 (AutoSurvey) to 0.565-0.571 (TaxoAlign variants)
- Level-order traversal metrics (BLEU-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore) show TaxoAlign outperforms baselines in semantic alignment
- Human and LLM judge rankings consistently place TaxoAlign above competing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Knowledge slice extraction enables LLMs to process large reference paper corpora by distilling topic-relevant information within context constraints. A 7B parameter LLM identifies text segments highly relevant to the taxonomy topic, reducing ~131 reference papers per survey to compressed "knowledge slices" that fit within a 16,384 token context window. This addresses the core scalability problem identified in the pilot study where prompting LLMs generated topic-related sub-topics but failed to align with human-written taxonomies.

### Mechanism 2
Instruction tuning teaches the model to learn taxonomy tree structure, preserving hierarchical organization that prompting alone cannot achieve. QLoRA-based fine-tuning on 400 training taxonomies with explicit depth constraints (max 3 levels) and Alpaca-style instruction format enables the verbalization model to generate trees where leaf nodes reflect single topics rather than combinations. This structural learning is absent in direct prompting-based methods.

### Mechanism 3
A stronger reasoning model (GPT-4o-mini) can refine parent-child relationships by grounding nodes in knowledge slices and adjusting tree coverage. The refinement stage evaluates connections between parent and child nodes, checking whether each node is grounded in document knowledge slices. If the tree contains too few nodes, it expands the node set to achieve greater coverage, improving alignment with gold standard taxonomies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Taxonomy Tree Structure (root, nodes, depth, degree)**: Why needed - evaluation metrics (average degree score, level-order traversal) and generation constraints assume familiarity with tree terminology. Quick check - Given a taxonomy with 15 nodes and 14 edges, what is its average degree? (Answer: 2(14)/15 ≈ 1.87)

- **Context Window Compression via Extraction**: Why needed - the number of cited papers in a survey paper is quite extensive, making it impossible to fit all papers in the model's input context window. Quick check - Why extract topic-relevant slices rather than summarize each paper? (Hint: Consider what signal is lost in summarization vs. extraction.)

- **Instruction Tuning vs. Few-Shot Prompting**: Why needed - the paper explicitly contrasts their instruction-tuning approach with prompting baselines, claiming finetuning helps preserve taxonomy structure. Quick check - What would happen if you used the same knowledge slices but only prompted a larger model instead of instruction-tuning a smaller model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Reference Papers → Knowledge Slice Creation: Mistral-7B/LLaMA-8B → Knowledge Slices → Taxonomy Verbalization: Tülu-8B/SciLitLLM-8B, QLoRA fine-tuned → Initial Taxonomy → Taxonomy Refinement: GPT-4o-mini → Refined Taxonomy

- **Critical path**: Knowledge slice quality directly constrains verbalization. If slices miss key themes, refinement cannot recover them. The verbalization model must output valid tree structure (depth ≤ 3) or refinement will struggle with malformed input.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - 7B/8B models for extraction + 8B for verbalization vs. larger models: Chosen for efficiency; tradeoff is potential loss of subtle domain distinctions
  - Max depth 3 vs. unconstrained: Ensures trees match survey paper structure but may oversimplify complex topics
  - GPT-4o-mini for refinement vs. open-source: Closed model for reasoning quality; tradeoff is reproducibility and cost

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Δ > 3: Generated tree is over-branched; baselines like STORM produce excessive nodes and branches
  - Δ < 0.5: Tree is under-branched; likely missing coverage
  - Low Node Entity Recall with high Node Soft Recall: Semantic similarity exists but entity overlap is poor
  - Repeated nodes/sub-trees: Error analysis identifies this as a failure mode without verbalization

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablate the verbalization stage: Run knowledge slices → direct prompting → refinement. Compare Δ and NSR to full pipeline to quantify verbalization's structural learning contribution.
  2. Test slice quality sensitivity: Manually corrupt 20% of knowledge slices. Measure degradation in NSR and NER to assess grounding dependence.
  3. Cross-domain transfer: Train on CS-TaxoBench, test on conference survey papers. Analyze Δ shift to evaluate domain robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How does the integration of automated reference paper retrieval impact the structural integrity and factual accuracy of the generated taxonomies?
  - Basis: The authors state they don't focus on reference paper retrieval and suggest this is important for end-to-end taxonomy construction
  - Why unresolved: Current pipeline assumes presence of relevant gold-standard reference papers; automated retrieval may introduce noise or omit key papers
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of TaxoAlign's performance when input documents are derived via automated search rather than manual selection

- **Question**: To what extent does the performance of TaxoAlign generalize to scientific domains outside of Computer Science?
  - Basis: The authors acknowledge constructing CS-TaxoBench from a single journal within a defined time frame
  - Why unresolved: Scientific taxonomy structures vary significantly across disciplines, and the model was fine-tuned specifically on CS survey structures
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results from applying the current model or a retrained version to datasets from distinct fields like biomedicine or social sciences

- **Question**: Can the substantial lexical gap between generated and human-authored taxonomies be reduced?
  - Basis: Results show structural metrics are close to 1 while lexical metrics remain low (e.g., BLEU-2 ≈ 0.01)
  - Why unresolved: The model captures structural patterns effectively but struggles to predict exact phrasing or specific terminology used by human experts
  - What evidence would resolve it: Improved BLEU/ROUGE scores through enhanced instruction tuning or terminology-constrained decoding

## Limitations

- Knowledge slice extraction mechanism lacks empirical validation through coverage quality analysis or slice ablation studies
- Training data preparation for instruction tuning remains underspecified, particularly tree-to-string serialization format
- Refinement stage depends entirely on GPT-4o-mini's reasoning capabilities with no comparison to open-source alternatives
- Generalization to non-CS domains and robustness to knowledge slice quality variations are not systematically evaluated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Structural alignment claims (Δ scores approaching 1.0), Node Entity Recall improvements over baselines, human and LLM judge rankings showing TaxoAlign superiority
- **Medium confidence**: Semantic alignment metrics (NSR, BERTScore), knowledge slice extraction effectiveness, refinement stage contribution magnitude
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to non-CS domains, robustness to knowledge slice quality variations, long-term sustainability of closed-source refinement dependency

## Next Checks

1. **Knowledge slice coverage ablation**: Systematically corrupt 20-30% of knowledge slices by removing topic-relevant sentences or adding irrelevant content. Measure degradation in Node Soft Recall and Node Entity Recall to quantify how much downstream performance depends on slice quality versus verbalization/refinement stages.

2. **Open-source refinement comparison**: Replace GPT-4o-mini with a strong open-source reasoning model (e.g., Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) using identical refinement prompts. Compare structural alignment (Δ) and semantic coherence metrics to assess whether the closed model provides unique value or if the approach can be fully open-sourced.

3. **Cross-domain taxonomy transfer**: Train TaxoAlign on CS-TaxoBench, then evaluate on medical/biology survey taxonomies from PubMed or similar sources. Measure changes in average degree score, level-order traversal metrics, and judge rankings to determine whether the approach generalizes beyond computer science or requires domain-specific adaptation.
