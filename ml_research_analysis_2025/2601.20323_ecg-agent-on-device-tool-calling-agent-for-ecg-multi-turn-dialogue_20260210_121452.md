# ECG-Agent: On-Device Tool-Calling Agent for ECG Multi-Turn Dialogue

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.20323
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20323
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: On-device ECG-Agent outperforms baselines in multi-turn ECG dialogue using specialized tool-calling architecture

## Executive Summary
ECG-Agent is a multi-turn ECG dialogue agent that leverages tool-calling to enable precise, on-device ECG interpretation. The system addresses key limitations of existing ECG-LLMs, including poor multi-turn dialogue capabilities, lack of precision, and high computational demands. By combining a lightweight LLM with specialized tools for classification, measurement, and explanation, ECG-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for deployment on edge devices.

The system was trained on ECG-MTD, a novel dataset of realistic ECG dialogues, and demonstrates superior performance across 12-lead, Lead I, and Lead II configurations. Notably, the on-device models (1B, 3B) achieve performance comparable to larger models, making ECG-Agent a practical solution for real-world clinical applications requiring efficient and accurate ECG dialogue capabilities.

## Method Summary
ECG-Agent employs a tool-calling architecture that integrates a lightweight LLM with specialized ECG tools for classification, measurement, and explanation. The system is trained on ECG-MTD, a new dataset of realistic ECG dialogues designed to capture multi-turn interactions. The tool-calling mechanism allows the agent to invoke specific tools based on the context of the conversation, enabling precise and contextually relevant ECG interpretations. The lightweight LLM ensures computational efficiency, making the system suitable for on-device deployment.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines in accuracy and completeness across 12-lead, Lead I, and Lead II configurations
- On-device models (1B, 3B) achieve performance comparable to larger models
- Demonstrates practicality of efficient, accurate ECG dialogue agents for real-world applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tool-calling architecture enables precise, context-aware ECG interpretation by allowing the agent to invoke specialized tools for specific tasks. This modular approach addresses the limitations of monolithic LLMs, which often struggle with precision and multi-turn dialogue in clinical settings. The lightweight LLM ensures computational efficiency, while the specialized tools provide domain-specific expertise, resulting in accurate and efficient ECG dialogue.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: LLM -> Tool-Calling Module -> ECG Tools (Classification, Measurement, Explanation)
**Critical Path**: Input ECG and dialogue context → Tool selection → Tool execution → Response generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Lightweight LLM vs. accuracy, tool granularity vs. computational efficiency
**Failure Signatures**: Incorrect tool invocation, context loss in multi-turn dialogue, misclassification in specialized tools
