core_contribution: This work addresses the challenge of learning in sparse-reward
  environments by proposing a two-level architecture combining intrinsic motivation
  (ICM) with sub-goal segmentation and policy learning (PTR). The ICM module explores
  the state space and identifies candidate sub-goals, while PTR learns specialized
  policies to achieve these sub-goals, using a competence-based criterion to determine
  when policies are robust enough.

# Autonomous state-space segmentation for Deep-RL sparse reward scenarios

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.03420
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03420
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** ICM+PTR achieves more efficient exploration and optimal state space partitioning in Gym SuperMarioBros without extrinsic rewards

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a two-level architecture for autonomous state-space segmentation in sparse-reward Deep RL environments. The approach combines intrinsic motivation (ICM) for exploration with a sub-goal segmentation and policy learning (PTR) module that creates specialized policies for achieving identified sub-goals. The method demonstrates that agents can learn to navigate complex environments like SuperMarioBros without any extrinsic rewards by autonomously discovering and chaining together sub-policies to reach the final goal.

The ICM module explores the state space and identifies candidate sub-goals, while PTR learns specialized policies to achieve these sub-goals using a competence-based criterion to determine when policies are robust enough. The approach shows more efficient exploration and optimal partitioning of the state space compared to single-exploration approaches, reaching level ends in fewer steps with lower variance in sub-goal creation across seeds.

## Method Summary
The method employs a hierarchical architecture where intrinsic curiosity-driven exploration (ICM) first maps the environment and identifies promising sub-goals. The PTR component then learns specialized policies for each sub-goal, using a competence criterion to assess policy robustness before proceeding. The agent chains these sub-policies sequentially to navigate toward the final goal. The approach operates entirely without extrinsic rewards, relying on the agent's intrinsic motivation to explore and segment the state space into meaningful sub-goals that can be achieved through dedicated policies.

## Key Results
- Achieved goal completion in Gym SuperMarioBros environment without any extrinsic rewards
- Demonstrated more efficient exploration compared to single-exploration approaches
- Reached level's end in fewer steps with lower variance in sub-goal creation across seeds
- Successfully chained sub-policies to navigate complex state spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by decomposing a complex sparse-reward problem into manageable sub-problems through autonomous state-space segmentation. The ICM module drives exploration by maximizing curiosity about novel state transitions, while PTR creates specialized policies for each identified sub-goal. The competence criterion ensures policies are sufficiently robust before transitioning, preventing premature sub-goal abandonment. This hierarchical decomposition allows the agent to make progress in environments where flat RL would struggle due to reward sparsity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Intrinsic Motivation (ICM)**: Internal reward signals that drive exploration of novel states; needed to overcome sparse external rewards, check by measuring state coverage
- **Sub-goal Segmentation**: Identifying meaningful intermediate states that partition the task; needed to break down complex problems, check by evaluating policy specialization
- **Competence-based Policy Evaluation**: Criteria for determining when a policy has mastered its sub-goal; needed to ensure reliable sub-policy performance, check by testing policy consistency
- **Hierarchical Policy Chaining**: Sequencing sub-policies to achieve long-term goals; needed to combine local solutions into global success, check by measuring goal completion rates
- **State-space Partitioning**: Dividing the environment into regions with specialized behaviors; needed for efficient learning, check by analyzing state visitation patterns
- **Reward-free Learning**: Learning without extrinsic rewards; needed for truly sparse-reward scenarios, check by confirming zero external reward usage

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** ICM -> Sub-goal Detection -> PTR Policy Learning -> Competence Evaluation -> Sub-policy Chaining

**Critical Path:** The agent first uses ICM to explore and identify sub-goals, then PTR learns policies for each sub-goal, competence evaluation determines policy readiness, and successful policies are chained to reach the final goal.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Single ICM vs. ICM+PTR - single ICM provides simpler exploration but lacks specialized policy learning and optimal partitioning. The two-level approach adds complexity but achieves more efficient exploration and better state space segmentation.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Poor sub-goal identification leading to redundant policies
- Competence criteria too strict (exploration stalls) or too loose (failed transitions)
- Sub-policy chaining failures when policies aren't properly sequenced
- Over-segmentation creating excessive sub-goals with insufficient data

**First Experiments:**
1. Test ICM module alone in sparse-reward environment to verify exploration capability
2. Validate PTR policy learning on pre-identified sub-goals before full integration
3. Run with disabled competence criterion to measure its impact on policy performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns to 3D or procedurally generated environments where state space segmentation is more challenging
- Limited evaluation scope to a single domain without comparison to alternative sparse-reward methods
- Lack of formal theoretical grounding for the competence criterion
- Potential sensitivity to hyperparameter choices affecting performance

## Confidence
- **High:** ICM+PTR can segment state space and chain sub-policies to reach goals in sparse-reward settings (empirically demonstrated)
- **Medium:** Claims of "optimal partitioning" supported by lower variance in sub-goal creation across seeds rather than formal optimality proofs
- **Low:** Generalization claims to other domains due to limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach in procedurally generated environments or 3D navigation tasks to assess scalability
2. Compare ICM+PTR against established sparse-reward methods (HRL, curiosity-based exploration) on identical benchmarks
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the competence criterion to quantify its contribution to policy performance
