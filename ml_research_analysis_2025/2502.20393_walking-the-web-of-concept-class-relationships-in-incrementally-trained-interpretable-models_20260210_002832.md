# Walking the Web of Concept-Class Relationships in Incrementally Trained Interpretable Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20393
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20393
- Reference count: 40
- Proposed MuCIL model achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 2x classification accuracy compared to other concept-based models in some cases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MuCIL (Multimodal Concept-Based Incremental Learner), a novel approach for concept-based incremental learning that dynamically adapts to both new classes and new concepts. The key innovation is the use of multimodal concept embeddings that combine image embeddings with interpretable concept anchors for classification. The approach is designed to scale to newer experiences without increasing parameters, addressing a critical limitation in existing concept-based incremental learning methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and CUB200 demonstrate superior performance, achieving over 2x the classification accuracy of competing methods in certain scenarios.

## Method Summary
MuCIL employs a multimodal concept embedding approach that combines image embeddings with interpretable concept anchors to perform classification in incremental learning scenarios. The model uses concept sets that evolve across experiences while maintaining parameter efficiency. When encountering new classes or concepts, MuCIL updates its concept representations without increasing the overall model size. The system is trained to preserve concept information across experiences while adapting to new classification tasks, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where both class and concept distributions change over time.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 2x classification performance compared to other concept-based models in some cases
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art classification performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and CUB200
- Introduced three new metrics to evaluate concept-based models in incremental learning settings
- Showed significantly better preservation of concept information across experiences compared to competing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MuCIL works by leveraging multimodal concept embeddings that combine visual information with interpretable concept anchors, creating a richer representation space that can adapt to new classes and concepts without requiring parameter growth. The model maintains a dynamic concept set that evolves across experiences while preserving information from previous concepts through the multimodal embedding space. This approach allows the model to establish connections between old and new concepts, enabling knowledge transfer and reducing catastrophic forgetting. The combination of image embeddings and interpretable anchors provides both the flexibility to adapt to new data and the interpretability needed for concept-based learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Incremental Learning**: Needed because real-world scenarios involve continuously arriving data; quick check is whether model maintains performance on previous classes
- **Concept-based Models**: Needed for interpretability and reasoning; quick check is whether concepts remain meaningful and identifiable
- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Needed to combine different information sources; quick check is whether embeddings capture complementary information
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Critical challenge in incremental learning; quick check is performance drop on previous tasks
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Essential for scalability; quick check is whether model size remains constant across experiences
- **Concept Drift**: Real-world phenomenon where concept distributions change; quick check is whether model adapts to changing concept relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Image Embeddings -> Concept Anchors -> Multimodal Concept Embeddings -> Classification Head -> Output

Critical Path: The core inference pipeline flows from image embeddings through concept anchors to create multimodal concept embeddings, which feed into the classification head to produce final predictions.

Design Tradeoffs: The model trades some classification accuracy potential for parameter efficiency and interpretability. By using concept anchors instead of full end-to-end training, the model maintains constant parameters but may miss some complex decision boundaries. The multimodal approach adds computational overhead but provides richer representations for incremental adaptation.

Failure Signatures: Poor concept preservation across experiences, degradation in classification performance on previous classes, inability to adapt to new concepts, and loss of interpretability in concept representations.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test incremental learning performance on CIFAR-100 with varying class arrival orders
2. Evaluate concept preservation metrics across multiple incremental experiences
3. Compare classification accuracy against non-incremental baselines to measure catastrophic forgetting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate the contribution of multimodal concept embeddings versus other components
- Limited experimental validation of scalability claims across different dataset sizes and scenarios
- Focus on relatively clean benchmark datasets that may not reflect real-world noise and complexity

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core architectural innovation and multimodal concept embedding approach | High |
| Scalability claims regarding parameter efficiency | Medium |
| State-of-the-art performance claims | Medium |
| Generalizability of new metrics | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of multimodal concept embeddings versus other architectural components

2. Test the model's performance on datasets with more severe concept drift and class imbalance to validate scalability claims

3. Evaluate the new metrics across different types of concept relationships and distribution shifts to assess their robustness and sensitivity
