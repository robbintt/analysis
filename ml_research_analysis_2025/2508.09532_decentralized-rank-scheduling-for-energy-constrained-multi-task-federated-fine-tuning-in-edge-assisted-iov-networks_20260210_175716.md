# Decentralized Rank Scheduling for Energy-Constrained Multi-Task Federated Fine-Tuning in Edge-Assisted IoV Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09532
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework with decentralized rank scheduling for LoRA-based fine-tuning, achieving >2.5% accuracy improvement and >24% latency reduction in energy-constrained IoV networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of federated fine-tuning in energy-constrained Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks by proposing a hierarchical framework that coordinates roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles for resource-aware learning. The core innovation is a decentralized rank scheduling method for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based fine-tuning, formulated as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. The system uses a novel UCB-DUAL algorithm that enables adaptive rank selection under per-task energy budgets, combining upper confidence bound exploration with dual-variable updates for provable sublinear regret. Experiments using a large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories demonstrate the method achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, reducing latency by over 24% and improving average accuracy by more than 2.5% compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework where a cloud scheduler dynamically allocates energy budgets to RSUs, which in turn coordinate with vehicle clients for local fine-tuning using LoRA adapters. The key innovation is the UCB-DUAL algorithm that formulates rank selection as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem, where each vehicle client selects its LoRA rank to maximize a reward function (accuracy vs. latency) while respecting a global energy constraint. The system incorporates a tri-feedback energy allocation scheme that periodically redistributes energy based on task difficulty, utilization, and convergence trends. Additionally, a mobility-aware fault tolerance mechanism proactively handles imminent client disconnections by evaluating three fallback strategies: early upload, task migration, or abandonment.

## Key Results
- Achieved >2.5% accuracy improvement and >24% latency reduction compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrated effective multi-task adaptation across SST-2, CoNLL-2003, and COPA datasets
- Showed scalability with increasing numbers of concurrent vehicles in the IoV simulator

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Rank Selection via Constrained Bandits
Each client selects a LoRA rank from a candidate set, framing the decision as a constrained multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Clients use a UCB-based exploration strategy to maximize a reward function (accuracy vs. latency) while a shared dual variable penalizes actions that violate the per-task energy budget. This allows for decentralized, resource-aware adaptation.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Energy Allocation
A cloud-level scheduler dynamically distributes energy budgets across tasks based on real-time feedback. A tri-feedback scheme periodically reallocates the global energy budget, prioritizing tasks based on task difficulty, energy utilization efficiency, and a difficulty amplification factor, ensuring resources flow to challenging but efficient tasks.

### Mechanism 3: Mobility-Aware Fault Tolerance
When a vehicle's departure is predicted, the system evaluates three strategies: Early Upload (if accuracy is sufficient), Task Migration (to a nearby vehicle), or Abandonment. It selects the strategy with the lowest expected cost, thus salvaging partial work or preventing wasted energy on incomplete training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - **Why needed here:** LoRA is the fundamental building block. The entire paper is about optimizing the "rank" (η) of these adapters.
  - **Quick check question:** In this architecture, what two matrices form a LoRA adapter, and what happens to their dimensions when the rank (η) is increased?

- **Concept: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames decentralized rank selection as a constrained MAB. Understanding the explore/exploit trade-off is key to understanding why the UCB algorithm is used.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of this paper, what constitutes an "arm" for a vehicle client, and what is the "reward" it tries to maximize?

- **Concept: Primal-Dual Optimization**
  - **Why needed here:** The UCB-DUAL algorithm relies on Lagrangian relaxation and dual variable updates to enforce energy constraints.
  - **Quick check question:** If the total energy consumed by clients in a round exceeds the budget Et, what happens to the dual variable λ in the next round, and how does that influence client rank selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Cloud Scheduler -> RSUs -> Vehicle Clients
- **Critical path:**
  1. Cloud Scheduler allocates per-task energy budget (Et) to the RSU
  2. RSU broadcasts the global model update decomposed via SVD (U, Σ, V^T)
  3. Each vehicle client selects its rank (ηv) by maximizing the Lagrangian objective with the current dual variable (λ)
  4. Clients train locally and upload their updated LoRA matrices
  5. RSU aggregates updates and updates the dual variable (λ) based on total energy consumed

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Adaptivity vs. Stability: The scheduler's reallocation interval (Q) and smoothing factor (ξ) trade off responsiveness to changing task demands against the stability of energy allocation
  - Exploration vs. Energy Cost: The UCB exploration bonus can force clients to try suboptimal, potentially energy-intensive ranks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Dual Variable Divergence: If the dual variable λ grows without bound, indicating consistent energy budget violations
  - Allocation Starvation: If the tri-feedback mechanism is poorly tuned, causing complex tasks to be starved of energy
  - Rank Collapse: Under severe energy constraints, all clients may converge to η=1, sacrificing model accuracy

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run the system with HomoLoRA, HetLoRA, and UCB-DUAL to verify the claimed >2.5% accuracy improvement and >24% latency reduction
  2. Scheduler Ablation: Run the full system vs. a version with the tri-feedback scheduler disabled to quantify the performance gain attributable to global energy allocation
  3. Scalability Stress Test: Use the T-Drive simulator to increase concurrent vehicles (10 to 90) and plot cumulative reward, comparing against baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the UCB-DUAL framework perform when deployed on physical hardware with real-world wireless channel variability?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The evaluation relies exclusively on a large-scale simulator based on T-Drive trajectories rather than physical testbeds
- **Why unresolved:** Simulators abstract physical layer complexities like packet loss and channel fading, which impact the latency and energy models used in the optimization
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results from a hardware-in-the-loop testbed or real-world vehicle deployment validating the latency and energy savings

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the rank scheduling mechanism generalize to high-dimensional vision tasks common in autonomous driving?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experiments are restricted to NLP tasks rather than the visual workloads implied by "autonomous driving" scenarios
- **Why unresolved:** Vision models have different computational/communication profiles and LoRA convergence behaviors than the BERT-based models tested
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation using visual datasets (e.g., Cityscapes) to verify if the sublinear regret bounds and energy savings hold

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How sensitive is the algorithm's convergence to severe non-stationarity in data distributions (concept drift)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The theoretical analysis assumes specific step sizes for regret bounds, which may be volatile if vehicle data distributions shift rapidly over time
- **Why unresolved:** The current T-Drive setup models mobility but may not capture rapid semantic changes in the data stream that affect reward stationarity
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical analysis or experiments explicitly testing performance under adversarial or continuously drifting data distributions

## Limitations
- The specific parameterization of the UCB-DUAL algorithm and tri-feedback scheduler hyperparameters are not explicitly stated, making exact reproduction challenging
- The system relies heavily on simulator-based results rather than real-world deployments, potentially missing physical layer complexities
- The mobility-aware fault tolerance mechanism lacks comprehensive quantitative evaluation in the main results

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The hierarchical framework architecture and general mechanism of using SVD decomposition for LoRA rank selection are well-established concepts
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific UCB-DUAL algorithm's effectiveness depends on proper hyperparameter tuning and the quality of the reward signal
- **Low Confidence:** The mobility-aware fault tolerance mechanism lacks comprehensive evaluation and quantitative results

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary key hyperparameters (ε, ω, rank candidate set φ_η, energy budget Etotal) and measure their impact on the accuracy-efficiency trade-off
2. **Real-World Mobility Integration:** Implement the framework with actual GPS trajectory data from multiple cities and compare performance against simulator-based results
3. **Baseline Comparison with Ablations:** Create a comprehensive ablation study isolating the contribution of each component (LoRA rank adaptation, energy-aware scheduling, mobility-aware fault tolerance) to quantify marginal benefits
