# Unveiling the Potential of Vision-Language-Action Models with Open-Ended Multimodal Instructions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11214
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: OE-VLA achieves competitive performance on both traditional language-only VLA tasks and four new open-ended multimodal instruction types, matching baselines while demonstrating strong generalization to diverse visual inputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OE-VLA, a vision-language-action model that extends traditional VLA capabilities to handle open-ended multimodal instructions beyond language-only prompts. The key innovation is enabling VLA models to accept four types of multimodal inputs: visual object specification (images showing objects to manipulate), optical instruction following (handwritten or printed instructions in images), visual goal reaching (goal state images), and video demonstration learning (multi-frame action demonstrations). Through a two-stage curriculum learning approach—first fine-tuning on a multi-image grounding dataset to improve spatial understanding, then training on robot manipulation data with open-ended multimodal instructions—the model achieves impressive results across all four multimodal instruction categories. The authors also create two new benchmarks (OE-CALVINbase and OE-CALVINhard) to evaluate this approach, demonstrating that OE-VLA not only matches traditional VLA performance but significantly expands the applicability of VLA models in everyday human-robot interaction scenarios.

## Method Summary
OE-VLA extends VLA models to handle multimodal instructions through a two-stage curriculum learning approach. The method processes all images (observation + instruction images) through a SigLIP vision encoder into visual tokens, which are interleaved with text tokens in their original positions and fed to an LLM backbone. Stage 1 fine-tunes the foundation model on a multi-image grounding dataset to enhance spatial understanding, while Stage 2 trains on robot manipulation data with open-ended multimodal instructions. The authors systematically transform existing robot datasets into multimodal format using automated tools: object detection for visual object specification, rendering libraries for optical instructions, frame sampling for video demonstrations, and episode segmentation for goal images. The model uses discretized actions mapped to vocabulary tokens rather than continuous action heads, balancing computational simplicity against potential performance gains.

## Key Results
- OE-VLA matches traditional language-conditioned VLA model performance on standard tasks while achieving impressive results across all four multimodal instruction categories
- The model demonstrates exceptional performance on visual object specification tasks (VOS) and maintains competitive results on the challenging OE-CALVINhard benchmark with web-sourced images
- Ablation studies show that stage-1 spatial grounding pre-training improves performance by 15-25% on language-heavy tasks, with consistent improvements across all task types
- Visual goal reaching (VGR) remains the most challenging task category, with significantly lower success rates than other instruction types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Interleaved Token Fusion for Multimodal Instructions
- Claim: Unified token sequence processing enables handling of interleaved image-text instructions across diverse task types.
- Mechanism: The vision encoder processes all images (observation + instruction images) into visual tokens via SigLIP ViT. These tokens are interleaved with text tokens in their original positions, forming a single sequence fed to the LLM backbone. The model learns to attend across modalities to extract task-relevant information.
- Core assumption: Pre-training on interleaved multi-image datasets (visual storytelling, video captioning) transfers to robot manipulation tasks requiring spatial reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we introduce OE-VLA, which explores the potential of VLA models for open-ended multimodal instructions"
  - [section 4.1]: "We concatenate all of these tokens while maintaining their original positions to form the final sequence of tokens that is then fed into the LLM"
  - [corpus]: Interleave-VLA (arXiv:2505.02152) demonstrates similar interleaved approaches improve generalization over text-only instructions
- Break condition: When instruction image count exceeds context window capacity (32k tokens limits approximately 20+ images), or when visual instructions contain information fundamentally incompatible with the observation modality.

### Mechanism 2: Spatial Grounding Pre-training for Manipulation Transfer
- Claim: Curriculum learning with spatial grounding tasks before robot training improves manipulation performance on multimodal instructions.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 fine-tunes on MGrounding dataset containing object tracking, referencing grounding, and free-form multi-image tasks. This enhances the model's ability to perceive and reason about spatial relationships between objects across images. Stage 2 then applies this enhanced spatial understanding to robot manipulation.
- Core assumption: Spatial reasoning skills learned from grounding tasks transfer to robot manipulation scenarios involving object localization and interaction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "This training stage is designed to further enhance the foundation model's ability to accurately perceive spatial relationships between objects"
  - [section 5.2.3, Figure 5]: Ablation study shows VOS LH-1 improving from 69.7% to 94.0% with stage 1 learning; consistent improvements across all task types
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence on grounding-to-manipulation transfer; this remains a hypothesized mechanism requiring further validation
- Break condition: When grounding task spatial relationships are too dissimilar from robot workspace configurations, or when grounding pre-training causes catastrophic forgetting of robot-relevant knowledge.

### Mechanism 3: Synthetic Multimodal Instruction Generation
- Claim: Algorithmic transformation of language-annotated datasets into multimodal format enables training without collecting new human demonstrations.
- Mechanism: The method systematically converts existing robot datasets: (1) VLM identifies objects in annotations, (2) object detection localizes and crops object images, (3) rendering libraries generate optical instructions with varied fonts/backgrounds, (4) frame sampling extracts video demonstrations, (5) episode segmentation provides goal images.
- Core assumption: Synthetic multimodal instructions preserve task-relevant information from original language annotations while adding visual diversity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: Detailed construction pipeline for all four task types using automated tools
  - [table 2]: OE-VLA1b achieves 2.75 average successful sequence length on multimodal tasks, comparable to language-only baseline performance
  - [corpus]: Assumption: No corpus evidence directly validates synthetic instruction quality or transfer to real-world deployment
- Break condition: When synthetic images lack sufficient visual diversity, contain rendering artifacts differing from real-world conditions, or when object detection failures corrupt the training data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vision-Language-Action Tokenization**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how continuous robot actions (7-DOF end-effector poses + gripper state) are discretized into language tokens is essential for interpreting model output and debugging action generation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the paper maps continuous robot actions to 256 discrete bins using least-frequent Qwen vocabulary tokens, and why action chunking uses 5 steps?

- **Concept: Multi-Image Attention in Transformers**
  - Why needed here: The model must process multiple images simultaneously (observation + 1-4 instruction images) and reason about object correspondence across them.
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism enable the model to relate an object shown in an instruction image to the same object appearing in the robot's observation?

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning for Embodied AI**
  - Why needed here: The two-stage training approach is central to the method's success and represents a key design choice.
  - Quick check question: What is the hypothesized benefit of training on multi-image grounding tasks before robot manipulation, and what evidence supports this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Observation + instruction images → SigLIP-400M ViT → visual tokens → MLP projector → aligned embedding space; Text fragments → Qwen tokenizer → language tokens; Interleaved concatenation → LLM backbone → action tokens → detokenization → continuous robot commands

- **Critical path:** 1) All images (observation + instruction) → SigLIP encoder → visual tokens 2) Text fragments → Qwen tokenizer → language tokens 3) Visual tokens → MLP projector → aligned embedding space 4) Interleaved concatenation preserves original text-image positions 5) LLM generates action tokens autoregressively 6) Action detokenization recovers continuous robot commands (5-step chunks)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Discretized actions vs. continuous action heads: Paper uses discretization for architectural simplicity, knowingly sacrificing potential gains from diffusion/flow matching heads (acknowledged in related work discussion)
  - 5-step action chunking: Balances temporal prediction horizon against computational cost and error accumulation
  - Dataset partitioning: Uses ~40% of raw data per task type (resulting in 2× total size) to maintain manageable training time

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Visual Goal Reaching (VGR) consistently underperforms across all experiments (OE-CALVINhard: 1.25 avg length vs. 3.14 for OIF), suggesting single goal images provide insufficient information
  - Performance degradation on OE-CALVINhard (web images, diverse environments) indicates generalization limitations
  - Models trained on multimodal-heavy data show slight performance reduction on pure language instructions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Implement OE-VLA1b and reproduce OE-CALVINbase ABC→D results (target: ~2.75 avg successful length across task types)
  2. **Stage 1 ablation**: Train without multi-image grounding pre-training to quantify spatial curriculum contribution (expect 15-25% LH-1 performance drop based on Figure 5)
  3. **Data ratio sensitivity**: Compare training with varying text-to-multimodal instruction ratios to identify optimal trade-off point for balanced performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal data mixing ratio between text-only instructions and multimodal instructions when training VLA models for open-ended tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 5.2.4, the authors state "a better trade-off of the data recipe may be explored in the future" after showing that models trained solely on textual instructions outperform the mixed training on linguistic tasks.
- Why unresolved: The current 40%/task split creates a dataset twice the original size with multimodal data significantly exceeding text-only data, potentially harming language-only performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study varying the text-to-multimodal ratio and measuring performance across all instruction types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can visual goal reaching (VGR) performance be improved to match the other open-ended task categories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Section 5.2.2 that "visual goal reaching (VGR) remains difficult due to the limited information contained in a single image," with VGR consistently showing the lowest success rates across both benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: A single goal image may lack sufficient information for the model to infer the required action sequence compared to explicit instructions or demonstrations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with multi-frame goal representations or augmented goal specifications showing improved VGR success rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would integrating a diffusion policy head with OE-VLA yield complementary improvements for open-ended multimodal instructions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors deliberately exclude diffusion heads "to pursue further performance enhancement" focused on the core contribution, but prior work (CogAct, π0, GR00T) shows diffusion heads improve VLA performance.
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear whether diffusion-based action prediction is compatible with interleaved multimodal instruction processing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training OE-VLA variants with diffusion heads and comparing success rates on OE-CALVIN benchmarks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can OE-VLA's open-ended instruction following capabilities transfer effectively to real-world robotic manipulation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments are conducted on the simulated CALVIN benchmark suite; the paper acknowledges web-sourced images and diverse environments in OE-CALVINhard but does not address sim-to-real transfer.
- Why unresolved: Real-world deployment introduces visual domain shifts, lighting variations, and physical execution challenges absent in simulation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Real-robot experiments evaluating OE-VLA on physical manipulation tasks with multimodal instructions.

## Limitations

- The model shows significant performance degradation on OE-CALVINhard with web-sourced images, indicating generalization gaps to diverse real-world environments
- Visual goal reaching (VGR) remains consistently the weakest task category across all experiments, suggesting fundamental limitations in single-image goal specification
- The reliance on synthetic multimodal instruction generation through algorithmic transformation raises questions about data quality and potential distribution shift from real-world conditions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of handling multimodal instructions through interleaved token fusion is technically sound and well-supported by the Interleave-VLA related work. The performance improvements on OE-CALVINbase and the ablation study showing benefits of stage-1 grounding pre-training are empirically demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence:** The synthetic instruction generation pipeline appears feasible, but the assumption that algorithmic transformations preserve task-relevant information lacks direct validation. The observed performance trade-offs between multimodal and language-only instructions suggest the data balance strategy may not be optimal.

**Low Confidence:** The transfer learning hypothesis connecting spatial grounding pre-training to improved manipulation performance has limited empirical support. The significant performance drop on web-sourced images (OE-CALVINhard) suggests the model may not generalize as claimed to diverse real-world environments.

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic Data Quality Audit:** Conduct a systematic evaluation comparing synthetic multimodal instructions against human-generated equivalents on a held-out validation set, measuring semantic preservation, visual diversity, and instruction clarity to quantify potential distribution shift.

2. **Generalization Stress Test:** Evaluate OE-VLA on a diverse set of real-world robot manipulation tasks beyond CALVIN, including cluttered environments, novel object categories, and varying lighting conditions to assess claims about "everyday human-robot interaction scenarios."

3. **Curriculum Learning Transfer Analysis:** Design an ablation study isolating the spatial reasoning components learned in stage-1 grounding from other potential effects (e.g., optimization dynamics, regularization), using techniques like feature similarity analysis and zero-shot transfer to spatial reasoning tasks.
