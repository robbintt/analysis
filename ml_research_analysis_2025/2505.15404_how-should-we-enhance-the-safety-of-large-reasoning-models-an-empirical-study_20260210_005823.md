# How Should We Enhance the Safety of Large Reasoning Models: An Empirical Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15404
- Reference count: 25
- Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) fail to achieve safety through direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1, requiring explicit addressing of three failure patterns

## Executive Summary
This empirical study investigates the challenge of enhancing safety in Large Reasoning Models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The authors demonstrate that directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1 fails to significantly improve safety, contrary to expectations. Through systematic manual analysis, they identify three key failure patterns - lack of safety awareness, overthinking, and inconsistency between reasoning and final answers - that must be explicitly addressed during the distillation process. By targeting these patterns, they achieve substantial safety improvements, reducing attack success rates from 77.0% to 7.0% across four LRM variants. The study also reveals that shorter or template-based reasoning processes can achieve comparable safety performance while being more efficient to learn than long reasoning chains.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted a comprehensive empirical study on safety enhancement for Large Reasoning Models using Supervised Fine-Tuning approaches. They began by attempting direct distillation of safe responses from DeepSeek-R1 to other LRM variants, then systematically analyzed why this approach failed through manual annotation of model outputs. Based on their analysis, they implemented targeted safety enhancements that explicitly address three identified failure patterns. The study employed attack success rate (ASR) as the primary metric for safety evaluation, testing across multiple datasets and model architectures. They also explored the impact of reasoning length and template-based approaches on safety performance, and investigated the effect of mixing benign math reasoning data during safety fine-tuning to balance safety with over-refusal.

## Key Results
- Direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 fails to significantly improve safety, with attack success rates remaining high at 77.0%
- Explicitly addressing three failure patterns (lack of safety awareness, overthinking, inconsistency) reduces ASR from 77.0% to 7.0% across four LRM variants
- Shorter or template-based reasoning processes achieve comparable safety performance while being easier to learn than long reasoning chains
- Mixing benign math reasoning data during safety fine-tuning helps balance safety improvements with reduced over-refusal

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that Large Reasoning Models exhibit specific failure patterns that prevent effective safety transfer through direct distillation. These models fail to internalize safety principles because they lack awareness of harmful content, engage in excessive reasoning that can rationalize harmful outputs, and show inconsistencies between their reasoning process and final answers. By explicitly addressing these patterns during fine-tuning, the models develop better safety awareness, learn to terminate reasoning when harmful content is detected, and maintain consistency between their reasoning and conclusions. The effectiveness of shorter or template-based reasoning suggests that the safety signal can be conveyed more efficiently when the reasoning process is streamlined or structured, reducing opportunities for harmful rationalization while maintaining performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)** - AI systems that generate step-by-step reasoning before producing final answers, similar to Chain-of-Thought prompting but with enhanced reasoning capabilities. Why needed: Understanding LRM architecture is crucial as they represent the target models for safety enhancement. Quick check: Verify the model generates intermediate reasoning steps before final answers.

**Attack Success Rate (ASR)** - The percentage of safety attacks that successfully elicit harmful or unsafe responses from a model. Why needed: ASR is the primary metric used to quantify safety improvements across different fine-tuning approaches. Quick check: Confirm ASR calculation method across all evaluation datasets.

**Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** - A training approach where models learn from labeled examples of desired behavior, in this case safe responses. Why needed: SFT is the core methodology used for safety enhancement in this study. Quick check: Ensure training data includes diverse safety scenarios and proper labeling.

**Overthinking** - A failure pattern where models engage in excessive reasoning that can rationalize or justify harmful outputs. Why needed: Identifying overthinking as a failure pattern was crucial for developing effective safety interventions. Quick check: Look for long reasoning chains that end with unsafe conclusions.

**Reasoning Consistency** - The alignment between a model's intermediate reasoning steps and its final answer, particularly regarding safety considerations. Why needed: Inconsistency between reasoning and final answers represents a critical failure mode in LRM safety. Quick check: Verify that safety considerations present in reasoning are reflected in final outputs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Manual Analysis -> Pattern Identification -> Targeted Fine-Tuning -> Safety Evaluation -> Performance Assessment

**Critical Path:** The essential sequence is Data Collection → Manual Analysis → Pattern Identification → Targeted Fine-Tuning → Safety Evaluation, as each step builds upon the previous one to achieve the final safety improvements.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study balances reasoning length (shorter vs. longer chains) against safety performance and learning efficiency. Shorter reasoning may be easier to learn but might miss important deliberative steps, while longer reasoning provides more context but increases training complexity and potential for harmful rationalization.

**Failure Signatures:** Models exhibit three main failure signatures: (1) generating harmful content without recognizing its problematic nature, (2) engaging in excessive reasoning that rationalizes harmful outputs, and (3) showing inconsistency between safe reasoning steps and unsafe final answers.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to test baseline safety transfer capability
2. Targeted fine-tuning addressing individual failure patterns to assess their relative impact
3. Comparative evaluation of different reasoning lengths to identify optimal balance between safety and efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Empirical analysis limited to four LRM variants and specific safety datasets, potentially limiting generalizability
- Manual analysis of failure patterns conducted by authors without external validation or inter-rater reliability checks
- Study focuses exclusively on Supervised Fine-Tuning approaches, not exploring alternatives like RLHF or constitutional AI
- Effectiveness metrics rely primarily on attack success rate, which may not capture all safety and utility trade-offs

## Confidence
- High confidence: Direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 fails to significantly improve safety, supported by experimental results and multiple ablation studies
- Medium confidence: Three failure patterns identified through manual analysis, though may reflect subjective interpretation
- Medium confidence: Shorter/template-based reasoning achieves comparable safety, but lacks detailed analysis of underlying mechanisms
- Medium confidence: Mixing benign math data helps balance safety and over-refusal, requiring further validation across different model families

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation of the three identified failure patterns by having independent safety researchers annotate model responses to verify pattern classification
2. Perform systematic ablation studies comparing shorter reasoning, template-based approaches, and different reasoning length cutoffs across multiple LRM architectures
3. Test proposed safety enhancements against adversarial attacks specifically designed to exploit identified failure patterns (lack of safety awareness, overthinking, inconsistency) to verify robustness
