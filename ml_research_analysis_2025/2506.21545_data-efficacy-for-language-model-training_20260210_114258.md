# Data Efficacy for Language Model Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21545
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21545
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces DELT paradigm showing data organization strategies can improve language model performance without increasing data scale or model size

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the relatively unexplored area of data efficacy in language model training, focusing on how optimal data organization can improve model performance. While data efficiency (achieving more with less data) has been extensively studied, data efficacy examines how the arrangement and selection of training data impacts learning outcomes. The authors propose DELT, a general paradigm that includes data scoring, selection, and ordering components to enhance language model training effectiveness.

The DELT framework introduces Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) to evaluate each training sample based on learnability and quality from a gradient consistency perspective, and Folding Ordering (FO) to reorganize data to mitigate model forgetting and distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DELT significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks without requiring additional data or larger models, establishing data efficacy as a promising complementary approach to traditional data efficiency methods.

## Method Summary
The DELT paradigm consists of three main components: data scoring, selection, and ordering. The Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) method evaluates each sample based on two dimensions - learnability (how easily the model can learn from the sample) and quality (the sample's contribution to overall model performance). This evaluation is performed from a gradient consistency perspective, ensuring that samples with stable and informative gradients are prioritized. The Folding Ordering (FO) component reorganizes the training data to address two key challenges: model forgetting (where the model loses previously learned information) and data distribution bias (where certain data patterns dominate training). The paradigm is designed to be general and applicable across different model architectures and training scenarios.

## Key Results
- DELT significantly improves language model performance across multiple benchmarks without increasing data scale or model size
- The combination of LQS and FO achieves the most substantial performance improvements
- Data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection within the DELT framework
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the DELT paradigm across various language modeling tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DELT paradigm works by optimizing the learning trajectory through intelligent data organization. LQS ensures that each training sample contributes maximally to model learning by selecting samples that are both learnable and high-quality, based on gradient consistency analysis. This prevents the model from wasting computational resources on samples that are either too difficult to learn from or too easy to provide meaningful learning signals. FO addresses the temporal aspects of learning by reorganizing data to prevent catastrophic forgetting and ensure balanced exposure to different data distributions throughout training. Together, these components create a more efficient learning process where the model encounters the most beneficial data at the optimal time during training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gradient Consistency**: Understanding how stable and informative gradients from training samples affect learning efficiency; needed to identify which samples contribute most effectively to model improvement; quick check: analyze gradient variance across different sample types
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Knowledge of how neural networks lose previously learned information when trained on new data; needed to design data ordering strategies that preserve learned knowledge; quick check: measure performance degradation on earlier tasks after training on new data
- **Data Distribution Bias**: Recognition that imbalanced or skewed data distributions can lead to suboptimal model performance; needed to ensure balanced learning across different data patterns; quick check: analyze model performance across different data subsets

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Collection -> LQS Scoring -> Data Selection -> FO Ordering -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation

Critical path: LQS Scoring -> Data Selection -> FO Ordering -> Model Training

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances computational overhead of scoring/ordering against performance gains; prioritizes gradient-based sample evaluation over traditional heuristics

Failure signatures: Poor performance on certain data subsets may indicate inadequate handling of distribution bias; inconsistent improvements across benchmarks may suggest overfitting to specific data characteristics

First experiments: 1) Apply LQS to a small dataset and analyze gradient consistency patterns; 2) Test FO on sequential data to measure forgetting reduction; 3) Combine LQS and FO on a standard benchmark to establish baseline improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the methodology raises several important considerations about the generalizability and scalability of data efficacy approaches in language model training.

## Limitations
- LQS method may overfit to specific datasets and model architectures, with limited cross-linguistic validation
- FO approach may not generalize well to highly dynamic or streaming data scenarios with rapidly changing distributions
- Computational overhead of scoring and ordering processes could be prohibitive for very large-scale training scenarios

| Data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the DELT paradigm on multilingual and cross-lingual language models to assess generalization beyond English
2. Evaluate the computational overhead and scalability of LQS and FO in training scenarios with billions of parameters and samples
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of scoring, selection, and ordering components to performance gains
