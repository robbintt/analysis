- The system achieved positive SUS scores from 10 participants for navigating speech archives with AI-generated visual illustrations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for navigating speech archives using AI-generated illustrations and interactive mind maps. The system leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo for topic extraction and Novita AI's txt2img model to create visual summaries for each recording. Built on the TED-LIUM 3 dataset (2,351 TED Talks), the method combines TF-IDF clustering with human-in-the-loop refinement to create 259 manageable categories. A usability evaluation with 10 participants using the System Usability Scale (SUS) showed generally positive results, though some users found the system complex.

## Method Summary
The method involves preprocessing TED-LIUM 3 transcripts (removing metadata, unknown tokens, and stopwords; lemmatization), then applying TF-IDF vectorization followed by K-Means clustering. Users interactively refine the 259 categories generated. GPT-3.5 Turbo extracts single-word topics from each transcript, which are then passed to Novita AI's txt2img v3 model to generate representative images. The system features a React frontend with a mind map visualization displaying recordings as nodes within topical clusters, backed by a Flask API. Users can search, filter, and click through to detailed views.

## Key Results
- SUS questionnaire with 10 participants showed generally positive usability results
- Users found the system easy to navigate with strong agreement on ease of use
- Mean Word Error Rate of transcripts was 6.7%
- Most users found the system intuitive, though some suggested refinements to reduce complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AI-generated visual illustrations reduce cognitive load for exploring speech collections by providing rapid topical summaries without requiring users to read transcripts or listen to recordings.
- Mechanism: The system uses GPT-3.5 Turbo to extract a primary topic word from each transcript, then passes this to Novita AI's txt2img model to generate a representative image. This creates a visual shortcut to content meaning.
- Core assumption: Users can identify relevant recordings faster through images than through text metadata alone; the single-word topic extraction captures sufficient semantic essence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "AI-generated images summarize each recording's content, enhancing user engagement and accessibility"
  - [Section 3.4]: "Such illustrations provide a quick and effective overview of the main subject of each recording"
  - [Section 4]: "A majority of participants found the system easy to use, with responses indicating strong agreement regarding ease of navigation"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on speech dialogue generation, not visual navigation interfaces
- Break condition: If topic extraction fails to capture nuance (e.g., "security" for talks about food security vs. cybersecurity), images may mislead rather than assist users.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semi-automatic clustering with controlled granularity prevents information overload by limiting category proliferation while maintaining topical coherence.
- Mechanism: TF-IDF vectors are clustered via K-Means, but a human reviews and filters categories interactively. This differs from pure LLM-based categorization (which produced overly specific categories) and unsupervised methods like BERTopic (which produced impractical cluster distributions).
- Core assumption: Neither fully automatic nor fully manual categorization is optimal; a hybrid approach balances scale with semantic quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3]: "LLM-generated categories, as well as standard clustering methods such as BERTopic and LDA, were impractical"
  - [Section 3.3]: "We adopted a semi-automatic approach using simple statistical methods, which allowed us to control both the number and size of categories"
  - [Section 5]: "A major limitation in applying this system to new collections is the semi-automatic clustering"
  - [corpus]: Tangential; Park et al. [8] (cited) used LLM-based segmentation for podcasts, but clustering granularity tradeoffs are not directly addressed in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If dataset size or topical diversity differs significantly from TED-LIUM 3, the 259-category structure may become either too coarse or too fragmented.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mind map visualization with interactive node-link structure enables serendipitous discovery that metadata-only browsing cannot support.
- Mechanism: Recordings are displayed as nodes within topical clusters; hover reveals metadata, click navigates to detail page. The spatial grouping creates visual proximity cues that suggest relatedness.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from exploratory navigation where visual proximity suggests semantic relatedness, rather than relying solely on search queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 1]: "Our method can lead to more serendipitous discoveries and new insights than these methods and has the potential to be more intuitive, interactive, and user-friendly"
  - [Section 3.1]: "The goal is to create an intuitive way for users to interact with vast and extensive collections of spoken content"
  - [Section 4]: "Some users expressed concerns about its complexity and perceived cumbersomeness"
  - [corpus]: No direct neighbor evidence on mind map efficacy for speech navigation; Shamma et al. [12] (cited) addresses visual interfaces for media but not specifically mind maps
- Break condition: If node density becomes high within a cluster, the visual advantage degrades; users reported some complexity concerns in SUS responses.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: TF-IDF vectorization with K-Means clustering
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly rejects LLM-based categorization and BERTopic, opting for TF-IDF + K-Means as the foundation for their semi-automatic approach.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why TF-IDF might produce more controllable cluster sizes than embedding-based methods like BERTopic for this use case?

- Concept: System Usability Scale (SUS) interpretation
  - Why needed here: The evaluation relies entirely on SUS scores from 10 participants; understanding what SUS measures (and its limitations) is critical for interpreting claims.
  - Quick check question: What does a SUS score indicate, and why might a sample size of 10 limit generalizability?

- Concept: Word Error Rate (WER) in ASR pipelines
  - Why needed here: The TED-LIUM 3 transcripts have 6.7% WER; this noise propagates into topic extraction and clustering quality.
  - Quick check question: How might a 6.7% WER affect the quality of GPT-3.5 topic extraction from transcripts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Raw transcript → preprocessing → TF-IDF vectors → K-Means clustering → human-in-the-loop category review
  - Transcript → GPT-3.5 prompt → single-word topic → Novita AI → image
  - User interaction → React frontend → Flask API → category/recording retrieval → display in mind map

- Critical path:
  1. Raw transcript → preprocessing (remove metadata, unknown tokens, stopwords, lemmatize)
  2. Preprocessed text → TF-IDF vectors → K-Means clustering → human-in-the-loop category review
  3. Transcript → GPT-3.5 prompt → single-word topic → Novita AI → image
  4. User interaction → React frontend → Flask API → category/recording retrieval → display in mind map

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Image generation cost vs. quality**: Novita AI chosen at $0.001/image; paper acknowledges upgrading to more sophisticated models could improve descriptiveness
  - **Clustering automation vs. control**: Pure LLM categorization too granular; semi-automatic approach requires human intervention but produces 259 manageable categories
  - **Single-topic assumption**: Each recording assigned one primary topic; paper notes multi-topical recordings would benefit from multiple categories

- Failure signatures:
  - **Category imbalance**: LLM-based clustering created too many categories with too few recordings; monitor cluster size distribution
  - **Image-topic mismatch**: Prompt engineering critical; paper found short, concise descriptions work best with Novita AI
  - **Scalability bottleneck**: Semi-automatic clustering requires human review; paper explicitly flags this as a limitation for new collections

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the TF-IDF + K-Means clustering pipeline on a subset of TED-LIUM 3 (e.g., 100 recordings) and compare cluster coherence against a BERTopic baseline.
  2. Test the GPT-3.5 topic extraction prompt on transcripts with artificially injected ASR errors to measure robustness to WER noise.
  3. Build a minimal Flask + React prototype displaying 3 clusters with AI-generated images, and conduct a 5-user SUS pilot to validate the interface before scaling to full dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The semi-automatic clustering approach requires significant human intervention and doesn't scale well to new collections without substantial manual effort
- The evaluation sample size (10 participants) provides limited generalizability for SUS scores
- Single-topic extraction may inadequately represent multi-topical recordings, potentially misleading users through oversimplification

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using AI-generated images for rapid content summarization is well-supported by both the implementation and user feedback
- **Medium Confidence**: The semi-automatic clustering approach's effectiveness is demonstrated on TED-LIUM 3 but remains untested on other datasets with different topical distributions
- **Low Confidence**: The serendipitous discovery claims lack direct comparative evidence against metadata-only browsing approaches

## Next Checks
1. Conduct A/B testing comparing mind map navigation with traditional metadata search/filtering to quantify discovery benefits
2. Test the system on a non-TED dataset (e.g., podcast archives) to evaluate clustering scalability and category coherence
3. Implement multi-topic extraction for recordings with diverse content and measure impact on user navigation efficiency
