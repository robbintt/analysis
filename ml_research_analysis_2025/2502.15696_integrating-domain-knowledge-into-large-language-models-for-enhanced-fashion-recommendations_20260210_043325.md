# Integrating Domain Knowledge into Large Language Models for Enhanced Fashion Recommendations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15696
- Authors: Zhan Shi; Shanglin Yang
- Reference count: 25
- FLLM achieves 62.17% accuracy on Polyvore Outfits-D and 67.21% on Polyvore Outfits datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Fashion Large Language Model (FLLM), a novel approach to fashion recommendation that addresses limitations of traditional supervised learning methods in handling distribution shifts and style replication discrepancies. The FLLM leverages auto-prompt generation training strategies and retrieval-augmented generation during inference to enhance personalized fashion advice while retaining domain knowledge. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, showing approximately 10% accuracy improvement at lower data ratios.

## Method Summary
The authors propose the Fashion Large Language Model (FLLM) that employs auto-prompt generation training strategies to enhance its ability to handle distribution shifts and style replication discrepancies. The model integrates retrieval-augmented generation during inference to improve personalized fashion recommendations while maintaining domain knowledge. The approach combines the strengths of LLMs with fashion-specific knowledge to overcome the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods in the fashion recommendation domain.

## Key Results
- FLLM achieves 62.17% accuracy on Polyvore Outfits-D dataset and 67.21% on Polyvore Outfits dataset
- Demonstrates impressive few-shot learning capabilities, outperforming baseline methods by approximately 10% in accuracy improvement at lower data ratios
- Shows superior performance compared to existing models in handling distribution shifts and style replication discrepancies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The FLLM works by leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs while incorporating fashion-specific domain knowledge through auto-prompt generation and retrieval-augmented generation. This hybrid approach allows the model to better understand and replicate fashion styles while handling distribution shifts that commonly affect traditional recommendation systems. The auto-prompt generation strategy helps the model adapt to new fashion contexts, while retrieval-augmented generation ensures that recommendations are grounded in relevant fashion knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Fashion Recommendation Systems: Understanding how LLMs can be adapted for fashion-specific recommendations
  - Why needed: Traditional recommendation systems struggle with fashion's subjective and evolving nature
  - Quick check: Compare FLLM recommendations against human stylist judgments

- Auto-Prompt Generation: Techniques for dynamically creating prompts that guide LLM behavior
  - Why needed: Static prompts limit model adaptability to new fashion trends
  - Quick check: Measure performance with different prompt generation strategies

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Methods for incorporating external knowledge during inference
  - Why needed: Fashion recommendations require current and diverse style information
  - Quick check: Evaluate retrieval quality and its impact on recommendation accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Fashion Data -> Auto-Prompt Generator -> FLLM Core -> Retrieval Module -> Fashion Recommendations

**Critical Path:**
Auto-prompt generation → FLLM processing → Retrieval augmentation → Final recommendation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- LLM size vs. inference speed for real-time recommendations
- Retrieval frequency vs. computational cost
- Prompt complexity vs. generalization across fashion styles

**Failure Signatures:**
- Generic recommendations when retrieval fails
- Style inconsistencies across similar items
- Performance degradation with extreme distribution shifts

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate FLLM performance across different fashion categories (casual, formal, etc.)
2. Test few-shot learning capabilities with varying data ratios
3. Compare auto-prompt generation vs. manual prompt engineering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several future directions, including the integration of multimodal information and a hybrid approach combining LLM and conventional recommendation models to further improve the system's ability to process and integrate multimodal data, enhancing the accuracy and personalization of fashion recommendations.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluated primarily on synthetic Polyvore datasets that may not capture real-world complexity
- Auto-prompt generation and retrieval-augmented generation components lack detailed ablation studies
- Integration of multimodal information remains conceptual rather than implemented

## Confidence
**Core Claims Assessment:**
- FLLM outperforms traditional supervised learning methods: Medium confidence
- FLLM demonstrates superior few-shot learning capabilities: Medium-High confidence
- Proposed hybrid approach combining FLLM with conventional models: Low confidence (conceptual only)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world user studies with diverse participant pools to validate FLLM recommendations against human stylist judgments across different fashion contexts and cultural backgrounds.

2. Implement and evaluate the proposed hybrid approach combining FLLM with conventional recommendation models using multimodal data (images, text descriptions, user behavior) on a held-out test set not seen during training.

3. Perform extensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of auto-prompt generation and retrieval-augmented generation components to overall system performance.
