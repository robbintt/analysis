# Multimodal Fact-Checking: An Agent-based Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22933
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces RW-Post dataset and AgentFact framework for multimodal fact-checking, showing significant improvements over existing methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automated multimodal fact-checking by introducing a new dataset (RW-Post) and a specialized framework (AgentFact). RW-Post is the first high-quality, real-world dataset that pairs multimodal claims with their original social media posts, structured reasoning, and evidence-grounded explanations. AgentFact is a five-agent framework that decomposes fact-checking into specialized subtasks: strategy planning, evidence retrieval and validation, image analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. The agents operate iteratively, alternating between evidence searching and reasoning, emulating human verification workflows. Experimental results show that AgentFact significantly outperforms existing methods on both classification and explanation tasks, demonstrating superior accuracy and interpretability in multimodal fact-checking.

## Method Summary
The approach combines a novel dataset with a multi-agent architecture. The RW-Post dataset consists of 3,023 multimodal claims extracted from social media posts, each annotated with evidence, reasoning chains, and explanations. The AgentFact framework employs five specialized agents working iteratively: Strategy Agent plans verification approaches, Evidence Agent retrieves and validates information sources, Image Agent analyzes visual content, Reasoning Agent performs logical inference, and Explanation Agent generates interpretable justifications. The iterative process alternates between evidence retrieval and reasoning until a final verdict is reached, mimicking human fact-checking workflows.

## Key Results
- AgentFact achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal fact-checking with significant improvements in classification accuracy
- The framework demonstrates superior explanation quality compared to baseline methods, providing more structured and evidence-grounded reasoning
- RW-Post dataset enables more realistic evaluation of multimodal fact-checking systems compared to existing datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of this approach stems from decomposing the complex fact-checking task into specialized subtasks handled by dedicated agents. This modular design allows each agent to focus on its specific expertise while maintaining coordination through iterative feedback loops. The strategy agent guides the overall verification process, ensuring systematic evidence collection and reasoning. By alternating between evidence retrieval and analysis, the system can progressively build a comprehensive understanding of the claim, similar to how human fact-checkers operate. The emphasis on generating explanations alongside classifications improves transparency and trust in the system's decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal claim processing: Understanding how text and image components interact in misinformation requires handling heterogeneous data types simultaneously (needed to process real-world claims; quick check: can the system extract and align information from both modalities)
- Iterative verification workflows: The alternating evidence search and reasoning pattern mirrors human verification strategies (needed to avoid premature conclusions; quick check: does the system refine its approach based on new evidence)
- Evidence-grounded explanations: Generating explanations that reference specific evidence sources improves interpretability and trust (needed for practical deployment; quick check: can explanations be traced back to source evidence)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Strategy Agent -> Evidence Agent <-> Reasoning Agent <- Image Agent <- Explanation Agent

Critical Path: Claim Input -> Strategy Agent -> Evidence Retrieval -> Image Analysis -> Reasoning -> Explanation Generation

Design Tradeoffs: The multi-agent approach provides specialization and modularity but introduces coordination overhead and complexity. Simpler baselines may be faster but lack the nuanced reasoning capabilities. The iterative design improves accuracy but increases computational cost.

Failure Signatures: AgentFact may struggle when evidence sources are incomplete or contradictory, when image analysis fails to extract relevant features, or when reasoning chains become circular. Performance may degrade on claims requiring domain expertise beyond the system's training.

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing each agent individually to quantify individual contributions
2. Out-of-distribution testing with claims from different domains or misinformation types
3. Robustness testing with incomplete, noisy, or adversarial evidence sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset creation relies on human annotators for claim extraction, introducing potential subjectivity and bias
- Five-agent architecture introduces significant complexity and computational overhead compared to simpler baselines
- Iterative evidence-retrieval loop assumes access to comprehensive and reliable information sources, which may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification accuracy and explanation quality, with limited analysis of robustness to adversarial misinformation tactics

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Dataset construction methodology and baseline comparisons are methodologically sound and reproducible
- Medium Confidence: AgentFact framework design and its superiority over existing methods are well-supported by experiments, but generalizability to broader contexts remains uncertain
- Medium Confidence: Explanation quality improvements are demonstrated, but subjective evaluation criteria may introduce variability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each agent to overall performance and identify potential redundancy
2. Test the framework's performance on out-of-distribution claims and diverse misinformation types to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate the framework's robustness when evidence sources are incomplete, noisy, or deliberately misleading
