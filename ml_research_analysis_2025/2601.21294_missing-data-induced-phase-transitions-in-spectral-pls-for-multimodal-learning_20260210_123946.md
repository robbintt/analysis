# Missing-Data-Induced Phase Transitions in Spectral PLS for Multimodal Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21294
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21294
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Under MCAR dual missingness, PLS-SVD recovery exhibits a sharp phase transition shifted by 1/√ρ, where ρ is joint retention probability.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes when spectral Partial Least Squares (PLS-SVD) can recover shared structure from multimodal data when both views have missing entries. Under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) masking, the authors show that dual missingness attenuates the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of √ρ, where ρ is the joint retention probability. This shifts the recovery threshold to θcrit = 1/[(αxαy)^1/4√ρ], creating a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below this threshold, the leading singular vectors are uninformative, while above it they achieve closed-form asymptotic overlaps with the latent shared directions. The theory is validated through extensive simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using biological datasets (TCGA BRCA and PBMC Multiome), showing that the phase transition occurs regardless of whether signal directions are random or biologically structured. The authors also demonstrate that split-half stability provides a practical diagnostic for assessing recovery without access to ground-truth signal directions.

## Method Summary
The method generates synthetic two-view data with planted shared structure, applies independent MCAR masks to both views, computes the rescaled cross-covariance matrix, and extracts leading singular vectors via SVD. The theoretical analysis uses replica method to characterize asymptotic overlaps and establish a sharp phase transition threshold that depends on aspect ratios and joint retention probability. The practical diagnostic (split-half stability) randomly partitions data into halves and measures correlation stability across partitions to infer whether the system operates above or below the recovery threshold without requiring ground-truth signal directions.

## Key Results
- Dual-view MCAR masking attenuates effective signal strength by √ρ, creating a shifted recovery threshold θcrit = 1/[(αxαy)^1/4√ρ]
- Sharp BBP-type phase transition: below θcrit singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative; above it they achieve closed-form overlaps
- Split-half stability provides ground-truth-free diagnostic that distinguishes three recovery regimes and correlates strongly with true recovery quality (r > 0.99)
- Simple imputation with √ρ normalization achieves theoretical limit under MCAR; more sophisticated methods provide no accuracy gain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dual-view MCAR masking attenuates effective signal strength by √ρ, where ρ is the joint retention probability.
- Mechanism: Entry-wise missingness in both views multiplies the cross-covariance signal term by ρ = (1−mx)(1−my) in expectation. With proper normalization by √ρ, the masked cross-covariance reduces to a spiked rectangular model with effective spike θeff = √ρ θ. The noise floor remains O(1/√N), so the signal-to-noise ratio drops multiplicatively rather than through effective sample-size reduction.
- Core assumption: Independent MCAR masks Sx, Sy with i.i.d. Bernoulli entries, independent of (X⋆, Y⋆, Z); proportional high-dimensional limit with fixed aspect ratios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "effective signal strength is attenuated by √ρ, where ρ is the joint entry retention probability"
  - [Section 3.2, Lemma 3.1] "E[C] = √ρ θ u₀v₀^T" with noise variance O(1/N)
  - [corpus] Ipsen & Hansen (2019) show analogous √ρ attenuation for PCA with missing data, supporting the generalization to two-view settings.
- Break condition: If missingness depends on signal values (MAR/MNAR), the √ρ factor underestimates true attenuation; Appendix B.2 shows signal-dependent MAR causes up to 0.5 deviation in recovery.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Recovery is possible iff θ > θcrit = 1/[(αxαy)^1/4 √ρ]; below this, singular vectors are asymptotically orthogonal to planted directions.
- Mechanism: The spiked rectangular random matrix exhibits a Baik–Ben Arous–Péché (BBP) transition. When αxαyρ²θ⁴ ≤ 1, the signal spike lies within the bulk spectrum; the leading singular vectors are noise-dominated. When αxαyρ²θ⁴ > 1, the top singular value separates from the bulk, and overlaps converge to closed-form expressions (Eq. 8–9). Joint missingness shifts the boundary by 1/√ρ compared to fully observed case.
- Core assumption: Replica-symmetric (RS) ansatz for free energy evaluation; Gaussian noise structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative"
  - [Section 3.3, Theorem 3.2] Explicit formulas with threshold condition αxαyρ²θ⁴ > 1
  - [corpus] Benaych-Georges & Nadakuditi (2012) established the rectangular spiked model behavior that this work builds upon.
- Break condition: Finite samples show smoothed transitions; N=100 has gradual curves, N=5000 approaches step function (Figure 1c).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Split-half stability provides a ground-truth-free diagnostic that tracks true recovery quality across the phase boundary.
- Mechanism: Randomly partitioning data into halves reduces aspect ratios by 2×, shifting the effective threshold to √2·θcrit. This creates three regimes: (1) θ < θcrit → no recovery in full or split data; (2) θcrit < θ < √2θcrit → full data recovers, but halves are unreliable; (3) θ > √2θcrit → stable recovery across splits. Stability correlates with true R² (r > 0.99).
- Core assumption: Self-averaging of free energy; RS solution correctly captures typical behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.4] "Split-half stability... provides a computable diagnostic that distinguishes three recovery regimes"
  - [Figure 4] Shows stability gradient tracking R²x across transition; identifies √2θcrit boundary
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for split-half diagnostics in PLS; this appears to be a novel practical contribution.
- Break condition: Stability measures correlation, not magnitude; requires averaging over multiple random splits for reliable inference.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Spiked Random Matrix Models & BBP Transition**
  - Why needed here: The entire theoretical framework relies on understanding when a low-rank perturbation emerges from the bulk spectrum. Without this, the threshold formula and overlap expressions are opaque.
  - Quick check question: If you observe a sample covariance matrix with leading eigenvalue 2.1 and bulk edge at 2.0, can you conclude a signal component exists? (Answer: In the Marcenko-Pastur limit, yes—but only above the BBP threshold, which depends on aspect ratio.)

- Concept: **Cross-Covariance Structure in Two-View Learning**
  - Why needed here: PLS-SVD operates on X^TY, not X^TX or Y^TY. Understanding how shared structure appears in cross-covariance is essential for interpreting the attenuation mechanism.
  - Quick check question: Why does PLS maximize covariance while CCA maximizes correlation, and how does this affect robustness to missing data? (Answer: PLS doesn't require inverting within-view covariances, making it more stable when features exceed samples.)

- Concept: **Replica Method for High-Dimensional Inference**
  - Why needed here: The derivation uses replica trick and RS ansatz to compute the quenched free energy. Understanding this machinery helps evaluate the theoretical claims' rigor.
  - Quick check question: What does "replica-symmetric" mean, and when might it fail? (Answer: RS assumes all replica indices are equivalent; fails when replica symmetry breaking occurs, e.g., in spin glasses with multiple metastable states.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: X* (whitened design) -> Y* = θ(X*u₀)v₀^T + Z -> S_x, S_y (MCAR masks) -> X = S_x ⊙ X*, Y = S_y ⊙ Y* -> C = (N√ρ)^(-1) X^T Y -> SVD -> (û, v̂) -> R²x, R²y (overlaps)

- Critical path:
  1. Verify MCAR assumption (or quantify MAR deviation per Appendix B.2)
  2. Compute aspect ratios αx = N/Dx, αy = N/Dy and joint retention ρ = (1−mx)(1−my)
  3. Estimate θcrit = 1/[(αxαy)^1/4 √ρ]
  4. Run split-half stability analysis to infer operating regime
  5. If θ > √2θcrit, expect stable recovery; if θcrit < θ < √2θcrit, expect unstable but nonzero recovery

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Imputation vs. missing-as-zero**: Appendix B.3 shows EM-PLS and iterative SVD imputation offer no accuracy gain over simple normalization (≈12ms vs. ≈65ms runtime) under MCAR
  - **Single-view vs. joint missingness**: Joint missingness (ρ = (1−m)²) requires √(1−m)× stronger signal than single-view (ρ = 1−m) for equivalent recovery (Figure 2)
  - **Sample size vs. dimension**: For fixed aspect ratio, larger N sharpens transition but doesn't shift threshold

- Failure signatures:
  - **Subcritical regime**: R²x ≈ 0 despite large sample size; split-half correlations near zero
  - **Heavy-tailed noise**: Student-t(ν=3) reduces supercritical recovery by ~10–15% (Figure 5c)
  - **Signal-dependent MAR**: Phase boundary shifts unpredictably; MCAR theory overestimates recovery (Figure 6c)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Threshold calibration**: Simulate with known θ, vary θ/θcrit from 0.5 to 2.5; verify transition sharpens with N and matches Eq. 8–9 (replicate Figure 1a)
  2. **Missingness sweep**: Fix θ = 1.5θcrit, vary m from 0 to 0.5 in both views; confirm R²x degradation follows theoretical curve (replicate Figure 3b,e)
  3. **Diagnostic validation**: Run split-half stability on synthetic data across θ range; verify stability tracks R²x and identifies θcrit and √2θcrit boundaries (replicate Figure 4)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does a sharp phase transition exist for PLS-SVD under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) mechanisms, and how does the threshold formula change when missingness depends on latent variables?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states the results "motivat[e] extensions to non-MCAR mechanisms."
- Why unresolved: The paper analyzes MCAR and provides only preliminary MAR robustness experiments (Appendix B.2); MNAR creates coupling between the mask and signal that breaks the effective spike reduction argument.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical characterization of the phase boundary under specific MNAR models (e.g., Tobit-type censoring), validated by simulations showing whether a sharp threshold persists and how it deviates from θcrit = 1/[(αxαy)^1/4√ρ].

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the phase transition generalize to multi-rank (K > 1) spiked models with multiple shared directions under dual missingness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly calls for extensions to "multiple factors."
- Why unresolved: The entire analysis (Lemma 3.1, Theorem 3.2, replica derivation) assumes a rank-1 spike θu₀v₀⊤; extending to rank-K requires analyzing interacting singular vectors and potentially replica symmetry breaking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of asymptotic overlap formulas for K > 1 latent directions, showing whether each component has its own threshold or whether cross-component interference shifts the boundaries.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the replica-symmetric predictions be rigorously proved using standard random matrix theory without invoking the replica method?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix A acknowledges: "RS arguments are not universally rigorous" and that Theorem 3.2 "should be read as a precise, testable characterization with strong empirical support."
- Why unresolved: The proof relies on non-rigorous physics-style replica calculations; while empirically validated, a mathematically rigorous proof would establish universal validity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof using moment method, Stieltjes transforms, or free probability that recovers the same threshold and overlap formulas without replica assumptions.

## Limitations

- The √ρ attenuation formula breaks under signal-dependent missingness, with MAR masks causing up to 0.5 deviation in recovery thresholds
- Heavy-tailed noise (Student-t) degrades supercritical recovery by 10-15%, indicating sensitivity to noise assumptions
- The split-half diagnostic provides correlation but not magnitude estimates, requiring multiple random splits for reliable inference

## Confidence

- √ρ attenuation mechanism: **High** - direct correspondence with cross-covariance expectation and supporting PCA evidence
- BBP transition characterization: **Medium-High** - rigorous replica derivation but finite-sample smoothing effects
- Practical diagnostic claims: **Medium** - strong simulation correlation but lacks direct corpus validation

## Next Checks

1. **Finite-sample calibration**: Measure overlap transitions across N ∈ {100, 500, 2000, 5000} with fixed θ/θcrit ratios to quantify smoothing effects and verify approach to theoretical step function

2. **MAR robustness test**: Generate signal-dependent missingness (e.g., S_x[i,j] ~ Bernoulli(1-m_x exp(|X*ᵢⱼ|²/2))) and measure deviation of recovery from MCAR predictions across varying signal strengths

3. **Cross-modal stability**: Apply split-half stability to real biological datasets with known ground truth (e.g., synthetic integration of controlled shared signals) to verify diagnostic accuracy outside simulation
