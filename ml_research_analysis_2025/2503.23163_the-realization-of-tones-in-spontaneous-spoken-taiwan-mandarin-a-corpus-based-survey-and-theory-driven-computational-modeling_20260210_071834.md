# The realization of tones in spontaneous spoken Taiwan Mandarin: a corpus-based survey and theory-driven computational modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.23163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23163
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Word identity and sense type are stronger predictors of pitch contours than canonical tone patterns in spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin speech.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the realization of Mandarin tones in spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin speech, focusing on disyllabic words with all 20 possible tone combinations. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMs) to analyze pitch contours from a corpus of spontaneous speech, the research examines how various predictors including word identity, sense type, and tone pattern influence f0 realization. The study employs the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) to predict pitch contours from contextualized embeddings derived from GPT-2, demonstrating that word meanings co-determine fine phonetic details of tone realization beyond canonical tone patterns. The findings challenge traditional linguistic axioms about the arbitrariness of the sign and support a model where form and meaning are deeply entangled in speech production.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed pitch contours from the Taiwan Mandarin Spontaneous Conversation Corpus using GAMs to examine the effects of predictors including gender, tonal context, tone pattern, speech rate, word position, bigram probability, speaker, and word. The Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) was employed to predict pitch contours from contextualized embeddings derived from GPT-2, representing token-specific meanings. Pitch contours were extracted from audio using Praat, normalized to a 0-1 time scale, and converted to fixed 100-dimensional vectors using GAM predictions. Linear mapping was used to transform semantic matrices (768-dimensional embeddings) into form matrices (100-dimensional pitch vectors), with accuracy evaluated using nearest-neighbor classification against chance baselines.

## Key Results
- Word identity and sense type emerged as crucial predictors of f0 contours, with effect sizes exceeding those of tone pattern
- Computational modeling using contextualized embeddings successfully predicted token-specific pitch contours with accuracy significantly above chance level (15.1% training, 7.7% testing vs. 0.4-1.3% baselines)
- The canonical "tone pattern" appears to be an emergent property of the semantic space rather than a primary generative rule

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Word identity and sense type are stronger predictors of pitch contours (f0) than canonical tone patterns in spontaneous speech.
- **Mechanism:** The production system retrieves word-specific or sense-specific motor programs rather than assembling syllables from abstract tone rules. This suggests a "word-and-paradigm" approach where the lexicon stores fine phonetic details correlated with meaning.
- **Core assumption:** Spontaneous speech captures underlying production processes better than laboratory speech; observed variance is structured by semantics, not just noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...word and sense emerged as crucial predictors of f0 contours, with effect sizes that exceed those of tone pattern."
  - [section 3.4] "The increase in AIC when word is omitted... substantially exceeds the corresponding change observed for any other predictor."
  - [corpus] Supported by neighbor "A new kid on the block" (Jin et al., 2024), which finds similar effects for monosyllabic words.
- **Break condition:** If withholding `tone pattern` from the model caused a larger AIC increase than withholding `word` or `sense type`.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Context-specific meaning (semantics) can be linearly mapped to context-specific phonetic realization (pitch contours).
- **Mechanism:** Within the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) framework, a function transforms a high-dimensional semantic vector (contextualized embedding) into a form vector (pitch contour). The system learns a direct association $S \rightarrow C$ rather than deriving form from abstract phonological rules.
- **Core assumption:** GPT-2 contextualized embeddings serve as valid proxies for the speakers' internal semantic states during production.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.4] "Method II... mean accuracy... was 23.5% on the training dataset and 15.1% on the testing dataset... All accuracies were above a permutation baseline of 0.4%."
  - [section 4] "We show that the pitch contours of word tokens can be predicted to a considerable extent from these contextualized embeddings."
  - [corpus] Not explicitly supported or challenged by the provided neighbor summaries.
- **Break condition:** If the linear mapping from embeddings to pitch vectors failed to exceed the majority baseline (1.3%) on held-out test data.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The canonical "tone pattern" is an emergent property of the semantic space, not a primary generative rule.
- **Mechanism:** Words cluster in semantic space (embeddings). The "average" pitch contour for a tone pattern emerges because words with similar semantic functions (often function words) share similar pitch targets, rather than the pitch target being imposed by an abstract tone category.
- **Core assumption:** The centroids of semantic embeddings for a specific tone pattern are distinct enough to map to distinct pitch contours.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.4] "Figure 9 shows that this prediction is on the right track... The pitch contours... shown in black [GAM estimates]... are similar... to the contours predicted by the three DLM mappings."
  - [section 4.4] "The 20 canonical tone patterns are surprisingly well approximated by projecting the centroids of the contextualized embeddings... into the f0 space."
  - [corpus] No direct external validation in neighbor summaries.
- **Break condition:** If the centroids of embeddings for different tone patterns (e.g., T1-T1 vs T2-T4) mapped to identical or random pitch contours.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMs)
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for modeling non-linear time-series data (pitch contours over time) while handling random effects (speakers) and autocorrelation. Standard linear models cannot capture the shape of a pitch trajectory.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a tensor product smooth (`ti()`) is used to model the interaction between `normalized t` and `speech rate`?

- **Concept:** Contextualized Embeddings (GPT-2)
  - **Why needed here:** Serves as the numerical representation of "meaning in context." Without this, the computational mapping from semantics-to-form cannot be tested.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a "contextualized" embedding differ from a static embedding (like Word2Vec) when processing a polysemous word like "bank"?

- **Concept:** Taiwan Mandarin Tone Sandhi
  - **Why needed here:** Provides the phonological baseline (e.g., T3-T3 -> T2-T3) that the study challenges or reframes. Understanding the canonical rules is necessary to see how the paper argues they are "overshadowed" by word-specific effects.
  - **Quick check question:** In this study, does the T3-T3 tone sandhi act as a distinct phonological rule or an emergent property of the lexicon?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Data Ingestion: Corpus of Spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin -> `.TextGrid` & `.wav`
  2. Preprocessing: `Praat` script for f0 extraction -> Log transformation -> Normalization (0 to 1 time scale)
  3. Semantic Encoder: GPT-2 (CKIP version) -> 768-dim vector per token
  4. Analysis Engine: `mgcv` (R package) -> GAMs (Factor smooths for Word/Sense)
  5. Prediction Engine: Linear Algebra Solver -> Map Matrix $S$ (Semantics) to Matrix $C$ (Pitch)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Alignment: Ensuring the GPT-2 embedding context window aligns perfectly with the specific token time-stamp in the corpus
  2. Dimensionality Matching: Normalizing variable-length f0 trajectories into fixed 100-dim vectors (via GAM smoothing) to allow matrix multiplication with embeddings

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Method II vs. Method III: Method II (abstracting away from context) yields higher prediction accuracy (15.1%) than Method III (token-specific, 7.7%). This suggests that while context matters, the "noise" in specific token production or the limitation of GPT-2 embeddings to capture exact intent reduces precision
  - AIC vs. $R^2$: The study relies heavily on AIC changes to rank variable importance, which measures relative model quality rather than absolute variance explained

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Concurvity: If `tone pattern` and `word` are not handled carefully (e.g., nesting), statistical models will fail to distinguish their effects (Section 3.4 notes concurvity of 1.0 when both are included improperly)
  - Pitch Extraction Errors: Spontaneous speech contains creaky voice and pauses; failure to filter outliers (standard deviation > 9th decile) introduces noise into the pitch vectors

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run the GAM on a single tone context (e.g., 4.4) and verify that removing `word` spikes the AIC by >7000 units (replicating Figure 2)
  2. Embedding Sanity Check: Visualize the GPT-2 embeddings using t-SNE (replicate Figure 8) to confirm that words like "school" and "student" cluster semantically before attempting to map them to pitch
  3. Linear Mapping Test: Split data 80/20. Train the linear mapping $SG=C$. Check if test accuracy is >1.3% (majority baseline) and >0.4% (permutation baseline)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do human speakers learn and utilize a linear mapping from semantics to pitch contours similar to the model demonstrated in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "It remains an open question whether human learners also generate pitch contours from semantics," while noting that the success of a simple linear mapping suggests human learning is plausible.
- Why unresolved: The study proves that a machine learning model can learn this mapping from corpus data, but this does not confirm that the human cognitive system employs the same mechanism or linearity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Behavioral experiments with human participants (e.g., learning artificial lexicons) that test if semantic manipulations produce predictable linear changes in pitch realization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should the phonetic realization of the neutral tone (T0) be interpreted within the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that neutral tone patterns often show descending contours and state, "A question for further research is how to interpret the present findings for tone patterns with the neutral tone."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the behavior of the neutral tone is best explained by the DLM's semantic mapping or by standard phonological rules (tone sandhi), as the current study leaves the specific semantic drivers for these patterns undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: A targeted analysis of the semantic vectors associated with neutral-tone words to determine if their geometric properties inherently predict the specific linearly descending pitch contours observed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why did abstracting away from token-specific context (Method II) result in better pitch prediction than using context-sensitive embeddings (Method III)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors report that Method II (word-type-specific vectors) outperformed Method III (token-specific vectors), which was surprising given the hypothesis that token-specific semantics determine phonetics. The authors speculate that the contextualized embeddings may lack precision.
- Why unresolved: There is a theoretical tension between the claim that token-specific meaning drives phonetics and the empirical result that token-averaged meaning predicts pitch better. It is unclear if this is a limitation of the GPT-2 embeddings or the theory.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the analysis using "ground-truth" human semantic annotations or more context-sensitive embeddings to see if token-specific prediction can surpass word-type prediction.

## Limitations
- The specific acoustic-phonetic features that correlate with semantic dimensions remain opaque in the linear mapping from embeddings to pitch vectors
- The study cannot establish causal relationships between semantic properties and pitch production due to the observational nature of corpus data
- All findings are based on one language variety (Taiwan Mandarin), limiting generalizability to other languages with different prosodic systems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The statistical finding that word identity and sense type are stronger predictors of f0 contours than tone pattern in this dataset
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that contextualized embeddings can predict token-specific pitch contours above chance level
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical interpretation that canonical tone patterns are "emergent" properties of semantic space rather than primary generative rules

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same GAM and DLM pipeline to spontaneous speech corpora from languages with different prosodic systems (e.g., stress-timed languages like English or quantity languages like Finnish) to test whether word-specific pitch effects are universal or tone-language specific
2. Design a production study where speakers read identical sentences with polysemous words in different contexts (e.g., "bank" as financial vs. river). Test whether the predicted pitch contours from contextualized embeddings align with actual f0 trajectories, establishing causal links between context-specific meaning and phonetic realization
3. Use techniques like SHAP values or integrated gradients to identify which dimensions of the GPT-2 embeddings most strongly influence predicted pitch contours, providing insight into the specific semantic features that correlate with tonal variation
