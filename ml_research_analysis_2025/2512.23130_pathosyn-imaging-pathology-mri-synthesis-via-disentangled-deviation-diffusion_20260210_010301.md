# PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.23130
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23130
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Disentangled additive deviation framework achieves Dice 0.845, AUROC 0.915 on BraTS 2020.

## Executive Summary
PathoSyn introduces a novel disentangled additive deviation framework for synthesizing realistic pathological MRI images by explicitly separating anatomical structure from disease-related variation. The model localizes generative uncertainty to the lesion space while preserving subject-specific anatomy, enabling controlled synthesis of internal lesion heterogeneity with coherent boundaries. Evaluated on BraTS 2020 brain tumor data, the approach significantly outperforms holistic and mask-conditioned baselines in perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity, achieving strong downstream task performance for segmentation and classification.

## Method Summary
The framework generates pathology by adding a learned deviation field to a stable anatomical substrate rather than generating the entire image. A two-stage architecture first estimates the anatomical substrate using a U-Net conditioned on masked input, then learns to denoise deviation fields through a diffusion model with strict spatial support constraints. The deviation is only applied within the lesion mask, ensuring anatomical integrity outside pathological regions. Joint optimization balances anatomical fidelity, diffusion quality, deviation regularization, and seam-aware synthesis through multiple loss components.

## Key Results
- Achieves Dice score of 0.845 for tumor segmentation on BraTS 2020 test set
- Improves classification AUROC to 0.915 compared to baselines
- Reduces feature-space distance to real pathology distributions, indicating higher fidelity
- Shows significant improvements in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity over holistic generation approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by explicitly modeling the pathology as a deviation from healthy anatomy rather than attempting to generate the entire pathological image directly. This disentanglement allows the model to focus generative capacity on the disease-specific variations while preserving the complex anatomical details that would be difficult to generate from scratch. The additive formulation with spatial constraints ensures that the generated pathology integrates naturally with the underlying anatomy without introducing artifacts outside the lesion region.

## Foundational Learning
- **Disentangled additive deviation:** Separating anatomy from pathology as an additive field rather than generating complete images allows focused modeling of disease-specific features while preserving anatomical integrity. Quick check: Verify the deviation field is zero outside the lesion mask.
- **Spatial support constraint:** Enforcing the deviation to be zero outside the mask prevents anatomical leakage and ensures generation is localized to pathological regions. Quick check: Monitor deviation values outside mask during training.
- **Diffusion-based residual modeling:** Using diffusion to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals enables controlled synthesis of internal lesion heterogeneity. Quick check: Validate the diffusion model can reproduce realistic pathology variations within the same lesion mask.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Masked input -> Substrate U-Net -> Anatomical substrate -> Subtract from input -> Deviation field -> Diffusion U-Net -> Refined deviation -> Add to substrate -> Synthesized pathology

**Critical path:** Masked input → Substrate estimation → Deviation calculation → Diffusion denoising → Final synthesis

**Design tradeoffs:** The additive deviation approach trades the simplicity of holistic generation for better anatomical preservation and interpretability. While more complex than direct image synthesis, it enables disease progression modeling and provides more control over the generated pathology.

**Failure signatures:** 
- Anatomical leakage: Deviation field shows non-zero values outside the mask
- Boundary artifacts: Visible seams between generated pathology and background
- Intensity inconsistencies: Generated pathology doesn't match surrounding tissue appearance

**3 first experiments:**
1. **Inpainting ablation study:** Compare performance using different inpainting methods for substrate estimation to understand sensitivity to initial anatomy approximation
2. **Boundary artifact analysis:** Systematically vary soft blend map and boundary weights to optimize seam suppression
3. **Loss weight sensitivity:** Grid search over diffusion, deviation, and synthesis loss weights to maximize downstream task performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the framework be extended to jointly model appearance alterations and geometric deformations like mass effect?
- Is the disentangled deviation representation robust to domain shifts from varying scanner protocols?
- To what extent do errors in counterfactual healthy substrate estimation propagate into synthesized deviation?

## Limitations
- Current formulation cannot simulate large-scale structural deformations like mass effect
- Performance may degrade when applied to data from different scanners or acquisition protocols
- Quality depends heavily on the accuracy of the inpainting operator used for substrate estimation

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in theoretical validity of disentangled additive framework
- **Medium confidence** in reproducibility given missing implementation details
- **Low confidence** in exact quantitative replication without clarification on key hyperparameters

## Next Checks
1. **Inpainting ablation study:** Compare different inpainting methods to quantify sensitivity to substrate estimation
2. **Boundary artifact analysis:** Systematically vary blend map and boundary weights to identify optimal settings
3. **Loss weight sensitivity:** Grid search over loss balancing parameters to determine impact on segmentation and classification performance
