- Primary result: ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) outperformed traditional classifiers and other LLMs for multi-label movie genre prediction, with fine-tuning yielding 26.5% F1-score improvement at 6× cost

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models for multi-label movie genre prediction using MovieLens-100K dataset augmented with trailer subtitles and poster images. ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) achieved the highest macro F1-score of 0.64 in zero-shot settings, surpassing traditional classifiers and other LLMs. Fine-tuning significantly improved performance but increased costs sixfold. Two-shot prompting proved optimal, while VLM integration with poster information provided mixed results—improving recall for visually distinctive genres while reducing precision overall.

## Method Summary
The study used MovieLens-100K dataset (1,682 movies, 18 genres) augmented with YouTube trailer subtitles and IMDb posters. Traditional classifiers (KNN, logistic regression, SVM) served as baselines using SBERT embeddings. LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo, text-davinci-002/003) were evaluated in zero-shot, few-shot (2-5 examples), and fine-tuned settings using conversational instruction format. VLM integration used LLaVA-7B to extract poster features. Models were evaluated using multi-label precision, recall, and F1-score metrics with 80:20 train-test split.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo achieved macro F1-score of 0.64, exceeding traditional classifiers
- Fine-tuning gpt-3.5-turbo improved F1-score by 26.5% across most genres (Crime: +132%, Fantasy: +126%) but increased costs sixfold
- Two-shot prompting outperformed both zero-shot and five-shot settings due to noise reduction
- VLM integration improved recall by 7% but reduced precision by 3%, with best results for visually distinctive genres (Action, Horror, War)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot LLMs can outperform traditional classifiers on multi-label genre prediction when given trailer subtitles as input.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained language models encode semantic relationships between dialogue, themes, and genre conventions from their training corpus. When prompted with subtitles and a genre list, the model maps linguistic patterns to genre labels via in-context inference without gradient updates.
- Core assumption: Trailer subtitles contain sufficient genre-discriminative lexical and semantic signals that align with patterns the model encountered during pre-training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.C] "LLMs achieved stronger performance, with gpt-3.5-turbo reaching the best macro F1-score of 0.64, exceeding the traditional classifiers."
  - [section I] "ChatGPT(gpt-3.5-turbo) under zero-shot setting outperformed traditional classifiers."
- Break condition: If subtitles are absent, noisy, or genre-ambiguous, zero-shot performance may degrade toward random baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning ChatGPT on task-specific conversational instructions yields substantial F1 gains but at significantly higher cost.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning adjusts model weights on a supervised dataset using role-based conversation format (user message with subtitles → assistant message with genre labels). This specializes the model to the label space and annotator conventions of MovieLens.
- Core assumption: The training distribution is representative of test distribution, and label quality in the dataset is reliable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.D.2] "Fine-tuning ChatGPT involved the cost of training the input tokens... it involves an additional six times the cost... helped in improving the performance of genre prediction task significantly (26.5%)."
  - [Table I] Fine-tuned gpt-3.5-turbo shows F1 gains across most genres.
- Break condition: If training data has systematic label noise, fine-tuning may amplify dataset biases rather than improve genuine genre understanding.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: VLM+LLM integration improves recall for visually distinctive genres but reduces precision overall.
- Mechanism: A Vision Language Model (LLaVA-7B) extracts poster features (color palette, typography, actors, symbols). These textual descriptions are concatenated with subtitles in the LLM prompt. Genres with strong visual signatures benefit; others suffer from dilution or conflicting signals.
- Core assumption: Movie posters contain genre-diagnostic visual information that maps consistently to genre labels, and VLM descriptions are accurate and relevant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V] "The genres like action, war, crime, and horror often have intense colors and dynamic visuals, making them more recognizable."
  - [Table VI] Micro F1 improved only +1%, precision declined -3%, but recall improved +7% with VLM integration.
- Break condition: If posters are generic, misleading, or VLM extracts irrelevant details, added context introduces noise without signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-label classification (vs. single-label)
  - Why needed here: Each movie belongs to multiple genres simultaneously. Single-label approaches would misrepresent the task.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why accuracy is a poor metric for multi-label settings with imbalanced genre distributions?

- Concept: Zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The paper benchmarks both paradigms. Understanding the tradeoff (few-shot adds context but increases token cost and noise risk) is essential for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why did two-shot prompts outperform five-shot prompts in this study?

- Concept: Precision-recall tradeoff in VLM integration
  - Why needed here: Adding poster information improved recall but hurt precision. Deployers must decide whether catching more genres (recall) or avoiding false positives (precision) matters more for their use case.
  - Quick check question: In a recommendation system, would you prioritize higher recall or higher precision for genre tags? Why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Data Augmentation Layer: YouTube transcript API + Whisperer for subtitles; BeautifulSoup for IMDb poster scraping
  2. VLM Feature Extractor: LLaVA-7B processes posters → textual descriptions
  3. LLM Inference Engine: gpt-3.5-turbo (zero-shot/few-shot/fine-tuned) takes subtitle (+ optional poster info) → genre predictions
  4. Evaluation Layer: Multi-label metrics (micro/macro F1, precision, recall) against MovieLens ground truth

- Critical path:
  1. Verify subtitle extraction quality (manual spot-check 10-20 samples)
  2. Establish zero-shot baseline with gpt-3.5-turbo (temperature=0.1, max_tokens=270)
  3. Run two-shot prompt experiments before fine-tuning (cost-efficient first iteration)
  4. If F1 < target, proceed to fine-tuning with 80:20 split; budget 6× inference cost

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuned: 26.5% F1 gain but 6× cost increase
  - Two-shot vs. five-shot: More examples add noise; optimal at 2 shots
  - VLM integration: +7% recall, -3% precision; use only if recall is prioritized

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision despite high recall: Check ground-truth label quality (Section VI shows MovieLens has missing/inappropriate labels)
  - Fine-tuned model underperforms zero-shot: Likely insufficient training samples or overfitting to noisy labels
  - VLM integration hurts performance: Poster descriptions may be irrelevant; filter VLM output or skip for low-visual-signature genres

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo with subtitles only; log macro F1 per genre to identify weak classes
  2. Two-shot prompt with manually curated high-quality examples; compare against zero-shot
  3. VLM integration on a 50-movie subset; measure precision/recall shift per genre to decide full deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does fine-tuning the Vision Language Model (VLM) for specific visual features resolve the precision decline observed when integrating poster data with subtitles?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the conclusion that "further enhancements could be achieved by fine-tuning VLM to generate more relevant and task-specific information."
- Why unresolved: The zero-shot VLM (LLaVA) integration improved recall for visually distinct genres but reduced precision in others, suggesting the extracted visual features were sometimes irrelevant or noisy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation using a VLM fine-tuned specifically on movie posters versus the zero-shot LLaVA-7B used in the study.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does substituting traditional metadata with ChatGPT-predicted genres impact the performance metrics of downstream movie recommendation systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that the findings "pave the way for a deeper understanding of its implications in recommendation systems," acknowledging the close relationship between the two tasks.
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates genre classification in isolation and does not test the utility of these predictions within an actual recommendation pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Measuring hit-rate or NDCG changes in a recommendation engine when fed LLM-generated genres versus original ground-truth genres.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what degree are the reported "low precision" scores attributable to incomplete ground truth labels in the MovieLens-100K dataset rather than model error?
- Basis in paper: The case study (Section VI) reveals instances where the LLM predicted valid genres (e.g., "Adventure" for *Toy Story*) that were absent from the dataset's ground truth, resulting in penalized precision.
- Why unresolved: Quantitative metrics currently treat these correct predictions as false positives, potentially underestimating the model's actual semantic understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Human verification of a random sample of "false positive" predictions to distinguish between model hallucinations and dataset labeling gaps.

## Limitations
- The study relies on MovieLens-100K dataset with potential label quality issues, as acknowledged in the case study where ground-truth genres were found to be missing or inappropriate for some movies
- Fine-tuning improvements come at a sixfold cost increase, creating significant resource tradeoffs not fully explored across different budget constraints
- VLM integration shows mixed results with improved recall but reduced precision, suggesting the added visual information may introduce noise rather than consistent signal

## Confidence

- High confidence: Zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo outperforming traditional classifiers on macro F1-score (0.64 baseline established with clear comparison methodology)
- Medium confidence: Fine-tuning benefits and cost tradeoffs (strong F1 improvement but limited exploration of training dynamics and dataset quality impacts)
- Medium confidence: VLM integration effects (recall improvements documented but precision degradation and mixed genre-specific results suggest context-dependent utility)

## Next Checks

1. Validate genre predictions against IMDb as ground truth rather than relying solely on MovieLens labels, given the paper's own admission of missing/inappropriate labels in the dataset
2. Conduct cost-benefit analysis of fine-tuning across different budget constraints to determine optimal deployment strategy for production environments
3. Test two-shot prompting optimization across multiple multi-label classification tasks beyond movie genres to assess generalizability of this finding
