# Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.15291
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291
- **Reference count:** 2
- **Primary result:** Semantic and structural metrics are more reliable indicators of KG complexity than spectral measures like CSG for link prediction tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric for assessing knowledge graph (KG) complexity in link prediction. CSG, designed to measure class separability via spectral clustering, was found to be highly sensitive to its parameter K and failed to scale robustly with the number of relation classes. Contrary to expectations, CSG showed no meaningful correlation with standard link prediction metrics (MRR, Hit@1) across multiple datasets. Instead, semantic metrics like Relation Entropy and Node-level Maximum Relation Diversity exhibited strong inverse correlations with prediction performance, indicating higher complexity. Structural features such as Average Degree and Degree Entropy correlated positively with MRR, while centrality measures aligned with Hit@10 performance. The results suggest that semantic and structural metrics provide more reliable, interpretable indicators of KG complexity than spectral measures.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates dataset complexity by computing three categories of metrics: spectral (CSG), semantic (Relation Entropy, Relation Type Cardinality, Node-level Max Relation Diversity), and structural (Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, Eigenvector Centrality). CSG is computed by grouping triples by tail entity, sampling 120 vectors per class, building a k-NN graph (k=50), constructing the normalized Laplacian, and summing eigenvalue gaps. Semantic and structural metrics are computed using standard graph algorithms. The correlations between these metrics and link prediction performance (MRR, Hits@1, Hits@10) are analyzed across five benchmark datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, CoDEx-L/M/S) using BERT-base embeddings for head-relation pairs.

## Key Results
- CSG is highly sensitive to its parameter K and shows weak or inconsistent correlation with link prediction performance metrics.
- Semantic metrics (Relation Entropy, Node-level Max Relation Diversity) exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, indicating they represent challenging aspects of KGs.
- Structural metrics (Average Degree, Degree Entropy, centrality measures) correlate positively with Hit@10, suggesting they aid recall in link prediction.
- The study identifies semantic ambiguity and structural connectivity as key factors affecting link prediction performance, rather than spectral class separability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Semantic ambiguity, quantified via relation entropy and diversity, degrades top-rank precision (MRR, Hits@1) in link prediction.
- **Mechanism:** High entropy in relation distribution and high node-level relation diversity fragment the embedding space. This forces the model to spread probability mass across ambiguous candidates, reducing confidence in the single correct answer.
- **Core assumption:** Models struggle to discriminate between valid tail entities when the relational context is highly variable or unpredictable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Semantic ambiguity tends to reduce top-rank accuracy... global and local relational ambiguity... exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1."
  - [section 7] "Higher values of semantic features... inversely correlate with improved Mean MRR... indicating they represent challenging aspects."
  - [corpus] "SLiNT" abstract notes that "limited exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity," corroborating the difficulty ambiguity introduces.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset has very low relation cardinality or if the model employs explicit disambiguation layers (e.g., attention over relation types), this inverse correlation may weaken.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Structural connectivity (density and centrality) aids recall (Hits@10) by providing redundant multi-hop inference cues.
- **Mechanism:** Densely connected graphs (high average degree) allow models to leverage neighborhood redundancy. High centrality ensures correct candidates are visible globally, making them easier to surface in a larger candidate set (top-10), even if semantic ambiguity hurts top-1 placement.
- **Core assumption:** Graph topology provides a reliable prior for entity prominence independent of fine-grained semantic signals.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Structural connectivity aids both precision and recall... graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree... correlate positively with Hit@10."
  - [section 7] "Nodes with greater centrality... provide richer structural patterns... well-connected, influential nodes... make top-10 predictions more accurate."
  - [corpus] "CGLE" abstract suggests "semantic information aggregated at the class level" is often neglected; this mechanism suggests structure compensates where semantics fail.
- **Break condition:** If the graph is extremely sparse or possesses long-tail degree distributions where connectivity cues are missing for the tail entities.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Spectral metrics (specifically CSG) fail to measure complexity in multi-relational KGs because they are unstable under hyperparameter variation.
- **Mechanism:** The Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) relies on eigenvalue gaps of a k-NN graph derived from embeddings. In KGs, CSG scales linearly or erratically with the neighbor parameter $K$ rather than dataset difficulty, failing to capture the "class overlap" concept it was designed for.
- **Core assumption:** A valid complexity metric should be robust to minor parameter changes and correlate with task difficulty.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "CSG is highly sensitive to its parameters and does not correlate well with performance metrics like MRR."
  - [section 5] "CSG varies dramatically with K... exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation... near-zero Pearson correlation."
  - [corpus] "Evaluating Cumulative Spectral Gradient as a Complexity Measure" (neighbor title) suggests this metric is an active area of debate; this paper provides evidence against its generalization to KGs.
- **Break condition:** If a different spectral formulation is used that does not rely on k-NN graph construction over dense embeddings, stability might be recovered.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spectral Graph Theory (Laplacian & Eigenvalues)**
  - **Why needed here:** Required to understand how CSG attempts to measure "class separability" using the eigenvalue spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian, and why it fails in this context.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a small eigenvalue gap (low spectral gradient) imply that classes are hard to separate in the vector space?

- **Concept: Information Entropy (Shannon Entropy)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding the "Relation Entropy" metric, which quantifies the unpredictability of relation types in the graph.
  - **Quick check question:** If a KG has only one relation type, what is its relation entropy, and does this imply high or low complexity?

- **Concept: Link Prediction Metrics (MRR vs Hits@k)**
  - **Why needed here:** To distinguish why semantic features hurt MRR/Hits@1 (precision) while structural features help Hits@10 (recall).
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model successfully place the correct entity in the top 10 (Hits@10) but fail to rank it first (Hits@1)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** KG Triples $(h, r, t)$ -> BERT-based embeddings -> Metric Engine (Spectral, Semantic, Structural modules) -> Complexity Scores -> Correlation Analysis with MRR/Hits@k
- **Critical path:** Calculating **Relation Entropy** and **Degree-based metrics**. The paper identifies these as the most faithful indicators of complexity (both positively and negatively correlated with performance), rendering them the critical signals for dataset profiling.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Spectral vs. Heuristic:** CSG is computationally expensive (eigen-decomposition) and fragile; Semantic/Structural metrics are computationally cheaper and more interpretable but may miss high-dimensional manifold interactions.
  - **Precision vs. Recall Profiling:** Optimizing for low Relation Entropy aids precision tasks; optimizing for high Centrality aids recall tasks.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **CSG Drift:** CSG values changing drastically with sampling size $M$ or neighbor $K$.
  - **False Negatives:** A dataset with low relation entropy but very sparse connectivity (low average degree) might look "easy" via semantic metrics but fail in practice due to lack of training signal.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **CSG Stability Check:** Sweep parameter $K$ (e.g., 10 to 100) on a single dataset (e.g., FB15k-237) and plot CSG variance to confirm instability.
  2.  **Semantic Correlation:** Calculate Relation Entropy for all benchmark datasets and verify the inverse correlation with reported MRR scores.
  3.  **Structural Impact:** Compute Average Degree and PageRank for CoDEx-S/M/L and correlate with Hits@10 to validate the recall hypothesis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on a single embedding method (BERT-base) for the CSG metric, limiting generalizability across different KG embedding architectures.
- The sampling procedure for CSG (N_s=120 per class) and the source of benchmark performance scores (MRR values) remain underspecified, affecting reproducibility.
- The study focuses on a fixed set of five datasets, limiting generalizability to KGs with different characteristics such as multi-modal or temporal knowledge graphs.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The finding that semantic metrics (Relation Entropy, Node-level Maximum Relation Diversity) inversely correlate with MRR/Hits@1, as this is directly supported by the presented correlation analysis and aligns with established understanding of semantic ambiguity in link prediction.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that structural features (Average Degree, Centrality) positively correlate with Hits@10, as this is supported by the data but the causal mechanism could be more complex than simple redundancy.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that CSG is a fundamentally flawed metric for KGs, as the instability observed might be specific to the chosen implementation (k-NN graph construction on BERT embeddings) rather than a universal property of spectral methods.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Test:** Systematically sweep the k-NN parameter K (e.g., 10, 25, 50, 100) on FB15k-237 and plot the resulting CSG values to quantify instability and confirm the paper's observation of dramatic variation.
2. **Embedding Ablation Study:** Compute CSG using a different embedding method (e.g., TransE or RotatE embeddings) on the same datasets to test if the observed instability is specific to BERT-based representations.
3. **Correlation Replication:** Independently calculate the Relation Entropy for all five benchmark datasets and verify the reported inverse correlation with the Mean MRR scores from the paper's Figure 3.
