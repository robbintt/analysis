# Roadmap for using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate cross-disciplinary research with an example from computational biology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03722
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03722
- Authors: Ruian Ke; Ruy M. Ribeiro
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs can accelerate cross-disciplinary research through literature synthesis, code generation, and iterative human-in-the-loop workflows, demonstrated via HIV rebound modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a practical roadmap for integrating large language models into cross-disciplinary research workflows, illustrated through a computational biology case study on HIV rebound dynamics. The authors demonstrate how iterative interactions with ChatGPT can facilitate literature review, data analysis, methodology development, and manuscript drafting. Key strengths include LLMs' ability to synthesize literature across fields, generate code for data preprocessing and visualization, suggest computational methods, and assist in writing. Limitations include potential hallucinations, oversimplification of complex topics, and need for expert validation. The study emphasizes a human-in-the-loop approach where LLMs serve as augmentative tools rather than replacements for human expertise. The roadmap provides practical prompts for researchers to effectively leverage LLMs while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Method Summary
The authors demonstrate LLM integration through an iterative workflow applied to HIV rebound dynamics modeling. They begin with literature synthesis using ChatGPT's Deep Research for HIV rebound literature, followed by data visualization and statistical analysis of longitudinal viral load measurements from post-treatment controllers versus non-controllers. The workflow progresses to ODE model development for HIV dynamics, with parameter estimation using mixed-effects fitting (Monolix), and concludes with manuscript drafting. The approach emphasizes context-rich prompting, expert validation at each stage, and iterative refinement to correct LLM-generated outputs.

## Key Results
- LLMs can effectively synthesize literature across domains and generate functional code for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization
- Expert oversight is essential to validate LLM outputs, correct biological inconsistencies in models, and verify citations
- Iterative prompting significantly improves LLM performance, particularly for specialized tools where initial outputs may contain errors
- The human-in-the-loop framework enables augmentation without replacement of expert judgment in cross-disciplinary research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs accelerate cross-disciplinary research by translating domain-specific jargon and synthesizing literature across fields.
- Mechanism: LLMs are trained on enormous corpora spanning diverse research literature; they restructure complex technical content into accessible summaries while preserving key concepts. This lowers communication barriers between specialists from different domains.
- Core assumption: The training data sufficiently covers both domains; the model does not systematically omit niche but critical methodological nuances.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study...demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research."
  - [section] "Thus, a common challenge in cross-disciplinary collaboration is to understand the fundamentals of multiple fields, so that researchers can communicate effectively by speaking and understanding each other's 'language'." (Page 3)
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Advancing Cognitive Science with LLMs" similarly frames LLMs as tools for addressing "knowledge synthesis and conceptual clarity" in interdisciplinary fields—consistent but not mechanistically novel.
- Break condition: When literature is too recent, too niche, or predominantly in non-English sources; when "deep research" features are unavailable and hallucination rates spike for citations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs reduce technical implementation barriers by generating functional code for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- Mechanism: Given natural language descriptions of datasets and goals, LLMs map tasks to appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, R packages) and produce annotated executable code. Iterative prompting refines outputs.
- Core assumption: The user can evaluate correctness of generated code; the model's training includes sufficient examples of the target libraries and idioms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "With proper description of the dataset and the goal of data preprocessing in prompts...LLMs can effectively generate code that automates data cleaning tasks." (Page 7)
  - [section] "The ability of LLMs to suggest statistical and computational methods in the context of a research domain and provide corresponding codes...is one of the greatest strengths of LLMs for research." (Page 7)
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "AceWGS" uses LLMs to accelerate computational workflows in chemistry, aligning with code-generation capabilities, but corpus evidence on mechanistic detail is sparse.
- Break condition: For specialized or proprietary tools with limited training representation (e.g., Monolix/mlxtran), code may have substantial errors requiring expert debugging.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human-in-the-loop oversight is necessary to validate LLM outputs; this workflow enables augmentation without replacement of expert judgment.
- Mechanism: Expert provides context, evaluates suggestions, corrects errors (e.g., fixing inconsistent ODE terms), and iterates. The LLM drafts; the human validates and refines.
- Core assumption: Domain expertise exists to catch hallucinations, oversimplifications, and methodological errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework."
  - [section] "Using information from LLM responses without human (expert) in the loop supervision is definitely not advised." (Page 5)
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers consistently emphasize expert oversight (e.g., "Towards Scientific Intelligence" survey notes human validation remains critical), but do not provide novel mechanistic evidence beyond the present paper.
- Break condition: When users lack sufficient domain expertise to evaluate outputs; when time pressure encourages blind acceptance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering with context specification
  - Why needed here: LLM response quality depends on providing expertise level, goals, and constraints in prompts.
  - Quick check question: Can you write a prompt that specifies your domain, the target audience, and the format of the desired output?

- Concept: Hallucination detection and reference verification
  - Why needed here: LLMs may generate plausible but fictitious citations or misattribute findings.
  - Quick check question: Do you know how to trace a cited claim back to the original primary source?

- Concept: Iterative refinement loops
  - Why needed here: Initial outputs are often general or partially incorrect; successive prompts correct and deepen results.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify what was wrong in an LLM's previous response and formulate a corrective prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM interface (e.g., ChatGPT with Deep Research) -> User prompts (context + task specification) -> Expert validation layer (human review of outputs, code, and citations) -> Local execution environment (run and verify generated code)

- Critical path: Literature synthesis -> Data visualization -> Method/model selection -> Code generation -> Expert debugging -> Drafting -> Final human revision

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. reliability: faster output with less iteration increases hallucination risk.
  - General vs. domain-specific tools: proprietary niche tools (e.g., Monolix) yield lower-quality generated code than well-documented libraries (e.g., Python/R ecosystems).

- Failure signatures:
  - Repeated or circular citations in summaries
  - Code that runs but implements incorrect logic
  - Plausible-sounding but unverified parameter values or references
  - Results sections that include fabricated data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a Deep Research literature review on a topic you know well; manually verify 5 citations for accuracy and completeness.
  2. Provide a small dataset and ask the LLM to generate code for cleaning and visualization; run locally and identify at least one error or suboptimal choice.
  3. Request a methods section draft; compare it against your actual procedures and note gaps or fabrications.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How should policies and governance frameworks be designed to ensure meaningful human oversight and transparency when LLMs are integrated into automated research workflows?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "Designing policies ensuring human oversight and transparency of the automated process is an emerging area that requires careful thinking and discussion."
- Why unresolved: Current guidelines focus on individual human-in-the-loop interactions, but emerging agentic systems (teams of LLMs) may perform more autonomous tasks, making oversight structures unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different oversight frameworks in real research projects, or consensus guidelines from professional societies on LLM transparency requirements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can reliable criteria be developed to systematically evaluate the scientific feasibility and novelty of cross-disciplinary research ideas generated by LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note LLMs "sometimes are capable of producing interesting insights—many of which appear to be genuinely novel," but also "many infeasible or illogical ideas," leaving expert evaluation as the only current filter.
- Why unresolved: No validated framework exists for distinguishing genuinely novel interdisciplinary connections from superficially plausible but flawed LLM suggestions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a rubric or scoring system for LLM-generated research ideas, tested against expert evaluations across multiple domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does sustained reliance on LLMs for research tasks lead to homogenization of methodological approaches and erosion of innovative thinking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors cite concerns that "overreliance on LLMs may make science less innovative... and lead to homogenization of research approaches and perspectives."
- Why unresolved: Longitudinal data on how LLM adoption affects research diversity does not yet exist; current observations are speculative.
- What evidence would resolve it: Bibliometric analyses comparing methodological diversity in publications before and after widespread LLM adoption, or controlled studies of research output quality from LLM-assisted vs. traditional workflows.

## Limitations
- Data availability and reproducibility: The specific anonymized clinical dataset is not provided, limiting direct reproduction of results.
- Domain-specific code generation: Generated code for specialized/proprietary software may contain errors requiring expert debugging.
- Hallucination risk: Even with Deep Research, citations and summaries must be manually verified, particularly for recent or niche literature.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism that LLMs can accelerate cross-disciplinary research by synthesizing literature and generating functional code for well-documented tools, given human oversight.
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of LLMs for specialized code generation (e.g., Monolix) and handling very recent/niche literature, due to documented error rates and hallucination risks.
- Low confidence: Claims about specific parameter values or model structures without validation against primary sources or biological plausibility checks.

## Next Checks
1. **Citation verification**: Select 10 citations from an LLM-generated literature review and verify each against the original source for accuracy of claims, context, and existence.
2. **Code validation**: Generate code for a non-trivial data analysis task (e.g., mixed-effects modeling), execute it locally, and compare results against known benchmarks or expert implementation.
3. **Model plausibility check**: Present an LLM-generated ODE model to a domain expert and document all structural errors, missing terms, or biologically implausible assumptions before any fitting is attempted.
