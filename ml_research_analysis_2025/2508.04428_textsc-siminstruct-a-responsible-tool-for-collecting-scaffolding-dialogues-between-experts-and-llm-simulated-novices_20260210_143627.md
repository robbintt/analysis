# \textsc{SimInstruct}: A Responsible Tool for Collecting Scaffolding Dialogues Between Experts and LLM-Simulated Novices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.04428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04428
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SimInstruct uses LLM-simulated novices to collect scaffolding dialogues with human experts, producing 123 dialogues that fine-tune LLaMA to outperform GPT-4o in instructional quality, especially reflective prompting.

## Executive Summary
SimInstruct introduces a tool that uses LLM-simulated novice instructors to collect high-quality scaffolding dialogues with human teaching experts. The tool generates diverse persona profiles and enables multi-turn coaching conversations, producing 123 dialogues totaling over 100,000 words. Compared to real coaching recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrated comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts found the process engaging and reflective. Fine-tuning LLaMA on the augmented dataset outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality, particularly in reflective prompting. The work highlights the potential of expert-in-the-loop approaches for responsible data collection in education and reveals limitations in current LLMs for reflective teaching tasks.

## Method Summary
SimInstruct collects expert-novice scaffolding dialogues through a web interface where teaching experts coach LLM-simulated novices. The tool generates persona profiles with Big Five personality traits and domain attributes, then uses GPT-4 for persona validation and initial question generation. GPT-4-turbo simulates novice responses across multi-turn dialogues. The collected 123 dialogues are augmented to 1,415 using 3-shot synthetic generation with GPT-4o mini, filtered for valid conversational format. The resulting 9,271 turns are used to fine-tune Llama-2-7b-chat-hf with LR 2e-5, weight decay 0.01, and cosine schedule on NVIDIA A100 hardware.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned LLaMA outperformed GPT-4o across all four evaluation dimensions, with the most pronounced difference in reflective prompting
- The majority of dialogues followed a three-part scaffolding structure (Problem Identification → Reason Exploration → Strategy Development)
- Extraverted persona profiles prompted more extended expert responses, with a positive association between extraversion and expert word count (Δ=86.94, p=0.030)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Persona personality traits in LLM-simulated novices causally influence expert engagement depth.
- Mechanism: Extraverted persona profiles prompt more extended expert responses through perceived conversational openness, while introverted profiles elicit briefer exchanges. This creates natural variation in dialogue complexity.
- Core assumption: Experts respond to simulated personality cues similarly to how they would respond to real personality traits in coaching contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "persona traits—such as extroversion and introversion—meaningfully influence how experts engage"
  - [section 4.4] "extraversion showed a positive association with expert word count (∆= 86.94, p= 0.030)"
  - [corpus] TutorUp paper similarly uses simulated students for tutor training, supporting persona-based simulation validity
- Break condition: If persona trait randomization produces no measurable variation in expert behavior across large samples, the mechanism is not operating.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Three-stage scaffolding structure (Problem Identification → Reason Exploration → Strategy Development) produces pedagogically coherent dialogues transferable to model fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: Structured dialogue phases enforce progressive cognitive engagement, preventing single-turn problem resolution and encouraging multi-turn reasoning chains that capture expert pedagogical logic.
- Core assumption: The scaffolding structure observed in real coaching transfers to simulated contexts and captures generalizable instructional reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "The majority dialogues collected through our tool followed a three-part scaffolding structure"
  - [section 5.1] "We found that the structural scaffolding in both types of dialogues was similar"
  - [corpus] EduDial corpus construction emphasizes multi-turn teacher-student dialogue structure for LLM training
- Break condition: If fine-tuned models show no improvement in scaffolded instruction quality versus baseline, structure-to-transfer pathway is weak.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Expert-in-the-loop with synthetic novices produces higher-quality instructional data than fully synthetic pipelines or post-hoc annotation alone.
- Mechanism: Human experts contribute situated pedagogical reasoning and adaptive questioning that synthetic generators fail to produce; synthetic novices enable scale without privacy/ethical barriers.
- Core assumption: Expert reasoning captured in simulated dialogues generalizes to real instructional contexts despite simulated novices lacking authentic pushback complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Fine-tuning LLaMA on the augmented dataset outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality, particularly in reflective prompting"
  - [section 5.2] "LLaMA outperformed GPT4o across all four evaluation dimensions... most pronounced difference was in reflective prompting"
  - [corpus] Evidence is limited; no direct comparison to fully synthetic scaffolding datasets in corpus literature
- Break condition: If models trained on expert-in-the-loop data underperform those trained on purely synthetic or crowd-annotated data on instructional benchmarks, mechanism is unsupported.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Scaffolding theory (Wood, Bruner, Ross)**
  - Why needed here: The entire dialogue collection framework assumes scaffolding—gradual support withdrawal based on learner needs—as the target pedagogical pattern. Without this foundation, the three-phase structure appears arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why effective scaffolding requires adaptive multi-turn dialogue rather than single-turn advice delivery?

- Concept: **Big Five personality traits in conversational agents**
  - Why needed here: Persona generation uses four Big Five traits to create diverse simulated novices. Understanding how these traits manifest conversationally is essential for designing realistic profiles.
  - Quick check question: Why would extraversion vs. introversion differentially affect expert word count in coaching dialogues?

- Concept: **In-context learning for data augmentation**
  - Why needed here: The augmentation pipeline uses 3-shot prompting to expand 123 dialogues to 1,415. Understanding few-shot learning capabilities and failure modes is critical for pipeline design.
  - Quick check question: What quality risks emerge when using LLM-generated synthetic data to expand a small seed dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Persona Profile Generator → Creates 9 domain attributes + 4 personality traits; GPT-4 validates coherence
  - Initial Question Generator → GPT-4 produces domain challenge question based on persona
  - Follow-up Response Engine → GPT-4-turbo maintains persona consistency across turns
  - Conversational UI → Web interface for expert-novice multi-turn dialogue
  - Data Augmentation Pipeline → 3-shot synthetic dialogue generation + format filtering
  - Fine-tuning Pipeline → LLaMA-2-7b-chat training on augmented dataset

- Critical path:
  1. Design domain-specific challenges (40-item list in this case)
  2. Define persona attribute space and validation rules
  3. Deploy conversational UI with expert recruitment
  4. Collect seed dialogues → quality-filter unrealistic conversations
  5. Augment via 3-shot synthesis → filter malformed outputs
  6. Fine-tune expert model → evaluate against baseline (GPT-4o in paper)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Persona complexity vs. coherence**: More attributes increase diversity but risk internal contradictions; paper uses GPT-4 verification step
  - **Data augmentation scale vs. quality**: 123→1,415 expansion enables fine-tuning but may amplify seed dataset biases
  - **Expert autonomy vs. consistency**: Experts can skip/revise prompts (increases engagement) but creates variable dialogue lengths (5-20 minutes)

- Failure signatures:
  - LLM-simulated novices excessively agree with expert suggestions despite prompts to decline appropriately
  - Simulated questions lack contextual grounding (rated lower than real dialogues on instructional contextualization)
  - GPT-4o baseline shows weak reflective prompting, generic praise overuse, condescending tone
  - Dialogues cluster at fewer turns than real face-to-face coaching

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Persona pushback calibration**: Modify follow-up response prompts to increase disagreement frequency; measure whether expert engagement patterns shift toward real-dialogue distributions
  2. **Augmentation ablation**: Train models on seed data only (123) vs. augmented (1,415) vs. augmented with different shot counts; isolate synthetic data contribution to fine-tuning gains
  3. **Cross-domain transfer**: Apply SimInstruct framework to non-teaching domain (e.g., clinical supervision) with domain-specific challenges; test whether scaffolding structure and expert engagement patterns replicate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLMs be trained to simulate realistic novice disagreement and pushback, rather than defaulting to agreement?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "These gaps underscore the need for future LLM systems to better simulate disagreement and dialogic complexity, especially since LLMs are typically optimized to be agreeable responders." (p. 11)
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs consistently agree with expert suggestions, making coaching feel "easier but less authentic."
- What evidence would resolve it: A study measuring disagreement rates and pushback quality in dialogues with modified training objectives, compared to human novice baseline rates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do gender and age attributes in persona prompts affect simulated behavior and introduce potential biases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We intentionally excluded gender and age from persona prompts to avoid introducing potential biases in simulated behavior—an area that merits further research." (p. 12)
- Why unresolved: These attributes were deliberately omitted to avoid bias, leaving their effects unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing dialogues with and without gender/age attributes, measuring expert response differences and bias metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can human-human dialogue data (with non-verbal cues, short utterances) effectively train LLMs for similar pedagogical tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "It opens a new discussion on how human-human data can or cannot be used to train LLM doing similar things as human." (p. 11)
- Why unresolved: Face-to-face dialogues include elements (short responses like "keep going," non-verbal cues) absent in text-based SimInstruct data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative training experiments using transcribed human-human coaching data vs. SimInstruct-style data, evaluating model performance on pedagogical benchmarks.

## Limitations

- Data Quality and Generalizability: Simulated dialogues show less contextual depth than real coaching recordings, suggesting limitations in capturing authentic expert-novice interactions. The expert-in-the-loop approach may not fully compensate for the absence of genuine novice pushback and emotional nuance.
- Sample Size and Statistical Power: With only 123 seed dialogues from a small pool of teaching experts, statistical inferences about persona trait effects may lack robustness. The positive association between extraversion and expert word count approaches significance thresholds.
- Model Evaluation Validity: Human evaluation metrics for instructional quality remain subjective. The superiority of fine-tuned LLaMA over GPT-4o needs further validation across diverse coaching scenarios.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The SimInstruct tool successfully generates scaffolded dialogues with a three-phase structure
- Persona traits measurably influence expert engagement depth (extroversion effect is statistically significant)
- Fine-tuning LLaMA on the augmented dataset produces a functional expert coaching model

**Medium Confidence**:
- SimInstruct dialogues are comparable to real coaching recordings in pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth
- Expert-in-the-loop with synthetic novices produces higher-quality data than fully synthetic approaches
- The structured scaffolding transfers effectively to model fine-tuning

**Low Confidence**:
- SimInstruct completely solves privacy/ethical barriers in expert dialogue collection
- The tool's effectiveness generalizes to non-educational domains
- Current LLMs are fundamentally limited for reflective teaching tasks (versus needing better prompting/data)

## Next Checks

1. **Persona Pushback Calibration Study**: Systematically vary the degree of simulated novice pushback (from highly agreeable to challenging) across 500+ dialogues. Measure whether expert engagement patterns shift toward real-dialogue distributions and identify the optimal pushback level for capturing authentic pedagogical reasoning.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Experiment**: Deploy SimInstruct framework in clinical supervision (or another high-stakes expert-novice domain) with domain-specific challenges. Compare scaffolding structure fidelity and expert engagement patterns to the educational domain to test generalizability claims.

3. **Fine-tuning Ablation with Real vs. Simulated Data**: Train three model variants: (a) fine-tuned on seed data only (123 dialogues), (b) fine-tuned on augmented synthetic data (1,415 dialogues), and (c) fine-tuned on a mixed dataset of real and simulated dialogues. Evaluate performance on authentic coaching benchmarks to isolate synthetic data contribution and identify potential catastrophic forgetting or style degradation.
