# Position on LLM-Assisted Peer Review: Addressing Reviewer Gap through Mentoring and Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09182
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09182
- Reference count: 13
- Proposes LLM-assisted mentoring and feedback system to improve peer review quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the "Reviewer Gap" in AI research by proposing an LLM-assisted mentoring and feedback system that positions LLMs as educational assistants for human reviewers rather than autonomous review generators. The system implements two complementary mechanisms: a mentoring system with guided recognition, review refinement practice, and full simulation stages for reviewer training, and a feedback system that detects weaknesses in review drafts and provides evidence-based suggestions for improvement. The approach aims to cultivate reviewer competencies while ensuring consistent application of five foundational review principles.

## Method Summary
The proposed system defines five foundational principles of high-quality reviews (Fidelity, Clarity, Fairness, Proportionality, Constructiveness) and implements two complementary mechanisms. The LLM-assisted mentoring system guides reviewers through three stages: guided recognition (identifying review components), review refinement practice (improving draft reviews), and full simulation (complete review process practice). The LLM-assisted feedback system analyzes review drafts to detect weaknesses and provides evidence-based suggestions for improvement. The approach emphasizes LLMs as educational assistants rather than autonomous review generators, focusing on reviewer training and development.

## Key Results
- Defines five foundational principles for high-quality reviews
- Implements two complementary mechanisms: mentoring system and feedback system
- Positions LLMs as educational assistants for human reviewers rather than autonomous review generators
- Addresses the "Reviewer Gap" through structured reviewer training and development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages LLMs' ability to provide consistent, detailed feedback and guidance while maintaining human agency in the review process. By positioning LLMs as mentoring tools rather than autonomous reviewers, the approach ensures that human reviewers develop critical competencies while benefiting from AI assistance. The two-pronged approach of mentoring and feedback creates a comprehensive framework for reviewer development that addresses both initial training needs and ongoing improvement opportunities.

## Foundational Learning
- Fidelity: Ensuring reviews accurately represent the work being evaluated - needed to maintain review integrity, quick check through accuracy metrics
- Clarity: Making reviews understandable and well-structured - needed for effective communication, quick check through readability scores
- Fairness: Maintaining objectivity and avoiding bias - needed for credible evaluation, quick check through bias detection tools
- Proportionality: Matching review depth to paper significance - needed for appropriate evaluation, quick check through scope analysis
- Constructiveness: Providing actionable feedback for improvement - needed for research advancement, quick check through feedback utility assessment

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Reviewer -> Mentoring System -> Feedback System -> Review Output
Critical path: Reviewer training through mentoring stages → Draft review creation → Feedback system analysis → Review refinement → Final review submission
Design tradeoffs: Human agency vs. AI assistance balance; comprehensive training vs. time efficiency; consistency vs. individual reviewer style
Failure signatures: Over-reliance on LLM guidance; inconsistent feedback quality; reviewer fatigue from extensive training; misalignment between mentoring stages and actual review needs
First experiments:
1. Compare review quality between mentored and non-mentored reviewers
2. Evaluate feedback system accuracy in detecting review weaknesses
3. Test transfer of reviewer competencies across different domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of mentoring stages in improving review quality
- Five foundational principles lack validation regarding their completeness or relative importance
- Implementation details for LLM feedback detection are not fully specified
- Risk of reviewers becoming overly reliant on LLM guidance

## Confidence
- Confidence in core positioning of LLMs as mentoring tools: Medium
- Confidence in specific implementation mechanisms: Low
- Confidence in proposed principles: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing review quality between reviewers who receive LLM-assisted mentoring versus traditional training methods
2. Evaluate inter-annotator agreement on LLM-generated feedback suggestions to assess consistency and reliability
3. Test whether reviewer competencies transfer across different domains or remain specific to the training context
