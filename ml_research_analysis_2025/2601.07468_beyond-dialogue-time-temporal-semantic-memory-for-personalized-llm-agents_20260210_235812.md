# Beyond Dialogue Time: Temporal Semantic Memory for Personalized LLM Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07468
- Authors: Miao Su; Yucan Guo; Zhongni Hou; Long Bai; Zixuan Li; Yufei Zhang; Guojun Yin; Wei Lin; Xiaolong Jin; Jiafeng Guo; Xueqi Cheng

- Primary result: TSM achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical limitation of existing personalized LLM agents that organize memories by dialogue time rather than actual event time, treating memories as isolated points without capturing temporal continuity. The authors propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a dual approach that constructs duration-aware memories through semantic timelines and consolidates temporally continuous information into durative memories. TSM introduces a novel temporal knowledge graph representation and semantic-time guided memory retrieval, significantly improving the agent's ability to maintain coherent and contextually appropriate responses over long-term interactions.

## Method Summary
TSM introduces a novel approach to personalized memory management by constructing a semantic timeline that clusters temporally continuous information and consolidates it into durative memories. The framework consists of two main components: duration-aware memory construction, which builds a temporal knowledge graph and aggregates episodic memories through clustering and summarization, and semantic-time guided memory utilization, which retrieves memories based on temporal intent. The system uses an external API for temporal extraction and entity linking, constructs episodic memory as a temporal knowledge graph, and employs clustering algorithms to create durative memories that capture temporal continuity rather than isolated dialogue points.

## Key Results
- TSM consistently outperforms baselines across multiple datasets, achieving up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy
- On LONGMEMEVAL_S benchmark, TSM achieves 74.80% accuracy, setting new state-of-the-art results on temporal, multi-session, and knowledge update questions
- Ablation study confirms both semantic timeline and durative memory components are crucial, with performance degradation observed when either component is removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of TSM stems from its ability to capture temporal continuity in user interactions rather than treating memories as isolated dialogue points. By constructing a semantic timeline that groups temporally continuous events and creating durative memories through clustering and summarization, the system can better understand the progression of user experiences and maintain contextual coherence. The temporal knowledge graph representation allows the system to capture relationships between events across different time periods, while semantic-time guided retrieval ensures that memories are selected based on both content relevance and temporal context, leading to more appropriate and personalized responses.

## Foundational Learning

Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Represent entities and relationships with temporal information
- Why needed: To capture how relationships between entities evolve over time
- Quick check: Can track when relationships start, end, or change strength

Semantic Timeline Construction: Clustering memories based on temporal proximity and semantic similarity
- Why needed: Groups related events that occur close together in time
- Quick check: Events from the same day/week should cluster together

Durative Memory Aggregation: Combining multiple related memories into consolidated representations
- Why needed: Reduces memory load while preserving important temporal patterns
- Quick check: Multiple lunch meetings with same person should merge into one "relationship" memory

Temporal Intent Recognition: Identifying when users reference past events or time periods
- Why needed: Enables appropriate memory retrieval based on temporal context
- Quick check: Questions about "last week" vs "last year" should trigger different memories

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: External API (Temporal Extraction) -> Temporal Knowledge Graph Builder -> Memory Clustering Engine -> Durative Memory Store -> Semantic-Time Retriever -> LLM Agent

Critical Path: User Input -> Semantic-Time Analysis -> Memory Retrieval (Durative Store + Timeline) -> Response Generation -> Memory Update

Design Tradeoffs: External API dependency vs accuracy, clustering granularity vs memory efficiency, temporal precision vs computational cost

Failure Signatures: Incorrect temporal clustering leading to inappropriate memory retrieval, API failures causing memory construction breakdown, over-aggregation losing important temporal details

First Experiments:
1. Single-session memory retrieval with controlled temporal patterns
2. Cross-session consistency test with evolving user preferences
3. Knowledge update scenario with conflicting temporal information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Reliance on external API for temporal extraction and entity linking introduces scalability and cost concerns for production deployment
- Limited validation on diverse real-world conversational datasets beyond established benchmarks
- Potential loss of granular temporal details during durative memory aggregation process

## Confidence

High: Core observation about temporal continuity limitations is well-supported; experimental methodology is rigorous
Medium: Performance improvements are well-documented but generalizability to other domains uncertain
Low: Practical deployment viability, including scalability and real-time performance, lacks thorough evaluation

## Next Checks

1. Implement TSM in a live conversational agent over 3+ months with real users to evaluate performance with naturally occurring temporal patterns
2. Test TSM on three additional domains (healthcare, education, customer service) with diverse temporal patterns and memory requirements
3. Conduct comprehensive benchmarking of computational overhead, memory usage, and response latency under varying memory loads (100, 1,000, 10,000+ memories)
