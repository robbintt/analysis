# Synthetic Data Privacy Metrics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03941
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03941
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of privacy metrics for synthetic tabular data with practical implementation guidance

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic review of privacy metrics for synthetic data, focusing on tabular datasets. It evaluates both classical metrics like k-anonymity and modern approaches including membership inference attacks (MIAs) and attribute inference attacks (AIAs). The authors analyze the strengths and limitations of each metric, propose practical implementations, and offer guidance on selecting appropriate metrics based on threat models. They emphasize the lack of standardization in the field and provide recommendations for improving synthetic data privacy through techniques like differential privacy and privacy filters.

## Method Summary
The paper reviews multiple privacy metrics for synthetic data evaluation. For distance-based metrics, the methodology involves computing Euclidean distances between synthetic and real records to identify privacy leakage patterns. For MIAs, the approach uses a "no-box" attack where L2 distance from synthetic records to holdout data determines membership likelihood. AIAs employ KNN-based methods using quasi-identifiers to predict sensitive attributes. The evaluation framework recommends using a holdout set (5% of training data) to simulate attacks and measure privacy metrics like DCR, NNDR, and NNAA. The authors also discuss differential privacy implementation and privacy filters as complementary techniques.

## Key Results
- No standardization exists across privacy metrics for synthetic data evaluation
- Distance-based proxies (DCR/NNDR) effectively detect overfitting but may fail in high dimensions
- Simulated adversarial attacks (MIAs/AIAs) provide direct empirical privacy measures
- Differential privacy offers mathematical guarantees but requires careful utility-privacy trade-offs
- Privacy filters can improve security by removing exact matches and outliers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Distance-based proxies (DCR/NNDR) indicate privacy leakage by measuring the uniqueness of synthetic records relative to the training distribution.
- **Mechanism:** By calculating the Euclidean distance from a synthetic record to its nearest real neighbor, one can detect if the model is outputting near-duplicates of training data. If the train-synth distance is significantly lower than the train-train distance, it implies the synthetic data is "closer" to the real data than real data is to itself, signaling overfitting.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that spatial proximity in the feature space correlates directly with information leakage, and that L2 distance captures semantic similarity meaningful to an attacker.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 3] Defines Distance to Closest Record (DCR) and the variation comparing train-train vs. train-synth DCR to detect leakage.
  - [Page 3-4] Describes Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR) as a measure of proximity to outliers, which are known to be vulnerable.
  - [Corpus] The paper "Quantifying the Privacy Implications of High-Fidelity Synthetic Network Traffic" supports the use of distance metrics but notes that high fidelity often complicates privacy.
- **Break condition:** Fails in high-dimensional spaces where distance metrics become uniform (curse of dimensionality) or when "safe" aggregated records happen to be equidistant to sensitive outliers.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Simulated adversarial attacks (MIAs/AIAs) provide a robust empirical measure of privacy by stress-testing the data against specific threat models.
- **Mechanism:** Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) attempt to distinguish between training and holdout data based on their proximity to synthetic records. Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) attempt to predict sensitive values using quasi-identifiers and nearest-neighbor logic. High accuracy implies the synthetic data retains specific individual patterns.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the simulation accurately models the capabilities of a real adversary (e.g., the "no-box" scenario where the attacker only sees the synthetic data) and that the holdout set is representative of the general population.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 5] Details "no-box" distance-based MIAs where L2 distance is compared to a threshold to identify training members.
  - [Page 6] Describes KNN-based AIAs using quasi-identifiers to predict sensitive fields.
  - [Corpus] "Privacy Auditing Synthetic Data Release through Local Likelihood Attacks" suggests existing heuristics often rely on unreasonable assumptions about the attacker, highlighting the need for rigorous simulation.
- **Break condition:** If the attacker has background knowledge (auxiliary data) not represented in the quasi-identifiers or features used in the simulation, the metric may underestimate the true privacy risk.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Differential Privacy (DP) provides a mathematical guarantee of privacy by bounding the contribution of any single record.
- **Mechanism:** Algorithms like DP-SGD clip gradients and add calibrated noise during training. This ensures the output distribution (synthetic data) remains statistically similar regardless of whether any specific individual's data was included in the training set.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the privacy budget ($\epsilon$) is correctly calculated and that the implementation of DP (e.g., gradient clipping) does not have software bugs or side channels.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 7] Defines $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and mentions DP-SGD.
  - [Page 7] Notes that DP provides an upper bound on MIA effectiveness.
  - [Corpus] "Privacy-Preserving Generative Modeling... for Chronic Disease" validates DP as a standard approach for sensitive health data.
- **Break condition:** Excessive noise destroys utility (the privacy-utility trade-off), or adaptive attacks exploit the specific implementation of the DP mechanism (e.g., privacy side channels).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Quasi-Identifiers**
  - **Why needed here:** Central to K-Anonymity and AIAs. These are non-direct identifiers (like zip code or birth date) that can be combined to re-identify individuals. Understanding them is required to define the "Attack Dataset" for testing.
  - **Quick check question:** In a dataset of hospital records, is "Admission Date" a direct identifier or a quasi-identifier, and why does that distinction matter for an AIA?

- **Concept: Overfitting & Memorization**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly links model overfitting to privacy loss. Generative models that memorize training data (low train loss) produce synthetic data that is vulnerable to MIAs.
  - **Quick check question:** If a generative model achieves 100% accuracy on the training set but performs poorly on a holdout set, is the resulting synthetic data likely to have high or low privacy? (Answer: Low privacy).

- **Concept: Threat Models (White-box vs. No-box)**
  - **Why needed here:** Privacy metrics depend on what the attacker knows. The paper emphasizes "no-box" attacks (attacker only has synthetic data) as the most realistic industrial scenario, influencing the choice of metric (e.g., distance-based MIAs vs. shadow models).
  - **Quick check question:** Why is a "shadow model" attack often considered unrealistic for evaluating synthetic data shared via CSV file?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input: Real Data -> Pre-processing (Deduplication, PII Scrubbing) -> Generator: Model (e.g., GAN, VAE, Diffusion) -> Training Loop (optional DP-SGD, Early Stopping) -> Post-Processing: Privacy Filters (Similarity filter, Outlier filter) -> Evaluation: Attack Suite (DCR/NNDR Calculation, MIA Simulation, AIA Simulation) -> Output: Synthetic Data Release

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Prevent:** Remove duplicates from training data (Page 8).
  2. **Train:** Generate data with regularization or DP (Page 8).
  3. **Filter:** Run privacy filters to catch exact matches or outliers (Page 8).
  4. **Audit:** Run MIA/AIA simulations to generate a privacy score (Page 6).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Utility vs. Privacy:** Aggressive privacy filters or low $\epsilon$ in DP improve privacy but may degrade the statistical fidelity of the synthetic data (Page 2).
  - **Metric Complexity vs. Interpretability:** Distance metrics (DCR) are fast and interpretable but indirect. Attack simulations (MIA) are direct but computationally expensive and sensitive to hyperparameters (thresholds).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Exact Replication:** Identical Match Share (IMS) > 0.
  - **Model Collapse:** DCR within synthetic data is significantly lower than DCR within real data (Page 3).
  - **MIA Vulnerability:** MIA Precision/Accuracy > 0.8 (Grade: Poor) (Page 5).
  - **Outlier Leakage:** NNDR values close to 0 indicate synthetic records are very close to real outliers (Page 4).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Fidelity vs. Privacy:** Train a generator *without* DP or filters. Measure DCR and Identical Match Share (IMS) to establish the "riskiest" baseline.
  2. **MIA Threshold Sensitivity:** Implement the "no-box" distance-based MIA (Page 5). Vary the distance threshold to plot the ROC curve or Precision/Accuracy trade-off to find the "break point" where the synthetic data reveals training members.
  3. **Filter Effectiveness:** Apply a Similarity Filter and re-run the MIA simulation. Compare the privacy score (precision/accuracy) before and after filtering to validate the utility of the post-processing step.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the field establish a standardized framework for empirical privacy metrics to ensure consistent evaluation across diverse synthetic data models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract and introduction state that despite the proliferation of new metrics, "there currently is no standardization."
- Why unresolved: The rapid, uncoordinated development of metrics leads to inconsistent reporting and difficulty in comparing model privacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A consensus benchmark or suite of standard tests adopted across academia and industry.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a rigorous method be developed to mathematically classify attributes as quasi-identifiers versus sensitive values in Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.8 notes the challenge that "there is no way to mathematically, unambiguously determine whether an attribute is an identifier, a quasi-identifier, or a non-identifying sensitive value."
- Why unresolved: Contextual factors like population prevalence make static classification unreliable, forcing reliance on random sampling heuristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that dynamically categorizes attributes based on data distribution and potential auxiliary knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) be refined to avoid the "unrealistic" assumption that attackers possess data closely resembling the training distribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.7 states that shadow model attacks "make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training data."
- Why unresolved: The most common MIA methods (shadow models) depend on training surrogate models on representative data, a resource real-world attackers often lack.
- What evidence would resolve it: High-accuracy attacks that operate effectively in "no-box" settings without requiring surrogate datasets.

## Limitations

- Lack of standardization across privacy metrics makes cross-model comparisons difficult
- Distance-based metrics may fail in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality
- Practical threshold selection for MIA classification remains unclear and "empirically selected"

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical definitions of DCR, NNDR, and NNAA metrics; the overall framework for privacy evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: The no-box MIA methodology and distance-based attack mechanics; differential privacy implementation principles
- **Low confidence**: Specific hyperparameter values for attack simulations; practical threshold selection guidance

## Next Checks

1. Implement sensitivity analysis on MIA distance thresholds using synthetic data with known privacy properties to identify optimal threshold ranges
2. Compare multiple quasi-identifier selection strategies (random vs. domain-knowledge-based) to assess their impact on AIA effectiveness
3. Benchmark different distance metrics (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, cosine) on mixed-type tabular data to determine which best correlates with privacy leakage
