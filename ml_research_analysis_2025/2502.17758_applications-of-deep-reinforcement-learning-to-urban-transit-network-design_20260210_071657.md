## Executive Summary
This thesis develops reinforcement learning methods to aid in the design of public transit networks, addressing the computationally challenging Transit Network Design Problem (TNDP). The core approach formulates transit network construction as a Markov Decision Process and trains a Graph Attention Network policy to act as an effective heuristic for this problem. The learned policy demonstrates strong performance on benchmark cities, outperforming simpler heuristics and matching state-of-the-art metaheuristic methods while requiring significantly less computation time.

## Method Summary
The research formulates transit network construction as a Markov Decision Process where the agent builds networks by sequentially adding bus lines to an initially empty graph. The state space includes the current network topology, travel demand data, and existing infrastructure. The action space consists of adding new bus lines by selecting start and end points and a path through the road network. The policy is implemented as a Graph Attention Network that processes the road network graph and produces action distributions. The network is trained using reinforcement learning with a reward function that balances operating costs against passenger benefits including reduced travel times and increased ridership. The approach includes a transfer learning component where the policy trained on small synthetic networks is applied to larger real-world scenarios.

## Key Results
- The learned Graph Attention Network policy outperforms simpler heuristics and matches state-of-the-art metaheuristic methods while requiring significantly less computation time
- The policy demonstrates strong generalization capability, transferring from small synthetic training instances (16 nodes, 4 lines) to larger real-world problems (up to 49 nodes, 20 lines)
- When applied to Laval, Canada, the method produces transit networks that improve on the existing network across multiple metrics including operating costs and passenger travel times

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the inductive biases of graph neural networks to capture spatial relationships in urban road networks while learning effective heuristics through reinforcement learning. The Graph Attention Network architecture allows the policy to weigh different parts of the network differently based on their relevance to transit demand patterns. The sequential decision-making framework mirrors how transit planners actually construct networks, adding lines incrementally rather than designing entire networks at once. The reward function encodes domain knowledge about the trade-offs between network coverage and operating costs, guiding the policy toward practical solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- Markov Decision Processes - Why needed: Provides the mathematical framework for modeling sequential transit network construction decisions; Quick check: Can define states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward function
- Graph Neural Networks - Why needed: Enables processing of road network topology and extracting relevant features for transit planning; Quick check: Understand message passing and aggregation mechanisms
- Reinforcement Learning - Why needed: Allows the policy to learn from interaction with the environment without requiring labeled examples; Quick check: Can explain policy gradient methods and exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- Transit Network Design Problem - Why needed: Understanding the specific constraints and objectives of urban transit planning; Quick check: Can identify key optimization criteria like operating costs and passenger travel times
- Graph Attention Networks - Why needed: Provides the ability to weight different parts of the network differently based on their relevance; Quick check: Can explain self-attention mechanisms in graph contexts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Road network graph -> Graph Attention Network -> Action distribution -> Transit network state update -> Reward calculation -> Policy update

**Critical Path:** State representation -> GNN processing -> Action selection -> Environment response -> Reward computation -> Policy gradient update

**Design Tradeoffs:** The sequential line-by-line construction approach trades completeness of search for computational efficiency. Using Graph Attention Networks provides better feature extraction than simpler graph convolutions but requires more computational resources. The transfer learning approach enables application to larger problems but may limit performance compared to training directly on target instances.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on networks with unusual topology or demand patterns not represented in training data. Suboptimal solutions when the action space is too constrained to capture important design decisions. Instability during training if the reward function is poorly designed or the learning rate is inappropriate.

**First Experiments:** (1) Test the policy on a small synthetic network to verify basic functionality; (2) Compare performance against random line selection to establish baseline improvement; (3) Evaluate transfer performance from small to medium-sized networks to assess generalization capability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The policy's performance was evaluated on only two small synthetic benchmark cities and one real-world case study, leaving generalizability to diverse urban contexts uncertain
- The evaluation metrics focus on aggregated performance measures without considering equity aspects such as service coverage across different socioeconomic areas
- The scalability to much larger networks beyond the tested 49-node instances remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in the policy's effectiveness as a heuristic for TNDP, given systematic comparison with multiple baselines
- Medium confidence in computational efficiency improvements, based on limited experiments without full characterization of training overhead
- Medium confidence in generalization from small to large instances, demonstrated on only a few cases

## Next Checks
1. Test the trained policy on diverse real-world transit networks from multiple cities with different topological characteristics and demand patterns
2. Incorporate equity metrics into the evaluation framework to assess whether the learned policy produces socially equitable network designs
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components (graph attention network architecture, action space design, reward shaping) to the policy's performance
