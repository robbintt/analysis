# SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20377
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377
- Reference count: 6
- One-line primary result: SKILL-RAG achieves competitive accuracy on QA benchmarks while reducing input documents through self-knowledge guided filtering

## Executive Summary
SKILL-RAG addresses hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation by leveraging a model's self-knowledge to filter irrelevant retrieved content. The method introduces a reinforcement learning-based training framework that elicits self-knowledge from the model and uses sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving useful knowledge. Evaluated on Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B across four QA benchmarks, SKILL-RAG achieves competitive performance with accuracy scores ranging from 52.5% to 73.0% across different datasets, while significantly reducing the number of input documents. The results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG improves generation quality and context efficiency by effectively integrating internal and external knowledge through self-knowledge modeling.

## Method Summary
SKILL-RAG combines self-knowledge elicitation through reinforcement learning with document filtering based on pointwise mutual information. The approach trains the model to recognize its own knowledge boundaries using an entropy-weighted advantage function, then applies this self-knowledge to filter retrieved documents at sentence level. The method uses a masked language modeling objective combined with an entropy-weighted advantage function to induce self-knowledge, followed by self-knowledge-guided document filtering that estimates the mutual information between input sentences and generated answers. This allows the model to selectively retain only relevant information while discarding redundant or conflicting content from retrieval sources.

## Key Results
- Achieved accuracy scores of 52.5-73.0% across TriviaQA, SelfAware, NQ, and TruthfulQA benchmarks
- Significantly reduced the number of input documents while maintaining competitive performance
- Demonstrated effective integration of internal and external knowledge through self-knowledge modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by training the model to distinguish between what it already knows and what needs to be retrieved. Through reinforcement learning, the model learns to generate self-knowledge scores that reflect its confidence in answering questions without external information. This self-knowledge is then used to filter retrieved documents, keeping only the most relevant sentences based on pointwise mutual information with the generated answer. The entropy-weighted advantage function ensures the model learns to accurately assess its knowledge boundaries rather than simply memorizing training examples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-knowledge elicitation**: Why needed - to identify what the model already knows internally; Quick check - model generates consistent self-knowledge scores across similar queries
- **Reinforcement learning with entropy weighting**: Why needed - to encourage exploration of knowledge boundaries; Quick check - entropy remains stable during training while performance improves
- **Pointwise mutual information for relevance**: Why needed - to quantify relevance between retrieved content and generated answers; Quick check - PMI scores correlate with human relevance judgments
- **Sentence-level filtering**: Why needed - to preserve context while removing irrelevant information; Quick check - filtered documents maintain core answer content

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Query -> Self-Knowledge Elicitation -> Retrieved Documents -> PMI-based Filtering -> Filtered Context -> Answer Generation

Critical path: The model first generates self-knowledge scores for the input query, retrieves relevant documents, then applies sentence-level filtering based on PMI scores between sentences and the generated answer using the self-knowledge as guidance.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades computational overhead of self-knowledge generation and filtering for improved accuracy and reduced context length. Sentence-level granularity provides more precise filtering but may miss document-level context compared to document-level approaches.

Failure signatures: The method may fail when self-knowledge scores are inaccurate, leading to over-filtering of relevant content or retention of irrelevant information. Complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning may be particularly challenging as the model must accurately assess its knowledge limitations across multiple knowledge domains.

First experiments: 1) Test self-knowledge elicitation on simple factual queries with known answers; 2) Evaluate document filtering performance on queries with clearly relevant and irrelevant retrieved content; 3) Assess end-to-end performance on a small subset of benchmark questions to validate the complete pipeline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B models, with no assessment of model size scaling effects
- Method's sensitivity to hyperparameters (entropy weight λ = 0.1, threshold τ = 0.05) and initialization seeds not thoroughly explored
- Sentence-level granularity may miss document-level context crucial for complex queries

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The technical implementation of the self-knowledge filtering mechanism and its basic functionality are well-established. The reported accuracy improvements on benchmark datasets are consistent with the proposed methodology.

**Medium Confidence**: The claims about context efficiency improvements and hallucination reduction are supported by the experimental results, but would benefit from more diverse query types and longer-form generation tasks.

**Low Confidence**: The generalization of self-knowledge elicitation across different domains and the robustness of the approach to adversarial or out-of-distribution queries remain unproven.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SKILL-RAG on multi-hop reasoning tasks and long-form generation to test the robustness of self-knowledge filtering beyond simple QA.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the entropy-weighted advantage function versus the PMI-based filtering component.
3. Test the approach on larger model architectures (e.g., Llama2-70B, Qwen3-72B) to assess scalability and whether the performance gains persist with increased model capacity.
