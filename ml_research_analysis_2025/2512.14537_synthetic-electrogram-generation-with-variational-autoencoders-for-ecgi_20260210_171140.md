# Synthetic Electrogram Generation with Variational Autoencoders for ECGI

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.14537
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14537
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: VAEs generate synthetic multichannel EGMs that improve ECGI reconstruction accuracy, with VAE-S achieving higher fidelity than VAE-C for sinus rhythm

## Executive Summary
This work addresses data scarcity in ECGI for atrial fibrillation by generating synthetic multichannel EGMs using VAEs. Two models are proposed: VAE-S for sinus rhythm and VAE-C for both sinus and AF rhythms. Generated EGMs are evaluated for fidelity and used to augment a downstream EGM reconstruction task. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs (LSD: 2.39, Correlation: 0.56), while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation with clear class separation but reduced sinus quality. Augmentation with VAE-generated sinus EGMs improves reconstruction accuracy (baseline correlation 0.160, improved to 0.214), especially with VAE-S. The results demonstrate that VAE-based generative modeling can enhance ECGI pipelines by alleviating data scarcity and improving model generalization.

## Method Summary
The study employs two variational autoencoder architectures to generate synthetic electrograms. VAE-S is trained exclusively on sinus rhythm EGMs, while VAE-C is trained on both sinus and AF rhythms. Both models use 2D reshaping of 3D tensors (time × channels) to capture spatiotemporal patterns. The VAE-C architecture incorporates rhythm labels as auxiliary inputs to enable conditional generation. Generated EGMs are filtered based on reconstruction error and similarity metrics before being used to augment training data for a downstream EGM reconstruction task. Fidelity is assessed through statistical metrics and spectral analysis, while augmentation impact is measured by correlation and RMSE in the reconstruction task.

## Key Results
- VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs (LSD: 2.39, Correlation: 0.56) compared to VAE-C
- VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation with clear class separation but reduced sinus quality
- Augmentation with VAE-generated sinus EGMs improves reconstruction accuracy (baseline correlation 0.160, improved to 0.214)
- Gains were most evident with moderate augmentation (k = 14-18), while larger sets (k = 20-25) plateaued or slightly degraded

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VAEs learn compressed representations of EGM spatiotemporal patterns that capture underlying physiological dynamics. By training on both sinus and AF rhythms, the models learn rhythm-specific latent spaces that enable conditional generation. The reconstruction loss ensures generated EGMs maintain morphological fidelity to real patterns, while the latent regularization prevents overfitting to training data. Augmentation with high-quality synthetic EGMs increases the diversity of training examples, helping downstream models generalize better to unseen patient data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Autoencoders**: Probabilistic encoder-decoder models that learn latent representations through variational inference, needed to generate diverse yet realistic EGMs
- **LS Difference (LSD)**: Metric for comparing signal morphology similarity, critical for assessing EGM generation quality
- **ECGI reconstruction**: Process of recovering intracardiac electrograms from body surface potentials, the target application for augmentation
- **Spatiotemporal EGM patterns**: Time-varying signals across multiple electrode channels that capture cardiac electrical activity
- **Conditional generation**: Using auxiliary information (rhythm labels) to control output characteristics, enabling rhythm-specific EGM synthesis
- **Data augmentation**: Artificially expanding training datasets to improve model generalization, addressing the fundamental data scarcity problem

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: EGM data → VAE-S/VAE-C → Latent space → Generated EGM → Filtering → Augmentation

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing → VAE training → Generation → Filtering → Downstream reconstruction

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- VAE-S prioritizes fidelity over versatility (sinus-only vs dual rhythm)
- 2D reshaping sacrifices explicit spatial relationships between channels
- Reconstruction loss weighting affects balance between diversity and quality
- Filter thresholds trade quantity of generated data against quality

**Failure signatures**:
- Overly smooth generated EGMs lacking fine morphological detail
- Mode collapse producing repetitive patterns
- Poor rhythm separation in latent space
- Excessive filtering eliminating most generated samples

**First experiments**:
1. Compare LSD and correlation metrics between generated and real EGMs
2. Visualize latent space organization by rhythm class
3. Test downstream reconstruction performance with varying augmentation ratios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does VAE-based EGM augmentation transfer to real clinical intracardiac recordings, or are gains specific to simulated data distributions?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "All in-silico EGMs in this study were themselves computational simulations; VAE-generated data therefore inherit simulator-induced biases. As a result, the reported gains should be interpreted as upper-bound estimates, and future work must assess generalizability to real intracardiac recordings."
- **Why unresolved**: No real patient EGM data was used; validation was entirely simulation-based
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluate the augmentation pipeline on paired BSPM-EGM datasets from clinical electrophysiology studies

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can more expressive generative architectures (e.g., diffusion models) improve fidelity for complex AF spatiotemporal patterns compared to VAEs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "Incorporating spatial context, or exploring more expressive generative architectures with larger dataset (e.g., diffusion models) could further strengthen the realism and utility of VAE-generated EGMs."
- **Why unresolved**: VAEs produced smoother, less detailed AF reconstructions; diffusion models were not tested
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Train diffusion models on the same data and compare spectral, morphological, and downstream reconstruction metrics against VAE-C

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does incorporating explicit spatial relationships between electrodes improve multichannel EGM generation quality?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The 2D input reshaping (time × channels) treats channels independently without modeling spatial adjacency; authors note "complex spatiotemporal patterns challenge latent-variable models."
- **Why unresolved**: Current architecture lacks spatial inductive biases; channel ordering is arbitrary in the tensor representation
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Compare current architecture against graph-convolutional or spatially-aware VAE variants on inter-channel coherence metrics

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: What is the optimal augmentation ratio and filtering threshold for synthetic EGMs in downstream ECGI tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] "Gains were most evident with moderate augmentation (k = 14-18), while larger sets (k = 20-25) plateaued or slightly degraded"; the 25/200 selection ratio and RMSE threshold were empirically determined without systematic ablation
- **Why unresolved**: The trade-off between diversity and quality in augmentation remains poorly characterized
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic ablation across generation quantities, filtering thresholds, and selection criteria measuring downstream correlation and RMSE

## Limitations
- Validation framework relies entirely on in silico EGM data, limiting clinical generalizability
- Modest improvements in downstream reconstruction (correlation improvement from 0.160 to 0.214) raise questions about clinical significance
- VAE-C shows clear rhythm separation but reduced quality for sinus rhythm, indicating potential architectural compromises

## Confidence
- **Clinical translation**: Medium - Simulation-based validation may not reflect real-world performance
- **Methodological soundness**: High - Well-designed experiments with appropriate controls
- **Result significance**: Medium - Statistically significant but modest effect sizes
- **Generalizability**: Medium - Results specific to the tested simulation framework

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate synthetic EGM generation on real patient EGM recordings to assess clinical fidelity and compare performance against in silico validation
2. Conduct ablation studies on VAE architecture parameters (latent dimension, reconstruction loss weighting) to optimize the balance between rhythm specificity and generation quality
3. Test the augmented EGM reconstruction pipeline across multiple patient cohorts with varying atrial anatomies and AF patterns to verify generalizability
