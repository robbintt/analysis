# A Unifying Framework for Parallelizing Sequential Models with Linear Dynamical Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21716
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21716
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations can all be understood as iterative evaluations of linear dynamical systems, providing a unified framework for parallelizing sequential models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unifying framework for parallelizing sequential models using linear dynamical systems (LDSs). The authors show that Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations—common fixed-point methods—can all be understood as iterative evaluations of LDSs, where each iteration involves linearizing the nonlinear recursion and applying a parallel scan. The key insight is that different fixed-point methods correspond to different approximations of the Jacobian of the dynamics function, ranging from the full Jacobian (Newton) to the identity matrix (Picard) to zero (Jacobi). This unifying view clarifies when particular methods are most effective based on the structure of the problem's Jacobian.

## Method Summary
The framework establishes that all these methods are guaranteed to converge in at most T iterations, where T is the sequence length, and provides theoretical foundation for parallelizing sequential models in machine learning. Through three case studies—group word problem, recurrent neural networks, and Langevin dynamics—the authors demonstrate how the framework guides method selection. The experiments show that Newton iterations excel when Jacobians are complex, Picard iterations work well when Jacobians are close to identity (e.g., small-step diffusion), and quasi-Newton methods provide a middle ground.

## Key Results
- Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations can all be understood as iterative evaluations of linear dynamical systems
- Different fixed-point methods correspond to different approximations of the Jacobian of the dynamics function
- Newton iterations excel when Jacobians are complex, Picard iterations work well when Jacobians are close to identity, and quasi-Newton methods provide a middle ground
- All methods are guaranteed to converge in at most T iterations, where T is the sequence length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that fixed-point iterations can be viewed as successive linearizations of nonlinear recursions, which can then be solved in parallel using linear dynamical systems. Each iteration involves computing a Jacobian approximation and applying a parallel scan operation. The convergence properties follow from the structure of these linearizations and the contraction properties of the underlying dynamical system.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear Dynamical Systems**: Models that describe the evolution of a system over time using linear equations; needed to understand the parallel computation framework
- **Jacobian Approximation**: Different fixed-point methods use different approximations of the Jacobian matrix; needed to understand why different methods work in different scenarios
- **Parallel Scan Operations**: Efficient parallel algorithms for prefix sums and similar computations; needed to understand how the sequential models can be parallelized
- **Contraction Properties**: Mathematical properties that guarantee convergence of iterative methods; needed to understand the theoretical guarantees of the framework
- **Fixed-Point Methods**: Iterative techniques for solving equations by finding points where the function maps to itself; needed as the foundation for the parallelization approach

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Sequential model recursion -> Jacobian linearization -> LDS formulation -> Parallel scan -> Fixed-point solution

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves computing the Jacobian approximation, forming the linear dynamical system, and applying the parallel scan operation to obtain the solution in each iteration.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades off computational complexity (full Newton vs. simpler approximations) against convergence speed and parallel efficiency. More accurate Jacobian approximations lead to faster convergence but higher per-iteration cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Methods fail when Jacobian approximations are poor (leading to divergence) or when the underlying linear dynamical system is ill-conditioned (leading to numerical instability).

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply the framework to a simple autoregressive model to verify basic functionality
2. Compare Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations on a controlled test case with known Jacobian structure
3. Measure actual parallel speedup versus theoretical iteration bounds on a multi-core system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes fixed-point methods operate on well-behaved nonlinear recursions where Jacobian approximations can be meaningfully categorized
- Convergence guarantees of at most T iterations depend on specific problem structures that may not generalize across all sequential model types
- Experimental validation is confined to three case studies and may not capture the full spectrum of practical scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The unifying framework for parallelizing sequential models through linear dynamical systems provides a coherent theoretical foundation
- **Medium confidence:** The assertion about when each method excels based on Jacobian structure has empirical support but limited generalizability across diverse model classes

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional sequential model types beyond RNNs and Langevin dynamics to assess generalizability
2. Systematically vary Jacobian structures in controlled experiments to validate the theoretical predictions about method performance
3. Measure actual parallel speedup versus theoretical iteration bounds to bridge the gap between convergence theory and practical implementation
