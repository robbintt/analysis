# The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06559
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06559
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: A neuro-symbolic architecture (Savassan) demonstrates that compositional typing of meaning enables explainable, compliance-aware legal reasoning by mapping natural language to typed logical forms and projecting them into multi-jurisdiction ontologies.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that the brittleness and opacity of current AI systems in compliance and legal reasoning stem from missing type-theoretic semantics, not data or scale limitations. It proposes treating meaning as a formal algebra using Montague's framework, where hallucinations and errors arise from type mismatches rather than statistical noise. The core contribution is Savassan, a neuro-symbolic system that compiles natural language into typed logical forms, validates them against layered ontologies, and projects them into jurisdiction-specific legal frameworks. This approach enables explainable, multi-jurisdiction compliance decisions without independent classifiers for each legal domain.

## Method Summary
The method centers on Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that treats natural language inputs as candidates for Montague-style typed logical forms. Neural components extract candidate structures from unstructured inputs, which are then validated by symbolic type-checkers against layered ontologies (Entity, Event, Property, Relation plus domain extensions). For cross-border legal scenarios, the system parses once into a neutral logical form and projects it into multiple jurisdiction-specific ontologies (KR defamation, JP disparagement, US protected opinion, EU GDPR), composing outcomes via typed operators into a unified, explainable decision. The architecture embeds typed interfaces throughout the pipeline, constraining neural discovery with top-down type systems.

## Key Results
- Hallucinations, brittle moderation, and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations.
- Cross-border compliance can be achieved via single-parse projection into multiple jurisdiction-specific ontologies, avoiding independent classifiers.
- Neuro-symbolic separation with typed interfaces enables constrained learning and provable downstream guarantees for legal reasoning.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hallucination in language models arises from missing type-theoretic semantics, not data or scale limitations.
- Mechanism: Inputs are compiled into Montague-style typed logical forms, making explicit whether an utterance is descriptive, normative, or legal. Type mismatches surface as detectable errors rather than silent hallucinations.
- Core assumption: Meaning can be captured compositionally via typed lambda calculus; hallucinations correlate with type-level violations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] argues hallucinations are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics; [PAGE 2] questions whether hallucination is an inherent feature of intelligence without ontology; corpus evidence is weak with neighbor papers focusing on legal retrieval, not type-theoretic anti-hallucination.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-jurisdiction compliance can be achieved via single-parse projection rather than independent classifiers.
- Mechanism: An input is parsed once into a neutral logical form (e.g., defect_claim(product_x, company_y)), then projected into multiple jurisdiction-specific ontologies and composed via typed operators into a unified decision.
- Core assumption: A shared intermediate representation exists that can be meaningfully projected into heterogeneous legal ontologies.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] describes parsing once and projecting into multiple legal ontologies; [PAGE 3] provides cross-border content compliance example; corpus evidence is limited with neighbor papers addressing specific jurisdictions but not cross-jurisdictional composition.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neuro-symbolic separation with typed interfaces enables constrained learning and provable downstream guarantees.
- Mechanism: Neural components extract candidate structures; symbolic components type-check and validate against layered ontologies. Only type-conforming structures propagate.
- Core assumption: Neural extraction is sufficiently accurate that symbolic validation does not become a bottleneck.
- Evidence anchors: [PAGE 3] describes bottom-up learning cycle constrained by top-down types; cites Feldstein et al. (2024) and Lu et al. (2024) as neuro-symbolic precedents; no direct replication data provided.

## Foundational Learning

- **Montague Grammar and Typed Lambda Calculus**
  - Why needed here: The entire architecture assumes meaning can be represented as compositional, typed expressions. Without this, the "parse once" strategy and type-based alignment cannot be implemented.
  - Quick check question: Can you sketch the difference between λP.∀x[P(x)] and ∃x[P(x)] in terms of type signatures and truth conditions?

- **Neuro-Symbolic Architectures**
  - Why needed here: Savassan explicitly separates neural pattern extraction from symbolic reasoning; understanding the division of labor is essential for debugging and extending the system.
  - Quick check question: What failure modes arise if the symbolic component is too permissive versus too restrictive?

- **Deontic Logic and Legal Ontologies**
  - Why needed here: The system extends typed ontologies with deontic operators (obligation, permission, prohibition) and jurisdictional context. Misunderstanding these leads to incorrect compliance outputs.
  - Quick check question: How does a deontic "obligation" differ in logical treatment from a descriptive "fact"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw input -> Neural preprocessor (transformer encoder, fine-tuned for semantic anomaly detection) -> Candidate structure extraction -> Symbolic type checker -> Conformance validation against layered ontologies -> Ontology projection module -> Maps parsed logical forms to jurisdiction-specific ontologies -> Composition engine -> Combines multi-jurisdiction outputs via typed operators (⊗) -> RL path reasoner -> Traverses legal knowledge graph for semantically valid paths

- Critical path: 1. Raw input → neural extraction of candidate logical form 2. Type checking against domain ontology 3. If valid, project to relevant jurisdictional ontologies 4. Compose results into unified guidance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Symbolic rigidity vs. neural flexibility: tighter type constraints improve explainability but may reject valid edge cases.
  - Ontology coverage vs. maintenance cost: more jurisdictions increase value but require ongoing legal updates.
  - Single-parse efficiency vs. projection fidelity: shared representation reduces compute but may miss jurisdiction-specific nuance.

- Failure signatures:
  - High rejection rate at type-check stage (neural extractor mismatch)
  - Incoherent or contradictory multi-jurisdiction outputs (projection or composition error)
  - Missing ontology coverage for novel input types (domain gap)
  - Explainability breakdown when composition operator masks jurisdictional conflicts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate type-checking pipeline: Input a set of labeled sentences with known semantic types; measure precision/recall of type assignment and rejection rate.
  2. Cross-jurisdiction projection test: Use synthetic multi-jurisdiction scenarios (e.g., defamation claim across KR/JP/US/EU); verify that projection and composition produce expected, explainable outputs.
  3. Ontology extension exercise: Add a new domain-specific type (e.g., "financial_disclosure") and confirm end-to-end propagation without pipeline modification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the Savassan architecture empirically reduce hallucinations and improve compliance accuracy compared to standard large language models on legal reasoning benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic multi-jurisdiction suites" but provide no results, leaving the system's efficacy as a hypothesis.
- Why unresolved: The paper is a position and design paper; the proposed neuro-symbolic implementation has not yet been tested against the described benchmarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative results from the proposed benchmarks showing performance differentials between Savassan and baseline LLMs in detecting "type errors" (hallucinations).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the system handle the "semantic gap" when the neural component fails to extract a valid Montague-style logical form from ambiguous or syntactically complex natural language?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims neural components "extract candidate structures" which are then type-checked, but does not address failure modes where the neural extractor cannot map utterances to the required typed lambda calculus.
- Why unresolved: If the initial "parsing" from natural language to logical form fails, the symbolic type checking cannot function; the paper does not specify recovery mechanisms or fallback behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of extraction failure rates on noisy, real-world data and a description of the system's behavior when logical forms cannot be generated.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the formal semantics for the composition operator ($\otimes$) used to resolve conflicts between contradictory cross-jurisdictional legal obligations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper lists a "Compose" step to produce a single decision but does not define the logic for reconciling mutually exclusive outputs.
- Why unresolved: A unified algebra of meaning requires a defined precedence or conflict-resolution logic to function in production, which is absent from the current architectural description.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal specification of the composition logic and case studies demonstrating how the system resolves "hard" legal conflicts without defaulting to binary censorship.

## Limitations
- Type-theoretic model scope: No empirical validation that typed compilation reduces hallucination rates versus untyped baselines.
- Cross-jurisdiction projection fidelity: Single-parse projection strategy lacks evidence that intermediate logical form retains all necessary jurisdiction-specific nuance.
- Neuro-symbolic balance: No data on rejection rates or downstream coverage loss, making it unclear whether architecture can operate at production scale without manual intervention.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core premise that meaning can be formally typed (Montague grammar, typed lambda calculus) is well-established in theoretical linguistics and computer science.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that hallucination is a type error rather than a data/scale issue is plausible but untested. The neuro-symbolic separation is sound in principle but lacks empirical validation in this context.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that single-parse projection works reliably across arbitrary jurisdictions is highly speculative without proof-of-concept results or error analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Hallucination reduction test**: Run a controlled experiment comparing hallucination rates (e.g., factuality, consistency) between a baseline LLM and the same model with Savassan's type-checking pipeline on a shared benchmark (e.g., TruthfulQA, HellaSwag).

2. **Cross-jurisdiction projection fidelity**: Create a synthetic dataset of legal scenarios with known multi-jurisdiction outcomes. Measure precision/recall of Savassan's projection and composition versus ground truth, and analyze error modes.

3. **Neuro-symbolic throughput and coverage**: Instrument the pipeline to log rejection rates at each symbolic stage. Evaluate whether high-recall neural extraction can sustain production throughput when constrained by type-checking.
