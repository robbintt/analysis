# Hybrid Cross-domain Robust Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23003

- Primary result: HYDRO achieves up to 36% improvement in robust performance compared to RFQI while requiring only 10% of the target data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HYDRO, a novel method that improves sample efficiency for offline robust reinforcement learning by combining limited offline target data with online source environment data. The approach addresses dynamics mismatch between source and target domains through a priority sampling scheme that selects reliable and relevant source samples, and an uncertainty filtering mechanism that removes unreliable samples. HYDRO is evaluated across three MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper) under various parameter perturbations, demonstrating consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
HYDRO addresses the challenge of robust RL when target domain data is scarce by leveraging abundant data from a source environment with similar but not identical dynamics. The method employs a dual-component approach: priority sampling to identify source samples that are both reliable (low epistemic uncertainty) and relevant (similar to target domain dynamics), and uncertainty filtering to remove samples that could introduce harmful bias. The algorithm combines these filtered source samples with target data to train a robust policy that performs well across the full range of possible dynamics parameters. The framework is designed to be model-free and compatible with existing offline RL algorithms like RFQI.

## Key Results
- HYDRO achieves up to 36% improvement in robust performance compared to RFQI baseline
- The method requires only 10% of the target data compared to RFQI while maintaining or improving performance
- Consistent improvements observed across all three tested MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper) under various parameter perturbations
- Ablation study confirms both priority sampling and uncertainty filtering components contribute to performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HYDRO works by intelligently combining data from two domains to overcome the limitations of each. The source environment provides abundant data but with dynamics that don't perfectly match the target, while the target environment has limited data but represents the true task. The priority sampling mechanism identifies source samples that are most likely to be useful by considering both their reliability (low model uncertainty) and relevance (similar to target dynamics). The uncertainty filtering then removes samples that could introduce harmful bias due to significant domain shift. This combined approach allows HYDRO to learn a robust policy that generalizes well to the target domain while leveraging the sample efficiency benefits of offline RL.

## Foundational Learning

**Offline Reinforcement Learning**
Why needed: Provides the foundation for learning from pre-collected data without environment interaction
Quick check: Can the method learn a policy using only pre-collected datasets without online fine-tuning?

**Robust Reinforcement Learning**
Why needed: Enables policies that perform well across varying dynamics parameters and uncertain environments
Quick check: Does the policy maintain performance across the full range of possible dynamics parameters?

**Domain Adaptation**
Why needed: Allows transfer of knowledge between related but different environments
Quick check: Can the method effectively bridge the gap between source and target domain distributions?

**Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation**
Why needed: Helps identify reliable samples and quantify model confidence in predictions
Quick check: Does the uncertainty estimation accurately reflect the reliability of source samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Buffer -> Priority Sampling -> Uncertainty Filtering -> Robust Policy Training

**Critical Path**
1. Collect offline data from source and target environments
2. Apply priority sampling to identify reliable and relevant source samples
3. Filter samples using uncertainty estimation to remove unreliable data
4. Combine filtered source data with target data for policy training
5. Evaluate policy robustness across parameter perturbations

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Balancing data quantity from source vs. quality alignment with target
- Computational overhead of uncertainty estimation vs. performance gains
- Complexity of priority sampling mechanism vs. implementation simplicity
- Trade-off between robustness and task-specific optimization

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when source and target domains are too dissimilar
- Degradation when target data is extremely limited or unrepresentative
- Suboptimal results if uncertainty estimation is inaccurate
- Computational bottlenecks during priority sampling on large datasets

**First Experiments**
1. Test HYDRO on a simple two-domain environment with known dynamics shift
2. Evaluate performance sensitivity to different ratios of source to target data
3. Compare HYDRO against baselines when source data quality varies systematically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to MuJoCo benchmarks with parameter perturbations, may not generalize to more complex real-world scenarios
- Assumes source and target domains are "roughly aligned," which may not hold in many practical applications
- Does not extensively explore sensitivity to source data quality and quantity variations
- Focus on parameter perturbations rather than more drastic dynamics shifts or high-dimensional observation spaces

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Claims about HYDRO's architecture and algorithmic components (priority sampling, uncertainty filtering)
**Medium confidence**: Claims about sample efficiency improvements relative to baselines (RFQI, MOReL, etc.)
**Medium confidence**: Claims about the ablation study validating individual components
**Low confidence**: Claims about generalization to real-world deployment scenarios beyond the tested MuJoCo environments

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate HYDRO on more diverse environments including image-based observations and non-MuJoCo domains to test generalization beyond the current benchmark suite.
2. Test the method's performance when source and target domains have significant structural differences or when source data quality varies substantially.
3. Conduct a systematic analysis of how HYDRO's performance scales with different ratios of source to target data, including scenarios with minimal target data availability.
