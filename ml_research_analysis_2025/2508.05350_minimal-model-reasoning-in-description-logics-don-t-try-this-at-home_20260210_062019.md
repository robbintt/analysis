# Minimal Model Reasoning in Description Logics: Don't Try This at Home!

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.05350
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05350
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable for $\mathcal{EL}$, but becomes decidable under strong/weak acyclicity constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the complexity of reasoning with minimal models in Description Logics (DLs). The authors prove that concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable for the lightweight DL $\mathcal{EL}$, even when restricted to very limited forms of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain decidability, they introduce strong and weak acyclicity conditions on TBoxes, which allow them to establish tight complexity bounds: NExpNP-completeness for weakly acyclic $\mathcal{ELIO}_\bot$, and $\Sigma^P_2$-completeness in data complexity. They also prove that even in the DL-Lite family, minimal model reasoning is already ExpSpace-hard for DL-Lite horn. The key technique involves using flooding to simulate universal quantification required for minimization.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes undecidability through a reduction from the Rectangular Tiling Problem, using a "flooding" technique where cyclic dependencies force a minimal model to enforce a grid structure. For decidable fragments, they introduce strong and weak acyclicity constraints on the TBox dependency graph, linking weak acyclicity to pointwise circumscription and proving a small model property that enables guess-and-check algorithms with exponential complexity.

## Key Results
- Concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable for $\mathcal{EL}$ (Theorem 1)
- Under UNA, the problem becomes P-complete in $\mathcal{EL}$ (Theorem 8)
- NExpNP-completeness for weakly acyclic $\mathcal{ELIO}_\bot$ (Theorem 5)
- ExpSpace-hardness for DL-Lite horn (Theorem 6)
- Small model property: any satisfiable concept has a witness model of size $|NI(K)| \times (|T| \times 2^{|T|})^{|T|}$

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Concept satisfiability becomes undecidable in $\mathcal{EL}$ under minimal model semantics because cyclic TBox axioms can simulate the Rectangular Tiling Problem.
- **Mechanism:** The authors construct a reduction where a minimal model must enforce a grid structure. By utilizing cyclic dependencies in the TBox, the system forces a "flooding" effect: if a local error (like an invalid tiling) exists, a "Flood" concept propagates globally. Minimality requires the absence of this flood, implicitly verifying the tiling conditions.
- **Core assumption:** The construction assumes the Unique Name Assumption (UNA); without it, Theorem 8 suggests the problem becomes decidable (P-complete).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3]: Explicitly details the reduction from RECT TILE and the "flooding technique."
  - [abstract]: States the "surprising result" of undecidability in $\mathcal{EL}$.
  - [corpus]: Evidence is weak; neighbor papers focus on cost-based semantics or standpoints, not $\mathcal{EL}$ undecidability.
- **Break condition:** Decidability fails if the TBox allows arbitrary cycles that can encode geometric constraints like tiling.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Imposing strong or weak acyclicity constraints on the TBox dependency graph breaks the reduction mechanism, restoring decidability and limiting complexity to NExp.
- **Mechanism:** Acyclicity prevents the "flooding" loops by ensuring the dependency graph ($DG(T)$) contains no cycles involving "star-edges" (existential restrictions). This allows the reduction of minimal model reasoning to pointwise circumscription, where minimization is checked locally rather than globally, bounding the search space.
- **Core assumption:** The TBox must be transformed into a normalized form (modal depth $\leq 1$) which preserves minimal models under these specific acyclicity conditions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1]: Defines strong acyclicity and links it to pointwise circumscription.
  - [section 4.2]: Defines weak acyclicity using star-edges in the dependency graph.
  - [corpus]: [paper 73037] discusses non-monotonic S4F logic, showing a parallel where modal/non-monotonic restrictions alter decidability, but does not reference acyclicity.
- **Break condition:** If the TBox is cyclic, the link to pointwise circumscription breaks, and the complexity likely reverts to undecidable.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The complexity of reasoning in weakly acyclic $\mathcal{ELIO}_\bot$ is bounded by the "small model property," enabling a guess-and-check algorithm.
- **Mechanism:** Lemma 1 proves that any satisfiable concept has a witness model whose domain size is single-exponential. This bound exists because weak acyclicity limits how far existential restrictions can generate new elements before the "type" of the element becomes empty.
- **Core assumption:** The upper bound assumes an NP oracle is available for verifying the non-existence of smaller models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2]: Lemma 1 establishes the domain size bound $|NI(K)| \times (|T| \times 2^{|T|})^{|T|}$.
  - [abstract]: Mentions complexity is brought "below double exponential time."
- **Break condition:** If the dependency graph contains cycles through star-edges, the active domain is not polynomially or singly-exponentially bounded, and the small model property fails.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Minimal Models & Circumscription**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper redefines standard DL reasoning by requiring models to have minimal extensions for *all* predicates. Without understanding this "pure" minimization (vs. standard circumscription which allows varying predicates), the undecidability results are unintuitive.
  - **Quick check question:** How does "pure" minimal model reasoning differ from classical open-world semantics in terms of justifying facts?

- **Concept:** **Dependency Graphs & Acyclicity**
  - **Why needed here:** The distinction between decidability and undecidability hinges entirely on the structure of the TBox dependency graph. Understanding "star-edges" (edges derived from existential restrictions) is critical for implementing the safety checks.
  - **Quick check question:** In the dependency graph $DG(T)$, what specific type of edge characterizes an existential restriction ($\exists r.C$) on the right-hand side of an axiom?

- **Concept:** **The Tiling Problem**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the canonical undecidable problem used to prove the hardness of minimal model reasoning. The "flooding" mechanism is essentially a simulation of a tiling grid.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the tiling problem useful for proving undecidability in logics with cyclic dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Parse TBox -> Build Dependency Graph ($DG(T)$) -> Check Acyclicity -> Execute Small Model Guessing algorithm
- **Critical path:**
  1. Parse TBox into a Dependency Graph ($DG(T)$).
  2. Check for **Strong/Weak Acyclicity** (Safety Check).
  3. If cyclic -> **Halt/Undecidable warning** (based on Theorem 1).
  4. If acyclic -> Execute **Small Model Guessing** algorithm (Theorem 5).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Expressiveness vs. Tractability:** The paper proves you cannot have both arbitrary TBox cycles and decidable minimal model reasoning in $\mathcal{EL}$. You must restrict the TBox to acyclic forms.
  - **Global vs. Pointwise:** Using pointwise circumscription (Section 4.1) offers a decidable approximation but coincides with global minimal models only under strong acyclicity.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Infinite Loops/Non-termination:** Occurs if the solver attempts general $\mathcal{EL}$ reasoning without acyclicity checks, triggering the tiling simulation.
  - **UNA Violations:** If the system does not enforce the Unique Name Assumption, the undecidability proofs (Mechanism 1) do not hold (Theorem 8), potentially leading to incorrect hardness classifications.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Acyclicity Validator:** Implement a script to parse $\mathcal{EL}$ axioms, build $DG(T)$, and flag cycles containing star-edges (Definition in Section 4.2).
  2. **Flooding Simulation:** Manually run the ABox/TBox construction from Example 3 (CERT3COL reduction) to observe how a minimal model handles the "Flood" concept.
  3. **Small Model Benchmark:** Generate weakly acyclic KBs and verify if the size of the minimal model respects the bound established in Lemma 1.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Is concept satisfiability in minimal models decidable for DL-Lite_bool, and what is its worst-case complexity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "We hope that this variant and even more expressive extensions like DL-Lite_bool may be decidable, and plan to look for tight matching complexity bounds."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes results for DL-Lite_core (positive) and DL-Lite_horn (hard), but leaves the decidability and complexity of DL-Lite_bool as an open, intriguing avenue.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proof of decidability (or undecidability) and a complexity classification for MINMODSAT in DL-Lite_bool.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the worst-case complexity of concept satisfiability in minimal models for DL-Lite_horn ExpSpace-complete?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors prove ExpSpace-hardness for DL-Lite_horn and note, "We believe that this bound... is likely to be tight, but leave the question for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** While the lower bound is established, the paper does not provide the matching upper bound required to confirm ExpSpace-completeness.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm operating in ExpSpace that decides the problem for DL-Lite_horn.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can acyclicity conditions and pointwise minimization be applied to regain decidability for minimal model reasoning in the setting of Tuple-Generating Dependencies (TGDs)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "It remains to be explored whether acyclicity conditions and pointwise minimization might also be useful in the richer setting of TGDs."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes undecidability for a fragment of guarded TGDs and decidability via acyclicity for DLs, but does not formally extend the acyclicity/pointwise methods to the more general TGD framework.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proof demonstrating that weak or strong acyclicity implies decidability for minimal model reasoning over guarded or general TGDs.

## Limitations

- The undecidability proof relies heavily on the Unique Name Assumption (UNA), which is a significant limitation if the system must handle scenarios where UNA is not enforced.
- The complexity bounds for weakly acyclic fragments rely on the small model property, but the paper does not provide an explicit algorithm or pseudocode for implementing the guess-and-check procedure, making practical implementation non-trivial.
- The complete construction of the KB that encodes the reduction from the Rectangular Tiling Problem is complex and not fully detailed in the paper, making it challenging to verify the reduction independently.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The undecidability result for general $\mathcal{EL}$ (Theorem 1) is well-established through the reduction from the known undecidable Rectangular Tiling Problem.
- **Medium Confidence:** The NExpNP-completeness result for weakly acyclic $\mathcal{ELIO}_\bot$ (Theorem 5) is supported by the small model property (Lemma 1), but the exact implementation of the guess-and-check algorithm is not provided.
- **Low Confidence:** The complexity result for DL-Lite horn (ExpSpace-hardness) is stated but not deeply analyzed in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Acyclicity Checker Implementation:** Implement a script to parse $\mathcal{EL}$ axioms, build the dependency graph $DG(T)$, and flag cycles containing star-edges (Definition in Section 4.2).
2. **Flooding Simulation:** Manually construct the KB from Example 3 (CERT3COL reduction) to observe how the "Flood" concept propagates in a minimal model.
3. **Small Model Benchmark:** Generate weakly acyclic KBs and empirically verify if the size of the minimal model respects the bound established in Lemma 1 ($|NI(K)| \times (|T| \times 2^{|T|})^{|T|}$).
