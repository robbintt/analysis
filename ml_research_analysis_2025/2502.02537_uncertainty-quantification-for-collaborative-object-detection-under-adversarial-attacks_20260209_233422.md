# Uncertainty Quantification for Collaborative Object Detection Under Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.02537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02537
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: TUQCP improves object detection accuracy by 80.41% under adversarial attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of collaborative object detection (COD) systems to adversarial attacks in autonomous driving scenarios. The authors propose TUQCP, a framework that combines adversarial training with uncertainty quantification to enhance COD resilience. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in detection accuracy under attack conditions while providing more reliable uncertainty estimates. The approach is evaluated on a custom V2X-Sim dataset, showing substantial performance gains over baseline models.

## Method Summary
The TUQCP framework integrates adversarial training with uncertainty quantification through a learning-based component and conformal prediction calibration. The system processes collaborative detection data while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations. The framework leverages adversarial training to improve model resilience and employs uncertainty quantification to provide reliable detection confidence estimates. The calibration component ensures that estimated uncertainties are properly calibrated using conformal prediction techniques.

## Key Results
- 80.41% improvement in object detection accuracy compared to baseline models under adversarial attacks
- Effective mitigation of adversarial perturbation impacts on collaborative object detection
- Enhanced reliability of detection results through improved uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from combining adversarial training with uncertainty quantification, which addresses both the robustness and reliability aspects of collaborative object detection. The learning-based uncertainty quantification component provides adaptive uncertainty estimates, while conformal prediction ensures these estimates are properly calibrated. This dual approach helps maintain detection accuracy even when facing adversarial attacks that would typically degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Adversarial training: Essential for improving model robustness against malicious attacks; quick check: evaluate model performance under various attack strengths
- Conformal prediction: Needed for reliable uncertainty calibration; quick check: verify calibration across different detection scenarios
- Collaborative object detection: Critical for multi-sensor fusion in autonomous driving; quick check: assess performance with varying numbers of input sources
- Learning-based uncertainty quantification: Enables adaptive uncertainty estimation; quick check: compare uncertainty estimates with ground truth uncertainty

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Sensor data -> Feature extraction -> Collaborative fusion -> Adversarial training -> Uncertainty quantification -> Conformal calibration -> Final detection output

Critical path: Data input flows through feature extraction, collaborative fusion, and adversarial training, then undergoes uncertainty quantification and conformal calibration before producing final detections.

Design tradeoffs: Balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, with uncertainty quantification adding overhead but improving reliability.

Failure signatures: Degradation in detection accuracy under strong adversarial attacks, miscalibration of uncertainty estimates, or breakdown of collaborative fusion under sensor noise.

First experiments: 1) Test detection accuracy with varying attack strengths, 2) Evaluate uncertainty calibration under normal conditions, 3) Assess collaborative fusion performance with different sensor configurations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited reproducibility due to custom V2X-Sim dataset and lack of detailed architectural specifications
- Focus primarily on white-box attacks, potentially missing more sophisticated real-world attack patterns
- Unclear calibration methodology sensitivity to hyperparameters and robustness across diverse driving conditions

## Confidence
- High confidence in conceptual framework and theoretical soundness
- Medium confidence in reported performance improvements due to limited reproducibility details
- Low confidence in framework's generalizability to real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Independent reproduction of results using the same V2X-Sim dataset and attack methodologies
2. Evaluation of TUQCP's performance under black-box attacks and more sophisticated adversarial strategies
3. Real-world testing on actual vehicle sensor data to assess practical deployment viability and computational overhead
