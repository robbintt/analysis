# ABE: A Unified Framework for Robust and Faithful Attribution-Based Explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06258
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06258
- Authors: Zhiyu Zhu; Jiayu Zhang; Zhibo Jin; Fang Chen; Jianlong Zhou
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents ABE, a unified framework for robust and faithful attribution-based explainability in deep learning models

## Executive Summary
ABE is a unified framework that addresses limitations in existing interpretability tools by integrating 17 attribution methods with a robustness module, enabling principled evaluation and selection of explanations under a common interface. The framework introduces Fundamental Attribution Methods that abstract attribution axioms into a gradient-based formulation, allowing flexible incorporation of custom update strategies while preserving theoretical guarantees. ABE's robustness module integrates white-box and black-box adversarial attacks to enhance explanation stability across multimodal tasks including image classification, text classification, and object detection.

## Method Summary
The ABE framework provides a modular architecture with four customizable modules: Robustness, Interpretability, Validation, and Data & Model. The core innovation is the Fundamental Attribution Methods formulation, which transforms attribution axioms into a gradient-based optimization problem. This allows various attribution methods to be unified under a common interface while maintaining their individual theoretical properties. The framework employs an iterative gradient update mechanism that can incorporate different custom update strategies, enabling methods like ISA and AttEXplore to achieve high insertion scores and low deletion scores. The robustness module enhances explanation stability by integrating adversarial attacks, while the validation module ensures faithfulness through quantitative metrics.

## Key Results
- ABE successfully integrates 17 attribution methods under a unified framework with a common interface
- Methods like ISA and AttEXplare achieve higher insertion scores and lower deletion scores compared to baseline methods
- The framework demonstrates strong computational efficiency while maintaining theoretical guarantees for attribution axioms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ABE works by abstracting attribution axioms into a gradient-based optimization framework that can accommodate diverse attribution methods while preserving their theoretical properties. The Fundamental Attribution Methods formulation allows different update strategies to be plugged in, enabling both traditional and adversarial-based methods to be evaluated under the same metrics. The robustness module enhances explanation stability by systematically applying adversarial perturbations, while the modular design allows for flexible incorporation of new methods and validation strategies.

## Foundational Learning
- Attribution axioms: Fundamental properties that attribution methods should satisfy (e.g., sensitivity, implementation invariance) - needed to ensure explanations are theoretically sound and meaningful
- Quick check: Can verify that implemented methods satisfy these axioms through mathematical proofs or empirical validation
- Adversarial attacks: Techniques to test explanation robustness by perturbing inputs - needed to ensure explanations remain stable under real-world variations
- Quick check: Can evaluate robustness by measuring explanation changes under different attack strengths
- Insertion/Deletion metrics: Quantitative measures for evaluating explanation quality - needed to provide objective benchmarks for method comparison
- Quick check: Can validate these metrics by testing on datasets with known ground truth importance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Robustness Module -> Interpretability Module -> Validation Module -> Data & Model Module

### Critical Path
The critical path follows: Data & Model input -> Interpretability computation -> Validation metrics calculation -> Robustness evaluation, with Fundamental Attribution Methods serving as the core computation engine connecting all components.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework trades computational overhead for unified evaluation and enhanced robustness. The iterative nature of Fundamental Attribution Methods provides flexibility but may impact efficiency for very large models.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor attribution quality when axioms are violated in custom update strategies
- Computational bottlenecks when scaling to extremely large models
- Suboptimal robustness when attack strategies don't match real-world perturbations

### First 3 Experiments
1. Benchmark 17 attribution methods on standard image classification datasets using insertion/deletion metrics
2. Test robustness against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks
3. Evaluate framework performance on multimodal tasks (text and image classification)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Fundamental Attribution Methods formulation be theoretically extended to guarantee global completeness for adversarial path methods (e.g., AGI, ISA) that currently only satisfy the property locally?
- Basis in paper: Table II and Section III-B0h note that methods like AGI, LA, and ISA only satisfy the "Complete" property "locally, rather than globally," despite the framework's goal of ensuring axiom compliance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proves the Fundamental Attribution Methods generally satisfy completeness (Eq. 10), the specific update strategies used by adversarial methods inherently restrict this satisfaction to local regions, creating a theoretical gap for these high-performing algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or modified update algorithm that allows adversarial-based attribution paths to sum exactly to the output difference $f(x) - f(x')$ globally, rather than relying on local approximations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational overhead of ABE's iterative Fundamental Attribution Methods scale when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) or diffusion models?
- Basis in paper: The abstract cites "scalability limitations" in existing frameworks, and the conclusion envisions application to "complex models." However, experiments are limited to architectures like ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16.
- Why unresolved: The framework relies on iterative gradient updates (Algorithm 1), which may become prohibitively expensive for models with billions of parameters, limiting ABE's utility for state-of-the-art foundation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing the Framework's throughput (FPS/IPS) and memory usage when applied to models significantly larger than ViT-B/16 (e.g., LLaMA or Stable Diffusion).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the optimization of proxy metrics like Insertion/Deletion scores via ABE's robustness modules correlate with improved human trust in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis?
- Basis in paper: The Introduction explicitly identifies "medical diagnosis and financial decision-making" as high-risk scenarios hindered by lack of transparency, yet the validation relies solely on quantitative computational metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that ABE improves algorithmic metrics (e.g., higher Insertion scores), but it remains unverified if these improvements translate to the "trustworthiness" required for the real-world deployment scenarios the authors highlight.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study involving domain experts assessing whether ABE-generated explanations improve decision-making confidence or accuracy compared to baseline methods.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology may not fully capture semantic quality or human interpretability of explanations
- Computational efficiency claims require validation across diverse hardware configurations and larger-scale models
- Limited testing across diverse model architectures and specialized domains like medical imaging

## Confidence

### Theoretical Contributions
- Medium confidence: Provides mathematical formulations but lacks comprehensive proofs for all theoretical guarantees

### Empirical Results
- Strong confidence: Demonstrates effectiveness on benchmark datasets
- Medium generalizability: Limited testing across diverse model architectures and domains

### Robustness Evaluation
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness shown against white-box and black-box attacks, but lacks sophisticated threat model exploration

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each module (Robustness, Interpretability, Validation, and Data & Model) to overall performance
2. Perform user studies with domain experts to evaluate practical utility and interpretability of generated explanations across different applications
3. Test framework scalability and performance on larger models (e.g., transformers with billions of parameters) and more diverse datasets, including specialized domains like medical imaging or scientific data
