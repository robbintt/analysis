# On the Identifiability of Latent Action Policies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.01337
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01337
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proves theoretical conditions for identifiability of latent action representations in discrete action spaces

## Executive Summary
This paper studies when latent action representations learned through Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) satisfy key desiderata: determinism, disentanglement from state, and informativeness. Under assumptions of continuous transitions, injective actions, and connected state supports, the author proves that entropy-regularized LAPO objectives guarantee identification of an encoder satisfying these properties. The theoretical analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations work well in practice and offers guidance for designing more effective latent action learning frameworks.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical analysis of Latent Action Policy Learning (LAPO) focusing on identifiability of learned action representations. The method uses an entropy-regularized objective combining reconstruction error and entropy regularization, with hypothesis classes of continuous functions for both forward and inverse dynamics models. The analysis proves that under specific assumptions (continuity, injectivity, connected supports), the optimization recovers representations that are deterministic, state-independent, and informative about ground-truth actions.

## Key Results
- Proves that entropy regularization in LAPO forces the learned inverse dynamics model to be deterministic
- Shows that topological connectedness of state supports ensures disentanglement from state
- Demonstrates that injectivity of ground-truth transitions guarantees informative (distinct) latent actions
- Establishes conditions under which latent action representations are identifiable from data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Entropy regularization forces the learned inverse dynamics model (IDM) to be deterministic.
- **Mechanism:** The optimization objective minimizes reconstruction error plus a weighted entropy term βH(q̂). Since the global minimum of the reconstruction term is zero (under existence assumptions) and entropy is non-negative, the entropy term must also reach zero at optimality. Zero entropy implies the probability mass is concentrated on a single outcome, collapsing the stochastic encoder into a deterministic map.
- **Core assumption:** There exists a transition model and encoder capable of achieving zero reconstruction error (Proposition 4).
- **Break condition:** If the transition dynamics are stochastic or the model capacity is insufficient to reach near-zero reconstruction error, the entropy term may not force complete determinism.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Continuity and topological connectedness of the state support force latent actions to be disentangled from the state.
- **Mechanism:** The proof leverages the topological property that the continuous image of a connected set is connected. If the encoder is continuous (Definition 2) and the support of states for a specific action is connected (Assumption 3), the encoder cannot "jump" between different latent codes for the same action across different states without violating continuity/connectedness. It must output a constant latent code â for a specific action a regardless of the state x.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption 1 (Continuity of q̂), Assumption 3 (Support p(x|a) is connected).
- **Break condition:** If the data distribution has disjoint supports for the same action (e.g., distinct modes of operation separated by gaps), the encoder could map the same action to different latent codes in different regions, entangling â with x.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Injectivity of ground-truth transitions ensures the learned latent actions are informative (distinct).
- **Mechanism:** By contradiction: if two distinct ground-truth actions a₁, a₂ mapped to the same latent code â, the learned forward model ĝ would predict the same next state for both. However, since the ground truth g produces different next states for these actions (Assumption 2), the reconstruction error would be non-zero, violating optimality.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption 2 (Injectivity: distinct actions yield distinct next states); Assumption 4 (Overlapping supports to rule out trivial mappings).
- **Break condition:** If distinct actions result in identical state transitions (aliasing), the model cannot distinguish them and will collapse them to the same latent representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core component being analyzed. The paper formalizes the IDM q̂(â|x, x') not just as a predictor, but as an encoder for a latent policy.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why predicting an action from (x, x') is harder but more useful for representation learning than predicting x' from (x, a)?

- **Concept: Topological Connectedness**
  - **Why needed here:** This mathematical property is the "secret sauce" for disentanglement in this proof. It ensures the encoder doesn't behave differently in different "islands" of the state space.
  - **Quick check question:** If your data consists of two non-overlapping clusters (e.g., "day" and "night" driving) with no transitions between them, does Assumption 3 hold?

- **Concept: Reparameterization Trick**
  - **Why needed here:** Remark 1 notes that while the theory requires a deterministic encoder, the implementation uses a stochastic one to enable gradient-based optimization via reparameterization, regularizing it towards determinism.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we backpropagate directly through a discrete sampling step without this trick or a substitute (like Gumbel-Softmax)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Encoder (q̂: (x, x') → â) -> Decoder (ĝ: (x, â) → x') -> Loss (Reconstruction + Entropy Regularizer)
- **Critical path:** The identifiability guarantee holds only if the loss converges to near-zero. Monitoring the entropy term is crucial; it must collapse.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Stochastic vs. Deterministic implementation:** The paper suggests using stochastic training (for gradients) but forcing it to be deterministic via entropy penalties. VQ-VAE approaches (discrete deterministic) might risk "pathological jumps" (Remark 1).
  - **Latent Space Size (k̂):** The theory requires k̂ ≥ k (latent space size ≥ ground truth actions), but does not require equality, offering flexibility.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Unidentifiability (Example 3):** If the expert policy is deterministic, the model ignores the action and learns ĝ(x).
  - **Entanglement:** If Assumption 3 (connectedness) is violated, the same latent code might mean "Left" in one mode and "Right" in another.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validation of Zero-Loss:** Train on a dataset satisfying all assumptions and verify if reconstruction loss and entropy approach zero simultaneously.
  2. **Ablation on Connectedness:** Construct a dataset with disjoint supports for the same action and verify if the encoder produces entangled state-dependent codes.
  3. **Linear Probing:** After training q̂, freeze it and train a linear map σ: Â → A. Compare performance against a baseline where Assumption 2 (Injectivity) is intentionally violated.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper is purely theoretical with no empirical validation of the theoretical conditions in practical settings.
- The strong assumptions (continuous transitions, connected supports, injective actions) may be difficult to verify or enforce in real-world applications with limited or noisy data.
- The analysis assumes discrete action spaces, with no clear extension to continuous or very large action spaces provided.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The theoretical framework and proof structure are sound, building logically from entropy regularization forcing determinism to topological properties ensuring disentanglement.
- **Medium Confidence:** The practical relevance of the theoretical conditions. While mathematically elegant, the assumptions may be too restrictive for many real-world applications.
- **Low Confidence:** The performance gap between this theoretically-grounded approach and heuristic latent action methods in practical settings, as no empirical comparison is provided.

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Verification of Assumptions:** Create synthetic datasets that systematically violate each assumption (e.g., disconnected supports, non-injective transitions) and measure the impact on learned representations.

2. **Continuous Action Extension:** Develop a practical instantiation for continuous action spaces and validate whether the theoretical insights about entropy regularization and continuity still hold.

3. **Comparison with Heuristic Methods:** Implement a standard LAPO baseline without theoretical guarantees and compare representation quality and downstream policy learning performance on a continuous control benchmark.
