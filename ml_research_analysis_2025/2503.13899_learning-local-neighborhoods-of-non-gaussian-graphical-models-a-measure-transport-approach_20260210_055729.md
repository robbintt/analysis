# Learning local neighborhoods of non-Gaussian graphical models: A measure transport approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.13899
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13899
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Key outcome**: L-SING algorithm learns conditional independence structures in high-dimensional non-Gaussian graphical models using transport maps, achieving F1 score of 0.941 on 40-dimensional butterfly distribution and identifying biologically relevant genes in ovarian cancer dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces L-SING, a scalable algorithm for learning conditional independence structures in high-dimensional non-Gaussian graphical models. Unlike existing methods that estimate the full joint distribution, L-SING learns local conditional distributions for each variable independently using transport maps parameterized by Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNNs). The method generalizes neighborhood selection with Lasso and nonparanormal approaches while being computationally tractable for large-scale problems.

The key innovation is learning a local neighborhood for each variable via transport maps that push forward conditional distributions to a standard Gaussian reference. Sparsity in the input dependencies of these transport maps directly corresponds to conditional independence in the graphical model. The method is evaluated on synthetic Gaussian and butterfly distributions as well as a real ovarian cancer gene expression dataset, demonstrating accurate graph recovery while being computationally efficient through parallelization.

## Method Summary
L-SING learns a conditional independence graph by estimating local conditional distributions for each variable using transport maps. For each variable $X_k$, a UMNN parameterized transport map $S_k$ transforms the conditional distribution $\pi(x_k|x_{-k})$ to a standard Gaussian reference. The algorithm optimizes a regularized maximum likelihood objective to learn sparse input dependencies in each $S_k$, corresponding to conditional independence. A generalized precision matrix is then computed from second derivatives of the transport maps, and edges are identified by thresholding this matrix. The local approach enables parallelization and reduced memory requirements compared to global methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 score of 0.941 on 40-dimensional butterfly distribution where Gaussian methods fail
- Identifies biologically relevant genes like CTSE in ovarian cancer dataset missed by Gaussian-based methods
- Scales efficiently to high dimensions through parallelization, learning each local neighborhood independently
- Demonstrates robustness across Gaussian, butterfly, and real gene expression data distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Local transport maps encode conditional distributions for non-Gaussian variables.
- **Mechanism**: Each map component $S_k(x_{-k}, \cdot)$ transforms a conditional distribution $\pi(x_k|x_{-k})$ to a standard Gaussian reference via the pushforward. Sparsity in input dependencies of $S_k$ directly corresponds to conditional independence—specifically, if $X_k \perp\!\!\!\perp X_j | X_{-(k,j)}$, then $S_k$ does not depend on $x_j$.
- **Core assumption**: The target distribution has a positive, smooth density amenable to transport map representation via UMNNs.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 3, p.4-5]: Eq. (3) defines the conditional transport; Spantini et al. (2018) links map sparsity to Markov properties.
- **Break condition**: If the conditional distribution is multimodal with discontinuities, the monotonic UMNN may fail to represent it accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The generalized precision matrix $\Omega$ encodes pairwise conditional independence for twice-differentiable log-densities.
- **Mechanism**: Entries $\Omega_{jk} = \mathbb{E}|\partial_j\partial_k \log \pi(x)|$ are computed from second derivatives of the transport map via $\Omega_{jk} = \mathbb{E}|\partial_j\partial_k[-\frac{1}{2}(S_k)^2(x) + \log \partial_k S_k(x)]|$. Zero entries indicate conditional independence.
- **Core assumption**: The log-density is twice differentiable; the transport map is sufficiently expressive to capture conditional structure.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 5, p.8]: Derivation of $\Omega$ from transport map derivatives; connection to Hessian-based sparsity.
- **Break condition**: If $\partial_j\partial_k \log \pi(x)$ is zero only in expectation but not almost surely, thresholding may misclassify edges.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Functional regularization promotes sparsity in input dependencies of transport maps.
- **Mechanism**: Penalty $\Phi(S_k) = \sum_{j=1}^d \sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M (\partial S_k(x_i)/\partial x_j)^2}$ penalizes non-zero partial derivatives, encouraging $S_k$ to depend only on relevant neighbors.
- **Core assumption**: The true conditional independence structure is sparse; regularization parameter $\lambda$ can be tuned via validation loss.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 4, p.6]: Regularized MLE objective (Eq. 5-6) with sparsity penalty from Rosasco et al. (2013).
- **Break condition**: If $\lambda$ is too large, true edges may be pruned; if too small, spurious edges appear. Early stopping mitigates but does not eliminate sensitivity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov properties (local and global)**
  - **Why needed here**: L-SING exploits the local Markov property to learn neighborhoods independently; understanding conditional independence is essential to interpret the graph structure.
  - **Quick check question**: Given variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$, if $X_1 \perp\!\!\!\perp X_3 | X_2$, what does this imply about edges in the graph?

- **Concept: Transport maps and pushforward/pullback densities**
  - **Why needed here**: The core of L-SING is representing conditional distributions via transport maps that push forward to a Gaussian reference; the change-of-variables formula underlies the objective.
  - **Quick check question**: If $S$ is a diffeomorphism and $X \sim \pi$, what is the density of $S(X)$ in terms of $\pi$ and $\nabla S$?

- **Concept: Monotonic neural networks and invertibility**
  - **Why needed here**: UMNNs enforce strict monotonicity ($\partial_k S_k > 0$), ensuring invertibility needed for density evaluation via the Jacobian determinant.
  - **Quick check question**: Why must the integrand network output $f(t; \psi)$ be strictly positive for UMNN invertibility?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data standardization -> UMNN training for each node -> Generalized precision matrix computation -> Thresholding -> Graph output
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Correct UMNN parameterization (monotonicity, quadrature integration)
  2. Sufficient samples for stable gradient estimates (paper uses $M \geq 5000$ for synthetic data)
  3. Proper hyperparameter selection ($\lambda$, $\tau$) via validation
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Larger UMNN architectures (more layers/units) improve expressiveness but increase memory and risk overfitting; paper uses [64, 64, 64] for synthetic, [64, 128, 128] for real data
  - Higher $\tau$ yields sparser graphs with lower false positives but may miss true edges
  - Parallelization across nodes reduces wall-clock time but requires independent memory per node
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High false positive rate: $\tau$ too low or $\lambda$ too small; check validation loss plateau
  - Dense recovered graph with no clear sparsity: Regularization insufficient; increase $\lambda$
  - Training instability or NaNs: Check quadrature nodes (paper uses 21 Clenshaw-Curtis points) and learning rate
  - Symmetry mismatch between $\hat{\Omega}$ and $\hat{\Omega}^T$: May indicate insufficient samples or biased estimation set
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Gaussian validation**: Generate $d=10$ Gaussian data with known precision matrix; verify $\hat{\Omega}$ matches ground truth with $\tau=0.2$; compare to GLASSO
  2. **Butterfly distribution ($d=10$)**: Test on non-Gaussian synthetic data where Gaussian methods fail; confirm L-SING recovers true edges between $X_i, Y_i$ pairs
  3. **Scalability test ($d=40$)**: Run butterfly distribution with $r=20$ pairs; measure F1 score and FPR; verify parallelization reduces runtime proportionally

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can L-SING be extended to handle datasets comprising both continuous and discrete random variables?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly lists "extending L-SING to handle mixed continuous and discrete variables" as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current method parameterizes transport maps using Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNNs) and assumes continuous variables with smooth densities (Section 3), making the existing optimization formulation inapplicable to discrete states without modification.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical extension of the transport map objective to discrete measures or empirical results showing successful graph recovery on synthetic datasets with mixed variable types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can consistent thresholding and scoring strategies be developed to reduce the algorithm's sensitivity to tuning parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "developing consistent thresholding and scoring strategies to reduce sensitivity to tuning parameters" as future work, specifically referencing the approach in Zhao et al. (2024).
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on manually selecting a threshold $\tau$ based on validation loss or prior knowledge of graph density (Section 6.1), which introduces user-defined bias and variability in the recovered graph structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: A derivation of a data-driven threshold selection rule that provides statistical guarantees (e.g., false discovery rate control) or demonstrates robustness across varying sample sizes and dimensions without manual tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does L-SING provide statistically consistent graph recovery for general non-Gaussian distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While Section 7.1 demonstrates empirical consistency (decreasing FPR with increasing samples) and Proposition 4.1 links it to Lasso for Gaussian cases, the paper lacks a formal theorem proving that the estimated generalized precision matrix $\hat{\Omega}$ converges to the true structure for the neural network parameterization used.
- Why unresolved: The move from linear maps (Lasso) to non-linear UMNNs introduces non-convexity and approximation errors that are theoretically analyzed for density estimation but not rigorously linked to graph structure recovery consistency in the main text.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical proof establishing conditions (e.g., sample complexity bounds, map expressiveness) under which the edge set estimated by L-SING converges in probability to the true edge set.

## Limitations
- The twice-differentiability assumption for the generalized precision matrix formulation may not hold for complex real-world distributions with multimodal or discontinuous log-densities
- The method shows sensitivity to hyperparameters (λ, τ) without providing systematic sensitivity analysis or data-driven selection rules
- Biological interpretation of recovered ovarian cancer networks lacks independent validation through experimental or clinical follow-up

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Local conditional independence recovery via transport maps - well-supported by Spantini et al. (2018) and demonstrated empirically across multiple distributions
- **Medium confidence**: Functional regularization for sparsity - theoretically grounded but lacks direct corpus validation for this specific application
- **Low confidence**: Generalized precision matrix for non-Gaussian distributions - the twice-differentiability assumption is critical but not thoroughly validated for complex real-world distributions

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness testing**: Systematically vary λ and τ across multiple synthetic distributions (Gaussian, butterfly, multimodal mixtures) and measure F1 score stability curves
2. **Multimodal distribution evaluation**: Test L-SING on distributions with known discontinuities or multimodality (e.g., mixture of Gaussians) to assess transport map limitations
3. **Biological validation**: Perform pathway enrichment analysis on recovered ovarian cancer networks and compare with known cancer-related pathways; validate top genes (e.g., CTSE) through independent gene expression databases
