# Physics-Based Explainable AI for ECG Segmentation: A Lightweight Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.15872
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15872
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 97.00% QRS, 93.33% T-wave, and 96.07% P-wave segmentation accuracy using physics-based preprocessing and a lightweight CNN-BiLSTM model.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a physics-enhanced deep learning model for ECG segmentation that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks with specialized preprocessing techniques. The approach integrates Hilbert Transform, Euler Differentiation, and Gauss-Legendre Integration to improve signal feature extraction and interpretability. By incorporating FFT-based spectral analysis, the model achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time biomedical monitoring applications.

## Method Summary
The method employs a CNN-BiLSTM architecture enhanced with physics-based preprocessing techniques for ECG segmentation. The pipeline begins with Hilbert Transform for envelope extraction, followed by Euler Differentiation for slope detection and Gauss-Legendre Integration for signal smoothing. These preprocessing steps are combined with FFT-based spectral analysis to create interpretable features that capture both temporal and frequency domain characteristics of ECG waves. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, followed by bidirectional LSTM layers for temporal pattern learning, and a final classification layer for wave delineation.

## Key Results
- QRS wave segmentation accuracy: 97.00%
- T-wave segmentation accuracy: 93.33%
- P-wave segmentation accuracy: 96.07%
- Gauss-Legendre Integration demonstrated the lowest training loss among preprocessing methods
- Achieved high accuracy with reduced computational complexity suitable for real-time applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The physics-based preprocessing techniques enhance traditional deep learning by providing structured signal transformations that align with the underlying physics of ECG waveforms. Hilbert Transform extracts amplitude envelopes crucial for identifying wave boundaries, while Euler Differentiation captures rate-of-change information essential for detecting sharp transitions. Gauss-Legendre Integration provides optimal numerical smoothing that preserves important waveform features. When combined with FFT analysis, these methods create a feature space that is both interpretable and highly discriminative for the CNN-BiLSTM model, enabling accurate segmentation without excessive model complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hilbert Transform**: Why needed - extracts analytic signal envelope for wave boundary detection; Quick check - verify envelope follows expected P-QRS-T morphology
- **Euler Differentiation**: Why needed - identifies slope changes critical for wave onset/offset detection; Quick check - confirm differentiation highlights QRS complex peaks
- **Gauss-Legendre Integration**: Why needed - provides optimal numerical integration for signal smoothing; Quick check - ensure integration preserves QRS amplitude while reducing noise
- **FFT Spectral Analysis**: Why needed - reveals frequency components unique to different cardiac waves; Quick check - verify distinct frequency bands for P, QRS, and T waves
- **CNN-BiLSTM Architecture**: Why needed - combines spatial feature extraction with temporal sequence learning; Quick check - confirm bidirectional processing captures context from both directions
- **Lightweight Design Principles**: Why needed - enables deployment on resource-constrained devices; Quick check - validate inference speed meets real-time requirements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw ECG Signal -> Hilbert Transform -> Euler Differentiation -> Gauss-Legendre Integration -> FFT Analysis -> CNN Feature Extraction -> BiLSTM Temporal Learning -> Classification Layer

**Critical Path**: The most compute-intensive operations are the Gauss-Legendre Integration and BiLSTM layers. The Gauss-Legendre Integration requires careful parameter tuning to balance accuracy and computational load, while the BiLSTM layer must be sized appropriately to capture temporal dependencies without excessive parameter count.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model prioritizes interpretability and computational efficiency over maximum possible accuracy. This tradeoff is achieved by using physics-based preprocessing to reduce the burden on the deep learning components, allowing for a smaller network that still achieves high performance. The lightweight design enables deployment on edge devices but may limit the model's ability to capture highly complex patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may struggle with: 1) Very low signal-to-noise ratio recordings where physics-based preprocessing cannot adequately denoise, 2) Arrhythmias with abnormal wave morphologies that deviate from training data distributions, and 3) Extremely high heart rates where wave boundaries become compressed and overlapping.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. **Preprocessing Ablation**: Train identical CNN-BiLSTM models with each preprocessing technique removed individually to quantify their contribution to overall accuracy
2. **Sampling Rate Robustness**: Test model performance across different ECG sampling rates (e.g., 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz) to evaluate generalizability
3. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Add controlled amounts of white and baseline noise to validation data to determine the model's noise tolerance threshold

## Limitations
- Performance claims are based on clean, well-sampled data; real-world wearable data with noise and artifacts may yield different results
- The interpretability benefits of FFT analysis are mentioned but not quantitatively benchmarked against baseline models
- No clinical validation or cross-population testing has been performed to establish real-world applicability

## Confidence
- Generalizability to wearable devices: Low confidence

- Applicability to broader ECG tasks: Low confidence
- Interpretability advantage: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the model on continuous ECG streams from wearable devices under varying noise and sampling rates.
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Hilbert Transform, Euler Differentiation, and Gauss-Legendre Integration.
3. Compare the model's performance and interpretability with other lightweight ECG segmentation architectures on the same dataset.
