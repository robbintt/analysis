core_contribution: This study presents a collaborative penetration testing suite designed
  to address vulnerabilities in generative AI systems against classical and emerging
  quantum cyber threats. The suite integrates dynamic and static application security
  testing (DAST/SAST) using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SonarQube, and Fortify; interactive
  application security testing (IAST) via Contrast Assess; blockchain-enhanced logging
  using Hyperledger Fabric; quantum-resistant cryptography based on lattice methods
  and RLWE; and AI-driven red team simulations to emulate adversarial and quantum-assisted
  attacks.

# Collaborative penetration testing suite for emerging generative AI algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19303
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Framework identified 300+ vulnerabilities, reduced high-severity issues by 70%, and achieved 100% integrity under simulated quantum attacks

## Executive Summary
This study presents a collaborative penetration testing suite designed to secure generative AI systems against both classical and emerging quantum cyber threats. The framework integrates multiple security testing methodologies including DAST/SAST, IAST, blockchain-enhanced logging, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Through comprehensive testing, the suite demonstrated significant vulnerability reduction capabilities while maintaining system integrity under simulated quantum attack conditions.

## Method Summary
The framework combines dynamic and static application security testing using OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite, interactive application security testing via Contrast Assess, blockchain logging through Hyperledger Fabric, and quantum-resistant cryptography based on lattice methods and RLWE. AI-driven red team simulations emulate adversarial and quantum-assisted attacks. The integrated approach addresses vulnerabilities across multiple attack vectors while providing immutable audit trails and post-quantum security measures.

## Key Results
- Identified over 300 vulnerabilities across test environments
- Achieved 70% reduction in high-severity vulnerabilities within two weeks
- Maintained 100% integrity under simulated quantum attack conditions
- Achieved 90% resolution efficiency for blockchain-logged vulnerabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-layered approach combining traditional security testing with emerging technologies. Dynamic and static testing tools provide comprehensive vulnerability coverage, while blockchain logging ensures immutable audit trails for security events. Quantum-resistant cryptography protects against future quantum computing threats, and AI-driven red team simulations continuously test defensive capabilities against sophisticated attack patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantum-resistant cryptography**: Essential for protecting data against future quantum computing capabilities; quick check: verify lattice-based algorithms meet current post-quantum standards
- **Blockchain audit trails**: Provides immutable logging for security events and compliance; quick check: ensure blockchain integration doesn't introduce performance bottlenecks
- **Multi-tool security integration**: Combining DAST/SAST/IAST provides comprehensive vulnerability coverage; quick check: validate tool coordination and data sharing effectiveness
- **AI-driven red team simulations**: Enables testing against sophisticated, evolving attack patterns; quick check: verify simulation scenarios cover real-world threat vectors
- **Collaborative security testing**: Multiple expert teams provide diverse perspectives on vulnerability identification; quick check: ensure effective communication channels between teams
- **Continuous monitoring**: Ongoing security assessment rather than point-in-time testing; quick check: validate monitoring doesn't impact system performance

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Security tools (DAST/SAST/IAST) -> Blockchain logging -> Quantum cryptography -> AI red team -> Vulnerability resolution
- **Critical path**: Vulnerability detection → Blockchain logging → Security patch deployment → Validation testing
- **Design tradeoffs**: Comprehensive security vs. system performance overhead; blockchain immutability vs. storage requirements; quantum readiness vs. current implementation complexity
- **Failure signatures**: False positives in vulnerability detection, blockchain synchronization delays, quantum algorithm performance degradation, AI simulation inaccuracies
- **First experiments**:
  1. Deploy basic DAST/SAST scan on sample generative AI application
  2. Implement blockchain logging for security events
  3. Test quantum-resistant encryption on sample data transmission
