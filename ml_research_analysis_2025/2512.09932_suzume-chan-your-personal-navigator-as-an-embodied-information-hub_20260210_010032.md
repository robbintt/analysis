- Primary result: A soft, handheld AI agent that functions as an Embodied Information Hub for interactive knowledge sharing

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Suzume-chan, a soft, handheld AI agent designed to facilitate real-time knowledge sharing through embodied interaction. The system combines local speech recognition, a language model, and retrieval-augmented generation to enable users to access expert knowledge through natural dialogue. By leveraging physical embodiment and social presence theory, Suzume-chan aims to reduce psychological barriers in knowledge-seeking conversations, making intellectual exchanges feel warmer and more human-centered. The prototype demonstrates how a tangible interface can transform expert knowledge access beyond temporal and spatial constraints.

## Method Summary
Suzume-chan operates through a two-phase RAG system: first capturing expert explanations via speech transcription and vector storage, then retrieving and synthesizing responses to visitor queries. The system runs entirely on local hardware (Mac Studio with 128GB memory) using open-source models for privacy and network independence. A handheld plush device containing microphone and speaker wirelessly connects to the host computer, enabling wake-word-activated dialogue. The architecture processes spoken input through Whisper for transcription, chunks and vectorizes content for database storage, and generates responses by retrieving relevant context and prompting an LLM before synthesizing speech output.

## Key Results
- Reduces psychological distance in knowledge-seeking through physical embodiment and dialogue
- Enables asynchronous knowledge sharing via RAG-based retrieval of expert explanations
- Demonstrates privacy-preserving local-only processing for sensitive knowledge exchange

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Physical embodiment in a soft, hand-sized form reduces psychological barriers to knowledge-seeking conversations.
- Mechanism: The plush exterior and handheld scale create perceived psychological safety, transforming intellectual exchange from a formal query into a "calm and trustworthy conversation." This draws on Social Presence Theory, where the sense that "someone is there" enriches mediated interaction.
- Core assumption: Users will anthropomorphize the agent sufficiently for social presence effects to transfer from human-human to human-AI contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered"
  - [section 1] "Its warm, hand-sized form helps reduce psychological barriers and turns intellectual explanation into a calm and trustworthy conversation"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work on embodied robots (Paro, Kismet, iCub cited in paper) supports emotional bonding but not specifically knowledge mediation.
- Break condition: If users perceive the device as purely instrumental (a "tool" rather than "partner"), the social presence effect may not activate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RAG-based dialogue enables accurate, contextually grounded responses from previously captured spoken explanations.
- Mechanism: Spoken input is transcribed (Whisper), chunked, vectorized, and stored. During queries, the question is vectorized, similar chunks are retrieved, and the LLM generates responses grounded in that retrieved context—reducing hallucination risk compared to pure LLM generation.
- Core assumption: Chunking and vectorization preserve semantic meaning well enough for relevant retrieval; the LLM can synthesize retrieved chunks into coherent, natural responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "During the input phase, the spoken explanations are transcribed and converted into vector representations... retrieved results are included in the prompt for the language model"
  - [corpus] Related RAG applications (e.g., Patient-Centered RAG for Oncology) show retrieval grounding improves domain-specific responses, though not directly tested for embodied agents.
- Break condition: If vector similarity fails to capture semantic relevance (e.g., domain-specific jargon mismatched), retrieval quality degrades and responses become irrelevant or generic.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Local-only processing enables privacy-preserving, network-independent operation suitable for sensitive or restricted environments.
- Mechanism: All components (speech recognition, LLM, vector DB, synthesis) run on a local Mac Studio with 128GB memory—no external API calls. This prevents data leakage and ensures functionality without internet connectivity.
- Core assumption: Local hardware is sufficient for acceptable latency and response quality; users value privacy enough to accept any performance tradeoffs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1.1] "runs open-source models locally... ensures both privacy protection and stable operation without dependence on an external network"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on local-vs-cloud tradeoffs for embodied agents; this is a design choice rather than a tested hypothesis in the paper.
- Break condition: If latency exceeds conversational thresholds (~1-2 seconds perceived response delay), the sense of "presence" and dialogue flow may break.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Social Presence Theory**
  - Why needed here: The entire design rationale rests on the claim that perceived "being together" improves knowledge communication. Without understanding this theory, the design choices (soft body, dialogue interface) appear arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a sense of presence might improve knowledge transfer compared to a static FAQ?

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Suzume-chan's dialogue engine depends on RAG to ground responses in presenter-provided content. Understanding chunking, embedding, and retrieval is essential for debugging response quality.
  - Quick check question: If Suzume-chan gives a generic answer instead of presenter-specific content, where in the RAG pipeline would you investigate first?

- Concept: **Local Inference Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Running LLMs locally requires balancing model size, memory, and latency. The 128GB unified memory constraint shapes all model choices.
  - Quick check question: What happens to response latency if you upgrade to a larger model that exceeds available memory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Microphone (handheld) → Whisper (speech-to-text) → Chunking → Vector embedding → Vector DB
  - Wake word → Microphone → Whisper → Query embedding → Vector DB retrieval → LLM (Llama/gpt-oss-120b) → Speech synthesis → Speaker (handheld)
  - Handheld agent (wireless) ↔ Wi-Fi ↔ Mac Studio (host, all model inference)

- Critical path:
  1. Verify audio capture from handheld microphone reaches host
  2. Confirm Whisper transcription accuracy for domain vocabulary
  3. Validate vector DB retrieval returns relevant chunks for test queries
  4. Measure end-to-end latency from wake word to speaker output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Model size vs. latency**: Larger models (gpt-oss-120b) may improve response quality but increase latency
  - **Chunk granularity vs. retrieval precision**: Smaller chunks improve specificity but may lose context; larger chunks preserve context but dilute relevance
  - **Privacy vs. capability**: Local-only limits access to state-of-the-art cloud models

- Failure signatures:
  - Generic or hallucinated responses → Check retrieval step; relevant chunks may not be reaching the LLM prompt
  - Long response delays (>3 sec) → Profile Whisper, LLM, and synthesis stages; consider smaller model or streaming
  - Wake word not detected → Check microphone gain and wake-word model sensitivity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Latency baseline**: Measure time for each pipeline stage (audio capture → transcription → retrieval → generation → synthesis) to identify bottlenecks.
  2. **Retrieval quality test**: Input known presenter explanations, query with specific questions, score whether retrieved chunks contain the relevant answer.
  3. **Social presence pilot**: Have users interact with Suzume-chan vs. a tablet-based text interface; survey perceived warmth, trust, and willingness to ask follow-up questions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What happens when Social Presence Theory is applied to an AI agent with a physical body for intellectual knowledge mediation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The introduction states, "We ask what happens when this human-centered theory is applied to an AI agent with a physical body. This is the main question of our research."
- Why unresolved: The paper currently presents the prototype and research method (WISS 2025 demonstration) but does not yet contain the empirical results or observations to answer this core inquiry.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data from user studies comparing perceived social presence and psychological distance in users interacting with Suzume-chan versus non-embodied information tools (e.g., smartphones).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a "Conversational Survey" conducted by an embodied agent yield richer qualitative data than traditional forms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Future vision" section proposes "Conversational Survey" as a new form of data collection where "agents can collect information naturally through dialogue instead of forms."
- Why unresolved: This is presented as a future application scenario. It remains unclear if this method effectively reduces burden or captures context better than existing tools in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of data quality, user engagement, and response depth between Suzume-chan-led interviews and standard digital surveys.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the system maintain privacy and accuracy when vectorizing unstructured spoken input for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on dividing spoken information into chunks for a vector database. However, the paper notes "privacy protection" as a key feature without detailing how audio data is anonymized or secured on the local server.
- Why unresolved: The technical description outlines the architecture but does not address potential security vulnerabilities in the wireless transmission or the management of sensitive voice data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Technical specifications regarding data encryption, local processing latency under load, and user consent mechanisms for the "Suzume Network."

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation through single conference demonstration without controlled comparisons
- Absence of quantitative performance metrics for RAG retrieval quality and response accuracy
- No measured evidence of actual latency impacts from local-only processing constraints

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical architecture description - the RAG pipeline, local inference setup, and component connections are clearly specified and technically feasible.
- Medium confidence in privacy and autonomy benefits - while the local-only design is implementable, actual performance and user experience impacts remain unmeasured.
- Low confidence in social presence and psychological distance claims - these are asserted based on theoretical grounds and qualitative feedback without controlled experimental evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **A/B testing of social presence effects**: Compare user experience metrics (comfort asking questions, perceived warmth, willingness to engage) between Suzume-chan and an equivalent tablet-based interface delivering the same content, controlling for other variables.
2. **RAG quality benchmark**: Create a test corpus of expert explanations, then systematically evaluate retrieval relevance scores (e.g., recall@k, mean average precision) and response accuracy across different query types to quantify grounding effectiveness.
3. **Latency and performance profiling**: Measure end-to-end response times across different model sizes and chunk parameters under realistic usage patterns to determine actual conversational latency and identify processing bottlenecks.
