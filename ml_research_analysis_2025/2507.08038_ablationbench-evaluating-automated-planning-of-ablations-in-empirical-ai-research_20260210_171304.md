# AblationBench: Evaluating Automated Planning of Empirical AI Research

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.08038
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08038
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Chain-of-thought prompting outperforms agent-based approaches for automated ablation planning, achieving 38% average F1 score across tasks with humans scoring 65% F1.

## Executive Summary
AblationBench is a benchmark for evaluating automated planning of ablation studies in empirical AI research. The benchmark includes two tasks: AuthorAblation, which requires generating ablations from method sections, and ReviewerAblation, which involves identifying missing ablations in full papers. Using chain-of-thought prompting, the best-performing models achieve only 38% F1 score on average, with humans scoring 65% F1 on a subset of tasks. The study finds that removal-type ablations are easier to identify than modification-type ablations, and that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms agent-based approaches in both accuracy and cost.

## Method Summary
AblationBench evaluates automated ablation planning through two tasks: AuthorAblation (generating ablations from method sections) and ReviewerAblation (identifying missing ablations in full papers). The benchmark includes 83 papers with 230 human-annotated ablations for AuthorAblation and 350 ICLR submissions with reviewer-identified missing ablations for ReviewerAblation. Using chain-of-thought prompting, the best-performing models achieve only 38% F1 score on average, with humans scoring 65% F1 on a subset of tasks. The study finds that removal-type ablations are easier to identify than modification-type ablations, and that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms agent-based approaches in both accuracy and cost.

## Key Results
- Chain-of-thought prompting achieves 38% average F1 score on ablation planning tasks
- Humans score 65% F1 on a subset of tasks, establishing a performance baseline
- Removal-type ablations show higher recall than modification-type ablations across models
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves 42.7% F1 on AuthorAblation but only 31.8% on ReviewerAblation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Chain-of-Thought Prompting Outperforms Agent-Based Reasoning
- Claim: Single-pass CoT prompting achieves higher accuracy and lower cost than iterative agent-based approaches for ablation planning.
- Mechanism: Agent-based planners introduce tool-use complexity that does not directly contribute to identifying ablatable components. A single LM call with full paper context and one CoT reasoning step yields better task alignment.
- Core assumption: The task requires synthesis and identification of key components rather than multi-step file inspection or code reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "chain-of-thought prompting outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach", [section 7.4] "LM-PLANNER outperforms AGENT-PLANNER for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet... while being ~1.5× cheaper" and "no correlation between agent trajectory length and F1 score"

### Mechanism 2: Removal-Type Ablations Are Easier to Identify Than Modification-Type
- Claim: Models achieve higher recall on ablations involving complete component removal versus those requiring substitution or modification.
- Mechanism: Removal ablations require only identifying core method components. Modification ablations additionally require proposing contextually appropriate alternatives informed by domain knowledge—a capability where current models struggle.
- Core assumption: The paper's ordering of ablations by appearance serves as a reasonable proxy for relative importance.
- Evidence anchors: [section 7.4] "recall@5 is consistently higher for removal-type ablations across planners and models... For GPT-4o, this difference is statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01", [section 6] "AuthorAblation includes 230 ablations... with 59% involving modifications and 41% removals"

### Mechanism 3: Inverse Performance Relationship Between Author and Reviewer Tasks Due to Grounding
- Claim: Models strongly grounded in paper content (e.g., Claude) excel at AuthorAblation but underperform on ReviewerAblation; less grounded models show the inverse pattern.
- Mechanism: AuthorAblation rewards precise adherence to method descriptions. ReviewerAblation requires identifying gaps—proposing ablations beyond what authors explicitly described. Strong grounding limits creative suggestion; weak grounding enables broader (but sometimes irrelevant) proposals.
- Core assumption: This trade-off reflects a fundamental tension between factuality and creativity in long-context reasoning tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [section 7.4] "models that perform well on one task tend to perform poorly on the other... attributed to differences in model grounding", [section 7.4 qualitative analysis] Claude "closely adhering to the method description... however, this grounding appears to limit performance on ReviewerAblation"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ablation Study Design
  - Why needed here: The entire benchmark assumes understanding that ablations attribute performance to method components through removal or modification.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a hyperparameter sweep, a baseline comparison, and a true ablation study?

- Concept: Long-Context Document Processing
  - Why needed here: Models must process truncated papers (method sections only) or full submissions to extract method structure.
  - Quick check question: Given a 10-page paper's method section, can you identify its 3-5 most critical architectural choices?

- Concept: LM-as-Judge Evaluation
  - Why needed here: The benchmark uses ensemble LM judges with bias mitigation (positional, intra-model, contextual) for automatic evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model prefer its own outputs when judging, and how does random assignment of "Side A/B" labels help?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Planner (LM-PLANNER / AGENT-PLANNER) -> Judge (LM-JUDGE / AGENT-JUDGE) -> Metrics computation
- Critical path: Paper input → Planner generates JSONL ablation plan → Judge receives (ground truth ablations, generated ablations) in shuffled order → Ensemble of 3 models votes on each match → Metrics computed: precision@k, recall@k, F1@k
- Design tradeoffs: k=5 for AuthorAblation, k=2 for ReviewerAblation; LM-JUDGE over AGENT-JUDGE (2× cheaper, comparable accuracy); majority voting over best single model (better human agreement)
- Failure signatures: Judge false negatives (51% of o3-mini errors on AuthorAblation); surface-level matches (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 30% of errors); NLP papers underperforming
- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline LM-PLANNER with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on AuthorAblation test set; 2) Ablate the ablation type to measure recall separately for removal vs modification ablations; 3) Cross-task grounding test to confirm inverse performance relationship

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can benchmark frameworks effectively evaluate novel ablation proposals that are valid and feasible but absent from the ground truth labels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3 states that evaluating suggestions not in the ground truth is "inherently challenging" and is left as "future work."
- Why unresolved: Current metrics penalize valid novel ideas as false positives because they rely solely on matching gold labels from authors or reviewers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new evaluation protocol or metric that can automatically assess the relevance and feasibility of non-ground-truth ablations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a single model architecture optimize for both the AuthorAblation and ReviewerAblation tasks given their conflicting requirements for grounding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 7.4 and Appendix B identify a trade-off where strongly grounded models (e.g., Claude) excel at AuthorAblation but struggle with ReviewerAblation, whereas less grounded models show the inverse trend.
- Why unresolved: The Author task requires strict adherence to the text, while the Reviewer task benefits from "creativity" or "hallucination" to identify gaps.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model that achieves high F1 scores (e.g., >0.6) on both tasks simultaneously without degradation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What techniques can close the performance gap between identifying removal-type ablations and modification-type ablations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 7.4 reports that models identify removal ablations significantly better than modification ablations, which require domain-specific knowledge to propose feasible substitutions.
- Why unresolved: Current LMs struggle to infer relevant alternatives for complex components, often defaulting to simple removals or hyperparameter tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that achieves statistically equivalent recall scores for both removal and modification ablation categories.

## Limitations
- LM-based judges show significant error rates (51% false negatives for o3-mini on AuthorAblation), creating uncertainty about model performance gaps
- Inverse performance relationship between tasks is primarily supported by internal analysis without extensive external validation
- Human performance baseline (65% F1) may not be representative due to potential annotation inconsistencies

## Confidence

- **High**: Chain-of-thought prompting outperforms agent-based approaches (supported by cost metrics and statistical significance)
- **Medium**: Removal-type ablations are easier than modification-type (supported by recall differences and statistical testing, but assumes paper ordering as importance proxy)
- **Low**: Inverse performance relationship between tasks due to grounding (supported by qualitative analysis but lacks direct corpus evidence)

## Next Checks

1. **Judge Reliability Audit**: Validate judge accuracy by comparing LM judge outputs against a larger human-annotated subset to quantify false positive/negative rates across different ablation types
2. **Grounding Control Experiment**: Test models with adjustable temperature or retrieval augmentation on both tasks to determine if grounding trade-offs can be controlled rather than being inherent
3. **Domain Transfer Test**: Evaluate the same models on ablation planning for domains outside the benchmark's CV/NLP focus (e.g., robotics or healthcare) to assess generalizability of the grounding-performance relationship
