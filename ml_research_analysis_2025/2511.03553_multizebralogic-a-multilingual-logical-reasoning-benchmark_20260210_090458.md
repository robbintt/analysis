# MultiZebraLogic: A Multilingual Logical Reasoning Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.03553
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03553
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Introduces a multilingual logical reasoning benchmark with 128+1024 puzzles across 9 Germanic languages, finding red herrings reduce o3-mini accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles

## Executive Summary
MultiZebraLogic is a multilingual logical reasoning benchmark designed to evaluate both reasoning and non-reasoning large language models across nine Germanic languages. The benchmark features zebra puzzles with varying sizes (2×3 and 4×5), 14 clue types, and 8 red herring types to systematically increase difficulty. The authors find that puzzle size 2×3 is sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (non-reasoning), while 4×5 is suitable for o3-mini (reasoning). Including 5 red herrings reduces o3-mini's puzzle-level accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles. Performance is consistent across English and Danish, and between different themes (houses vs. smørrebrød). The authors observe no correlation between clue type selection and difficulty. They publish datasets of 128+1024 puzzles per language and size, along with code for puzzle generation, filling a gap in multilingual logical reasoning evaluation.

## Method Summary
The benchmark generates zebra puzzles using iterative constraint addition with a Python constraint package, ensuring unique solutions through clue validation. Puzzles are translated across nine Germanic languages using language-specific configuration files that handle grammatical cases. Two model categories are evaluated: non-reasoning models (GPT-4o mini) on 2×3 puzzles and reasoning models (o3-mini) on 4×5 puzzles. Red herrings (irrelevant clues) are added to increase difficulty, with 5 red herrings reducing o3-mini accuracy by 15±7%. Puzzle-level accuracy (Apuzzle) and cell-wise accuracy (Acell) are computed using JSON output parsing and comparison against ground truth.

## Key Results
- Adding 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini's accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles
- No significant performance difference between English and Danish puzzles (<2σ variation)
- Puzzle size 2×3 is appropriate for GPT-4o mini while 4×5 suits o3-mini reasoning capabilities
- No correlation found between clue type selection and puzzle difficulty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding red herrings systematically degrades reasoning model accuracy on constraint satisfaction puzzles
- Mechanism: Red herrings introduce noise that requires the model to distinguish relevant constraints from irrelevant information, increasing cognitive load without providing useful signal
- Core assumption: The accuracy decrease stems from interference with reasoning processes rather than simply increased sequence length
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Adding five red herrings decreases o3-mini's accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles"
  - [section 3.2] "Going from 0 to 5 red herrings decreases Apuzzle by 4±1 times as much as adding 1"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work focuses on puzzle generation but not red herring effects specifically
- Break condition: If accuracy recovers when models are explicitly told to ignore irrelevant clues, the mechanism is attention-filtering rather than reasoning interference

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Logical reasoning ability generalizes across linguistically similar languages without significant performance degradation
- Mechanism: The paper finds no significant difference between English (high-resource) and Danish (medium-resource) performance, suggesting reasoning capabilities transfer when grammatical structures are sufficiently similar (both Germanic)
- Core assumption: The translation process preserves logical structure and difficulty equivalence across languages
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Performance is consistent across English and Danish, and between different themes"
  - [section 3.3] "Apuzzle and Acell vary by <2σ – both for Danish vs. English house-themed puzzles"
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration; PolyMath and MathMist examine multilingual math reasoning but report persistent language gaps
- Break condition: If performance drops significantly for non-Germanic languages with different grammatical cases, the mechanism is language-family-specific transfer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Puzzle generation via iterative constraint addition naturally biases toward more informative clue types
- Mechanism: The algorithm adds clues randomly, keeps only those that reduce the solution space, and removes clues that don't contribute to uniqueness, creating a frequency bias toward clue types that provide stronger constraints
- Core assumption: More informative clues are more frequently retained, creating the observed distribution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "If a suggested clue changes the number of possible solutions, we keep it and iterate until one solution remains"
  - [appendix B] "Frequently selected clues are typically more informative"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; constraint-satisfaction puzzle generation is standard but frequency analysis is novel here
- Break condition: If manually balancing clue type frequencies doesn't affect puzzle difficulty, the bias is epiphenomenal

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**
  - Why needed here: Zebra puzzles are CSPs where clues constrain the solution space until unique assignment remains
  - Quick check question: Given attributes A, B, C across 3 objects, what's the minimum number of binary constraints needed to guarantee uniqueness?

- Concept: **Reasoning vs. Non-Reasoning Model Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates o3-mini (reasoning) and GPT-4o mini (non-reasoning) differently, with suitable puzzle sizes 4×5 vs. 2×3 respectively
  - Quick check question: What specific architectural or training differences would cause one model to handle 2× larger constraint spaces?

- Concept: **Bernoulli Distribution for Binary Accuracy Metrics**
  - Why needed here: Puzzle-level accuracy (correct/incorrect) is modeled as Bernoulli, enabling proper uncertainty quantification
  - Quick check question: Why is Apuzzle treated as Bernoulli but Acell as approximately normal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Solution generation -> clue addition loop -> uniqueness check -> red herring injection -> translation -> model evaluation
- Critical path: Solution generation → clue addition loop → uniqueness check → red herring injection → translation → model evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Unambiguity vs. naturalness: "There are n houses between X and Y" preferred over more natural phrasing to avoid ambiguity
  - Ease of generation vs. consistency: Icelandic uses "elskar ekki" instead of "líkar ekki" to avoid dative case complications
  - Puzzle size vs. evaluation cost: 5×5 puzzles excluded due to resource constraints
- Failure signatures:
  - Multiple valid solutions indicate insufficient clues
  - High Acell but low Apuzzle suggests object permutation errors
  - API errors treated as wrong solutions may inflate difficulty estimates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the 4×5 red herring experiment (0 vs. 5 herrings) on your target model to establish baseline sensitivity
  2. Test non-Germanic language (e.g., Finnish, Japanese) to validate cross-linguistic generalization claims
  3. Ablate clue types individually to verify the "no correlation between clue type and difficulty" finding for your model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does model performance change when extending the benchmark to include non-unique attributes or grid-based spatial constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix L suggests these specific variations, such as "houses on a grid" and "non-unique" attributes, to evaluate "broader or more advanced reasoning skills"
- Why unresolved: The current study restricts puzzles to linear layouts with unique attributes per object, leaving these complex constraints untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of reasoning models on a newly generated dataset incorporating grid layouts and duplicate attributes to measure accuracy degradation

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the removal of the "football/soccer" ambiguity in the post-analysis dataset significantly improve model accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix K notes that linguistic corrections were applied after the results were computed, specifically replacing "watching football" with "ski jumping" to avoid confusion with the "playing football" attribute
- Why unresolved: The reported metrics (e.g., o3-mini accuracy of 42%) were derived from the dataset version containing these potential linguistic traps
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluating the models on the corrected dataset and comparing the new accuracy scores against the baseline reported in Section 3

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the bias towards informative clues in the generation algorithm mask potential difficulty correlations with specific clue types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.4 finds no correlation between clue types and difficulty, but Appendix B states the algorithm naturally selects "more informative" clues more frequently, potentially skewing the distribution
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the lack of correlation is a fundamental property of the reasoning task or an artifact of the non-uniform clue distribution
- What evidence would resolve it: Generating a control dataset with manually weighted, uniform clue type frequencies to test if specific logical structures (e.g., "not_between") become statistically significant difficulty predictors

## Limitations

- The benchmark's focus on 9 Germanic languages limits generalizability claims about multilingual reasoning transfer
- The puzzle generation algorithm's inherent bias toward certain clue types may affect difficulty calibration across languages
- The study lacks performance data for non-Germanic languages, leaving cross-linguistic generalization claims unverified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The red herring mechanism and its quantified effect (15±7% accuracy drop) on reasoning models
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-linguistic generalization within Germanic languages based on English-Danish comparison
- **Low confidence**: Claims about puzzle size appropriateness for different model categories (2×3 vs. 4×5) without broader model testing

## Next Checks

1. Test the benchmark with non-Germanic languages (e.g., Finnish, Japanese) to validate cross-linguistic generalization claims beyond the Germanic language family
2. Evaluate a broader range of reasoning and non-reasoning models on both puzzle sizes to validate the 2×3/4×5 model categorization
3. Conduct ablation studies on individual clue types to verify whether the observed "no correlation between clue type and difficulty" finding holds across different model architectures
