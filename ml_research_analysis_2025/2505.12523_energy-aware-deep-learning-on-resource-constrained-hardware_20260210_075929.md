## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of energy-aware deep learning approaches for resource-constrained hardware, particularly focusing on Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. The paper addresses the critical need for optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to operate within strict energy budgets, which is essential for prolonging battery life and enabling operation on energy-harvesting devices. The survey covers several key areas: energy-aware DNN design, including compression methods like pruning and quantization optimized for energy efficiency; neural architecture search (NAS) techniques that incorporate energy as a design metric; energy-adaptive inference strategies such as multi-exit networks and dynamic right-sizing; and on-device training methods that minimize energy consumption during fine-tuning. A significant contribution is the detailed analysis of energy estimation methodologies and their limitations across different hardware platforms.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes research across four main categories: energy-aware DNN design (compression methods optimized for energy efficiency), NAS with energy constraints, energy-adaptive inference (multi-exit networks, dynamic right-sizing), and on-device training for energy efficiency. The methods rely on hardware-specific energy estimation through regression models trained on benchmark measurements, proxy metrics based on MACs and memory access patterns, and runtime adaptation strategies. Implementation requires selecting target DNN architectures, profiling energy consumption on target hardware, and integrating confidence-based exit policies or compression strategies with energy constraints.

## Key Results
- Memory access patterns dominate DNN energy consumption, making MAC-based optimization insufficient
- Multi-exit networks with confidence-based early exits can significantly reduce average inference energy
- Hardware-specific energy estimation via regression models provides better accuracy than proxy metrics
- Intermittent computing requires careful state management for safe resumption after power failures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Data Movement Dominates Energy Consumption
Optimizing for MACs/FLOPs alone does not minimize energy; memory access patterns are the primary driver. Energy-aware pruning and quantization rank layers by estimated memory access costs, not just parameter counts. Layer-wise energy consumption is estimated via hardware measurements or memory-access proxies, guiding compression order.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Inference via Early Exits
Dynamic inference that exits early for "easy" inputs reduces average energy without sacrificing accuracy on "hard" inputs. Multi-exit networks attach side-branch classifiers at intermediate layers. Exit decisions are based on confidence metrics (score margin, entropy) or RL-based policies that consider energy availability.

### Mechanism 3: Hardware-Specific Energy Estimation via Regression
Accurate pre-execution energy estimation requires hardware-specific profiling; proxy metrics are insufficient. Regression models are trained on measured energy consumption of reference architectures on target hardware. Features include layer parameters, MACs, and memory access patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Memory Hierarchy and Data Movement Costs**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that off-chip DRAM access >> SRAM access >> ALU operations is fundamental to energy-aware design.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SqueezeNet (50× fewer MACs) might consume more energy than AlexNet on the same hardware?

- **Concept: Inference-Time Adaptivity vs. Static Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes design-time compression from runtime adaptation; knowing when each applies is critical.
  - Quick check question: What information must be available at inference time to decide whether to exit early?

- **Concept: Intermittent Computing and State Persistence**
  - Why needed here: Battery-less devices experience power failures; safe resumption requires checkpointing or atomic task execution.
  - Quick check question: What happens to DNN inference state if power fails mid-execution on an energy-harvesting MCU?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Hardware profiling -> Energy estimation model -> NAS/compression with energy constraint -> Deployment with adaptive inference policy

- **Critical path:** Hardware profiling -> Energy estimation model -> NAS/compression with energy constraint -> Deployment with adaptive inference policy

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fine-grained exits: More opportunities vs. higher overheads and convergence issues
  - On-device training: Personalization vs. backpropagation energy/memory cost
  - Offloading: Cloud compute savings vs. transmission energy cost
  - Quantization precision: Energy reduction vs. accuracy loss on difficult inputs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Energy predictions fail to generalize across hardware (proxy metrics don't transfer)
  - Multi-exit networks exhibit "overthinking"—easy inputs traverse all layers
  - On-device fine-tuning exceeds energy budget or causes catastrophic forgetting
  - Intermittent execution corrupts state (partial NV memory updates)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Profile layer-wise energy of MobileNetV2 on target hardware; compare MAC-based predictions vs. actual measurements to quantify estimation gap.
  2. Implement a 3-exit variant with confidence-based exit policy; measure energy reduction and accuracy tradeoff on a held-out test set.
  3. Deploy on energy-harvesting hardware (or simulate intermittent power); test SONIC-style checkpointing for safe resumption; measure overhead vs. correctness guarantee.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can architectural representations, such as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), be extended with energy-relevant metadata to enable accurate, execution-free energy estimation across heterogeneous hardware platforms? Current energy estimation methods rely heavily on regression models trained on hardware-specific benchmarks. They struggle to generalize across different devices or architectures without physical execution, as DNN energy consumption varies significantly based on memory hierarchy and dataflow. A prediction model that utilizes metadata-enriched ASTs to estimate energy consumption for unseen DNN architectures on unprofiled hardware with a consistently low error margin (e.g., <10%) would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can differentiable energy-aware regularizers be effectively integrated into the training process to optimize neural networks for inherent energy efficiency across diverse hardware? Existing methods predominantly focus on inference-time optimization (e.g., pruning, quantization) applied post-training. Incorporating energy directly into the training loss function is difficult due to the non-differentiable nature of hardware energy consumption metrics. A training methodology that minimizes a combined loss function (accuracy + differentiable energy proxy) and produces models that demonstrate measurably lower energy consumption during inference on target hardware compared to standard regularization techniques would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can policy-based or reinforcement learning approaches effectively adjust capacitor capacity at runtime to optimize task scheduling on energy-harvesting devices? Current intermittently-powered systems typically use static voltage thresholds ($V_{on}$) set pre-deployment. These static settings cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of environmental energy sources or variable computational workloads, leading to missed events or wasted charging time. An implementation on a resource-constrained testbed (e.g., MSP430) demonstrating that an RL agent can dynamically modulate effective capacitance to maximize utility or task completion rates compared to static threshold configurations would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Cross-platform energy estimation validity remains unproven; most methods lack validation beyond target platforms
- Absence of validation for intermittent computing claims; checkpointing overhead vs. energy savings not quantified
- Limited coverage of non-CNN architectures; RNNs and transformers minimally treated despite growing IoT relevance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Memory hierarchy dominates energy consumption - extensively validated in literature and supported by multiple hardware measurements
- **Medium confidence**: Multi-exit networks reduce average energy - theoretical basis is sound but quantitative validation varies across implementations
- **Low confidence**: Hardware-agnostic energy estimation - survey acknowledges this as a challenge but doesn't provide validated solutions

## Next Checks

1. Implement and compare two different energy estimation approaches (hardware-specific regression vs. proxy metrics) on the same target platform to quantify accuracy differences.

2. Systematically vary confidence thresholds across multiple exit points and measure the energy-accuracy Pareto frontier to identify optimal configurations.

3. Measure energy consumption of different fine-tuning strategies (layer-wise vs. full-network) on resource-constrained hardware to validate survey claims about backpropagation overhead.
