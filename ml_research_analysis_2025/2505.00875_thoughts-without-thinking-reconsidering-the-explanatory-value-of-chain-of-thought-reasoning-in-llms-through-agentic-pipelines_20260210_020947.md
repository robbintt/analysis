# Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00875
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Chain-of-Thought reasoning in agentic LLM pipelines does not improve explainability and may hinder user understanding by introducing irrelevant or erroneous content.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves explainability in agentic LLM pipelines for perceptive task guidance systems. Using toy assembly tasks and participatory organizational/social questions, the research finds that CoT reasoning alone does not enhance output quality or explainability. Quantitative results show non-reasoning models outperformed CoT-trained counterparts, with human and LLM-as-a-Judge scores correlating weakly between CoT thoughts and final answers. Qualitative analysis revealed CoT explanations often mislead by introducing irrelevant content, reinforcing logical fallacies, or focusing on generic machine-related tokens rather than task-specific details. The findings suggest CoT reasoning may hinder rather than help user understanding in agentic systems.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six LLM variants (reasoning and non-reasoning) within an agentic pipeline supporting perceptive task guidance. The pipeline includes perceptors (visual/language), planners (lead, query, answer), and action agents (RAG, reformulator, question answerer, question generator, safety agent, chit-chat). Models tested include Llama-3-8b, Qwen-7b/14b (non-reasoning) versus DeepSeek-distilled variants (reasoning/CoT). The custom benchmark dataset includes 152 organizational/social questions and 129 task questions based on Assembly 101 dataset. Outputs are scored on a 4-point Likert scale by human experts and GPT-4o LLM-as-a-Judge, with statistical significance via Wilcoxon rank-sum test and agreement measured via Cohen's Kappa.

## Key Results
- Non-reasoning models (Llama-3-8b, Qwen variants) significantly outperformed reasoning models (DeepSeek-distilled variants) on both task and organizational/social questions
- CoT thought quality shows weak correlation with output correctness, suggesting thoughts don't constrain or guide accurate responses
- Qualitative analysis identified three CoT failure modes: false premises, hasty generalizations, and excessive irrelevant text
- CoT explanations introduce explainability burden rather than benefit, distracting users with verbose, fallacy-prone content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Non-reasoning models outperform reasoning-based models in context-bound agentic tasks because CoT reasoning introduces token drift toward statistically common associations rather than task-specific context. The foundation model's prior training on common associations dominates over in-context retrieved specifications when CoT is unconstrained.

### Mechanism 2
CoT thought quality weakly correlates with output correctness because CoT generates post-hoc rationalizations rather than causal reasoning traces. The independence between thought quality and answer quality suggests thoughts are not constraining the output generation process effectively.

### Mechanism 3
CoT introduces explainability burden rather than benefit by adding verbose, fallacy-prone text that users must parse. Three failure modes identified: false premises presented as facts, hasty generalizations, and excessive irrelevant text obscuring useful signal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Agentic Pipeline Architecture**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the system requires knowing how perceptors, planners, and actors coordinate. The paper evaluates CoT within this multi-agent context, not on isolated models.
  - Quick check question: Can you trace how a "What should I do next?" query flows through lead planner → intent detection → RAG → answer planner → safety agent?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The system retrieves specification documents and historical logs. CoT failures partly stem from insufficient context or model override of retrieved context.
  - Quick check question: If RAG returns toy assembly instructions but the model outputs real machinery components, where did the failure occur?

- **Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The study uses both human and automated evaluation. Understanding the weak correlation (Cohen's Kappa 0.28-0.48) between them is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM judge rate an answer differently than a human expert assessing practical helpfulness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Lead planner → Intent detection → Visual perception → Query planner → RAG → Answer planner → Safety agent → Output
- **Critical path:** 1. Input → Lead planner generates pipeline graph 2. Intent detection + visual perception enrich context 3. Query planner reformulates if needed 4. RAG retrieves specification documents 5. Answer planner checks sufficiency → routes to answer generator OR question generator 6. Safety agent validates output before delivery
- **Design tradeoffs:** Single LLM per agent vs. specialized models; CoT reasoning vs. direct generation; LLM-as-judge vs. human evaluation
- **Failure signatures:** Token drift (generic concepts instead of retrieved context), false premise propagation, context window saturation, weak thought-answer coupling
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline comparison: Run same Task and Org-Soc questions through all 6 models with identical pipeline configuration; score outputs using Likert scale (-1, 0, 0.5, 1) 2. Thought-output correlation analysis: Separately score thoughts and answers; compute correlation to verify whether thought quality predicts answer quality 3. Qualitative failure mode analysis: Manual review of CoT traces for incorrect answers; code for Einstellung effects, logical fallacies, and irrelevant content density

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does deploying heterogeneous, task-specific LLMs within the agentic pipeline (e.g., specialized models for planning vs. safety) improve performance compared to the homogeneous deployment evaluated in this study?
- How can agentic pipelines be re-architected to utilize CoT for "human-centered explainability" without exposing users to the logical fallacies and "thoughts without thinking" identified in the analysis?
- Can strict grounding constraints or "forced reference" mechanisms prevent CoT from defaulting to generic priors (the Einstellung Paradigm) when retrieving information from specification documents?

## Limitations

- Single LLM per agent architecture may not reflect real-world deployments where specialized models serve different roles
- Toy assembly tasks serve as proxy for manufacturing scenarios, domain transfer remains untested
- Weak correlation between human and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations suggests different evaluation methods capture different quality dimensions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Non-reasoning models outperform reasoning models on task completion accuracy in this agentic pipeline setting
- **Medium confidence**: CoT thought quality weakly correlates with output correctness
- **Low confidence**: CoT reasoning universally hinders explainability

## Next Checks

1. Test the same agentic pipeline with actual manufacturing assembly tasks to verify whether CoT degradation persists in realistic operational contexts
2. Replace the single LLM per agent with specialized models while maintaining CoT reasoning to isolate whether degradation stems from the reasoning process itself versus architectural constraints
3. Conduct a controlled experiment with both novice and expert users interacting with system outputs to measure whether CoT traces increase cognitive burden versus providing explanatory value
