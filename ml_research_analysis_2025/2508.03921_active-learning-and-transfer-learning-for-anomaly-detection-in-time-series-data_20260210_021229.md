# Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03921
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921
- Reference count: 12
- Best performance achieved using a single cluster model without clustering when combining active learning with transfer learning

## Executive Summary
This paper examines combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cloud time-series data. The study finds that clustering and active learning interact, with best performance occurring without clustering (single model). Active learning improves model performance, but at a slower rate than previously reported literature suggests, attributed to using separate sampling and testing data pools. As more points are selected for labeling, performance initially improves but eventually plateaus or declines, suggesting active learning effectively sequences useful points first.

## Method Summary
The method combines CORAL domain adaptation, K-means++ clustering, and pool-based active learning with uncertainty sampling. Source data is transformed to match target domain covariance before training Random Forest models. Active learning iteratively selects points based on prediction uncertainty (|P(norm)-P(anom)|) with a context diversity filter (±10 points), labels them, and retrains. The experimental design uses separate sampling and testing pools, maintaining constant test difficulty throughout.

## Key Results
- Clustering interacts with active learning, with single-cluster models (k=1) outperforming multi-cluster setups
- Active learning improves performance linearly at modest rates (0.00013-0.00026 F1 per point labeled)
- Performance plateaus or declines as more points are added, suggesting AL sequences most informative points first
- Transfer learning with active learning can outperform purely in-domain training using less target domain data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Active learning sequences the most informative data points first, causing performance improvements to tail off as less useful points are eventually added. The acquisition function ranks unlabeled points by model uncertainty (|P(norm) - P(anom)|). Points with highest uncertainty are selected first. As iterations progress, remaining points have lower information value, yielding diminishing returns.

### Mechanism 2
Clustering undermines active learning effectiveness by fragmenting labeled data across multiple models and exacerbating label imbalance in small clusters. As cluster count increases, selected points are distributed across more models, diluting per-model impact. Small clusters may lack anomalous examples, causing overconfident predictions that invalidate uncertainty-based selection.

### Mechanism 3
Separating sampling and testing pools yields slower but more valid improvement rates than prior work that conflated them. When sampling from the test set, each iteration shrinks and simplifies the test set by removing uncertain points. Separate pools maintain constant test difficulty, revealing true generalization gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Pool-based active learning**: Used to iteratively select batches from a fixed unlabeled pool using an acquisition function. Quick check: Can you explain why pool-based sampling enables batch selection for computational efficiency?
- **Uncertainty sampling with acquisition functions**: The core selection mechanism relies on ranking by prediction uncertainty. Quick check: Given a point with P(anom)=0.48, what is its uncertainty score and where would it rank?
- **Domain adaptation via CORAL**: Source data is transformed to match target domain covariance before training. Quick check: What does CORAL minimize between source and target distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Feature extraction (catch24) → Domain adaptation (CORAL) → Base model (Random Forest) → Clustering (optional K-means++) → Active learning loop (uncertainty ranking → diversity filter → batch selection) → Evaluation (F1, precision, recall)
- **Critical path**: 1) Merge source datasets → apply CORAL using target training split, 2) Train base RF on adapted source data, 3) For each AL iteration: score pool → rank by uncertainty → filter by context window → select → label → retrain, 4) Evaluate on target test set
- **Design tradeoffs**: Clustering may help transfer learning baseline but hurts AL effectiveness; larger batch sizes reduce retraining frequency but may include redundant points; more AL iterations improve performance but with diminishing returns
- **Failure signatures**: Performance plateaus/declines early → check sampling pool exhaustion; recall very low despite high precision → check cluster imbalance; F1 drops after many points → less useful points being forced in
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate single-cluster baseline: Train on adapted source data only, evaluate F1 on target test set, 2) Run 5 iterations of AL with 20 points/iteration (100 total): Plot F1 vs. points added, 3) Compare k=1 vs. k=5 clustering with 160 total AL points

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific characteristics of data points selected in the late stages of active learning cause model performance to degrade? The paper identifies the phenomenon but doesn't analyze the features or distributions of the specific points causing the performance decline.

### Open Question 2
Does the finding that active learning yields only modest, linear improvements hold true for deep learning architectures? The study relies exclusively on Random Forest models, leaving open whether the observed improvement rate is specific to this model capacity.

### Open Question 3
Is the negative interaction between clustering and active learning resolvable through cluster balancing or alternative uncertainty metrics? The authors suggest removing clustering entirely rather than attempting to fix the interaction through stratified clustering or weighted uncertainty acquisition functions.

## Limitations
- Separate sampling and testing pools design assumption lacks direct corpus validation
- Clustering-AL interaction analysis doesn't explore alternative clustering algorithms
- Context window diversity filter (±10 points) parameter choice not justified
- Catch24 feature extraction process not detailed for reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Clustering-AL interaction (k=1 optimal), active learning sequencing most informative points first, transfer learning outperforming pure in-domain training
- **Medium confidence**: Separate sampling/testing pools yielding more valid but slower improvement rates, linear improvement trend holding across data volumes
- **Low confidence**: Specific improvement rate values, optimal batch size recommendations, clustering algorithm choice (K-means++)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiment using the same test set for both sampling and evaluation to measure inflation in improvement rates when test sets are contaminated
2. Replace K-means++ with DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering to determine if the k=1 recommendation holds across clustering methods
3. Systematically vary the context window parameter (±5, ±10, ±20) and measure impact on active learning efficiency and diversity of selected points
