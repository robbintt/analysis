- InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperformed Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpassed HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT

## Executive Summary
InfiMed-Foundation introduces medical-specific multimodal large language models designed to overcome challenges in medical AI including domain expertise gaps, data quality issues, and computational inefficiency. The models employ a five-dimensional quality assessment framework for dataset curation and leverage multimodal sequence packing with reduced image patches to enhance training efficiency. A three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline progressively injects medical knowledge and ensures robust generalization across diverse medical tasks.

The research demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks through careful architectural design and training methodology. InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B achieves superior results compared to Qwen2.5VL-3B, while the 4B parameter version outperforms both HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT. The work establishes new benchmarks for compute-efficient medical AI systems capable of handling complex multimodal medical data.

## Method Summary
The InfiMed-Foundation models utilize a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline beginning with general instruction following, progressing to medical instruction following, and concluding with cross-distribution adaptation. This progressive approach allows the models to first master basic multimodal understanding before specializing in medical domains and finally generalizing across diverse medical contexts. The training process incorporates a five-dimensional quality assessment framework for dataset curation, ensuring high-quality medical data inputs. Computational efficiency is achieved through multimodal sequence packing and reduced image patch counts, enabling effective training on large-scale medical datasets while maintaining performance.

## Key Results
- InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperformed Qwen2.5VL-3B on medical visual question answering tasks
- InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpassed HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT in diagnostic performance
- Three-stage fine-tuning pipeline achieved state-of-the-art results across tested medical benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of InfiMed-Foundation stems from its systematic approach to addressing fundamental challenges in medical AI. By implementing a progressive fine-tuning strategy, the models build from general capabilities to specialized medical knowledge in a structured manner. The five-dimensional quality assessment framework ensures that training data meets stringent medical domain requirements, reducing noise and improving learning efficiency. Computational optimizations through sequence packing and reduced patches enable the models to handle the high-dimensional nature of medical imaging data without excessive resource requirements, making advanced medical AI more accessible and practical for real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal learning** - Combines text and image processing for comprehensive medical understanding
  - *Why needed*: Medical diagnosis requires integrating visual findings with clinical text
  - *Quick check*: Model correctly answers questions requiring both image and text analysis

- **Domain-specific fine-tuning** - Specialized training for medical contexts after general pre-training
  - *Why needed*: General models lack medical terminology and diagnostic reasoning capabilities
  - *Quick check*: Performance on medical benchmarks exceeds general domain models

- **Sequence packing optimization** - Efficient batching of multimodal inputs
  - *Why needed*: Reduces computational overhead while maintaining learning quality
  - *Quick check*: Training throughput improves without accuracy degradation

- **Cross-distribution adaptation** - Generalization across diverse medical datasets
  - *Why needed*: Medical data varies significantly across institutions and imaging modalities
  - *Quick check*: Consistent performance across multiple medical datasets

- **Quality assessment frameworks** - Systematic evaluation of training data quality
  - *Why needed*: Poor data quality severely impacts medical model reliability and safety
  - *Quick check*: Model performance correlates with data quality scores

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Vision Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> Text Decoder -> Output Layer

**Critical Path:**
Image input → Vision Encoder → Feature extraction → Multimodal fusion → Cross-attention with text → Text Decoder → Medical response generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The models balance parameter efficiency with performance through careful architectural choices. The 1.7B and 4B parameter versions demonstrate that smaller models can achieve state-of-the-art results when combined with specialized training approaches. The reduced image patch strategy sacrifices some spatial detail for computational efficiency, while sequence packing enables larger batch sizes without proportional memory increases.

**Failure Signatures:**
Models may struggle with rare medical conditions not well-represented in training data, exhibit sensitivity to image quality variations, and potentially show bias toward conditions more prevalent in training datasets. Cross-distribution adaptation failures may manifest as performance drops when encountering unfamiliar medical imaging protocols or institutional practices.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Validate basic multimodal understanding on standard VQA datasets before medical specialization
2. Test incremental improvements from each fine-tuning stage using held-out validation sets
3. Compare performance across different medical imaging modalities to assess generalization capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework comprehensiveness and cross-domain generalization remain uncertain
- Performance comparisons rely on reported benchmarks rather than direct head-to-head evaluations
- Five-dimensional quality assessment framework lacks detailed specification for independent verification

## Confidence

| Claim Type | Confidence Level |
|------------|------------------|
| Multi-stage fine-tuning improves medical task performance | High |
| Data quality improvements through five-dimensional framework | Medium |
| Computational efficiency gains from architectural modifications | Medium |
| Robustness to cross-distribution adaptation | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent evaluations using alternative medical benchmark suites (e.g., VQA-RAD, MIA-COVIS) to verify cross-dataset generalization
2. Perform resource usage benchmarking comparing training/inference time and memory consumption against Qwen2.5VL-3B and HuatuoGPT-V-7B under identical conditions
3. Execute systematic ablation studies isolating the impact of each data curation dimension to validate their individual contributions to model performance
