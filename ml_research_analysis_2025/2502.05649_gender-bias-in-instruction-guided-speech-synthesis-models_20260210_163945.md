core_contribution: This study investigates gender bias in instruction-guided text-to-speech
  models, specifically examining how models interpret occupation-related prompts like
  "Act like a nurse." Using four Parler-TTS models of different sizes, we analyzed
  109 occupations and found consistent gender stereotypes across models - male-dominated
  occupations like fisherman, electrician, and mechanic showed strong male bias, while
  female-associated jobs like nurse, nanny, and receptionist displayed female bias.
  We tested three mitigation methods including fairness interventions and diversity
  prompts, but found them ineffective and sometimes counterproductive, occasionally
  reversing bias directions or amplifying existing biases.

# Gender Bias in Instruction-Guided Speech Synthesis Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.05649
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05649
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Inference-time prompt-based methods failed to effectively mitigate gender bias in TTS models.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates gender bias in instruction-guided text-to-speech models by examining how models interpret occupation-related prompts like "Act like a nurse." Using four Parler-TTS models of different sizes, the authors analyzed 109 occupations and found consistent gender stereotypes across models. Male-dominated occupations showed strong male bias while female-associated jobs displayed female bias. Three mitigation methods were tested but found ineffective, occasionally reversing bias directions or amplifying existing biases. The results demonstrate that inference-time prompt-based mitigation approaches are neither sufficiently effective nor generalizable across different model architectures.

## Method Summary
The study used four Parler-TTS models (Large v1, Mini v1, Mini v0.1, Mini Expresso) to generate speech from 109 occupation prompts combined with 5 style templates. For each combination, 10 audio samples were generated using sampling parameters (Temperature=1.0, Top-p=0.9, Top-k=50). Gender classification was performed using a wav2vec2-based model fine-tuned for gender recognition. Bias was quantified by comparing occupation prompt distributions against three control groups (empty string, general prompts, neutral sentences) using Chi-square tests and standardized residuals. Three mitigation methods were tested: fairness interventions, demographic diversity prompts, and default gender voice settings.

## Key Results
- Parler-TTS models consistently generated gender-stereotyped voices for occupation prompts (e.g., male for "fisherman," female for "nurse")
- Inference-time prompt-based mitigation methods failed to reduce bias and sometimes caused overcompensation or direction reversal
- Bias patterns were consistent across all four model variants despite different sizes and architectures
- Control group baselines themselves exhibited inherent gender bias, complicating bias measurement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distributional Bias Amplification
If a TTS model is trained on a corpus where specific occupations and gendered voices co-occur more frequently, the model conditions its latent speaker identity space on these semantic correlations. The text encoder maps semantic prompts to a latent space where training data links "nurse" contexts with female speakers, amplifying this probability during inference.

### Mechanism 2: Inference-Time Conditioning Failure
Appending fairness instructions fails to mitigate bias because the model's text encoder processes the "occupation" token with higher attention weight than the abstract "fairness" token. The "fairness" prompt acts as a weak modifier that fails to move generation out of the high-probability region defined by the occupation token.

### Mechanism 3: Control Group Baseline Drift
The observed "occupational bias" is calculated as a deviation from control groups that themselves exhibit "inherent bias." The model has a prior probability for generating a specific gender, and the standard residuals measure the shift from this baseline rather than true neutrality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Chi-Square Test & Standardized Residuals:** Used to quantify bias magnitude as deviation from expected control distribution. *Why needed:* Cannot interpret results without understanding standardized residuals represent magnitude of deviation in standard deviations. *Quick check:* If control is 50/50 Male/Female and "Nurse" is 100% Female, would standardized residual be low or high?

- **Cross-Modal Conditioning:** TTS maps text to audio, so bias involves how semantics control acoustic features perceived as gender. *Why needed:* Understanding that text prompts modify latent vectors controlling speaker decoder, not directly changing audio wave amplitude. *Quick check:* Does a text prompt directly change audio wave amplitude or modify a latent vector?

- **Classifier Bias Loop:** The wav2vec2-based classifier used for gender recognition may have its own biases that compound TTS model bias. *Why needed:* Understanding that classifier artifacts could be misattributed to TTS bias. *Quick check:* Why did authors validate classifier with human evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Parler-TTS (text encoder + decoder) -> Gender Classifier (wav2vec2-based) -> Chi-square Analysis

**Critical path:** 1. Define Occupation Prompt -> 2. Generate Audio (Parler-TTS) -> 3. Classify Audio (Gender Recognition) -> 4. Compare distribution to Control Group (Chi-Square)

**Design tradeoffs:** Binary classification limits analysis to male/female categories; prompt-based mitigation chosen for inference-time ease but proven ineffective

**Failure signatures:** Overcompensation causing extreme gender ratios (e.g., 98% female for "mechanic"); control group instability with varying baseline gender ratios

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Generate 100 samples with empty string prompt to establish "Inherent Bias" baseline
2. Take neutral occupation (e.g., "Manager") and vary phrasing to measure explicit instruction override
3. Validate gender classifier on balanced real-world voices to ensure bias detection accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Training-time interventions:** Can training-time or architectural interventions effectively mitigate occupational gender bias where inference-time prompting failed? The authors conclude inference-time methods are ineffective and highlight the "need for more effective approaches."

2. **Reference audio conditioning:** Do observed gender bias patterns generalize to instruction-guided TTS models that utilize reference audio as additional conditioning input? The analysis is restricted to text-only models due to availability constraints.

3. **Non-binary gender representation:** How does gender bias manifest when the target voice is non-binary or doesn't fit male/female classification? Current speech recognition models used for evaluation are trained on binary data, making it impossible to measure bias outside this spectrum.

## Limitations

- Binary gender classification framework excludes non-binary representations and oversimplifies gender perception
- Study relies on occupation-gender associations from English-speaking contexts, limiting cultural generalizability
- wav2vec2-based gender classifier may introduce cascading bias that compounds rather than measures TTS model bias
- Effectiveness of mitigation strategies tested only at inference time, leaving training-time interventions unexplored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core finding of consistent gender stereotypes in Parler-TTS models is well-supported by statistical evidence
- **Medium Confidence:** Interpretation that biases reflect societal stereotypes amplified by training data is plausible but not definitively proven
- **Low Confidence:** Specific mechanism by which occupation prompts trigger gender associations in latent space remains speculative

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier Validation on Real Voices:** Run gender classification model on balanced dataset of real human voices (e.g., VCTK corpus) to verify it doesn't harbor its own gender stereotypes

2. **Cross-Cultural Occupation Analysis:** Test same occupation prompts with speakers from different cultural backgrounds or using occupation lists from non-Western contexts

3. **Latent Space Probing:** Analyze text encoder's attention patterns and embeddings when processing occupation versus neutral prompts to identify where gender associations emerge
