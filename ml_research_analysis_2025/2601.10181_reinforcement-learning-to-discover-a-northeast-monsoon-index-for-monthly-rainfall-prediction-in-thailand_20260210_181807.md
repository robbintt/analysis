- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10181

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving long-term monthly rainfall prediction in Thailand by developing a novel NorthEast monsoon (NE) climate index derived from sea surface temperature (SST). The study employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning agent to optimize the calculation areas for the NE index, exploring discrete shifts and resizing operations of SST rectangles. Rainfall stations are classified into 12 distinct clusters to capture regional patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the optimized NE index into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models significantly enhances predictive skill, with notable reductions in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for 12-month-ahead forecasts across most clusters.

## Method Summary
The method optimizes SST-based NorthEast monsoon index calculation areas using a DQN to improve 12-month-ahead rainfall prediction in Thailand via LSTM models. The process involves hierarchical clustering of 74 rainfall stations into 12 clusters, followed by DQN optimization of SST rectangle coordinates (Areas A and B) to maximize correlation with rainfall during both NE onset and retreat periods. The optimized NE index is then incorporated into LSTM models as an additional feature alongside traditional climate indices. The DQN uses discrete actions for ±0.5° shifts and resizing operations, with a composite reward function averaging squared correlations from both seasonal phases.

## Key Results
- DQN-optimized NE index significantly improves 12-month-ahead rainfall prediction accuracy
- RMSE reductions range from 4.7% to 12.2% in southern Thailand and 4.4% to 11.7% in upper Thailand
- NE index shows strong correlations with rainfall during both NE onset (Oct-Mar) and retreat (Apr-Sep) periods
- Shift-only action space outperformed shift-and-resize configuration in objective score optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A Deep Q-Network (DQN) can effectively navigate the search space of geographic coordinates to identify optimal Sea Surface Temperature (SST) regions that correlate with local rainfall, outperforming static baseline areas. The DQN agent treats the selection of SST bounding boxes as a discrete action space (shift/resize). By maximizing a reward signal based on the squared correlation ($R^2$) with rainfall, the agent iteratively updates its policy to shift these boxes away from low-impact zones toward high-impact zones.

### Mechanism 2
Optimizing for a composite "season-aware" objective function allows a single index to capture the bi-phasic nature of the monsoon (onset vs. retreat). The reward function is formulated as the average of the squared correlations during the NE onset (Oct-Mar in Southern Thailand) and NE retreat (Apr-Sep in Upper Thailand). This forces the agent to find a geographic middle ground for the SST boxes that explains variance in both distinct seasonal phases rather than maximizing for just one.

### Mechanism 3
Incorporating the optimized NE index as an input feature reduces long-horizon prediction error in LSTM models by providing an exogenous leading signal. The NE index ($Z(t)$) acts as a compressed representation of oceanic forcing. When fed into the LSTM alongside traditional indices (like ENSO/ONI), it provides a specific regional signal that improves the model's state estimation for the 12-month-ahead forecast horizon.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Q-Learning & Reward Shaping
  - Why needed here: The core engine of this paper is a DQN. Without understanding how agents learn to map states to actions via rewards, one cannot debug why the agent selects specific SST coordinates.
  - Quick check question: If the agent maximizes correlation ($R^2$) but the resulting index has a negative correlation with rainfall, does the reward function need to change, or is negative correlation acceptable?

- **Concept**: Teleconnections & Climate Indices
  - Why needed here: The model predicts rainfall using indices like ONI and the proposed NE index. Understanding that these are distant climate patterns (SST) used to predict local weather is crucial for feature selection.
  - Quick check question: Why use SST-based indices rather than direct wind speed data for long-term (12-month) prediction?

- **Concept**: Hierarchical Clustering
  - Why needed here: The paper does not predict for individual stations but for 12 clusters. This groups stations with similar rainfall patterns to create a more robust target signal for the RL agent.
  - Quick check question: Why does the method use clustering based on rainfall statistics rather than administrative boundaries (provinces)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: OISST/SST Data -> Hierarchical Clustering -> DQN Agent -> Optimized Coordinates -> NE Index Calculation -> LSTM Model -> Rainfall Forecast
- **Critical path**: The reward calculation inside the DQN environment. The agent proposes new coordinates, and the environment must instantly calculate the SST difference for the historical timeline, correlate it with the clustered rainfall, and return the Q(A,B) score.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Shift-only vs. Shift-and-Resize: Table I shows "Shift-only" achieved a higher objective score (0.497) than "Shift-and-resize" (0.412). Restricting the agent to translation (shift) without changing box size may reduce the search space variance, leading to more stable convergence.
- **Failure signatures**: Index Overfitting: High correlation during training but low predictive skill in LSTM test phase. Land Contamination: Agent drifts to coordinates over land, invalidating SST values. Sign Flipping: Cluster 11 shows positive correlation while most are negative.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline Reproduction: Implement "Initial Areas" calculation to verify low objective score. 2) Ablation on Action Space: Train shift-only vs shift-and-resize agents to verify performance differences. 3) LSTM Sensitivity Check: Train LSTM without NE index to replicate higher RMSE baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can spatiotemporal deep learning architectures further enhance prediction skills compared to the LSTM baseline when utilizing the discovered NE index? The Conclusion explicitly suggests future work should employ spatiotemporal models such as Convolution-LSTM, Graph Neural Networks, or Neural Operators. This remains unresolved because the current study evaluates the index solely using LSTM models, which may not fully exploit the spatial structure of the monsoon data.

### Open Question 2
How can the NE index formulation be modified to capture rainfall patterns in the excluded clusters (3, 7, 10, and 11)? Table III and text note results for these clusters are excluded because absolute correlations of the NE index were lower than 0.6. The current season-aware objective function optimizes for onset and retreat periods that likely do not align with the specific micro-climates or drivers of these excluded regions.

### Open Question 3
Does the discrete action space (0.5° shifts) of the DQN limit the precision of the SST boundaries compared to continuous optimization methods? The paper mentions DDPG is designed for continuous action spaces but selects DQN for discrete actions, potentially missing optimal coordinates between grid points. It's unclear if the "Shift-only" configuration's success is constrained by the 0.5° step size.

## Limitations

- The DQN agent's neural network architecture (layers, units, activation functions) is unspecified, making it difficult to assess whether reported Q-scores are near-optimal.
- The composite reward function assumes a single SST region can explain both onset and retreat phases, but the physical mechanisms may differ.
- LSTM improvement relies on strict feature selection (|R| > 0.6), which may discard weak but potentially synergistic predictors.
- Training and validation folds are based on single years, which may not be robust to inter-annual variability.

## Confidence

- **High**: The DQN framework and reward formulation are clearly specified; hierarchical clustering approach is standard and well-documented.
- **Medium**: Reported RMSE reductions (4.7-12.2%) are plausible given strong correlations in Table II, but exact LSTM training setup is unclear.
- **Low**: Reproducibility of RL training outcomes depends heavily on unspecified hyperparameters (replay buffer size, target update frequency, initial box coordinates).

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Re-run DQN training with varied replay buffer sizes and target network update frequencies to assess stability of final Q(A,B) scores.
2. **Phase-Specific Index Test**: Train two separate RL agents—one optimizing for NE onset only, one for NE retreat only—and compare their individual and combined predictive performance against the composite index.
3. **LSTM Ablation with Weak Features**: Relax the |R| > 0.6 filter and include all available climate indices in LSTM to test whether weak but diverse predictors improve generalization beyond reported RMSE gains.
