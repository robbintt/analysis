- The Speech Continuation task reveals systematic voice-quality bias in speech foundation models, with female voices showing stronger reversion to modal phonation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Speech Continuation (SC) task as a novel diagnostic tool for detecting voice-based bias in speech foundation models. The authors evaluate three models—SpiritLM (base and expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT—across gender and phonation types (breathy, creaky, end-creak) using a combined dataset of spoken StereoSet prompts and neutral open-ended prompts. The methodology assesses speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that when semantic coherence is sufficiently high, significant gender effects emerge on metrics like agency and sentence polarity, with female voices showing stronger reversion to modal phonation. The study demonstrates that the SC task effectively reveals socially relevant representational biases in speech generation systems.

## Method Summary
The authors develop the Speech Continuation task by having models continue spoken prompts while controlling for semantic coherence. They evaluate three foundation models using a dataset combining spoken StereoSet prompts with neutral open-ended prompts. The evaluation measures speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics including agency, topic, sentence polarity, and stereotype scores. Gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) are systematically varied as bias factors. The analysis focuses on conditions where semantic coherence exceeds 0.6 to isolate bias effects from model performance limitations.

## Key Results
- Gender effects on agency and sentence polarity emerge only when semantic coherence exceeds 0.6 threshold
- Female voice continuations show stronger reversion to modal phonation compared to male voice continuations
- Voice quality preservation remains poor across all models, limiting ability to detect VQ-based semantic bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Speech Continuation task works by creating controlled conditions where models must generate speech continuations while preserving speaker characteristics and avoiding bias. By requiring semantic coherence thresholds, the method isolates bias effects from model performance limitations. The task captures both acoustic properties (voice quality) and semantic properties (text-based bias metrics) simultaneously, allowing researchers to detect when models systematically alter speaker characteristics in biased ways.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speech foundation models**: Need to understand how these models process and generate speech compared to text-only models. Quick check: Review model architectures and training objectives.
- **Voice quality dimensions**: Requires knowledge of phonation types (breathy, creaky, modal) and their acoustic properties. Quick check: Compare spectrograms of different phonation types.
- **Bias measurement in speech**: Understanding how text-based bias metrics apply to speech outputs and the relationship between acoustic and semantic bias. Quick check: Map text bias metrics to speech-specific contexts.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** StereoSet dataset + neutral prompts -> Pre-processing -> Model input -> Continuation generation -> Speaker similarity analysis -> Voice quality metrics -> Text-based bias metrics -> Statistical analysis

**Critical path:** Data preparation → Semantic coherence filtering → Model generation → Multi-modal evaluation → Bias detection

**Design tradeoffs:** The SC task trades ecological validity for controlled bias detection. By focusing on short continuations with strict coherence requirements, the method may miss longer-form bias patterns but gains precision in identifying systematic speaker characteristic alterations.

**Failure signatures:** Poor voice quality preservation across models suggests either architectural limitations or training data imbalances. The emergence of gender effects only at high coherence thresholds indicates potential confounding between model capacity and bias.

**First experiments:** 1) Test additional foundation models with varying architectures, 2) Expand speaker diversity beyond binary gender categories, 3) Investigate intersectional effects between gender and other speaker attributes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Will voice quality emerge as a significant source of semantic bias in continuations as speech foundation models improve their ability to capture and preserve phonation characteristics?
- Basis in paper: "Yet the low VQ similarity across models suggests this reflects model limitations rather than absence of bias. VQ may emerge as a bias source once models capture it more effectively."
- Why unresolved: Current models failed to preserve voice quality adequately, making it impossible to determine whether VQ genuinely has no effect on semantic bias or whether the null result is due to model limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-running the evaluation on future SC models with demonstrated VQ preservation capability; observing significant VQ effects on text-based bias metrics would confirm this hypothesis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying causes of the voice-quality regularization bias that disproportionately suppresses non-modal phonation in female voices?
- Basis in paper: The authors document that "continuations revert toward modal phonation more strongly for female prompts than for male ones, revealing a systematic voice-quality bias" and call this "a key issue to monitor and mitigate."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies and quantifies the bias but does not investigate whether it stems from training data distributions, model architecture, or learned societal expectations about how women "should" sound.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying training data composition; analysis of internal representations during continuation generation; comparison across models trained on different corpora.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do other speaker identity dimensions beyond binary gender (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, accent, socioeconomic markers) interact with continuation behavior and bias?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges it "systematically varied voice quality—a socially salient but previously overlooked dimension" yet focused exclusively on gender and phonation type as bias factors.
- Why unresolved: Intersectional bias research in speech generation is nascent; the methodology introduced here could extend to other demographic factors, but this remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the SC probe methodology with controlled manipulations of additional speaker attributes and measuring effects on semantic coherence, text bias metrics, and acoustic preservation.

## Limitations
- The SC task has not been independently validated for reliability beyond the specific models tested
- Gender bias findings depend on semantic coherence thresholds, suggesting potential confounding by model capacity
- Dataset diversity and voice type representation limitations constrain generalizability
- The methodology does not address intersectional bias dimensions or other demographic factors

## Confidence
- Methodology sensitivity to bias detection: High
- Gender bias findings reliability: Medium
- Generalizability to other models and contexts: Low
- Ecological validity of SC task: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the SC task with additional foundation models and larger, more diverse speaker pools to test robustness of gender and phonation bias findings
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether SC-generated continuations are perceived as biased by listeners across different demographic groups
3. Extend the framework to test intersectional bias (e.g., gender × accent, gender × age) and compare results with existing bias benchmarks in speech and language models
