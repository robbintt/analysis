# LLM-based Personalized Portfolio Recommender: Integrating Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Investment Strategy Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12922
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12922
- Reference count: 0
- L-PPR achieves 73.8% higher annualized return and 33.2% lower maximum drawdown than MVO

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the LLM-based Personalized Portfolio Recommender (L-PPR), a framework that integrates Large Language Models and reinforcement learning to optimize personalized investment strategies. The system uses an LLM-driven conversational agent to infer user risk profiles from natural-language interactions, which are then combined with market data to condition a PPO-based portfolio optimization engine. Experiments on a multi-asset dataset show that L-PPR outperforms traditional and deep learning baselines, achieving 73.8% higher annualized return and 33.2% lower maximum drawdown than MVO, with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.45, Information Ratio of 0.78, and User Alignment Score of 0.89.

## Method Summary
L-PPR combines LLM-based conversational agents for user risk profiling with PPO-based reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization. The LLM interprets natural-language user inputs to infer risk tolerance, which is then integrated with market data to condition the PPO agent. The PPO agent learns to allocate assets dynamically based on both user preferences and market conditions, creating a personalized investment strategy that adapts to individual risk profiles while optimizing for performance metrics.

## Key Results
- 73.8% higher annualized return compared to traditional Mean-Variance Optimization
- 33.2% lower maximum drawdown than MVO baseline
- Sharpe Ratio of 1.45 and Information Ratio of 0.78 with User Alignment Score of 0.89

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of LLM-based user profiling with reinforcement learning enables truly personalized portfolio optimization that adapts to individual risk preferences. The conversational interface allows for natural risk assessment without requiring users to complete traditional questionnaires, while the PPO agent continuously learns optimal allocations based on both market dynamics and user-specific constraints. This dual-input approach addresses the limitation of traditional methods that optimize for generic risk-return profiles rather than individual preferences.

## Foundational Learning
1. **PPO Reinforcement Learning** - Why needed: Enables dynamic portfolio optimization that adapts to changing market conditions. Quick check: Verify convergence and stability of PPO training.
2. **LLM-based Risk Profiling** - Why needed: Provides natural language interface for user preference elicitation. Quick check: Validate inference accuracy against established risk assessment tools.
3. **Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization** - Why needed: Handles complex asset allocation across diverse investment vehicles. Quick check: Confirm constraint satisfaction and diversification benefits.
4. **Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics** - Why needed: Enables comprehensive evaluation beyond simple returns. Quick check: Compare Sharpe and Information ratios across different market regimes.
5. **User Alignment Scoring** - Why needed: Quantifies personalization effectiveness beyond financial metrics. Quick check: Correlate alignment scores with actual user satisfaction.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** LLM Conversation Agent -> Risk Profile Extractor -> PPO Portfolio Optimizer -> Performance Evaluator
**Critical Path:** User Input → LLM Risk Inference → PPO Training → Portfolio Recommendation → Performance Monitoring
**Design Tradeoffs:** Balances personalization depth against computational efficiency, chooses PPO for stability over more complex RL algorithms
**Failure Signatures:** LLM mis-profiling leads to suboptimal allocations, PPO overfitting to historical data, poor generalization to new market regimes
**First Experiments:** 1) Test LLM risk inference accuracy against standard questionnaires, 2) Validate PPO convergence and stability, 3) Compare personalization metrics across different user segments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Backtest-only evaluation may not capture real-world performance or different market regimes
- User Alignment Score metric lacks external validation or comparison to established personalization measures
- LLM risk profiling accuracy is assumed but not empirically validated against ground-truth profiles

## Confidence
- Performance Metrics: Medium (simulation-based, potential overfitting)
- Personalization Claims: Medium (no user validation studies)
- Methodological Novelty: High (innovative integration of LLM with RL)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct out-of-sample testing on data beyond 2021, including stress periods such as the 2020 COVID-19 market crash and 2022 inflation shock, to assess robustness.
2. Validate the LLM's risk profile inference by comparing its outputs against established psychometric risk assessment tools or real user feedback in a controlled experiment.
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the LLM component versus the PPO optimizer, and test alternative user-profiling methods to benchmark the claimed improvements in personalization and performance.
