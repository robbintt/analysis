# Neuro-Symbolic Learning for Galois Groups: Unveiling Probabilistic Trends in Polynomials

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20844
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic approach classifies Galois groups of sextic polynomials by integrating neural networks with algebraic invariants, achieving substantially higher accuracy than pure numerical methods and uncovering novel distributional trends.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic approach to classify Galois groups of polynomials by integrating classical Galois theory with machine learning. The method combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning—leveraging invariants like root distributions, signatures, and resolvents—to outperform purely numerical methods in accuracy and interpretability. Focusing on sextic polynomials with height ≤ 6, the authors analyze a database of 53,972 irreducible examples and uncover novel distributional trends, such as 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group C6 spanning just seven invariant-defined equivalence classes. The work provides first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lays groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, the results offer implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher-degree classifications.

## Method Summary
The approach trains a feedforward neural network on 53,972 irreducible sextic polynomials (height ≤ 6) with Galois groups computed via GAP/resolvent methods. The network integrates symbolic preprocessing layers that compute real root counts (Sturm sequences), signatures via factorization mod small primes (p=2,3,5,7), discriminant properties, and resolvent constraints. These algebraic features are concatenated with polynomial coefficients and fed through three dense layers (64 neurons each, ReLU, softmax output) trained with Adam optimizer (100 epochs, cross-entropy loss). The neuro-symbolic architecture substantially outperforms purely numerical baselines (<10% accuracy), achieving improved classification while respecting Galois-theoretic constraints.

## Key Results
- Neuro-symbolic approach outperforms pure numerical methods, which achieved <10% accuracy on the sextic dataset
- 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group C6 span only seven equivalence classes under GL₂(Q)-invariants
- Database reveals novel probabilistic trends in Galois group distributions under height constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Symbolic Constraint Injection
Integrating mathematical invariants as symbolic layers constrains the hypothesis space, preventing the network from learning patterns that violate Galois theory. Raw polynomial coefficients lack discriminative structure for Galois groups (pure ML achieved <10% accuracy). Symbolic layers compute invariant properties—signatures, discriminants, root counts—that are provably linked to group structure. These outputs are concatenated with learned features, ensuring predictions respect algebraic constraints.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Candidate Refinement via Signature Filtering
Factoring polynomials modulo small primes provides a signature that incrementally eliminates candidate groups, reducing classification complexity before neural processing. Dedekind's theorem links factorization patterns mod p to permutation types in the Galois group. The signature layer compares observed factorization patterns against known signatures for each transitive subgroup, progressively pruning `grps`. When `|grps| = 1`, classification terminates without neural inference.

### Mechanism 3: Equivalence Class Compression via Invariants
GL₂(Q)-invariants compress the polynomial space into equivalence classes, revealing that many polynomials share identical Galois-relevant structure. Binary sextics are mapped to weighted projective space via Igusa invariants (J₂, J₄, J₆, J₁₀) and absolute invariants (t₁, t₂, t₃). Polynomials with identical invariants are GL₂(Q)-equivalent, meaning they share the same moduli. The finding that 20 C₆ polynomials span only 7 equivalence classes suggests the network can learn from invariant representations rather than raw coefficients.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transitive subgroups of Sₙ**: Classification targets are specifically the transitive subgroups of Sₙ (16 for S₆). Without knowing this lattice, you cannot interpret output labels or design the refinement logic.
  - Quick check: Can you sketch the containment relationships among C₆, D₆, A₄, and S₄ within S₆?

- **Dedekind's theorem on reduction modulo p**: The signature layer depends on this theorem to translate factorization patterns mod p into constraints on the Galois group's cycle structure.
  - Quick check: If f(x) mod 5 factors as a product of two irreducible quadratics and two linears, what permutation type must G contain?

- **Discriminant parity and Aₙ containment**: The discriminant layer determines whether G ⊆ Aₙ by testing if √Δ ∈ Q, a critical distinction for resolving ambiguities between groups like S₄(6d) and S₄(6c).
  - Quick check: For a polynomial with discriminant Δ = 144, what does this imply about A₆ containment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: [Polynomial coefficients] → [Symbolic Layer 1: Real Roots] → [Symbolic Layer 2: Discriminant] → [Numerical Layer 1] → [Symbolic Layer 3: Signature] → [Numerical Layer 2] → [Fusion Layer] → [Output: Softmax over candidates in `grps`] → [Post-processing]
- **Critical path**: Signature computation (Symbolic Layer 3) is the bottleneck—it requires factoring each polynomial modulo multiple primes. Precompute signatures for the full dataset before training.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Resolvent inclusion omitted in initial implementation due to computational cost (degree-30 polynomials). Trade accuracy for tractability. Using only p ∈ {2,3,5,7} is fast but may miss distinguishing signatures; larger prime sets improve refinement at O(log p) factoring cost. Height bound h ≤ 6 yields 53,972 samples; scaling to h ≤ 10 would increase dataset size ~10× but require recomputing all invariants.
- **Failure signatures**: Stalled refinement (`|grps| > 1` after all symbolic layers)—network forced to guess among ambiguous candidates. Invariant collision—two polynomials with different Galois groups map to same invariants (should not happen for GL₂(Q)-equivalence but check for numerical precision errors). Signature mismatch—observed factorization pattern not in lookup table—indicates either bug in factorization or incomplete signature database.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline reproduction: Train the described architecture on the sextic dataset (h ≤ 6), confirming improvement over pure numerical baseline. Target: >60% accuracy. 2) Ablation on symbolic layers: Remove each symbolic layer individually to quantify its contribution. Hypothesis: Signature layer provides largest gain. 3) Generalization test: Train on h ≤ 5, evaluate on h = 6 polynomials. Assess whether learned patterns transfer to unseen heights.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can AI models automatically determine the necessary systems of resolvents to uniquely identify a polynomial's Galois group? The conclusion states a "significant challenge for future work involves designing AI models capable of determining systems of resolvents that uniquely identify a polynomial's Galois group." Constructing and applying resolvents remains computationally demanding and is currently tailored to specific degrees rather than automated.

- Is it more effective to train models on raw polynomial coefficients or strictly on their algebraic invariants? The authors note purely numerical methods failed (<10% accuracy) and explicitly ask on Page 7: "Is it worth it to have a database with all irreducible polynomials or simply their invariants?" While invariants proved useful, the trade-off between the data reduction of invariants and the information loss from raw coefficients is not fully quantified.

- Can machine learning derive explicit radical formulas for polynomials with solvable Galois groups across any degree? The conclusion identifies "a further challenge... to develop AI models that, for any given degree where the Galois group is solvable, derive explicit formulas to solve the polynomial by radicals." Galois theory assures existence, but the actual construction of formulas (entailing nested roots and field extensions) remains a complex, manual case-by-case endeavor.

## Limitations

- Symbolic constraints (resolvents, signatures) become computationally prohibitive for higher-degree polynomials, limiting scalability beyond sextics
- Claims about uncovering "novel probabilistic trends" rest entirely on the specific height-6 dataset; generalization to unconstrained or larger-height polynomials remains unvalidated
- Equivalence class compression finding (20 C₆ polynomials spanning 7 invariant classes) lacks statistical significance testing against randomized polynomial ensembles

## Confidence

- High: Neuro-symbolic approach outperforms pure numerical methods on the sextic dataset; symbolic layers provide measurable accuracy gains
- Medium: Claims about uncovering "novel probabilistic trends" in Galois group distributions; these are dataset-specific observations rather than proven theorems
- Low: Assertions about implications for higher-degree classifications and solvability by radicals—these are speculative extensions beyond the sextic focus

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical significance test**: Compare the observed C₆ equivalence class compression against randomized polynomial datasets with identical height distributions to assess whether this is a genuine structural phenomenon or an artifact of the sampling method.

2. **Generalization benchmark**: Train the same architecture on quintic polynomials (h ≤ 6), then test on septic polynomials (h = 6) to evaluate cross-degree transfer of learned patterns and identify breaking points in the symbolic layer refinement.

3. **Signature completeness analysis**: Systematically increase the prime set beyond {2,3,5,7} and measure how refinement accuracy improves; identify the minimal prime set that guarantees unique signatures for all 16 transitive subgroups of S₆.
