# FEAT: A Multi-Agent Forensic AI System with Domain-Adapted Large Language Model for Automated Cause-of-Death Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.07950
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07950
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-agent AI system automates forensic cause-of-death analysis with 3.2% accuracy improvement in long-form autopsy analyses and 10.7% in concise conclusions versus state-of-the-art systems

## Executive Summary
FEAT is a multi-agent AI system designed to automate forensic cause-of-death analysis through domain-adapted large language models. The system decomposes complex forensic cases into specialized subtasks handled by role-specific agents, integrating tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, and human-in-the-loop feedback. Evaluated on 7,748 medicolegal cases across six Chinese provinces, FEAT demonstrates superior performance to existing AI systems in both comprehensive autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions, with expert pathologists validating outputs as comparable to human experts.

## Method Summary
FEAT employs a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of forensic analysis including evidence extraction, correlation analysis, hypothesis generation, and conclusion synthesis. The system utilizes a domain-adapted large language model fine-tuned on medicolegal case data, enhanced with tool-augmented reasoning capabilities for accessing forensic databases and analytical tools. Hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation enables context-aware information retrieval across multiple levels of forensic evidence, while human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms allow expert pathologists to refine and validate system outputs. The system processes medicolegal cases through coordinated agent interactions, producing both detailed autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions suitable for official documentation.

## Key Results
- 3.2% accuracy improvement in long-form autopsy analyses compared to state-of-the-art AI systems
- 10.7% accuracy improvement in concise cause-of-death conclusions versus existing systems
- Demonstrated robust generalization across six Chinese provinces and diverse cause-of-death categories
- Expert pathologists validated FEAT outputs as comparable to human expert analyses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent architecture enables parallel processing of complex forensic tasks through specialized agents, each optimized for specific analytical functions. Domain adaptation ensures the language model understands forensic terminology and reasoning patterns unique to medicolegal contexts. Hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation provides contextual awareness by accessing relevant evidence at multiple granularities, while tool augmentation extends reasoning capabilities beyond text generation. The human-in-the-loop component enables continuous learning and refinement, ensuring system outputs align with expert standards and legal requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Multiple specialized AI agents work in parallel on different forensic analysis aspects, enabling comprehensive case evaluation through distributed expertise
- **Domain adaptation techniques**: Fine-tuning large language models on specialized medicolegal datasets improves performance on domain-specific tasks and terminology
- **Hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation**: Multi-level information retrieval provides contextual evidence at varying granularities, enhancing analytical depth
- **Tool-augmented reasoning**: Integration of external forensic tools and databases extends AI capabilities beyond pure language modeling
- **Human-in-the-loop feedback systems**: Expert validation and refinement mechanisms ensure outputs meet professional standards and legal requirements
- **Forensic evidence correlation**: Systematic analysis of multiple evidence types to identify causal relationships and establish cause-of-death chains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Evidence Ingestion -> Agent Coordination Layer -> Specialized Forensic Agents -> Tool-Augmented Reasoning Module -> Hierarchical RAG System -> Human Validation Interface -> Final Output Generation

**Critical Path:**
Case input → Evidence extraction agent → Correlation analysis agent → Hypothesis generation agent → Conclusion synthesis agent → Human expert review → Final cause-of-death determination

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system prioritizes accuracy and expert validation over real-time processing speed, accepting longer analysis times to ensure comprehensive forensic evaluation. The multi-agent approach increases complexity but enables specialized reasoning that single-agent systems cannot achieve. Human-in-the-loop feedback improves quality but requires expert time investment.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incomplete evidence correlation leading to missed causal relationships
- Over-reliance on statistical patterns without considering rare forensic scenarios
- Tool integration failures causing incomplete database queries
- Human feedback bottlenecks slowing the validation process
- Domain adaptation limitations with novel or emerging cause-of-death patterns

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Run a single case through all agent layers to verify end-to-end processing flow and identify integration issues
2. Test tool-augmented reasoning with controlled forensic database queries to validate accuracy and completeness
3. Conduct parallel human validation on identical cases to establish baseline expert agreement rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Geographic and demographic specificity of the medicolegal dataset raises questions about generalizability to other forensic systems
- Limited transparency in baseline system comparisons regarding tool augmentation and hierarchical retrieval capabilities
- Insufficient methodological detail in expert validation process, including inter-rater reliability metrics and pathologist experience levels
- Single healthcare system evaluation limits conclusions about cross-cultural or cross-jurisdictional applicability

## Confidence
- System architecture and technical implementation: High
- Internal validation results on the Chinese dataset: High
- Performance relative to baselines: Medium
- External validity and generalizability: Low
- Expert validation methodology: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-jurisdictional evaluation using forensic datasets from different countries with varying legal frameworks and autopsy protocols to assess generalizability
2. Implement a blinded expert validation study with standardized rubrics measuring inter-rater reliability between FEAT outputs, human experts, and inter-expert agreement
3. Perform ablation studies systematically removing individual components (tool augmentation, hierarchical RAG, human-in-the-loop feedback) to quantify their specific contributions to overall performance
