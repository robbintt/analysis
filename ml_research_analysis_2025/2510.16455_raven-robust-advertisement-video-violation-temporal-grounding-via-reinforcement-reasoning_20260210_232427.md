# RAVEN: Robust Advertisement Video Violation Temporal Grounding via Reinforcement Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16455
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16455
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Achieves superior performance in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization with strong generalization capabilities

## Executive Summary
RAVEN addresses the challenge of precise temporal grounding for advertisement video violation detection, where existing methods struggle with noisy annotations and limited generalization. The core method integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. A hierarchical reward mechanism ensures precise temporal localization and consistent category prediction. Experiments show RAVEN achieves superior performance in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization, with strong generalization capabilities and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. Online A/B testing validates practical applicability, demonstrating significant improvements in precision and recall.

## Method Summary
RAVEN employs a three-stage curriculum reinforcement learning framework built on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B MLLM. The method uses GRPO to optimize structured outputs with `<thinking>` and `<answer>` tags, enabling emergent reasoning without Chain-of-Thought training data. A hierarchical reward system combines format compliance, binarized IoU thresholds, boundary alignment via exponential penalty, and category consistency checks. The curriculum progressively exposes the model to precise, coarse, then mixed annotations to build robustness while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The approach achieves strong performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain violation categories while maintaining temporal grounding precision.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization compared to baselines
- Demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different violation categories
- Effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting during training
- Validated through online A/B testing showing significant improvements in precision and recall

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Curriculum reinforcement learning enables robust training on noisy annotations while preserving generalization. The three-stage training progressively exposes the model to increasing annotation noise—starting with precise data to establish foundation, moving to coarse data to build robustness, then fine-tuning on mixed data to balance accuracy and generalization. This prevents overfitting to annotation noise while maintaining learned capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
Structured thinking tags combined with GRPO enable emergent reasoning without explicit Chain-of-Thought training data. By enforcing output structure through format rewards and optimizing via relative policy comparison across sampled outputs, GRPO incentivizes the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps that improve reward outcomes. The model self-discovers useful reasoning patterns.

### Mechanism 3
Hierarchical reward decomposition provides dense training signals for both coarse localization and fine-grained boundary precision. Multiple rewards operate at different granularities—IoU reward (binary, 0.5 threshold) handles coarse position; Boundary Alignment reward (continuous exponential) refines edges; Category Consistency reward ensures semantic coherence. This multi-scale signal guides learning across abstraction levels.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** GRPO samples multiple outputs per input, computes rewards for each, then optimizes relative preferences—avoiding the need for explicit reward models or value functions.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how GRPO differs from PPO in terms of baseline estimation?

- **Concept: Temporal IoU (Intersection over Union)**
  - **Why needed here:** The primary accuracy metric for evaluating predicted vs. ground-truth time intervals; understanding IoU thresholds is critical for interpreting reward design.
  - **Quick check question:** Given intervals [10, 30] and [20, 40], calculate the IoU.

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** RAVEN's three-stage training requires understanding how task difficulty progression affects generalization and catastrophic forgetting.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might training on easy examples before hard ones improve final performance on hard examples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video frames → Qwen2.5-VL encoder → visual tokens → Prompt + violation rules → structured query → Model samples K outputs with `<thinking>` and `<answer>` sections → Each output scored across all reward functions → GRPO updates policy → Curriculum scheduler advances stage

- **Critical path:**
  1. Video frames → Qwen2.5-VL encoder → visual tokens
  2. Prompt + violation rules → structured query
  3. Model samples K outputs with `<thinking>` and `<answer>` sections
  4. Each output scored across all reward functions
  5. GRPO updates policy to favor higher-reward outputs
  6. Curriculum scheduler advances stage based on convergence

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Soft vs. strict grounding format: Strict enforces structure but may reject valid outputs during early training
  - IoU threshold (0.5): Higher threshold increases precision but reduces usable signal from noisy data
  - Boundary alignment weight (α): Too high causes overfitting to annotation boundaries; too low loses fine-grained precision
  - **Assumption:** Tradeoffs were empirically tuned on validation data; paper does not report sensitivity analysis

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Model outputs reasoning without answer tags → format reward zero, no gradient signal
  - Category prediction high but IoU near zero → category reward dominates, reduce α5
  - Performance degrades on out-of-domain categories → catastrophic forgetting, check curriculum progression
  - Generated intervals consistently shifted → annotation bias, examine temporal boundary alignment reward

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reward ablation:** Train with only IoU reward, then add boundary alignment, then category consistency—measure mIoU progression on held-out validation set to confirm hierarchical benefit
  2. **Curriculum necessity:** Train single-stage on mixed data vs. three-stage curriculum; compare generalization gap (in-domain vs. out-of-domain category performance per Table 5 methodology)
  3. **Structured thinking impact:** Run inference with and without `<thinking>` tags enabled; analyze whether reasoning chains correlate with higher IoU predictions (qualitative inspection + quantitative grouping by reasoning length)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does RAVEN fully preserve the base model's performance on general vision-language tasks (e.g., VQA), or does it sacrifice general proficiency for specialized violation grounding?
- **Basis:** The paper claims mitigation of "catastrophic forgetting" but restricts quantitative evaluation to violation detection tasks, omitting standard MLLM benchmarks.
- **Why unresolved:** Optimization for specific hierarchical rewards could distort the general knowledge representations of the base Qwen2.5-VL model.
- **Evidence:** Comparing base and RAVEN model scores on general benchmarks like MMMU or TextVQA.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the RAVEN framework architecture-agnostic, or is its success dependent on the specific inductive biases of the Qwen2.5-VL backbone?
- **Basis:** The methodology is implemented exclusively on Qwen2.5-VL, while baseline comparisons use different architectures without applying the RAVEN training logic to them.
- **Why unresolved:** The convergence of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and emergent reasoning may vary significantly with different base model capacities or training objectives.
- **Evidence:** Training the RAVEN framework on alternative backbones (e.g., LLaVA, InternVideo) and comparing convergence rates.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does the framework's performance depend on the manually tuned reward weights (α) and the binarized IoU threshold?
- **Basis:** The reward functions utilize fixed coefficients and thresholds without a reported sensitivity analysis.
- **Why unresolved:** These hard-coded hyperparameters may be optimal for the current dataset but brittle when applied to data with different noise profiles or interval distributions.
- **Evidence:** Ablation studies varying reward coefficients and IoU thresholds on datasets with varying annotation noise levels.

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters (reward weights α1-α5, scaling factor σ) are unspecified, making faithful reproduction difficult
- The exact composition of precisely vs. coarsely annotated training data is unclear
- No reported sensitivity analysis for reward weights or IoU threshold choices
- Performance on general vision-language tasks beyond violation detection is not evaluated

## Confidence
**High confidence** in problem formulation and experimental results on MultiHateClip. The task definition, evaluation metrics, and reported performance improvements are clearly specified and methodologically sound.

**Medium confidence** in claimed mechanisms, particularly curriculum learning benefits and emergent reasoning through GRPO. While the theoretical framework is well-articulated, the text lacks direct ablations or sensitivity analyses for critical design choices.

**Low confidence** in reproducibility without additional implementation details. Key hyperparameters, reward weights, data split specifications, and prompt templates are either unspecified or insufficiently detailed.

## Next Checks
1. **Reward weight sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary α1-α5 across a reasonable range (e.g., [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]) and measure performance degradation on both in-domain and out-of-domain categories to identify which rewards are most critical.

2. **Curriculum learning necessity test**: Train an identical model architecture with all data combined from the start (no curriculum stages) while keeping all other factors constant. Compare generalization performance and catastrophic forgetting metrics to isolate the curriculum's contribution.

3. **Structured reasoning impact measurement**: Run the trained model with `<thinking>` tags disabled (direct answer only) and compare both quantitative metrics (mIoU, category accuracy) and qualitative output quality. Additionally, analyze whether reasoning length correlates with prediction accuracy across different difficulty levels of test samples.
