# Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Networks via Conservative Flux Quantization
arXiv ID: 2511.21784

Reference count: 40
Key outcome: Introduces PISNN with C-LIF neurons and CFQ strategy for high physical fidelity and energy efficiency in edge computing

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework that addresses the fundamental challenge of combining physical conservation laws with energy-efficient spiking computation. The key innovation is the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, which ensures strict physical conservation by design, paired with a Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy that discretizes continuous physical fluxes into spike events. This allows PISNN to learn time-invariant physical evolution operators while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge devices. Experimental results demonstrate accurate simulation of both 1D heat equations and 2D Laplace's equations with perfect mass conservation, achieving computational cost reductions of approximately three orders of magnitude compared to conventional PINNs.

## Method Summary
The PISNN framework introduces two core innovations: the C-LIF neuron and CFQ strategy. The C-LIF neuron incorporates a conservative flux mechanism that ensures physical quantities are neither created nor destroyed during the spiking process, directly embedding conservation laws into the neuron's dynamics. The CFQ strategy discretizes continuous physical fluxes into spike events through a quantization process that maintains conservation properties while enabling efficient computation. Together, these components allow PISNN to learn a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling robust long-term generalization. The framework is trained using physics-informed loss functions that enforce both conservation laws and accuracy constraints, with the spike-based computation providing inherent energy efficiency through sparse temporal activity.

## Key Results
- PISNN accurately simulates 1D heat equations and 2D Laplace's equations with perfect mass conservation
- Computational costs reduced by approximately three orders of magnitude compared to conventional PINNs
- Maintains high physical fidelity while achieving energy efficiency suitable for edge computing deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by fundamentally aligning the spiking neuron dynamics with physical conservation laws. The C-LIF neuron's conservative flux mechanism ensures that physical quantities are preserved during the spike generation process, preventing artificial creation or destruction of conserved quantities. The CFQ strategy then maps these conserved fluxes into discrete spike events, maintaining the conservation properties while enabling efficient computation. This direct embedding of physics into the spiking dynamics allows PISNN to learn time-invariant evolution operators that generalize well over long simulation horizons, as the conservation laws provide structural constraints that stabilize the learning process.

## Foundational Learning
**Conservative numerical methods**: Why needed - To ensure physical quantities are preserved during computation; Quick check - Verify mass conservation holds exactly across all simulations
**Spiking neural network dynamics**: Why needed - To enable energy-efficient computation through sparse temporal events; Quick check - Confirm spike sparsity correlates with computational savings
**Physics-informed neural networks**: Why needed - To embed physical laws into the learning process; Quick check - Validate that physics constraints are satisfied during training and inference
**Flux discretization**: Why needed - To map continuous physical quantities to discrete computational events; Quick check - Ensure quantization error remains bounded and controlled
**Time-invariant evolution operators**: Why needed - For robust long-term simulation and generalization; Quick check - Test stability over extended simulation periods

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Physical system -> C-LIF neurons -> CFQ quantization -> Spike generation -> Physical output
**Critical path**: Input physical state → C-LIF computation → Conservative flux calculation → CFQ quantization → Spike output → Next state update
**Design tradeoffs**: Conservative flux vs. computational complexity; quantization resolution vs. spike sparsity; physical fidelity vs. implementation simplicity
**Failure signatures**: Violation of mass conservation; accumulation of quantization errors; instability in long-term simulations
**First experiments**: 1) Test conservation properties on simple linear PDEs; 2) Measure computational efficiency on increasing problem sizes; 3) Validate generalization to longer time horizons
