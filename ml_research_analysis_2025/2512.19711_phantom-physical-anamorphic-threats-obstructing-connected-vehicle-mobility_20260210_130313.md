core_contribution: This paper introduces PHANTOM, a novel physical adversarial attack
  that exploits anamorphic art to deceive vision-based perception in connected autonomous
  vehicles (CAVs). Unlike conventional attacks that use conspicuous patches or textures,
  PHANTOM employs geometrically distorted road markings that appear natural to humans
  but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors

# PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19711
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711
- Reference count: 21
- Authors: Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo; Moinul Hossain
- Key outcome: Introduces PHANTOM, an anamorphic adversarial attack on CAV perception that exploits perspective-dependent geometric distortions to deceive detectors and propagate false emergency messages through V2X networks.

## Executive Summary
PHANTOM introduces a novel physical adversarial attack that uses anamorphic road markings to deceive vision-based object detectors in connected autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional patch-based attacks, PHANTOM employs geometrically distorted patterns that appear natural to humans but are misclassified by detectors when viewed from specific distances. The attack achieves high success rates across multiple detector architectures without model access and propagates false emergency messages through V2X networks, degrading safety-critical communication by 68-89% in Peak Age of Information.

## Method Summary
The attack transforms source vehicle images using anamorphic geometric projection based on camera height, viewing distance, and desired illusion dimensions. A two-step optimization process combines grid search over parameter ranges with Bayesian refinement to maximize detection loss using YOLOv2 as a surrogate. The optimized patterns are deployed as road markings that activate within a specific "sweet spot" distance (6-10m). The attack exploits shared mid-level CNN feature representations to achieve cross-model transferability and triggers emergency BSM broadcasts that flood V2X networks, causing channel congestion and communication degradation.

## Key Results
- Attack Success Rate exceeds 90% under optimal conditions (sunny weather, 20-30 mph speeds)
- Strong transferability across YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet with 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments
- Network impact increases Peak Age of Information by 68-89% through false emergency message propagation
- Illusion activates within 6-10m of target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering
- Attack operates in black-box settings without requiring model access

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Anamorphic geometric projection creates perspective-dependent adversarial examples that activate only within a specific distance window.
- Mechanism: A source image is projected through a grid transformation that maps a rectangle to an isosceles trapezoid, computed from camera height H, viewing distance d, and desired illusion dimensions. When viewed from the "sweet spot" (6-10m), the distorted pattern resolves into a coherent object shape that detectors classify with high confidence.
- Core assumption: The target vehicle's camera height and approach trajectory are predictable from public specifications or field observation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "geometrically distorted road markings that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence...when viewed from specific angles"
  - [Section III-A] Equations (1)-(3) define the geometric relationships: Lg = d·h/(H−h), wfar = w·H/(H−h), θ = arctan(w/2d)
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighboring papers discuss V2X but not anamorphic attacks specifically
- Break condition: Camera height differs significantly from assumed H, or vehicle approaches from off-axis angle outside the trapezoidal projection window.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PHANTOM achieves cross-model transferability by preserving mid-level CNN feature representations rather than targeting model-specific decision boundaries.
- Mechanism: The geometric transformation maintains locally coherent visual cues (edges, textures, spatial arrangements) that CNN-based detectors universally associate with real objects. Feature map correlation analysis shows ~0.97 similarity between benign and adversarial images across network depths.
- Core assumption: Diverse detector architectures share sufficient mid-level feature representations for transferability to hold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet)"
  - [Section IV-B-5] "the correlation coefficient between benign and PHANTOM images reaches approximately 0.97"
  - [Section IV-B-3] "PHANTOM exploits shared mid-level feature representations...universal to CNN-based detectors"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence on feature correlation mechanisms
- Break condition: Target model uses significantly different feature extraction paradigm (e.g., transformer-based vision) or employs adversarial training with geometry-aware augmentations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Localized perception failures cascade into network-wide degradation through BSM propagation.
- Mechanism: Misclassification triggers SAE J2735 emergency protocol, generating high-priority BSMs at 10 Hz (vs. 1 Hz normal rate). These flood the RSU's 300m communication range, causing channel congestion that increases Peak Age of Information and delays genuine safety messages.
- Core assumption: V2X networks lack rate-limiting or consensus mechanisms to filter perception-based false positives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89%"
  - [Section IV-B-6] "three-stage cascade: (1) hard braking (2) emergency BSM flooding, and (3) reactive braking and route recalculation"
  - [corpus] V2X-LLM paper mentions BSM integration challenges; Wireless Communication survey discusses cooperative perception limitations
- Break condition: Network implements multi-source validation, rate limiting on emergency BSMs, or LiDAR/radar cross-modal verification before broadcasting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Perspective projection and anamorphic geometry
  - Why needed here: Understanding how 2D distorted patterns resolve into 3D illusions from specific viewpoints is essential for grasping why the attack activates at precise distances.
  - Quick check question: Given camera height H=1.5m and desired illusion distance d=8m, what happens to the illusion if the vehicle's camera is at H=2.0m instead?

- Concept: CNN feature hierarchies and transferability
  - Why needed here: The attack's black-box success depends on shared mid-level features across architectures; knowing which layers capture edges vs. semantics clarifies why geometric attacks transfer better than texture perturbations.
  - Quick check question: Why would an attack optimized on YOLOv2 succeed on Faster R-CNN despite different region proposal mechanisms?

- Concept: V2X communication protocols (BSMs, DSRC/IEEE 802.11p)
  - Why needed here: The network-level impact hinges on understanding message prioritization, broadcast frequency, and how emergency protocols can be weaponized through false positive propagation.
  - Quick check question: If BSMs normally transmit at 1 Hz but emergency mode uses 10 Hz, what network congestion effects would you expect in a dense traffic scenario?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Anamorphic Generator (Algorithm 1): Takes source image + geometric parameters → produces distorted road marking
  - Optimization Loop: Grid search over (d, w, h) ranges → Bayesian refinement → surrogate model (YOLOv2) evaluation
  - Physical Deployment: Decal/stencil application at intersection, straight road, or roundabout
  - Target Perception: Camera → DNN object detector (YOLOv5/SSD/Faster R-CNN/RetinaNet)
  - V2X Cascade: Misclassification → SAE J2735 BSM → DSRC broadcast → RSU → surrounding vehicles

- Critical path: Geometric parameter selection → anamorphic transformation quality → sweet spot alignment (6-10m) → detection confidence >80% → BSM emergency broadcast → network PAoI increase

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger illusion dimensions (w, h) increase visibility but may alert human observers
  - Shorter activation distance reduces reaction time but narrows the attack window
  - Using YOLOv2 as surrogate improves speed but may not maximize transferability to all target architectures

- Failure signatures:
  - Rain conditions: AUC drops from 0.71 to 0.56 due to water reflections and motion blur
  - RetinaNet targets: Lower ASR profile (100% only at 6m) due to weaker baseline detection accuracy
  - Off-nominal camera heights: Illusion fails to resolve correctly
  - Distance outside 3-9m: Attack success rate drops below 50%

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the geometric transformation in CARLA with a single vehicle, varying approach distance from 2m to 15m while logging detection confidence and class probability for the anamorphic pattern.
  2. Test transferability by generating attacks using YOLOv2 as surrogate, then evaluating ASR and AUC on all four target detectors (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet) under identical weather/lighting conditions.
  3. In SUMO-OMNeT++ with 60 vehicles, measure PAoI baseline, then trigger PHANTOM attack and compare PAoI increase, BSM transmission rates, and average vehicle speed reduction over 30-second windows.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Geometry-aware defenses**: Can multi-modal sensing (LiDAR, radar) reliably detect perspective-dependent attacks while maintaining real-time perception latency? The paper notes multi-modal fusion incurs hardware cost and computational overhead but doesn't quantify whether real-time constraints can be met while detecting anamorphic illusions.

- **Vehicle camera diversity**: How does PHANTOM perform across vehicles with varying camera mounting heights and positions across different manufacturer specifications? The attack depends on predictable camera geometry, but different vehicles (sedans vs. SUVs vs. trucks) have significantly different camera positions.

- **CNN feature limitations**: Does the high feature-map correlation (0.97) between anamorphic illusions and real objects suggest fundamental limitations in CNN-based perception that cannot be addressed through adversarial training? The attack exploits shared mid-level feature representations, but it's unclear whether this is an inherent architectural vulnerability or a tractable training gap.

## Limitations
- All evaluations conducted in simulation environments (CARLA and SUMO-OMNeT++) without real-world validation
- Attack assumes predictable camera geometry and approach trajectories
- No evaluation of long-term physical degradation effects on anamorphic markings
- Defense discussion remains theoretical without empirical validation of geometry-aware solutions

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1**: High confidence - geometric transformation equations are explicitly defined and experimentally validated in CARLA
- **Mechanism 2**: Medium confidence - feature correlation analysis shows 0.97 similarity but lacks comparative analysis with alternative attack methods
- **Mechanism 3**: High confidence - V2X cascade is well-documented through SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation with measurable PAoI metrics

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the anamorphic transformation in CARLA and verify the "sweet spot" distance (6-10m) produces the expected geometric illusion when viewed from different camera heights
2. Generate attacks using YOLOv2 as surrogate and measure cross-model transferability on all four target detectors under varying weather conditions
3. Implement the V2X cascade in SUMO-OMNeT++ and measure PAoI increase during controlled PHANTOM attack scenarios
