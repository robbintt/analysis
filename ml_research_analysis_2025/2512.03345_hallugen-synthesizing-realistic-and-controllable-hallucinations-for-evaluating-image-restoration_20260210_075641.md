# HalluGen: Synthesizing Realistic and Controllable Hallucinations for Evaluating Image Restoration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03345
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03345
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces first controllable framework for generating realistic hallucinations in image restoration

## Executive Summary
HalluGen introduces a diffusion-based framework for controllable hallucination generation in image restoration, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucinations—a critical but understudied failure mode in safety-critical domains like medical imaging. By extending diffusion posterior sampling with targeted gradient perturbations, HalluGen generates both intrinsic (measurement-inconsistent) and extrinsic (measurement-consistent but semantically incorrect) hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity. The method produces perceptually realistic outputs that significantly degrade segmentation accuracy (IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, researchers constructed the first large-scale hallucination dataset (4,350 annotated images from 1,450 brain MR scans) for low-field MRI enhancement.

## Method Summary
HalluGen extends diffusion posterior sampling by incorporating gradient perturbations that guide the generation of specific hallucination types while maintaining perceptual realism. The framework introduces two key mechanisms: intrinsic hallucinations that violate measurement consistency through direct pixel manipulation, and extrinsic hallucinations that preserve measurement consistency while introducing semantically incorrect structures. Control parameters allow adjustment of hallucination location, type (intrinsic vs extrinsic), and severity through modification of the diffusion process gradients. The method leverages a pre-trained diffusion model and applies targeted perturbations during the denoising steps to steer the generation toward desired hallucination characteristics while maintaining overall image coherence.

## Key Results
- Generates perceptually realistic hallucinations that reduce segmentation IoU from 0.86 to 0.36
- Constructs first large-scale hallucination dataset with 4,350 annotated images from 1,450 brain MR scans
- Develops SHAFE metric improving hallucination detection sensitivity (AUC increase of 0.25, 24 percentage points reduction in false negatives)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HalluGen works by exploiting the structured nature of diffusion models' denoising process. By perturbing the gradients during posterior sampling, the method can selectively introduce artifacts that either violate measurement constraints (intrinsic) or preserve them while introducing incorrect semantics (extrinsic). The controllability emerges from the ability to modulate perturbation magnitude and location, allowing systematic exploration of hallucination severity and spatial distribution. The diffusion framework's inherent ability to generate coherent structures ensures that hallucinations appear realistic rather than as obvious artifacts, making them more representative of actual restoration failures.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models**: Why needed - Provide the generative foundation for creating coherent hallucinations; Quick check - Understand forward noising process and reverse denoising mechanics.

**Measurement Consistency**: Why needed - Critical distinction between types of hallucinations in restoration tasks; Quick check - Verify understanding of how measurements constrain reconstruction solutions.

**Gradient Perturbation**: Why needed - Mechanism for controlling hallucination generation direction; Quick check - Confirm how gradient modifications affect denoising trajectory.

**Perceptual Realism**: Why needed - Hallucinations must be realistic to be diagnostically relevant; Quick check - Evaluate realism through segmentation performance degradation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Diffusion model -> Gradient perturbation module -> Hallucination generator -> Annotation pipeline

**Critical Path**: Diffusion denoising steps with gradient perturbations → Hallucination generation → Perceptual evaluation → Metric development

**Design Tradeoffs**: Controllability vs. realism (more control can reduce naturalness), intrinsic vs. extrinsic hallucination balance (measurement violation vs. semantic correctness), dataset size vs. annotation quality (more data requires more human effort).

**Failure Signatures**: Oversaturated hallucinations (too strong perturbations), spatially inconsistent structures (poor localization control), artifacts in non-target regions (insufficient perturbation specificity).

**First Experiments**: 1) Generate intrinsic hallucinations at varying severity levels and measure segmentation degradation; 2) Compare intrinsic vs extrinsic hallucination realism using radiologist evaluation; 3) Test SHAFE metric performance across different hallucination types and severities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to imaging modalities beyond brain MRI remains unproven
- Semantic realism may vary with target structure complexity and anatomical context
- SHAFE metric requires further validation across diverse restoration tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Controllability and systematic nature of HalluGen's hallucination generation approach, supported by quantitative evidence of perceptual realism and segmentation degradation.

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of HalluGen framework and SHAFE metric to imaging domains beyond low-field brain MRI.

**Medium confidence**: Real-world applicability of HalluGen-generated hallucinations as proxies for actual restoration failures, given controlled synthesis process.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate HalluGen's hallucination generation and SHAFE metric performance on CT, ultrasound, and other medical imaging modalities to assess cross-domain applicability.

2. Conduct user studies with radiologists to validate whether HalluGen-generated hallucinations accurately represent real-world restoration failures in clinical contexts.

3. Test the reference-free hallucination detector trained on HalluGen data on actual restoration errors from deployed image enhancement systems to measure real-world generalization.
