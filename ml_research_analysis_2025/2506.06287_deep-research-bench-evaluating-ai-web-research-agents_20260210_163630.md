# Deep Research Bench: Evaluating AI Web Research Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06287
- Reference count: 31
- Frontier models achieve ~0.51 mean score (out of 1) on multi-step web research tasks, still substantially below human performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Deep Research Bench (DRB), a benchmark for evaluating AI web research agents on real-world multi-step research tasks. The authors developed 89 task instances across 8 categories, created RetroSearch (a frozen web snapshot environment), and evaluated various models using ReAct agents. They found that frontier models like o3 achieve around 0.51 score (out of 1), with forgetting information being the strongest predictor of failure. The benchmark is publicly available with continuous updates planned.

## Method Summary
The DRB framework uses ReAct agents with two tools: Google Search (via Serper API) and Query Document (for reading pages). Tasks are run in a frozen web environment called RetroSearch, which provides reproducible evaluation without temporal drift. Each task has a specific scoring method (binary for simple retrieval, F1 for datasets, probability difference for validation). Agents have a 50-action budget and run in "low-elicitation" mode with minimal prompts. The evaluation uses both live web and RetroSearch, with trace analysis performed by o3 to classify failure modes.

## Key Results
- Frontier models (o3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve mean scores around 0.45-0.51 out of 1
- Commercial tools (ChatGPT-o3) outperform frontier models on aggregate
- Forgetting information is the strongest predictor of failure (β=-0.843, p=0.014)
- Early stopping (satisficement) is a primary failure mode for reasoning models like o3 and DeepSeek-R1
- Offline RetroSearch evaluation performs comparably to live web evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Forgetting previously observed information during multi-step traces is the strongest predictor of web research agent failure
- Mechanism: As agent traces extend (5-15 iterations, 10-45 LLM decisions), models fail to retain earlier observations in working context, leading to redundant searches, lost citations, and inconsistent reasoning
- Core assumption: Context window limitations and attention degradation over long traces cause information loss, not strategic decisions to discard
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5.2]: "forgetting information has the largest negative coefficient (-0.843, p=0.014)" in regression predicting task scores
  - [section 3.5.1]: Table 6 shows forgetting rates from 0.090 (Gemini 2.5 Flash NT) to 0.356 (GPT-4 Turbo), with newer models trending lower
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support—neighbor papers focus on benchmark design, not failure mode causation
- Break condition: Models with explicit external memory mechanisms or significantly larger effective context would show different failure distributions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RetroSearch's frozen web snapshot enables reproducible evaluation without materially degrading agent performance relative to live web
- Mechanism: Pre-scraped pages served through an API mimicking Serper's format preserve search result ordering while eliminating temporal drift; agents navigate the same information landscape across runs
- Core assumption: The live web's continuous changes are primarily a source of evaluation noise rather than essential signal for the research tasks tested
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "demonstrate that offline 'RetroSearch' agents perform comparably to 'live web' agents"
  - [section 3.2]: Table 5 shows consistent model rankings (o3: 0.51 live, 0.46 retro; Gemini 2.5 Pro: 0.45 live, 0.46 retro)
  - [corpus]: BrowseComp-Plus (arXiv:2508.06600) similarly criticizes "black-box live web" evaluation unreliability
- Break condition: Tasks requiring information published after the snapshot, or where the crawl missed key pages an agent would realistically find

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reasoning models (o3, DeepSeek-R1, Claude Thinking) require modified ReAct architecture that eliminates explicit thought generation steps
- Mechanism: RL-on-CoT training creates models that guard internal reasoning chains; prompts asking to "generate a thought" are rejected or degrade performance, so thought must occur implicitly during action selection
- Core assumption: Implicit reasoning in thinking models is functionally equivalent to explicit ReAct thoughts for the purpose of action selection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4.2]: "Reasoning models often reject prompts of this form, which we believe is due to guarding against users trying to jailbreak the model's internal thought process"
  - [section 2.4.2]: "the implicit thought modification does not degrade performance"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on this architectural modification; neighboring benchmarks don't address reasoning model compatibility
- Break condition: Future reasoning models with different training objectives may accept explicit thought prompts without degradation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ReAct (Reason + Act) Agent Loop
  - Why needed here: The entire DRB evaluation framework assumes agents follow an observation-action loop with tool use; understanding this cycle is prerequisite to interpreting trace failures
  - Quick check question: Given an observation that a search returned no results, what are three valid actions a ReAct agent could take next?

- Concept: Tool-Augmented LLMs
  - Why needed here: DRB agents have exactly two tools—Google Search (via Serper API) and Query Document (for reading pages); all web research flows through these interfaces
  - Quick check question: What types of information can Query Document provide versus Google Search, and what are the failure modes unique to each?

- Concept: Benchmark Construct Validity
  - Why needed here: DRB's value depends on tasks reflecting "real-world" research with "continuous scale of performance"—understanding why this matters is essential for interpreting leaderboard results
  - Quick check question: Why would a benchmark with only binary pass/fail scoring fail to distinguish between a moderately capable agent and a highly capable one?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  RetroSearch Database -> Scraping Pipeline -> Agent Runtime -> Evaluation Layer -> Trace Analyzer
  - **RetroSearch Database**: Frozen pages (15k-110k per task type) stored as raw HTML + processed Markdown via Trafilatura
  - **Scraping Pipeline**: Recursive query generation -> Playwright -> HTTP fallback -> ScraperAPI for hard-to-scrape pages
  - **Agent Runtime**: ReAct loop with 50-action budget; tip selection from curated list prepended to task prompt
  - **Evaluation Layer**: Task-specific scoring (binary for Find Number, F1 for Compile Dataset, probability difference for Validate Claim); LLM-assisted for entity matching and source reliability assessment
  - **Trace Analyzer**: o3-based per-step classification of hallucinations, repeated calls, and forgetting

- Critical path:
  1. Task definition -> Crawling (recursive search expansion) -> Scraping -> RetroSearch population
  2. Agent execution: Task prompt -> Tip selection -> Tool calls (Serper/RetroSearch + Query Document) -> Loop until answer or budget exhaustion
  3. Output -> JSON formatting -> Task-specific scoring -> Leaderboard

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Low-elicitation prompting reveals intrinsic model behavior but may understate capabilities achievable with careful prompting
  - RetroSearch ensures reproducibility but can't guarantee all relevant or misleading pages are captured
  - Per-check trace evaluation with o3 is accurate but expensive; batch approaches have high error rates

- Failure signatures:
  - **Hallucination in actions**: Tool calls referencing non-existent URLs, fake document IDs, or information not in trace
  - **Repeated tool calls**: Identical search queries without adaptation after null results
  - **Forgetting information**: Re-searching for pages already discovered earlier in trace
  - **Early termination (satisficement)**: Concluding with clearly incomplete answers; especially common in o3/DeepSeek-R1

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify implicit vs. explicit thought equivalence: Run Claude 3.7 Sonnet in both thinking and non-thinking modes with both ReAct variants; confirm scores align as paper claims
  2. Quantify RetroSearch coverage effects: Identify tasks with large live-retro score deltas; manually check whether missing pages explain the gap
  3. Intervene on forgetting: Add a scratchpad summarization tool triggered every N steps; measure score improvement on tasks with average trace length >10 steps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does correcting failure modes (particularly forgetting information) causally improve agent performance on web research tasks?
  - Basis: [explicit] Section 3.5.2: "Note that this does not allow us to conclude anything causal. This would require rerunning agents from a partial trace ending in a corrected mode to see how much this improves performance. We leave this to future work."
  - Why unresolved: Regression analysis shows correlation but not causation
  - What evidence would resolve it: Intervention experiments where agents are restarted from traces with specific failure modes corrected

- **Open Question 2**: How much does the ordering of live search results (vs RetroSearch) subtly influence agent behavior through information leakage?
  - Basis: [explicit] Section 2.6.1: "We note that there is an opportunity for information leakage to occur here... We do not take any steps to prevent this under the assumption that this effect is minimal, and intend to analyze this further in the future."
  - Why unresolved: Live search ranking correlates with real-world relevance, potentially leaking information about which results are "important"
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing agent performance with shuffled vs original search result ordering

- **Open Question 3**: How do frontier web research agents perform under high-elicitation prompting compared to the low-elicitation regime tested?
  - Basis: [explicit] Section 2.3: "We will explore the high-elicitation case in future work."
  - Why unresolved: Current results reflect only minimal prompts; explicit guidance on optimization strategies could substantially improve scores
  - What evidence would resolve it: Running evaluations with detailed prompts specifying thoroughness, cross-referencing, and quality thresholds

- **Open Question 4**: Why do toolless agents perform comparably to full web agents on Validate Claim tasks, and what does this imply about benchmark validity?
  - Basis: [explicit] Appendix A: "For this task, Toolless agents perform comparably to Live and Retro ReAct agents... it is not yet clear to us whether this is due to internalized memory... or due to an enhanced capability to judge claim validity based on intrinsic priors."
  - Why unresolved: External web access may be unnecessary for this task type, suggesting potential construct validity issues
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis using instances with claims about events post-dating all training cutoffs

## Limitations

- Data Availability Constraints: The core 89 task instances and their ground-truth answers are not publicly released, limiting independent verification of reported scores
- Generalization Boundaries: The frozen web snapshot approach ensures reproducibility but may not generalize to tasks requiring current information or pages outside the crawl's scope
- Causal Attribution Uncertainty: While forgetting is identified as the strongest predictor of failure, causation cannot be definitively proven from correlation alone

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- RetroSearch provides reproducible evaluation comparable to live web for the tested task set
- Forgetting information is the strongest negative predictor of task success across models
- Reasoning models require implicit-thought modification to avoid rejection of explicit ReAct prompts

**Medium Confidence**:
- Frontier models achieve ~0.51 mean score, substantially below human performance
- Commercial tools (ChatGPT-o3) outperform frontier models on aggregate
- Early stopping (satisficement) is a primary failure mode for reasoning models

**Low Confidence**:
- The exact distribution of forgetting vs. hallucination vs. repeated calls across all 89 tasks
- Whether the implicit-thought modification truly preserves reasoning capability
- The relative importance of RetroSearch coverage versus agent capability in explaining score variations

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate Implicit-Thought Equivalence**: Run Claude 3.7 Sonnet in both thinking and non-thinking modes with both explicit and implicit ReAct variants across 10-15 representative tasks. Confirm that scores align as claimed and that thinking mode doesn't provide advantages when explicit thoughts are forced.

2. **Validate RetroSearch Coverage Effects**: For the 5 tasks with largest live-retro score discrepancies, manually examine whether key relevant pages were missed by the crawl. This would establish whether the 0.46 vs 0.51 delta represents evaluation methodology differences or actual information access limitations.

3. **Intervene on Forgetting Mechanism**: Implement a lightweight scratchpad summarization tool that triggers every 3-5 steps to consolidate key findings. Apply this to tasks with average trace length >10 steps and measure score improvement. This would test whether the forgetting predictor represents a fixable architectural limitation versus fundamental model behavior.
