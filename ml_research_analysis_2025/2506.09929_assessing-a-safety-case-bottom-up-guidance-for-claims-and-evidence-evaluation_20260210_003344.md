# Assessing a Safety Case: Bottom-up Guidance for Claims and Evidence Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.09929
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09929
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Structured framework for evaluating automated driving system safety case claims through bottom-up evidence assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a structured methodology for assessing the credibility of automated driving system (ADS) safety cases by evaluating both the support for claims and the status of evidence artifacts. The approach defines two distinct assessment layers: evaluating claim support through provided evidence (procedural and implementation), and assessing the status of individual evidence artifacts for recency, ownership, and governance. Two independent teams are required - one for safety case creation and another for evaluation - to ensure objectivity. The framework emphasizes that safety cases serve as internal tools for documenting and pressure-testing safety approaches rather than direct approval criteria, with results informing continual improvement efforts.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves independent safety experts evaluating claims using a 0-3 scoring scale for both claim support and evidence status. Claim support is assessed through procedural support (process specifications) and implementation support (evidence of process application), with scores based on coverage, relevance, and governance criteria. Evidence status is evaluated based on recency (typically <6-12 months), ownership, and control. Scores are aggregated using qualitative weighting rather than strict mathematical averaging, with results visualized through spider plots. The process requires a mature document management system to verify evidence timestamps and ownership, and includes group sessions to align scorers and improve inter-rater reliability.

## Key Results
- Defines structured 0-3 scoring rubrics for both claim support (procedural and implementation) and evidence status (recency, ownership, control)
- Establishes independence requirement between safety case creation and evaluation teams
- Provides visualization methodology using spider plots for aggregate score presentation
- Acknowledges framework serves as internal documentation tool rather than direct approval mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically decomposing safety goals into claims and mapping them to supporting evidence, then applying independent expert evaluation to assess both the logical support for claims and the practical status of evidence artifacts. The dual-layer assessment ensures both theoretical soundness and operational readiness of the safety case.

## Foundational Learning
- **Safety Case Structure:** Decomposes top-level safety goals into hierarchical claims with mapped evidence; needed to organize complex safety arguments systematically
- **Independent Assessment:** Requires separate teams for creation and evaluation; ensures objectivity and reduces bias in safety validation
- **Qualitative Weighting:** Uses expert judgment over mathematical averaging for score aggregation; preserves nuanced understanding of logical relationships
- **Evidence Governance:** Evaluates not just existence but control and review status of evidence; ensures evidence reliability and traceability
- **Spider Plot Visualization:** Aggregates branch scores into visual format; enables quick identification of weak areas in safety argument
- **Continual Improvement:** Results inform ongoing safety enhancement rather than serving as final approval; supports iterative safety development

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Top-level Goal -> Sub-claims -> Evidence Artifacts -> Expert Assessment Scores -> Spider Plot Visualization

**Critical Path:** Safety Case Creation → Independent Assessment → Score Aggregation → Result Reporting → Continual Improvement

**Design Tradeoffs:** Independence vs. efficiency (separate teams ensure objectivity but increase resource requirements); qualitative weighting vs. algorithmic consistency (expert judgment captures nuance but reduces repeatability)

**Failure Signatures:** Over-scoring evidence quality while missing governance gaps; confirming evidence existence without verifying complete claim coverage; inconsistent scoring between assessors due to lack of calibration protocols

**First Experiments:**
1. Pilot study to validate qualitative weighting heuristics through expert consensus on sample safety cases
2. Inter-rater reliability testing across multiple assessment teams using identical claims and evidence
3. Sensitivity analysis of evidence recency thresholds by evaluating safety cases with varying documentation timelines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
How can the presented bottom-up evaluation of claims and evidence be systematically integrated with top-down assessments of argument completeness and robustness? The paper explicitly lists "completeness" and "robustness" as top-down assessment attributes that are "not specifically tackled in this publication" but are required for a comprehensive Case Credibility Assessment.

### Open Question 2
What formal aggregation logic should replace "qualitative weighting" to consistently determine parent claim support from child claim scores? The reliance on assessor discretion for weighting prevents the methodology from being fully repeatable or algorithmic, potentially leading to inconsistent evaluations of the top-level safety goal.

### Open Question 3
What is the quantifiable inter-rater reliability of the 0-3 scoring system when applied by independent safety assessors? Without statistical evidence of scoring consistency, the "Assessment" phase may produce significantly different results depending on the specific personnel conducting the audit.

## Limitations
- **Qualitative Weighting Uncertainty:** Lack of defined heuristics for aggregating child-to-parent scores introduces significant subjectivity
- **Document Management Requirements:** Implementation requires mature document management system with verified evidence metadata
- **Operational Complexity:** Independence requirement between creation and evaluation teams adds resource burden
- **Top-Down Integration Gap:** Framework does not address argument completeness and robustness assessment

## Confidence
- **Methodological Rigor:** High - specific scoring rubrics and dual-layer assessment approach are well-specified
- **Practical Applicability:** Medium - qualitative weighting mechanisms and resource requirements create implementation uncertainty
- **Inter-rater Reliability:** Medium - acknowledges subjectivity but lacks statistical validation data
- **Real-world Adoption:** Medium - requires mature infrastructure and operational complexity management

## Next Checks
1. Conduct pilot study to validate qualitative weighting heuristics through expert consensus on sample safety cases
2. Perform inter-rater reliability testing across multiple assessment teams to establish calibration protocols
3. Test framework's sensitivity to evidence recency thresholds by analyzing safety cases with varying documentation timelines
