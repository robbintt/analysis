# On Generalization in Agentic Tool Calling: CoreThink Agentic Reasoner and MAVEN Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.22898
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22898
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Introduces CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, achieving 5-30% improvement over baselines via symbolic reasoning layer and MAVEN benchmark for out-of-distribution multi-step reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the critical challenge of generalization in agentic tool calling, where models often fail to adapt to unseen or complex reasoning tasks. The authors propose CoreThink, a novel framework that combines a symbolic reasoning layer with adaptive tool orchestration, enabling structured decomposition and improved multi-step reasoning. CoreThink achieves state-of-the-art results on existing benchmarks and is rigorously evaluated on MAVEN, a new out-of-distribution benchmark designed to stress-test generalization in math and physics. The approach not only boosts performance but also reduces computational cost by roughly an order of magnitude, making it scalable and accessible for real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
CoreThink augments large language models with a symbolic reasoning layer, enabling structured decomposition of complex tasks and adaptive tool orchestration. The framework uses hierarchical reasoning—breaking down high-level goals into subgoals and tool calls—while enforcing single-tool-call responses to ensure verifiable, sequential reasoning. This symbolic layer is paired with a lightweight execution module that manages tool invocation and result integration. The design emphasizes modularity and adaptability, allowing CoreThink to generalize across diverse reasoning tasks without requiring extensive retraining.

## Key Results
- CoreThink achieves 5-30% improvement over existing baselines on standard tool-calling benchmarks.
- On the MAVEN benchmark, CoreThink scores significantly higher than other models, which average below 50% accuracy.
- CoreThink operates at roughly one-tenth the computational cost of leading models, enabling efficient deployment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoreThink’s effectiveness stems from its symbolic reasoning layer, which enforces structured decomposition and sequential tool orchestration. By breaking down tasks into verifiable subgoals and restricting to single-tool calls per response, the system ensures traceable and auditable reasoning paths. This modularity allows for targeted intervention and debugging, while the adaptive orchestration layer dynamically selects the most relevant tools based on task context, reducing reliance on memorized patterns and improving generalization to novel problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tool Calling & Orchestration:** Needed to understand how agents interact with external APIs; quick check: identify all tool invocations in a sample trace.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Needed for sequential problem-solving; quick check: trace the logical flow across 3+ steps.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization:** Needed to assess robustness to unseen tasks; quick check: compare performance on in-distribution vs. MAVEN tasks.
- **Symbolic vs. Neural Reasoning:** Needed to contrast interpretable vs. black-box methods; quick check: map a symbolic trace alongside a neural-only trace.
- **Benchmark Design (Parametric, Adversarial):** Needed to evaluate true generalization; quick check: generate a MAVEN-style variant of an existing benchmark.
- **Automated Judge Calibration:** Needed to trust leaderboard scores; quick check: cross-validate judge output with human annotations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query -> Symbolic Decomposition -> Tool Selection -> Execution Module -> Result Integration -> Final Answer

**Critical Path:** User Query → Symbolic Decomposition → Tool Selection → Execution → Result Integration

**Design Tradeoffs:** The single-call-per-response rule ensures verifiability and sequential reasoning but may penalize models optimized for parallel execution. Symbolic reasoning increases interpretability and debuggability at the cost of additional computational overhead during planning.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor decomposition may lead to redundant or circular tool calls; tool selection errors can cause cascading failures in multi-step tasks; the symbolic layer may struggle with ambiguous or underspecified queries.

**First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate CoreThink on a simple in-distribution benchmark to establish baseline performance. 2) Test on MAVEN to measure out-of-distribution generalization. 3) Conduct an ablation study removing the symbolic layer to isolate its contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can MAVEN's adversarial parametric design prevent models from "narrow overfitting," or will it eventually succumb to the "benchmark brittleness" observed in BFCL and TauBench? [explicit]
- **Open Question 2:** Does the strict "single-call per response" protocol artificially penalize models optimized for parallel or batched tool execution? [inferred]
- **Open Question 3:** To what extent does the reliance on GPT-4.1 as the "expert automated judge" introduce systematic bias into the MAVEN leaderboard? [inferred]

## Limitations
- MAVEN benchmark is not publicly available, limiting independent verification.
- Limited ablation studies make it difficult to isolate the impact of the symbolic reasoning layer.
- Performance claims are based on math and physics tasks; generalization to other domains is unproven.
- The single-tool-call constraint may not reflect optimal strategies for all agents.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** CoreThink achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks.
- **Medium confidence:** CoreThink generalizes better than baselines, particularly on MAVEN.
- **Low confidence:** The symbolic reasoning layer is the sole driver of improved generalization; efficiency claims are hardware-agnostic.

## Next Checks
1. Release MAVEN benchmark publicly to enable independent replication and broader evaluation.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the symbolic reasoning layer on performance and efficiency.
3. Evaluate CoreThink on additional, diverse benchmarks beyond math and physics to assess true generalization.
