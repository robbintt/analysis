# Mechanistic Interpretability of Brain-to-Speech Models Across Speech Modes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.01247
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01247
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Cross-mode transfer in brain-to-speech models is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse network-wide activity

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the mechanistic basis of cross-modal transfer in brain-to-speech decoding models by examining how representations from vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech modes interact. Using activation patching and tri-modal interpolation techniques, the authors discover that performance differences across modes stem from representational structure rather than input signal quality. The research reveals that vocalized speech representations can effectively restore decoding performance for imagined and mimed inputs, while the reverse transfer fails catastrophically. These findings suggest that speech modes lie on a continuous causal manifold with distinct layer-specific subspaces mediating transfer effects.

## Method Summary
The study employs cross-mode activation patching to test representational transfer between vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech modes. Researchers systematically substitute activations from one mode into another across different model layers and analyze the resulting performance changes. Tri-modal interpolation is used to explore the continuous space between speech modes, while neuron-level analysis identifies consistent subsets driving performance improvements. The approach combines causal intervention with interpretability techniques to map how internal representations mediate cross-modal decoding capabilities.

## Key Results
- Cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse network-wide activity
- Vocalized representations can causally restore high-quality decoding for imagined and mimed inputs
- Reverse substitution (imagined/mimed to vocalized) catastrophically degrades performance
- Small sets of convolutional channels and recurrent states dominate transfer effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that cross-modal transfer effectiveness depends on the structural compatibility of representational subspaces across speech modes. When vocalized activations are substituted into imagined or mimed processing streams, they provide geometrically aligned features that the model can effectively utilize for decoding. The directional asymmetry arises because vocalized representations contain richer, more complete feature sets that serve as effective priors for degraded input modes. The compact nature of transfer subspaces suggests that only specific, aligned portions of the representational space are critical for successful cross-modal decoding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Activation patching**: Why needed - to test causal effects of specific representations; Quick check - verify that patched activations produce measurable performance changes
- **Representational subspaces**: Why needed - to understand how information is organized internally; Quick check - confirm that subspaces are smaller than full layer representations
- **Cross-modal transfer**: Why needed - to identify which representations generalize across conditions; Quick check - measure performance changes when transferring between modes
- **Causal intervention**: Why needed - to establish directional relationships between representations; Quick check - test whether substitutions produce consistent effects
- **Neuron-level analysis**: Why needed - to identify specific units driving performance; Quick check - verify that identified neurons show consistent activity patterns
- **Bottleneck identification**: Why needed - to locate critical components in the processing pipeline; Quick check - confirm that removing bottlenecks significantly impacts performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input signal -> Convolutional layers -> Recurrent states -> Output decoder -> Speech reconstruction

**Critical Path:** The convolutional channels and early recurrent states form the critical bottleneck for cross-modal transfer, as these components show the strongest causal effects when substituted between modes.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The model appears optimized for vocalized speech processing, with representations that can partially compensate for degraded input modes but not vice versa. This asymmetry suggests a design prioritizing robustness over bidirectional transfer capability.

**Failure Signatures:** Catastrophic performance degradation occurs when attempting reverse substitution (imagined/mimed to vocalized), indicating that the model's representational geometry is not invertible across modes.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test cross-modal patching at individual layer boundaries to identify precise transfer points
2. Conduct systematic ablation of identified bottleneck channels to quantify individual contributions
3. Apply representational similarity analysis to compare geometric alignment of mode-specific subspaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Causal claims based on activation patching may not reflect true neural representational structure
- Performance metrics may not capture all aspects of speech quality differences
- Neuron-level analysis could reflect correlated activity rather than independent causal units
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific architecture and dataset used

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The existence of layer-specific subspaces that mediate cross-mode transfer effects
**Medium confidence:** The directional asymmetry between vocalized-to-imagined/mimed transfer versus reverse transfer
**Medium confidence:** The identification of bottleneck channels and recurrent states
**Low confidence:** The precise causal role of identified neuron subsets

## Next Checks
1. Replicate activation patching experiments using different model architectures and brain signal datasets to test generalizability of subspace transfer findings
2. Conduct ablation studies that systematically remove identified bottleneck channels and recurrent segments to quantify their individual contributions to cross-mode decoding performance
3. Apply alternative interpretability methods such as representational similarity analysis or causal tracing to independently verify identified subspaces and their directional transfer properties
