# The Feasibility of Training Sovereign Language Models in the Global South: A Study of Brazil and Mexico

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19801
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: H100-based deployments cost 8–14M USD and are fiscally viable; A100 scenarios cost 19–32M USD due to higher hardware and energy needs.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the feasibility of training sovereign-scale language models in Brazil and Mexico under hardware and energy constraints. Using a dual-axis design varying accelerator type (H100 vs A100) and training duration (90 vs 150 days), it estimates compute demand, energy use, capital costs, and regulatory compatibility for a 10-trillion-token model. Results show that H100-based deployments are fiscally viable at 8–14 million USD, while A100 configurations cost 19–32 million USD due to higher hardware and energy needs. All scenarios remain below export-control and infrastructure thresholds. Extending training timelines is identified as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling usable, locally aligned AI capabilities without requiring frontier-level compute.

## Method Summary
The study performs analytical cost modeling of sovereign-scale LLM training in Brazil and Mexico, using a 3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs compute budget derived from DeepSeek-V3 specifications. It varies accelerator type (H100/A100) and training duration (90/150 days) to estimate GPU counts, energy use, and costs. No actual model training is conducted; instead, closed-form formulas are used to project CAPEX (hardware plus integration overhead and tariffs) and OPEX (energy consumption at local industrial rates). Outputs are validated against national export-control limits (50K GPUs), grid capacity (10MW peak), and a fiscal ceiling of 52M USD.

## Key Results
- H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a total cost of 8–14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19–32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand.
- All configurations remain below the 50,000 GPU export-control threshold and 10 MW peak power limit, enabling deployment without high-voltage interconnection or special permits.
- Extending training from 90 to 150 days reduces GPU fleet size by ~40%, lowering peak load and capital costs, and is identified as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hardware efficiency (FLOPs per watt and per dollar) determines fiscal viability more than absolute budget size.
- Mechanism: H100 GPUs deliver ~6.4× higher throughput (2,000 vs 312 TFLOPs) at only 1.75× the power (700W vs 400W TDP), reducing the GPU fleet needed for a fixed compute budget. Fewer GPUs lower both capital outlay and cumulative energy draw, compressing total cost from 19–32M USD (A100) to 8–14M USD (H100).
- Core assumption: MFU of 0.552 holds across both accelerator generations; throughput scales linearly with GPU count.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a total cost of 8–14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19–32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand."
  - [Section 3.3] "CAPEX dominates total system cost in all scenarios... confirming that fiscal feasibility hinges overwhelmingly on accelerator generation and tariff regimes rather than energy pricing."
  - [corpus] Related work (Sastry et al., 2024, cited in paper) notes generational efficiency gains are the primary driver of feasible national-scale deployments; no direct external validation of Brazil/Mexico-specific cost modeling.
- Break condition: If MFU degrades significantly on A100 clusters (e.g., due to communication overhead at 2,200+ GPU scale), energy and hardware costs would exceed projections, pushing A100 scenarios further from viability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Extending training timelines reduces GPU count and peak power proportionally, acting as a policy lever under hardware constraints.
- Mechanism: For a fixed compute budget (3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs), doubling training time halves required throughput per day, reducing GPU fleet size by ~40% (e.g., H100: 584 GPUs at 90d → 350 GPUs at 150d). Smaller clusters lower peak load (0.64 MW → 0.41 MW) and capital cost (13.8M → 8.3M USD).
- Core assumption: Extended training windows do not materially increase failure rates, checkpoint overhead, or opportunity costs that would offset hardware savings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Extending training timelines is identified as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling usable, locally aligned AI capabilities without requiring frontier-level compute."
  - [Section 2.2] "Extending training from 90 to 150 days compounds this effect, lowering requirements by roughly 40 percent across both hardware classes."
  - [corpus] No external corpus papers directly test extended-duration training as a policy strategy; mechanism is model-based within this study.
- Break condition: If training stability degrades over 150-day runs (hardware failures, divergence), restart costs could erode savings. Real-world failure rates at this scale are not empirically validated in the paper.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Medium-voltage distribution infrastructure (1–10 MW) is sufficient for sovereign-scale training without high-voltage interconnection.
- Mechanism: All modeled configurations stay below 1.5 MW peak load, within the 3–5 MW capacity typical of 13–34 kV industrial distribution networks in Querétaro and São Paulo. This avoids substation upgrades and permitting delays.
- Core assumption: Industrial parks can sustain continuous near-peak load for 90–150 days without reliability incidents or curtailment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.4] "We identify 1MW as the practical threshold for deployment without additional permitting or physical infrastructure upgrades in urban industrial parks."
  - [Section 3.2] "The largest configuration (A100–90d) requires 1.49 MW... Both figures remain under the 10 MW ceiling."
  - [corpus] "Renewable Energy Transition in South America" (arXiv:2503.17771) models energy capacity expansion but does not address datacenter-scale continuous loads; infrastructure claims rely on national planning documents (PRODESEN, ONS) cited in the paper.
- Break condition: If local grids experience instability or if utility contracts impose demand charges that scale with peak load, OPEX could rise materially above the <5% of total cost projected.

## Foundational Learning

- **FLOPs-based compute budgeting**
  - Why needed here: The entire feasibility analysis hinges on translating a 10-trillion-token training run into a fixed FLOPs budget (3.0×10²⁴) and then back into GPU-hours.
  - Quick check question: Given 3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs and 2,000 TFLOPs/GPU at 0.552 MFU, how many GPU-days are needed for a 90-day training run?

- **GPU throughput metrics (TFLOPs, MFU, TDP)**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes peak TFLOPs and applies a utilization factor; misunderstanding these would break cost and power projections.
  - Quick check question: If MFU drops from 0.552 to 0.40, what happens to the required GPU count for the same compute budget?

- **Datacenter power economics (PUE, peak load, tariffs)**
  - Why needed here: Energy cost is modeled as GPU TDP × PUE × hours × tariff; PUE of 1.3 and country-specific tariffs (88–110 USD/MWh) materially affect OPEX.
  - Quick check question: At 1.49 MW peak load, 1.3 PUE, and 90 days continuous operation, what is the total MWh consumed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Compute -> GPUs (350–2,200 units) -> Power (1–10 MW peak) -> Cooling (PUE 1.3) -> Cost (CAPEX + OPEX)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Fix compute budget (FLOPs) based on model size and token count
  2. Select hardware generation and training duration → derive GPU count
  3. Validate peak load against local grid capacity (target <1 MW for easy deployment, <10 MW hard ceiling)
  4. Sum CAPEX + OPEX; compare against fiscal ceiling (52M USD reference)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - H100 + short timeline: Lowest total cost (8–14M), highest hardware availability risk (export controls, supply)
  - A100 + long timeline: Higher cost (19–32M), lower hardware risk (legacy chips more available), higher energy draw
  - Training duration extension: Reduces GPU count and peak power but increases project timeline and operational risk

- **Failure signatures**:
  - GPU count exceeds 50,000 → export-control ceiling breached (not observed in any scenario)
  - Peak load exceeds 10 MW → requires high-voltage interconnection (not observed, max is 1.49 MW)
  - Total cost exceeds 52M USD → fiscally infeasible (not observed, max is 32.6M USD for A100–90d Brazil)
  - Assumption: Training run failure/restart costs are not modeled; high failure rates would increase effective costs

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sensitivity analysis on MFU**: Re-run GPU count and cost projections at MFU 0.40 and 0.65 to bound best/worst-case efficiency.
  2. **Grid reliability stress test**: Model the impact of 5–10% grid downtime on training duration and cost (restart overhead, checkpoint frequency).
  3. **Tariff scenario modeling**: Test 20% and 50% increases in industrial electricity tariffs to assess OPEX sensitivity; validate whether OPEX remains <5% of total cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can models trained at 10-trillion-token scale actually deliver "strategically sufficient" performance for the specific sovereign use cases identified (legal reasoning, educational content, administrative automation)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper defines "strategically sufficient" models by their intended applications but uses DeepSeek-V3's aggregate benchmark score (80.0 on ArtificialAnalysis.ai) as a proxy, without validating performance on domain-specific tasks or local languages.
- Why unresolved: Aggregate benchmark performance does not guarantee adequacy for specialized sovereign applications, particularly in Portuguese and Spanish with local legal/administrative terminology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation of models trained at this scale on domain-specific benchmarks (e.g., legal reasoning in Brazilian Portuguese, Mexican administrative procedures) and comparison to minimum performance thresholds for each use case.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do these feasibility findings generalize to other Global South countries with different infrastructure conditions, tariff regimes, and electricity costs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study is explicitly limited to Brazil and Mexico, selected as upper-middle-income countries with specific grid conditions; no claim of generalizability is made.
- Why unresolved: Countries like Nigeria, Indonesia, or Vietnam face substantially different constraints—less reliable grids, different import tariffs, and varying industrial electricity rates—that could change feasibility outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of this modeling framework across a diverse sample of Global South countries, varying grid reliability, tariffs, and energy costs systematically.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the inference costs and infrastructure requirements for sovereign deployment of these models over their operational lifecycle?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper calculates only training expenditures (CAPEX + first-year training OPEX) but omits inference costs, which may exceed training costs over time and require sustained infrastructure investment.
- Why unresolved: A sovereign model must not only be trained but deployed and queried; inference compute demands could impose ongoing fiscal and energy burdens not captured in this analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modeling of inference demand profiles for typical sovereign applications (e.g., government services, educational platforms) with associated energy, hardware, and cost projections over a 3–5 year operational horizon.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation of training runs or hardware deployment at modeled scale; assumptions about MFU, PUE, and grid reliability are not experimentally verified.
- Infrastructure claims (grid reliability, industrial park capacity) are based on national planning documents but not stress-tested at 2,000+ GPU cluster scale.
- Training stability, checkpoint overhead, and failure rates for 90–150 day runs are not supported by experimental data and could materially affect effective cost and feasibility.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The relative hardware efficiency advantage of H100 over A100 and resulting cost gap (8–14M USD vs 19–32M USD) are well-supported by transparent throughput and TDP specs. Export-control and infrastructure thresholds (50K GPUs, 10MW peak) are based on documented national policies and grid standards.
- **Medium confidence**: Absolute cost figures and energy use projections depend on unverified assumptions about MFU, PUE, and grid reliability in real-world deployments. Training duration as a policy lever is plausible but lacks empirical validation.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about training stability, failure rates, and restart costs for 90–150 day runs are not supported by experimental data and could erode projected savings from extending timelines.

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical MFU and PUE validation**: Deploy a small-scale (e.g., 32–64 GPU) cluster in each country and measure real-world MFU and PUE under continuous load to validate analytical assumptions.
2. **Infrastructure stress test**: Conduct a technical audit of industrial parks in Querétaro and São Paulo to confirm that 1–10 MW sustained loads can be supported without grid upgrades or curtailment risk.
3. **Extended-duration training trial**: Run a pilot training job for 30–60 days on a 100+ GPU cluster, measuring checkpoint overhead, failure rates, and recovery time to quantify operational risk of longer training windows.
