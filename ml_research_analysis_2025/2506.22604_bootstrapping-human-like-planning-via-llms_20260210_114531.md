# Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604
- Reference count: 36
- This paper proposes a command-to-action-sequence pipeline using LLMs to translate natural language commands into human-like action sequences for robot end-user programming

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to translating natural language commands into executable robot actions using large language models (LLMs). The authors develop a command-to-action-sequence (CAS) pipeline that infers relevant entities, translates commands into symbolic action sequences, and post-processes these sequences for domain compatibility. The approach is evaluated across four different LLM configurations (pretrained and fine-tuned) using household task datasets, demonstrating that larger models generally outperform smaller ones in producing action sequences that match human-generated sequences, while smaller fine-tuned models also show effectiveness in advancing robots toward intended states.

## Method Summary
The proposed command-to-action-sequence (CAS) pipeline consists of three main components: entity inference using LLMs to identify relevant objects in the environment, command translation where the LLM converts natural language commands into symbolic action sequences, and post-processing to ensure domain compatibility. The pipeline was evaluated using four different LLM models (both pretrained and fine-tuned) on a dataset of household tasks. The evaluation metrics include action similarity and final state similarity compared to human-generated sequences, as well as assessment of how well the generated sequences advance robots toward intended states.

## Key Results
- Larger LLM models generally outperform smaller ones in producing action sequences matching human-generated sequences
- Smaller fine-tuned models also perform well, producing action sequences that significantly advance robots toward intended final states
- The approach demonstrates effectiveness in bootstrapping robot end-user programming, though improvements are needed for user evaluation and integration with actual EUP tools

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from LLMs' ability to understand natural language context and generate structured action sequences. By leveraging the pre-existing knowledge encoded in LLMs and fine-tuning them on relevant task data, the system can infer contextual entities, understand temporal dependencies in commands, and generate plausible action sequences. The post-processing step ensures generated sequences are compatible with the robot's operational domain, bridging the gap between natural language understanding and executable robot commands.

## Foundational Learning
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding how LLMs parse and interpret natural language commands
  - Why needed: Core capability for translating human instructions to machine actions
  - Quick check: Test LLM's ability to correctly identify entities and actions in sample commands
- Symbolic Planning: Representing actions as discrete symbols that can be sequenced
  - Why needed: Enables structured representation of robot behaviors
  - Quick check: Verify generated action sequences form valid symbolic representations
- Robot Domain Knowledge: Understanding the constraints and capabilities of the robot environment
  - Why needed: Ensures generated actions are executable by the robot
  - Quick check: Confirm post-processing maintains action feasibility within domain constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Natural Language Command -> Entity Inference -> Action Sequence Generation -> Post-processing -> Domain-Compatible Actions

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence is Natural Language Command → Entity Inference → Action Sequence Generation, as errors in early stages propagate downstream. Post-processing serves as a safeguard but cannot fully compensate for poor initial generation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The paper balances model size (larger models perform better but are more computationally expensive) against fine-tuning (smaller fine-tuned models can achieve comparable results). The post-processing step adds domain safety but may reduce the naturalness of generated sequences.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include incorrect entity identification (missing or wrong objects), implausible action sequences (actions that don't logically follow from the command), and domain incompatibility (actions the robot cannot execute). Fine-tuned models show fewer entity identification errors but may produce more repetitive action patterns.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test entity inference accuracy on a diverse set of household commands
2. Evaluate action sequence plausibility by having humans rate the logical flow of generated sequences
3. Measure post-processing effectiveness by comparing domain compatibility before and after processing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on similarity metrics to human-generated sequences rather than actual robot performance
- Dataset limited to household tasks, potentially limiting generalizability to more complex environments
- Post-processing effectiveness is described but not extensively validated through comprehensive evaluation

## Confidence

High confidence claims:
- Smaller fine-tuned models can effectively advance robots toward intended states (based on action similarity metrics)

Medium confidence claims:
- Larger models generally outperform smaller ones in producing action sequences (limited scope of tested tasks and potential reference sequence bias)
- LLMs are effective in bootstrapping robot end-user programming (relies on proxy metrics rather than user studies or real implementations)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the generated action sequences in actual end-user programming scenarios
2. Implement the pipeline on a physical robot to test the real-world performance of the generated action sequences and validate the domain compatibility post-processing
3. Expand the evaluation to include more diverse and complex tasks beyond household activities to assess the generalizability of the approach
