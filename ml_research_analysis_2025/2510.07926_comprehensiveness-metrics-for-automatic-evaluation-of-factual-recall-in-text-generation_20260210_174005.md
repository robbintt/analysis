core_contribution: This paper introduces three methods for evaluating the comprehensiveness
  of LLM-generated responses by detecting missing information from a given corpus.
  The NLI-based approach decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural
  language inference to identify missing links, while the Q&A-based method extracts
  question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources.

# Comprehensiveness Metrics for Automatic Evaluation of Factual Recall in Text Generation

- Three automated methods for evaluating LLM response comprehensiveness by detecting missing information from source corpora

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces three distinct approaches for automatically evaluating how comprehensively large language models recall and incorporate information from source texts. The methods include NLI-based decomposition, Q&A-based extraction, and a direct end-to-end approach using LLMs. Experiments on synthetic datasets (WikiContradict, ConflictBank) and real-world Reddit queries demonstrate that the simplest end-to-end method surprisingly outperforms more complex approaches, though with trade-offs in interpretability and robustness. The work establishes that automated comprehensiveness evaluation is feasible and practical for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The paper presents three complementary methods for comprehensiveness evaluation. The NLI-based approach decomposes source and generated texts into atomic statements, then uses natural language inference to identify missing information. The Q&A-based method extracts question-answer pairs from sources and compares responses across documents. The end-to-end approach directly uses LLMs to identify missing content without intermediate steps. Each method addresses the challenge of determining what factual information from a source corpus was omitted in generated responses, with varying degrees of complexity and performance trade-offs.

## Key Results
- End-to-end approach outperforms NLI and Q&A methods despite its simplicity
- gpt-oss-120b achieved comprehensiveness scores of 0.71 (Q&A) and 0.83 (E2E) on Reddit queries
- Limited evaluation scope (10 examples) affects statistical significance of performance differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from leveraging LLMs' inherent ability to understand and compare textual content directly, bypassing the need for complex decomposition and intermediate processing steps. By using the model itself to identify missing information, the approach capitalizes on the model's contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. This direct approach reduces error propagation from intermediate steps and simplifies the evaluation pipeline, though at the cost of reduced interpretability and potential robustness issues.

## Foundational Learning
- Natural Language Inference (NLI): Understanding entailment relationships between statements
  - Why needed: Core mechanism for detecting missing information in NLI-based approach
  - Quick check: Can you explain entailment vs contradiction vs neutral?

- Question-Answer Pair Extraction: Converting text into QA format for comparison
  - Why needed: Enables systematic comparison of information coverage across sources
  - Quick check: What are the challenges in generating meaningful questions from text?

- End-to-end LLM Evaluation: Direct assessment of response quality without intermediate steps
  - Why needed: Simplifies pipeline while leveraging model's inherent understanding
  - Quick check: What are the trade-offs between simplicity and interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Source Corpus -> Processing Method -> Comprehensiveness Score

Critical Path: Text Processing → Information Extraction → Missing Content Detection → Score Calculation

Design Tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. Interpretability vs. Robustness
- NLI-based: High interpretability, complex pipeline, resource-intensive
- Q&A-based: Moderate complexity, dependent on question quality
- E2E: Simple, high performance, low interpretability

Failure Signatures:
- NLI: Poor performance with insufficient training data
- Q&A: Ineffective question generation leading to incomplete coverage
- E2E: Sensitivity to prompt variations and context

First Experiments:
1. Test each method on simple, controlled text pairs with known missing information
2. Evaluate robustness across different prompt formulations
3. Compare performance on synthetic vs. real-world query sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- NLI-based approach requires substantial training data not fully implemented
- Small evaluation set (10 examples) limits statistical significance
- E2E method sacrifices interpretability for performance gains

## Confidence
- High: Automated comprehensiveness evaluation is feasible; E2E approach outperforms complex methods
- Medium: Generalizability of findings given limited evaluation scope
- Low: Robustness claims, particularly E2E approach sensitivity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale evaluation with more diverse examples to strengthen statistical validity
2. Implement and test NLI-based approach with proper training data for fair comparison
3. Evaluate methods across multiple domains and query types to assess generalizability
