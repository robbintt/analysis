# Analyzing Patient Daily Movement Behavior Dynamics Using Two-Stage Encoding Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09947
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09947
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Two-stage self-supervised framework analyzes dementia patient daily movement behavior by converting activity logs to text strings, encoding with fine-tuned language model, and applying PageRank on t-SNE-reduced vectors to identify latent behavioral states and transitions.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a two-stage self-supervised learning approach to analyze patient daily movement behavior using home activity records from individuals with dementia. The method first converts time-series activity data into text strings, which are encoded using a fine-tuned language model to produce high-dimensional vector representations. These vectors are then reduced to two dimensions using t-SNE, enabling the application of the PageRank algorithm to analyze latent state transitions and quantitatively assess behavioral patterns. By identifying activity biases and clustering similar behavioral patterns, the approach offers insights into patient behavior that can support personalized care interventions. The results demonstrate the potential of this framework to uncover interpretable behavioral dynamics and support clinical diagnosis, though further validation and refinement are needed for broader applications.

## Method Summary
The framework preprocesses time-series home activity data (from PIR sensors and sleep mats) by converting 20-minute interval activity logs into text strings. These strings are encoded using a fine-tuned MiniLM-L12-v2 sentence transformer via cluster-based contrastive learning with triplet loss. The resulting 384-dimensional embeddings are reduced to 2D using t-SNE, clustered with K-means (K=5 optimal by silhouette score), and analyzed using PageRank on a transition matrix constructed from spatial proximity between clusters. This enables quantitative assessment of behavioral patterns and latent state transitions that can correlate with clinical metrics like MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores.

## Key Results
- The two-stage encoding framework successfully identifies latent behavioral states in dementia patients using home activity data
- PageRank analysis on t-SNE-reduced embeddings reveals meaningful transition patterns between behavioral states
- The approach identifies activity biases and clusters similar behavioral patterns, offering insights for personalized care interventions
- Framework shows promise for supporting clinical diagnosis, though further validation is needed for broader applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting discrete time-series activity data into text strings enables language models to capture temporal and semantic patterns in behavioral data.
- Mechanism: Raw sensor data (timestamped room entries/exits) is discretized into 20-minute windows, converted to text tokens (e.g., "lounge_kitchen_bedroom_nowhere"), then processed by a pre-trained sentence transformer (all-MiniLM-L12-v2). The model's attention mechanisms treat activity sequences analogously to word sequences, learning embeddings where similar behavioral patterns cluster together.
- Core assumption: Activity sequences share structural properties with natural language that language models can exploit.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "first stage involves converting time-series activities into text strings, which are then encoded by a fine-tuned language model"
  - [section 2.3] "We then utilize the all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model... This model excels at capturing similarities in textual information, making it suitable for analyzing similarities between recorded dates"
  - [corpus] Related work (Capstick et al. 2024, cited in paper) applies GPT-based text encoders to string representations of in-home activity data for clustering—suggesting transferability but not proving this is optimal.
- Break condition: If activity patterns lack sequential dependencies that language models capture (e.g., purely random room transitions), the encoding may not improve over simpler statistical features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-dimensional projection with PageRank analysis extracts interpretable latent behavioral states and their transition dynamics.
- Mechanism: High-dimensional embeddings (384-dim) are reduced to 2D via t-SNE, then clustered with K-means (K=5 optimal by silhouette score). A transition matrix is constructed based on spatial proximity between clusters across time, and PageRank scores quantify the "importance" or dwell tendency of each behavioral state.
- Core assumption: t-SNE preserves meaningful neighborhood structure such that spatial proximity in 2D reflects behavioral similarity, and transition frequency correlates with clinical relevance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "vectors are then reduced to two dimensions using t-SNE, enabling the application of the PageRank algorithm to analyze latent state transitions"
  - [section A.4.2] Transition matrix T_ij is computed based on distance thresholds between samples in different clusters
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—PageRank has been applied to biological networks (Iván & Grolmusz 2011, cited), but application to behavioral state transitions via t-SNE embeddings appears novel and unvalidated externally.
- Break condition: If t-SNE distorts cluster boundaries or if transition matrices are sensitive to arbitrary distance thresholds, PageRank scores may not reflect true behavioral dynamics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cluster-based contrastive learning with triplet loss enables self-supervised fine-tuning without labeled behavioral data.
- Mechanism: Daily activity strings are one-hot encoded and clustered. Positive pairs are defined as same-participant, same-cluster samples within 30 days; negatives are random other samples. Triplet loss with Manhattan distance optimizes embeddings to pull similar days closer and push dissimilar days apart.
- Core assumption: Temporal proximity (30-day window) combined with cluster membership identifies behaviorally similar days for dementia patients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section A.3] "k-means clustering of the encoded vectors yielded the best results with a 30-day window"
  - [section A.3] Silhouette scores: 30-day window (0.554) outperforms 7-day (0.459) and 180-day (0.437)
  - [corpus] Semi-supervised contrastive learning for time series is established (Kim et al. 2024, Franceschi et al. 2019, cited), but the specific cluster-based positive selection strategy is not externally validated.
- Break condition: If behavioral patterns change faster or slower than 30 days for different patients, the positive sample selection may be too rigid, reducing embedding quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sentence Transformers / Text Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on mapping activity sequences to dense vectors. Understanding how sentence-BERT models produce 384-dim embeddings via mean pooling over token representations is essential for debugging encoding quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the same activity sequence encoded twice might produce slightly different embeddings, and how pooling strategy affects the output?

- Concept: **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
  - Why needed here: The second stage depends on 2D visualization and clustering. t-SNE's stochastic nature, perplexity parameter, and tendency to preserve local over global structure directly affect downstream PageRank results.
  - Quick check question: What happens to cluster separation if you run t-SNE with perplexity=5 vs perplexity=50 on the same dataset?

- Concept: **PageRank Algorithm**
  - Why needed here: Transition importance scoring uses PageRank's random-walk-with-restart formulation. Understanding damping factor α and convergence criteria is needed to interpret state importance scores.
  - Quick check question: If α=0.85 and a patient has 5 behavioral states, what does a PageRank score of 0.30 for one state indicate about their behavioral patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Raw sensor logs (PIR + sleep mats) → Preprocessing (20-min binning, "nowhere" labeling) → Text string conversion → Fine-tuned MiniLM-L12-v2 encoder (384-dim) → t-SNE dimensionality reduction (2-dim) → K-means clustering (K=5) → Transition matrix construction (distance threshold) → PageRank computation (α=0.85) → Patient similarity analysis / clinical correlation

- Critical path:
  1. **Preprocessing consistency**: Incorrect binning or missing "nowhere" labels corrupts all downstream embeddings
  2. **Language model fine-tuning**: Poor triplet sampling (wrong positive/negative selection) yields embeddings without behavioral discrimination
  3. **Transition matrix threshold**: Arbitrary distance threshold for defining "transitions" directly shapes PageRank scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **20-minute bins**: Reduces 86,400 daily points to 72 tokens (within model limits) but loses sub-20-min behavioral detail
  - **t-SNE vs. UMAP/PCA**: t-SNE preserves local clusters well but is stochastic and slow; UMAP would be faster and more reproducible
  - **K=5 clusters**: Determined by silhouette score on test set; may not generalize to other dementia populations
  - **30-day positive window**: Aligns with monthly clinical checkups but assumes stable behavior within windows

- Failure signatures:
  - **All embeddings collapse to similar vectors**: Triplet loss not converging; check learning rate, positive/negative balance
  - **Clusters don't separate in 2D t-SNE**: Embeddings lack discriminative structure; revisit fine-tuning or preprocessing
  - **PageRank scores uniform across states**: Transition matrix too dense (threshold too large) or too sparse (threshold too small)
  - **Similar patients show no clinical correlation**: Embedding space doesn't capture clinically relevant features; may need supervised fine-tuning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate preprocessing pipeline**: Take 3 participants with known behavioral patterns (e.g., high bathroom visits at night), verify text strings correctly represent this before/after encoding.
  2. **Ablate fine-tuning**: Compare embeddings from pre-trained MiniLM (no fine-tuning) vs. fine-tuned model using silhouette scores and downstream cluster separation. This tests whether domain adaptation is necessary.
  3. **Sensitivity analysis on transition threshold**: Vary the distance threshold for transition matrix construction (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 in t-SNE space) and measure how PageRank scores change for a single patient. Document threshold stability before clinical interpretation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed two-stage encoding framework be adapted into a generative model to synthesize realistic medical time-series data for data augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state, "we could explore transforming this approach into a generative model... for purposes like data augmentation."
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses solely on representation learning and analysis; it does not implement or test the framework's capability to generate synthetic data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A generative extension of the model that produces synthetic patient activity logs statistically similar to real data, validated by clinical experts or classification metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust are the derived latent state vectors to the stochastic nature of the t-SNE dimensionality reduction step?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on t-SNE to create the 2D projection required for the PageRank algorithm. Since t-SNE results can vary significantly based on initialization and perplexity, the stability of the resulting transition matrix is not quantified.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a single deterministic view of the state transitions without analyzing variance caused by the dimensionality reduction technique.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study measuring the variance in PageRank vectors across multiple t-SNE runs with varying random seeds and perplexity settings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the identified behavioral transition patterns predict longitudinal clinical decline (e.g., rate of MMSE change) more effectively than static activity metrics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes that further validation is needed and aims to support interventions, but the current experiments primarily demonstrate correlations with static clinical scores (MMSE, ADAS-Cog) rather than predictive power over time.
- Why unresolved: The framework identifies "activity biases" and clusters, but the clinical utility depends on proving these dynamics precede or correlate with disease progression speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study correlating specific PageRank transition profiles with the rate of cognitive decline over subsequent months or years.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness is only demonstrated on a single dataset (50 participants), limiting generalizability to other dementia populations or sensor configurations
- The 30-day positive sampling window and K=5 cluster selection are optimized for this cohort but may require patient-specific tuning for other populations
- The reliance on t-SNE for 2D projection introduces stochastic variability that affects downstream PageRank results but is not quantified in the paper

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The preprocessing pipeline (20-minute binning, text string conversion) is clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The fine-tuning procedure works as described for this dataset, but the generalizability of the 30-day positive sampling strategy to other dementia populations is uncertain.
- **Medium confidence**: The PageRank transition analysis captures meaningful behavioral states for this cohort, but the arbitrary distance threshold for transition matrix construction limits interpretability.
- **Low confidence**: The framework's ability to detect clinically meaningful behavioral changes or support diagnosis is claimed but not rigorously validated against ground truth behavioral assessments.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply the framework to a different dementia cohort with varying sensor configurations to test whether the 30-day positive sampling window and K=5 clusters remain optimal, or if these hyperparameters need patient-specific tuning.
2. **Temporal stability analysis**: Track PageRank scores and cluster assignments for individual patients across 6+ months to verify that the framework captures stable behavioral patterns rather than short-term fluctuations, particularly important for clinical monitoring.
3. **Clinical correlation validation**: Test whether the PageRank-derived behavioral states correlate with independent clinical assessments (caregiver burden scores, medication changes) beyond the initial MMSE/ADAS-Cog correlations reported, to establish the framework's clinical utility.
