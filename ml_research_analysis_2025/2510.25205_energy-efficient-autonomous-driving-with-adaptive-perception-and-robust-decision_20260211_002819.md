# Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205
- Authors: Yuyang Xia; Zibo Liang; Liwei Deng; Yan Zhao; Han Su; Kai Zheng
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed EneAD framework achieves 1.9× to 3.5× reduction in perception energy consumption while improving driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EneAD, an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that addresses the high computational costs of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. The framework dynamically adapts perception model selection and execution framerate based on driving conditions while maintaining driving performance and safety. Using Bayesian optimization with meta-learning, EneAD identifies low-computation configurations that meet accuracy requirements. The approach significantly reduces energy consumption without compromising safety metrics, making autonomous vehicles more energy-efficient and extending their driving range.

## Method Summary
EneAD consists of two main components: an adaptive perception module and a robust decision module. The adaptive perception module manages multiple perception models with varying computational costs and dynamically adjusts their execution framerate based on driving conditions. The robust decision module enhances stability when dealing with perturbed perception results, ensuring consistent driving performance. The system employs Bayesian optimization with meta-learning to efficiently search for optimal configurations that balance computational cost and perception accuracy. The framework is evaluated in Carla simulator environments across different traffic densities, demonstrating significant energy savings while maintaining safety and comfort metrics.

## Key Results
- Perception energy consumption reduced by 1.9× to 3.5× compared to baseline approaches
- Driving range improved by 3.9% to 8.5% through reduced energy consumption
- Safety and comfort metrics maintained across various traffic density scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from intelligent resource allocation and adaptive computation. By selecting lower-computation perception models when high accuracy isn't critical and adjusting framerates dynamically, EneAD minimizes unnecessary processing. The robust decision module compensates for potential accuracy loss from simplified perception, maintaining driving stability. Bayesian optimization with meta-learning enables rapid identification of optimal configurations without exhaustive search, making the approach practical for real-time deployment.

- **Adaptive Perception**: Dynamic selection of perception models based on current requirements; quick check: accuracy-cost tradeoff curves
- **Robust Decision-Making**: Decision systems that maintain performance under uncertain or degraded inputs; quick check: stability metrics under perception perturbations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Perception Models -> Adaptive Selection Module -> Framerate Controller -> Robust Decision Module -> Vehicle Control

**Critical Path:** Sensor Input → Adaptive Perception → Robust Decision → Vehicle Control → Motion Execution

**Design Tradeoffs:** Computational efficiency vs. perception accuracy, real-time adaptability vs. optimization thoroughness, energy savings vs. potential safety margins

**Failure Signatures:** Degraded perception accuracy leading to conservative driving behavior, suboptimal framerate selection causing perception lag, Bayesian optimization convergence to local minima

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test adaptive model selection on simple highway driving scenarios to verify basic energy savings
2. Evaluate robust decision module performance under simulated perception degradation
3. Benchmark Bayesian optimization convergence speed across different traffic density profiles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Simulation-based validation may not accurately reflect real-world energy consumption patterns
- Assumes perception energy dominates total vehicle energy consumption, which may not hold in all scenarios
- Bayesian optimization assumes stationary perception model performance characteristics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical framework for adaptive perception management and robust decision-making is sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Energy savings percentages are plausible but require real-world validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about maintaining safety and comfort metrics across all traffic densities are not empirically verified beyond simulation

## Next Checks
1. Deploy the framework on actual autonomous driving hardware with power monitoring to measure real-world perception energy consumption and validate simulation-based energy savings claims
2. Test the Bayesian-optimized configurations across diverse environmental conditions (rain, snow, varying lighting) and sensor degradation scenarios to assess robustness of the adaptive mechanisms
3. Conduct comprehensive energy audits comparing total vehicle energy consumption with and without the adaptive perception framework across extended driving cycles, accounting for computational overhead and real-world driving patterns
