# Optimization of Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks Utilizing Historical Dynamics of Refractory Periods

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.02960
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02960
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** HDRP-SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR10 (96.70%), CIFAR100 (80.91%), ImageNet-1k (70.45%), and sets new record on CIFAR10-DVS (87.00%)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the over-activation problem in low-latency Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by introducing the Historical Dynamic Refractory Period (HDRP) model. The HDRP mechanism dynamically adjusts refractory periods using membrane potential derivatives and historical firing rates, combined with a threshold-dependent refractory kernel. This approach effectively suppresses redundant spikes while preserving binary characteristics. The method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k, and CIFAR10-DVS, while also showing improved noise robustness and lower energy consumption compared to both traditional SNNs and ANNs.

## Method Summary
The HDRP model extends standard LIF neurons by dynamically adjusting refractory periods based on membrane potential derivatives and historical firing patterns. The refractory time constant τ_ref is modulated by the previous time step and the derivative of the current membrane potential, normalized via min-max scaling. A threshold-dependent refractory kernel g(τ_ref) = U_th * tanh(Aτ_ref) modulates synaptic current by subtracting an inhibition term proportional to both firing threshold and refractory period length. The network is trained using Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation (STBP) with surrogate gradients. The method aims to reduce redundant spikes in low-latency settings while maintaining classification accuracy and energy efficiency.

## Key Results
- HDRP-SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy: 96.70% on CIFAR10, 80.91% on CIFAR100, and 70.45% on ImageNet-1k
- Sets new record on CIFAR10-DVS dataset with 87.00% accuracy
- Demonstrates superior noise robustness with up to 8.29% improvement over standard SNNs and ANNs under high Gaussian noise levels
- Maintains lower energy consumption than ANNs while outperforming traditional SNNs
- Ablation studies confirm that the combination of adaptive dynamic decay and historical refractory period is crucial for performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Historical Dynamic Refractory Period (HDRP) Estimation
Dynamic adjustment of refractory period duration based on membrane potential derivatives and firing history reduces over-activation in low-latency SNNs. The refractory time constant τ_ref^(l,t) is modulated by both the previous time step τ_ref^(l,t-1) and the derivative of the current membrane potential U'(l,t), normalized via min-max scaling. This creates a feedback loop where rapid membrane potential changes extend the refractory period, while historical firing patterns implicitly encode neuron excitability levels.

### Mechanism 2: Threshold-Dependent Refractory Kernel
A learnable refractory kernel that scales inhibition strength with refractory period duration suppresses noise spikes while preserving responsiveness to meaningful inputs. The kernel g(τ_ref) = U_th * tanh(Aτ_ref) modulates synaptic current by subtracting an inhibition term proportional to both firing threshold and refractory period length. Longer refractory periods produce stronger suppression, creating a soft barrier against spurious firing.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Dynamic Decay via Membrane Potential Derivative
Using the derivative of membrane potential to adaptively adjust decay factors outperforms fixed decay strategies in low-latency settings. Instead of fixed decay factors, the decay rate is computed from the normalized membrane potential derivative, allowing neurons with rapidly changing states to recover more slowly from refractory inhibition. This creates a data-dependent temporal modulation absent in traditional approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: HDRP extends the standard LIF model; understanding membrane potential integration, threshold crossing, and reset mechanisms is prerequisite to grasping how refractory periods modulate these dynamics
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the membrane potential U(t) evolves in a vanilla LIF neuron between spike events?

- **Concept: Surrogate Gradient Training in SNNs**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) with surrogate gradients to train HDRP-SNN; understanding how non-differentiable spike functions are approximated is essential for implementing the training loop
  - Quick check question: Why can't standard backpropagation be directly applied to SNNs, and how do surrogate gradients address this?

- **Concept: Refractory Periods in Biological and Artificial Neurons**
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on biological refractory mechanisms; distinguishing between complete suppression (absolute) and graded recovery (relative) clarifies why HDRP adopts the relative approach
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between absolute and relative refractory periods, and why might a fixed absolute refractory period harm low-latency SNNs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Encoding Layer → Conv/FC Layers → HDRP-LIF Neurons → Readout Layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Derivative computation: U'^(l,t) = -1/τ_m × (U^(l,t-1) - U_rest) + I^(l,t)
  2. Normalization: k(U') = (U' - U'_min)/(U'_max - U'_min)
  3. Refractory update: τ_ref^(l,t) = k(U') × τ_ref^(l,t-1) + spike-dependent terms
  4. Kernel application: g(τ_ref) = U_th × tanh(A × τ_ref)
  5. Current modulation: I^(l,t) = W × S^(l-1,t) + b - g(τ_ref^(l,t-1))

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Timestep (T): Lower T reduces latency but may underutilize HDRP dynamics; higher T improves accuracy at cost of computation
  - Refractory range (τ_ref0, τ_refL): Wider range allows stronger suppression but risks over-inhibition
  - Learnable parameter A: Enables task-specific inhibition but requires monitoring to prevent negative values

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy drops below baseline LIF: Likely τ_ref bounds too restrictive; check if U'_max/U'_min computed correctly from weight norms
  - Energy consumption exceeds ANN: Firing rate not suppressed; verify refractory kernel gradient flow
  - Noise robustness degrades: Fixed decay factor may be inappropriate; ensure adaptive decay using k(U') is active
  - Training instability: Check surrogate gradient parameter γ

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison on CIFAR10 with T=4: Implement HDRP-LIF in ResNet-18, compare against vanilla LIF and fixed refractory period variants; target >96.56% accuracy
  2. Ablation of adaptive decay: Replace k(U') with fixed decay factors (0.1, 0.5, 0.9); verify performance degradation shown in ablation (96.34% max for fixed vs 96.70% adaptive)
  3. Noise robustness test: Add Gaussian noise (σ varying) to CIFAR10 inputs; confirm HDRP-SNN maintains >2.89% accuracy advantage over LIF-SNN at highest noise level

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the HDRP mechanism generalize to Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) without destabilizing temporal dynamics?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates performance exclusively on feed-forward architectures for static and event-based vision tasks, omitting recurrent layers where internal state dynamics are critical
- Why unresolved: The HDRP model adds a dynamic history variable (τ_ref) to the neuron state; it is unclear if this competes with or disrupts the recurrent synaptic plasticity required for sequential memory tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks of HDRP-RSNNs on temporal classification datasets (e.g., SHD or PSMNIST) comparing stability and accuracy against vanilla LIF-RSNNs

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the computational overhead of the refractory kernel negate energy savings when deployed on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware?
- Basis in paper: The energy analysis relies on theoretical MAC/AC counts and a 45nm process assumption, acknowledging that the HDRP-LIF model increases formulation complexity compared to vanilla LIF neurons
- Why unresolved: The threshold-dependent kernel involves a tanh function and division operations for normalization, which are expensive to implement in digital logic compared to the simple accumulation of standard SNNs
- What evidence would resolve it: On-chip power measurements (e.g., on Loihi or FPGA) comparing the actual latency and dynamic power consumption of HDRP-SNN vs. standard SNN implementations

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the membrane potential derivative normalization to violations of the assumed weight bounds during training?
- Basis in paper: The method relies on Min-Max normalization of the membrane potential derivative, which assumes weight matrices are strictly bounded by constants C_1 and C_2 enforced by L2 regularization
- Why unresolved: If regularization is insufficient or gradients explode, the derived bounds for U' may become inaccurate, potentially causing the normalization factor k(U') to fall outside the [0,1] range and destabilizing the refractory period adjustment
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the correlation between the regularization coefficient λ, the actual distribution of U' during training, and the final classification accuracy

## Limitations

- Several key hyperparameters and training details remain unspecified, including optimizer type, learning rate schedule, initialization values for parameter A, and regularization coefficient λ
- The "state-of-the-art" accuracy claims rely heavily on specific architectural choices (ResNet-18, direct training) that may not generalize across all SNN implementations
- Energy efficiency comparisons lack clarity on how spike counts translate to actual hardware energy consumption

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core HDRP mechanism is well-defined mathematically and the ablation study provides strong evidence that the combination of adaptive decay and historical refractory period is crucial for performance gains
- **Medium confidence:** The noise robustness claims are supported by experimental results, but the analysis focuses on additive Gaussian noise rather than other noise types
- **Low confidence:** The energy efficiency comparisons lack rigorous validation across different hardware platforms

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary the initial A parameter, refractory period bounds, and surrogate gradient parameters to determine their impact on both accuracy and energy efficiency, establishing a robust hyperparameter range

2. **Cross-architecture generalization:** Implement HDRP-SNN in different network architectures (VGG, MobileNet) and training paradigms (conversion from ANNs) to verify that performance gains are not architecture-specific

3. **Real-world noise validation:** Test HDRP-SNN under realistic noise conditions including sensor noise, quantization noise, and temporal jitter in the spike encoding process, rather than only synthetic Gaussian noise
