# Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Neural USD, an object-centric conditioning framework for precise control over object appearance, geometry, and pose in generative image models

## Executive Summary
Neural USD presents an object-centric framework that enables precise control over individual objects in generative image models. Inspired by the Universal Scene Descriptor standard, it represents scenes as structured assets with per-object attributes, encoding them into continuous vector representations compatible with diffusion models. The framework learns disentangled control signals through fine-tuning on paired video frames, allowing iterative editing of object properties while preserving other scene elements. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in object control and reconstruction accuracy compared to existing baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework encodes object-centric attributes (geometry, appearance, pose) into continuous vectors that can be decoded into visual features and processed by diffusion models. Neural USD represents scenes using structured assets inspired by the Universal Scene Descriptor standard, where each object has associated attributes. The model learns to disentangle these attributes through fine-tuning on paired video frames, enabling iterative editing workflows. By maintaining separate representations for different object properties, the framework allows users to modify specific aspects of objects while preserving other scene elements, supporting flexible editing across diverse datasets.

## Key Results
- Superior performance in object control compared to baselines like Neural Assets, Object 3DIT, and ControlNet
- Demonstrates enhanced reconstruction accuracy while enabling precise manipulation of object properties
- Supports flexible editing workflows across diverse datasets with iterative control over appearance, geometry, and pose

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its object-centric representation that encodes per-object attributes into continuous vectors. This structured approach allows the model to learn disentangled representations of appearance, geometry, and pose through paired video frame training. The continuous vector encoding enables smooth interpolation and precise control over individual object properties while maintaining compatibility with diffusion models. The Universal Scene Descriptor-inspired structure provides a standardized way to represent and manipulate scene elements, facilitating iterative editing workflows.

## Foundational Learning

**Universal Scene Descriptor (USD)**: A framework for describing, composing, and collaborating on 3D scenes. Why needed: Provides standardized structure for representing scene assets with per-object attributes. Quick check: Verify USD compatibility with existing 3D modeling tools.

**Object-centric representation**: Scene modeling approach that treats objects as independent entities with their own attributes. Why needed: Enables fine-grained control over individual objects while preserving scene context. Quick check: Test object independence by modifying one object without affecting others.

**Diffusion model conditioning**: Technique for controlling generative models through additional input signals. Why needed: Allows precise manipulation of generated content through learned attribute representations. Quick check: Verify conditioning vectors produce expected changes in generated outputs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Scene Assets -> Attribute Encoder -> Continuous Vector Representations -> Diffusion Model -> Generated Image

**Critical path**: The attribute encoder processes object-centric information (geometry, appearance, pose) into continuous vectors, which are then fed into the conditioned diffusion model for image generation. The paired video frame training enables learning of disentangled representations.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead for precise control - maintaining continuous vector representations for multiple objects requires additional memory and processing. The reliance on paired video data for training may limit scalability to real-world scenarios.

**Failure signatures**: Poor disentanglement of object attributes, leading to unintended changes in appearance when modifying geometry or vice versa. Incompatibility with scenes containing complex object interactions or occlusions.

**First experiments**:
1. Test attribute disentanglement by independently modifying appearance, geometry, and pose of single objects
2. Evaluate reconstruction accuracy on synthetic scenes with known ground truth attributes
3. Compare editing precision against baseline methods on standard benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions. However, based on the framework's design and limitations, potential open questions include:
- How can the framework be adapted to handle scenes with complex object interactions or occlusions?
- What are the scalability challenges when applying Neural USD to real-world, unstructured datasets?
- How can the computational overhead be reduced to enable real-time applications?

## Limitations

- Reliance on paired video data for fine-tuning may limit scalability to real-world scenarios where such data is scarce
- Computational overhead of maintaining continuous vector representations for multiple objects could challenge real-time applications
- Performance evaluation primarily on synthetic or curated datasets raises questions about robustness to diverse, unstructured real-world inputs
- Limited discussion of handling complex object interactions and occlusions in scenes

## Confidence

- High: Quantitative performance comparisons with baselines, structured representation using Universal Scene Descriptor standard
- Medium: Claims of precise control and reconstruction accuracy, flexibility across datasets
- Low: Generalizability to real-world, unstructured data and real-time applications

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on real-world datasets with minimal preprocessing to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability for scenes with a large number of objects or high-resolution images
3. Conduct user studies to quantify the precision and usability of object control in complex, dynamic scenes
