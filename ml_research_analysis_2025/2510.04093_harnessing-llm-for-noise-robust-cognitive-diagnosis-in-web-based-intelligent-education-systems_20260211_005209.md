# Harnessing LLM for Noise-Robust Cognitive Diagnosis in Web-Based Intelligent Education Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.04093
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04093
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DLLM achieves up to 82.06% accuracy and 79.66% F1-score on ASSIST0910 with superior noise robustness across three real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DLLM, a diffusion-based large language model framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis in web-based intelligent education systems. DLLM addresses data imbalance and noise issues by constructing independent subgraphs based on response correctness, applying relation augmentation, and integrating LLM-derived semantic representations. A two-stage denoising diffusion module is employed to eliminate erroneous and misleading information before alignment. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DLLM achieves superior predictive performance across varying noise levels, achieving up to 82.06% accuracy and 79.66% F1-score on the ASSIST0910 dataset.

## Method Summary
DLLM processes response logs through a multi-stage pipeline: first decomposing the student-exercise interaction graph into correct/incorrect subgraphs, then applying relation augmentation to mitigate data imbalance by adding edges between low-degree student nodes. LightGCN generates initial embeddings from these augmented graphs, which are aligned via contrastive learning. The framework generates semantic representations using an LLM (Qwen-7B) to create student profiles and exercise descriptions, encodes these with Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, and aligns them with structural embeddings. A two-stage denoising diffusion process removes random errors in the first stage and structured noise in the second stage, with the final representations fed into various CDM backbones (IRT, MIRT, NCDM, CDMFKC) for prediction.

## Key Results
- DLLM achieves up to 82.06% accuracy and 79.66% F1-score on ASSIST0910 dataset
- The framework demonstrates superior noise robustness across three real-world datasets
- Performance degrades at high noise levels (≥10% on Junyi1808), where relation augmentation can propagate errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph Decomposition and Relation Augmentation
The framework splits the student-exercise interaction graph into correct/incorrect subgraphs, then augments low-degree student nodes by adding edges to random peers. This mitigates data imbalance effects in GNN-based cognitive diagnosis by allowing underrepresented students to receive more graph signals during message passing. Core assumption: Students with similar response patterns share latent cognitive characteristics that can be meaningfully transferred through graph edges. Evidence: Paper demonstrates this approach mitigates imbalance, though ablation studies show RAA can be detrimental at high noise levels when erroneous information propagates through augmented edges.

### Mechanism 2: LLM-Based Semantic Enhancement with Contrastive Alignment
LLM-generated student profiles and exercise descriptions inject external knowledge that enriches representations, especially for students with sparse interaction histories. The framework uses InfoNCE loss to align structural graph embeddings with semantic LLM embeddings. Core assumption: LLM-encoded interdisciplinary knowledge accurately infers student mastery patterns and exercise semantics. Evidence: Framework shows improved performance with semantic enhancement, but Figure 1 demonstrates profile inversion at 15% noise where strengths become weaknesses.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Stage Denoising Diffusion
Sequential unconditional and conditional diffusion processes remove distinct noise types while preserving structural alignment between representations. Stage 1 removes random errors like guessing and slipping, while Stage 2 removes structured noise including semantic biases from LLM hallucinations. Core assumption: Noise decomposes into random errors (uniformly distributed) and systematic errors (correlated with specific patterns). Evidence: The two-stage design is innovative but lacks direct corpus validation for cognitive diagnosis specifically.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation applies diffusion models to latent representations for noise removal. Understanding forward diffusion, reverse denoising, and reparameterization is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why can a diffusion model learn to denoise without access to ground-truth clean data during training?

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks and Message Passing**
  - Why needed here: LightGCN generates node embeddings that serve as conditions for the diffusion module. The relation augmentation strategy depends on understanding how neighborhood aggregation works.
  - Quick check question: If a student node has only 2 neighbors with noisy response patterns, how does adding edges to random peers change their final embedding?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning and InfoNCE Loss**
  - Why needed here: DLLM uses InfoNCE twice—once to align original vs. augmented graph embeddings, and again to align structural vs. semantic embeddings.
  - Quick check question: What happens if the temperature τ is set too low or too high in InfoNCE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Response logs → Graph decomposition → LightGCN → [RAA + DDM_u + DDM_c] ← LLM embeddings → Final alignment → CDM

- **Critical path:**
  ```
  Response logs → Graph decomposition → LightGCN → [RAA + DDM_u + DDM_c] ← LLM embeddings → Final alignment → CDM
  ```
  Bottleneck: If the two-stage diffusion fails to remove noise, or if LLM embeddings are corrupted by hallucination, downstream CDM predictions inherit the error.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  1. **Unconditional vs. conditional balance (ρ):** Higher ρ strengthens unconditional denoising (better for high noise) but risks over-smoothing useful signal. Paper uses ρ ∈ [0.05, 0.2].
  2. **Augmentation aggressiveness:** Adding edges to bottom 50% helps imbalance but propagates noise. Alternative: percentile-based threshold or uncertainty-weighted edges.
  3. **LLM choice:** Qwen-7B for generation (capability) vs. Qwen3-0.6B for embedding (efficiency). Larger LLMs reduce hallucination but increase latency.
  4. **CDM backbone selection:** Model-agnostic by design, but neural-based CDMs (NCDM, CDMFKC) benefit more from rich embeddings than statistical models (IRT).

- **Failure signatures:**
  1. **High noise + sparse data:** On Junyi1808 with ≥10% noise, w/o RAA outperforms full DLLM—augmentation propagates errors.
  2. **LLM profile inversion:** At 15% noise, student profiles flip strengths to weaknesses (Figure 1), causing semantic alignment to pull embeddings toward incorrect knowledge.
  3. **Over-denoising:** When ρ ≥ 0.4, accuracy drops across datasets because unconditional DDM removes discriminative information.
  4. **Cold-start exclusion:** Students with <15 responses filtered out—framework does not handle extreme cold-start natively.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation reproduction on ASSIST0910:** Train DLLM-NCDM with w/o RAA, w/o DDM_u, w/o DDM_c variants. Evaluate at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% noise. Expect DDM_u more critical at high noise; DDM_c superior at low noise. Verifies mechanism contributions.
  2. **Hyperparameter ρ sweep across datasets:** Test ρ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4} on ASSIST0910, Junyi1808, Eedi50. Hypothesis: Eedi50 (largest, most interactions) needs higher ρ due to inherent real-world noise. Reveals dataset-specific tuning requirements.
  3. **Backbone compatibility test:** Integrate DLLM with IRT, MIRT, NCDM, CDMFKC. Compare against LightGCN, ORCDF, ISGCD, KCD baselines using ACC/AUC/F1/DOA metrics. Confirms model-agnostic claim and identifies which CDMs benefit most from semantic enhancement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the variability in hallucination rates and domain knowledge across different LLM architectures affect the reliability of the semantic augmentation alignment module?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper utilizes Qwen-7B as a representative LLM and notes that LLM reasoning is prone to "hallucination phenomena" and "semantic shifts" (Section 2), yet does not test the framework's sensitivity to the choice of backbone LLM.
- **Why unresolved:** The framework's robustness is demonstrated using a single LLM; it is unclear if smaller or differently fine-tuned models would introduce uncorrectable semantic noise that the diffusion module cannot remove.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments replacing Qwen-7B with other LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) and measuring the resulting performance variance and noise resilience.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the linear Gaussian noise schedule employed by the diffusion module optimal for capturing the discrete, non-Gaussian characteristics of educational noise (e.g., binary slips and guesses)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.3.1 states, "We adopt a linear noise schedule where the variance parameters $\beta_t$ increase linearly...," assuming a Gaussian process to model the corruption of node representations.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper treats noise removal as a Gaussian denoising task in the latent space, but the underlying "erroneous information" in response logs is often discrete or bursty, potentially mismatching the model's generative assumptions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study comparing the linear Gaussian schedule against non-Gaussian or learned noise schedules, specifically analyzing performance on data with artificially injected high rates of discrete guessing/slipping.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the DLLM framework maintain the low-latency requirements of real-time Web-based Intelligent Education Systems given the computational overhead of iterative diffusion sampling?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper targets WIES (Section 1), which often requires real-time feedback. The proposed method involves a two-stage diffusion process (Section 3.3) which typically requires multiple iterative neural network evaluations during the reverse sampling process.
- **Why unresolved:** The complexity analysis focuses on embedding dimension reduction, but the paper does not report the wall-clock time for inference or training relative to baselines, leaving the practical deployability in question.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Reporting the average inference latency per student update and comparing it against real-time constraints of typical WIES platforms.

## Limitations
- **Diffusion hyperparameters unspecified:** Key parameters like diffusion steps T and denoiser architecture are not provided, preventing exact reproduction
- **Two-stage diffusion lacks corpus validation:** The specific architecture for cognitive diagnosis lacks direct validation in the literature
- **LLM profile inversion at high noise:** Semantic alignment breaks down at ≥15% noise with profile inversion demonstrating fragility

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (Graph decomposition + augmentation):** **Medium** - novel combination but RAA can propagate noise at high levels
- **Mechanism 2 (LLM semantic enhancement):** **Low-Medium** - semantic alignment breaks down at ≥15% noise with profile inversion
- **Mechanism 3 (Two-stage diffusion):** **Low** - innovative but no direct corpus evidence for this specific architecture in CD

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce ablation study on ASSIST0910 showing RAA harm at ≥10% noise, quantifying noise propagation
2. Test ρ hyperparameter sweep across all three datasets to identify dataset-specific tuning needs
3. Validate model-agnostic claim by integrating DLLM with all four CDM backbones and comparing against baselines
