# SKGE-SWIN: End-To-End Autonomous Vehicle Waypoint Prediction and Navigation Using Skip Stage Swin Transformer

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.20762
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20762
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** SKGE-Swin-tiny achieves driving score of 37.10 on CARLA platform

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the SKGE-Swin architecture, which integrates the Swin Transformer with skip-stage connections to improve global context awareness in end-to-end autonomous vehicle waypoint prediction and navigation. The proposed model addresses the limitation of conventional CNN-based methods that struggle to capture global relationships between pixels due to their local receptive field. The SKGE-Swin model utilizes the Swin Transformer's hierarchical processing and self-attention mechanism, augmented with skip connections that preserve high-resolution spatial details across network stages. Experimental results on the CARLA platform demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin-tiny (stage 1→4) model achieves the highest driving score of 37.10, significantly outperforming baseline models like x13.

## Method Summary
The SKGE-Swin architecture combines the Swin Transformer's hierarchical processing and self-attention mechanism with skip connections that preserve high-resolution spatial details across network stages. The model addresses the global context limitations of CNN-based methods by leveraging the Swin Transformer's ability to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention, while the skip-stage connections ensure that spatial information is not lost during downsampling operations. The architecture processes input images through multiple transformer stages, with skip connections connecting earlier stages to later ones, allowing the model to maintain both local and global context information for more accurate waypoint prediction and navigation.

## Key Results
- SKGE-Swin-tiny (stage 1→4) achieves driving score of 37.10 on CARLA platform
- Outperforms baseline models like x13 with significant margin
- Demonstrates superior performance in complex scenarios including sharp turns and pedestrian detection
- Shows improved situational awareness at intersections in qualitative analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SKGE-Swin architecture works by combining the Swin Transformer's self-attention mechanism with skip-stage connections to address the fundamental limitation of CNNs in capturing global context. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to consider relationships between all pixels in the input image, regardless of their spatial distance, while the skip connections preserve high-resolution spatial details that would otherwise be lost during downsampling. This combination enables the model to maintain both local detail and global context, resulting in more accurate waypoint prediction and adaptive driving behavior. The hierarchical processing of the Swin Transformer allows for multi-scale feature extraction, while the skip connections ensure that fine-grained spatial information is available at all stages of the network.

## Foundational Learning
**Self-attention mechanism**: Why needed - to capture long-range dependencies between pixels that are spatially distant. Quick check - verify that attention scores are computed across all spatial positions within each window.
**Hierarchical processing**: Why needed - to extract multi-scale features that represent both fine details and global context. Quick check - confirm that feature maps are progressively downsampled while maintaining semantic information.
**Skip connections**: Why needed - to preserve high-resolution spatial details that would be lost during downsampling operations. Quick check - ensure that feature maps from earlier stages are properly concatenated or added to later stages.
**Window-based self-attention**: Why needed - to reduce computational complexity while maintaining the benefits of self-attention. Quick check - verify that attention is computed within local windows before shifting to adjacent windows.
**Residual connections**: Why needed - to facilitate gradient flow and prevent vanishing gradients in deep networks. Quick check - confirm that skip connections are implemented with proper normalization and activation functions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input image → Swin Transformer encoder (stages 1-4) → Skip-stage connections → MLP head → Waypoint prediction

**Critical path:** Input image → Stage 1 feature extraction → Skip connection to Stage 4 → Stage 4 processing → MLP head → Output waypoints

**Design tradeoffs:** The use of skip-stage connections increases model complexity and parameter count but significantly improves performance in complex driving scenarios. The window-based self-attention reduces computational complexity compared to full self-attention while maintaining global context awareness.

**Failure signatures:** The model may struggle with extremely rare or novel driving scenarios not well-represented in training data. Poor performance on sharp turns or pedestrian detection could indicate insufficient skip connections or inadequate training data for these specific scenarios.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Test the model on simple straight-line driving scenarios to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate performance on sharp turn scenarios to assess the effectiveness of skip connections
3. Test pedestrian detection capabilities to verify situational awareness improvements
