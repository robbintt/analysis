# Exploring Pose-Based Anomaly Detection for Retail Security: A Real-World Shoplifting Dataset and Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.06591
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06591
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PoseLift dataset with state-of-the-art pose-based anomaly detection models achieving ~67% AUC-ROC for shoplifting detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PoseLift, a privacy-preserving dataset designed for shoplifting detection, addressing challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and model biases. The dataset captures real-world shoplifting and normal shopping behaviors from a retail store, using anonymized human pose data to preserve privacy while maintaining utility. The authors frame shoplifting detection as an anomaly detection problem and benchmark state-of-the-art pose-based anomaly detection models on PoseLift. Results show that pose-based approaches achieve high detection accuracy, with STG-NF achieving an AUC-ROC of 67.46%, AUC-PR of 84.06%, and an EER of 0.39. The study highlights the potential of pose-based methods to address privacy and bias concerns while improving detection performance. PoseLift is publicly available to support future research in this domain.

## Method Summary
The paper frames shoplifting detection as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem using anonymized human pose data. The method converts raw CCTV video into skeletal pose sequences using YOLOv8 for detection, ByteTrack for temporal ID association, and HRNet for 17 COCO-format keypoints. The dataset contains 155 videos from 6 cameras (1920x1080 @ 15 FPS), with 53,353 training frames (all normal shopping) and 3,721 test frames (2,221 normal, 1,500 anomalous). Models like STG-NF (Normalizing Flows) learn a probability distribution of normal skeletal movement and flag deviations as anomalies. Preprocessing includes linear interpolation for missing poses and 8-frame smoothing.

## Key Results
- STG-NF achieves AUC-ROC of 67.46%, AUC-PR of 84.06%, and EER of 0.39 on PoseLift test set
- Pose-based anomaly detection outperforms appearance-based methods in privacy preservation
- Dataset publicly available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/PoseLift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Converting raw video into skeletal pose sequences preserves behavioral signals necessary for detecting theft while stripping personally identifiable information (PII). The system abstracts human activity into 17 COCO-format keypoints using HRNet. By training anomaly detectors on these coordinates rather than pixels, the model focuses on body kinematics rather than appearance-based features. This works because shoplifting actions exhibit distinct spatial-temporal kinematic patterns that deviate from normal shopping poses. The mechanism fails when occlusion prevents the pose estimator from generating keypoints.

### Mechanism 2
Framing shoplifting as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem allows the system to learn "normality" without requiring scarce theft labels. The architecture is trained exclusively on normal shopping frames and learns a probability distribution of normal skeletal movement. During inference, frames with low likelihood are flagged as anomalies. This works because normal shopping behaviors cluster tightly in a learned feature space while shoplifting behaviors lie outside this distribution. The mechanism fails when shoplifting actions are kinematically similar to normal actions.

### Mechanism 3
Temporal smoothing and interpolation of pose data stabilize the input required by sequential anomaly models. Raw pose extraction is often jittery or contains gaps due to occlusion. The dataset creation applies linear interpolation to fill missing frames and an 8-frame smoothing window. This works because human movement is continuous and short-term occlusions are noise rather than signal. The mechanism fails when interpolation spans too many frames, creating artificial motion paths.

## Foundational Learning

- **One-Class Classification / Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**
  - Why needed: The paper rejects supervised classification in favor of learning a distribution of "normal" data without theft labels
  - Quick check: If the model is never shown a shoplifter during training, how does it know what theft looks like? (Answer: It recognizes that theft looks different from the normal distribution it learned)

- **Pose Estimation (Skeleton Extraction)**
  - Why needed: This is the core privacy mechanism. Understanding how pixels become coordinates is vital to understanding the data format
  - Quick check: Why does using 17 coordinate pairs (skeleton) protect privacy better than using a bounding box crop of the person?

- **AUC-PR vs. AUC-ROC in Imbalanced Datasets**
  - Why needed: Shoplifting is rare. The paper emphasizes AUC-PR alongside AUC-ROC because ROC curves can be misleadingly optimistic when the negative class dominates
  - Quick check: In a dataset with 53,000 normal frames and 1,500 anomalous frames, why might a high "Accuracy" score be meaningless?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw CCTV (1920x1080 @ 15fps) -> YOLOv8 (Bounding Box) -> ByteTrack (Temporal ID) -> HRNet (17 Keypoints) -> Linear Interpolation (gaps) -> 8-frame Smoothing (noise) -> STG-NF (Normalizing Flows) or GEPC (Graph Clustering) -> Frame-level Anomaly Score

- **Critical path:** The Pose Extraction quality. If HRNet fails to detect keypoints due to high-angle views or occlusion, the downstream Anomaly Engine receives garbage input.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Trading detailed visual context (which helps distinguish a phone from a stolen item) for privacy and reduced bias; smoothing reduces jitter but introduces lag, potentially delaying detection of the start of a shoplifting event.

- **Failure signatures:** False Positives on "Reaching" where normal actions like putting a phone in a pocket trigger low "normality" scores; Occlusion Drift where models struggle when a subject walks behind shelves.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run STG-NF on PoseLift test set to verify ~67% AUC-ROC benchmark; 2) Add synthetic jitter to keypoints to test if 8-frame smoothing is sufficient; 3) Vary anomaly threshold to plot EER curve specifically for "loitering" vs. "active theft."

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can pose-based anomaly detection models be refined to distinguish between benign "anomalous" behaviors, such as cell phone usage, and actual shoplifting to reduce false positives? Current unsupervised models flag deviations from the norm generally, struggling to disentangle rare-but-innocent actions from malicious ones without semantic context. Evidence would be a modified architecture maintaining high theft detection rates while filtering out common false-positive triggers like phone use.

### Open Question 2
What architectural advancements are required to develop specialized shoplifting detection models that outperform general pose-based anomaly detectors? The benchmarked models are general-purpose pose anomaly detectors, not tailored to the specific temporal dynamics of retail theft. Evidence would be a novel model designed specifically for retail behavior achieving significantly higher AUC-ROC or AUC-PR than the current benchmark.

### Open Question 3
To what extent can models trained on the PoseLift dataset generalize to retail environments with significantly different physical layouts or camera perspectives? The dataset is collected from a single retail store with a fixed set of six cameras, potentially limiting the diversity of spatial contexts and shopping behaviors. Evidence would be cross-dataset evaluation results showing maintained performance when tested on data from a different retail location.

## Limitations
- Privacy-preserving claim lacks formal privacy audit or differential privacy guarantees
- Benchmark results based on single dataset; cross-dataset generalization untested
- Effectiveness of 8-frame smoothing in preserving temporal accuracy versus introducing detection delay remains unquantified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core methodology of using pose-based anomaly detection for shoplifting is technically sound and well-supported by literature; benchmark results on PoseLift are reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that pose-based methods significantly reduce bias compared to appearance-based models is plausible but not empirically validated within the paper
- **Low Confidence:** Assertion that the dataset is "comprehensive" is questionable given limited number of cameras and scenarios captured

## Next Checks
1. Conduct formal privacy assessment to verify pose keypoints cannot be used to re-identify individuals
2. Test benchmarked models on a different retail anomaly detection dataset to assess generalization
3. Measure impact of 8-frame smoothing window on detection latency for real-time applications
