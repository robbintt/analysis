# Exploring Disparity-Accuracy Trade-offs in Face Recognition Systems: The Role of Datasets, Architectures, and Loss Functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.14138
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14138
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: This study explores the impact of model architecture, loss functions, and datasets on accuracy and disparity in face recognition systems (FRSs) for gender prediction

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive study examines how different components of face recognition systems - including model architectures, loss functions, and training datasets - affect both accuracy and disparity in gender prediction tasks. The research evaluates 266 different configurations across ten deep learning models, three modified FRS architectures, four loss functions, and seven diverse datasets. The findings reveal that dataset properties have the most significant impact on both accuracy and disparity outcomes, while model architecture and loss function choices provide additional avenues for optimization.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic evaluation framework examining ten deep learning models with architectural modifications, four different loss functions, and seven diverse datasets for gender prediction tasks. The research analyzes 266 distinct configurations to understand how these components interact to affect both accuracy and disparity metrics. The methodology includes comprehensive benchmarking across multiple datasets to identify patterns in how different architectural choices and training data influence model performance and bias characteristics.

## Key Results
- Datasets exhibit inherent properties that significantly influence model performance, with some showing consistent high accuracy and low disparity (CFD) while others show low disparity at accuracy costs (FARFace)
- Model size reduction correlates with disparity reduction, suggesting architectural complexity impacts fairness metrics
- Dataset choice determines perceived bias direction, with some datasets showing disparity in opposite directions
- Female embeddings demonstrate greater shift magnitude compared to male embeddings, indicating dataset diversity affects generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of architectural and dataset choices in mitigating disparity stems from how different loss functions optimize for both accuracy and fairness objectives. When models are trained on diverse datasets with appropriate architectural modifications, they learn more robust feature representations that generalize better across demographic groups. The interaction between loss function design, architectural complexity, and dataset characteristics creates a multidimensional optimization space where trade-offs between accuracy and fairness can be systematically explored and managed.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dataset bias properties**: Understanding inherent dataset biases is crucial because they fundamentally shape model behavior and perceived fairness metrics. Quick check: Analyze dataset composition statistics and identify potential sampling biases.
- **Architectural impact on fairness**: Model architecture choices directly influence the model's ability to learn fair representations. Quick check: Compare feature space distributions across demographic groups for different architectures.
- **Loss function design**: Different loss functions optimize for varying trade-offs between accuracy and fairness objectives. Quick check: Examine gradient distributions during training to understand optimization behavior.
- **Embedding space analysis**: The geometry of learned embeddings reveals how models differentiate between demographic groups. Quick check: Visualize t-SNE projections of embeddings across different model configurations.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Dataset -> Preprocessing -> Model Architecture -> Loss Function -> Embeddings -> Classification -> Metrics Evaluation
**Critical path**: Dataset quality and diversity -> Model architecture choice -> Loss function selection -> Embedding space quality -> Final classification performance and disparity metrics
**Design tradeoffs**: Larger models generally reduce disparity but increase computational cost; simpler architectures may be more efficient but potentially less fair; loss function choice balances accuracy versus fairness optimization
**Failure signatures**: High disparity indicates dataset bias or inadequate architectural modifications; accuracy drops suggest poor generalization or inappropriate loss function selection; inconsistent performance across datasets points to overfitting to specific dataset characteristics
**3 first experiments**: 1) Train baseline model on multiple datasets to establish performance baselines, 2) Apply architectural modifications systematically to identify impact on disparity metrics, 3) Compare different loss functions while holding other variables constant to isolate their effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on gender prediction, limiting generalizability to other demographic attributes
- Analysis is constrained to seven specific datasets, which may not represent full real-world diversity
- The evaluation framework examines only binary gender classification, potentially oversimplifying complex gender identities
- Model modifications are limited to architectural changes without exploring other bias mitigation strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence: The impact of datasets on accuracy and disparity outcomes
- High confidence: The relationship between model size and disparity reduction
- Medium confidence: The directional effects of different loss functions on disparity
- Medium confidence: The observation that female embeddings shift more than male embeddings
- Low confidence: Generalizability of findings to other demographic attributes or real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the observed patterns across additional demographic attributes (age, race/ethnicity) to verify if similar dataset- and architecture-dependent effects persist
2. Conduct cross-dataset validation by training on one dataset and testing on others to measure true generalization capabilities and identify dataset-specific biases
3. Implement and evaluate additional bias mitigation techniques beyond architectural modifications, such as adversarial debiasing or reweighting strategies, to compare effectiveness against current approaches
