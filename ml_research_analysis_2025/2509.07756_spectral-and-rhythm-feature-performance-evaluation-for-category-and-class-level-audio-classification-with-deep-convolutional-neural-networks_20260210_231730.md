# Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07756
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07756
- Reference count: 40
- Spectral features (mel-scaled spectrogram, MFCC) achieved 76.5% accuracy and 77.7% precision, outperforming rhythm features by ~35%

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates six spectral and rhythm features for environmental sound classification using a deep CNN on the ESC-50 dataset. The research compares mel-scaled spectrogram, MFCC, cyclic tempogram, STFT chromagram, CQT chromagram, and CENS chromagram across category and class levels. Results demonstrate that spectral features significantly outperform rhythm-based features, with mel-scaled spectrogram achieving 76.5% accuracy and 77.7% precision compared to 36.2%-45.6% accuracy for rhythm features. The study provides clear evidence that spectral representations are more effective than rhythm features for general environmental sound classification tasks.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six audio features using a deep convolutional neural network architecture on the ESC-50 dataset. Features were extracted from 5-second audio clips and fed into the CNN for classification. The model was trained and evaluated across five categories (animals, natural soundscapes, human sounds, interior/domestic sounds, and exterior/urban noises) and individual classes. Performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The CNN architecture remained constant across all feature types to isolate feature performance differences.

## Key Results
- Mel-scaled spectrogram achieved 76.5% accuracy, 77.7% precision, 75.5% recall, and 75.4% F1 score across all categories
- MFCC achieved 76.3% accuracy, 74.4% precision, 74.3% recall, and 74.2% F1 score, performing nearly identically to mel-scaled spectrogram
- Rhythm-based features (cyclic tempogram and chromagrams) ranged from 36.2% to 45.6% accuracy, approximately 35% lower than spectral features
- Per-class level analysis showed mel-scaled spectrogram achieving 69.3% precision versus 21.3% for cyclic tempogram and 18.4% for chromagrams

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of spectral features stems from their ability to capture the rich frequency content and harmonic structure present in environmental sounds. Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs preserve both temporal and spectral information crucial for distinguishing between different sound sources. The mel scale's logarithmic frequency representation aligns better with human auditory perception, making it particularly effective for environmental sound classification. In contrast, rhythm-based features like cyclic tempograms and chromagrams focus primarily on temporal patterns and harmonic relationships, which are less discriminative for the diverse sound sources in environmental audio.

## Foundational Learning
**Mel-scaled spectrogram** - Represents audio in time-frequency domain with perceptual frequency scaling
Why needed: Captures both temporal evolution and spectral content in a human-auditory-aligned representation
Quick check: Verify mel filter bank parameters match target sampling rate and frequency range

**MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** - Compressed spectral representation using discrete cosine transform
Why needed: Provides compact representation emphasizing perceptually important spectral features
Quick check: Confirm number of coefficients and whether delta/delta-delta features are included

**Cyclic tempogram** - Rhythm-based feature showing cyclic patterns over time
Why needed: Captures periodic temporal structures useful for rhythmic sounds
Quick check: Validate tempo resolution and frequency range settings for target sound types

**Chromagram** - Pitch-class profile representation showing harmonic content
Why needed: Useful for music and harmonic sound analysis but limited for general environmental sounds
Quick check: Verify whether STFT, CQT, or CENS variant best suits the audio characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw audio -> Feature extraction -> CNN -> Classification -> Performance metrics

**Critical Path:**
Feature extraction quality directly impacts CNN input quality, which determines classification performance. The CNN acts as a feature learning and decision-making module.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Fixed CNN architecture vs. feature-specific optimization: Trade simplicity for potential performance gains
- Comprehensive feature comparison vs. computational efficiency: Trade thorough evaluation for faster experimentation
- Single dataset vs. generalization: Trade controlled evaluation for broader applicability

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor feature extraction (incorrect parameters, noise) manifests as consistently low accuracy across all features
- CNN overfitting shows high training accuracy but low validation accuracy regardless of feature type
- Class imbalance issues appear as poor performance on minority classes in per-class analysis

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare feature extraction quality using visualization tools to ensure proper time-frequency representation
2. Evaluate feature dimensionality impact by testing reduced-resolution versions of top-performing features
3. Test feature combinations (e.g., mel-spectrogram + MFCC) to determine if complementary information improves performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single dataset evaluation (ESC-50) limits generalizability to other environmental sound classification tasks
- Fixed CNN architecture without exploration of feature-specific architectural optimizations
- Comparison limited to six specific features without testing complementary representations like delta features
- No analysis of computational efficiency or real-time applicability differences between feature extraction methods

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Superiority of mel-scaled spectrogram and MFCC over rhythm features on ESC-50 dataset
**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of findings to other environmental sound datasets and classification tasks
**Medium confidence**: Magnitude of performance differences between feature types across all evaluation metrics

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study using multiple environmental sound datasets (UrbanSound8K, FSD50K) to assess generalizability
2. Compare feature performance using different CNN architectures and training protocols to isolate feature effects from model effects
3. Conduct ablation studies adding delta features or other complementary representations to top-performing features to determine potential performance gains
