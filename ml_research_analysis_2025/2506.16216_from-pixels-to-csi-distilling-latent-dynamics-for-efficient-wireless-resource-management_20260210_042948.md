# From Pixels to II: Distilling Latent Dynamics For Efficient Wireless Resource Management

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.16216
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16216
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: Achieves 50% transmit power reduction while maintaining control performance through joint modeling of control and wireless dynamics in latent space

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel machine learning framework that jointly models control system dynamics and wireless channel conditions in latent space for efficient resource management in remote control applications. The method uses two coupled Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) - one for control dynamics from image observations and another for wireless channel state information (CSI) through cross-modal conditioning. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm derives control policies from the latent control dynamics, while a power predictor estimates scheduling intervals based on latent CSI representations. The approach demonstrates significant power savings of over 50% while maintaining comparable control performance to baseline methods that don't account for wireless optimization.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs a dual-JEPA architecture where a control JEPA models high-dimensional image observations into latent control dynamics, and a wireless JEPA captures CSI dynamics through cross-modal conditioning from the control JEPA's predictions. The controller uses these latent models to imagine device trajectories and optimize scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm extracts control policies from the latent control dynamics, while a power predictor uses latent CSI representations to estimate optimal scheduling intervals. This joint modeling approach enables the system to anticipate both control requirements and wireless conditions, allowing for intelligent power allocation and transmission scheduling.

## Key Results
- Achieves 50% reduction in transmit power while maintaining normalized returns of 0.9-0.98
- Communicates less than 30% of data compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates 3 dB power savings (50% less) compared to baseline with no prediction
- Maintains control performance comparable to baseline methods that don't account for wireless optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a unified latent space representation that captures both control system dynamics and wireless channel conditions. By using JEPAs for both modalities and coupling them through cross-modal conditioning, the system can anticipate future states in both domains simultaneously. The control JEPA extracts relevant features from high-dimensional image observations to model the control system's behavior, while the wireless JEPA learns to predict channel conditions based on the control dynamics. This joint modeling allows the reinforcement learning controller to make informed decisions about when to transmit data based on both the control requirements and the expected wireless conditions, leading to optimized power usage and scheduling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs)**: Why needed - to learn compact latent representations from high-dimensional observations that capture essential dynamics. Quick check - verify the JEPA can reconstruct key features from compressed latent representations.
- **Cross-modal conditioning**: Why needed - to enable information flow between control and wireless models for coordinated predictions. Quick check - ensure latent representations from one JEPA improve predictions in the other JEPA.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - to derive optimal control policies from learned latent dynamics. Quick check - verify the RL agent can achieve stable performance across different initial conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image Observations -> Control JEPA -> Latent Control Dynamics -> RL Controller; CSI Observations -> Wireless JEPA (conditioned on Control JEPA) -> Latent CSI -> Power Predictor

**Critical Path**: Image observations → Control JEPA → RL Controller → Action Selection; CSI observations → Wireless JEPA → Power Predictor → Transmission Decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: The coupled JEPA architecture trades computational complexity for improved coordination between control and wireless domains. While more complex than separate modeling approaches, the joint latent space enables better anticipation of system needs and channel conditions.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when either JEPA fails to accurately model its respective dynamics, or when the cross-modal conditioning becomes misaligned. Common failure modes include poor reconstruction quality in latent space and suboptimal policy decisions from the RL controller.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate individual JEPA performance on isolated control and wireless datasets before coupling
2. Test cross-modal conditioning effectiveness by comparing coupled vs uncoupled performance
3. Evaluate RL policy performance with ground truth vs predicted latent dynamics

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on real-world experimental data with actual control systems and wireless channels to verify performance claims
2. Benchmark computational requirements and latency of the complete system, including both JEPAs and the RL policy, to assess real-time feasibility
3. Test the method's robustness to environmental changes, including different propagation conditions and control system dynamics beyond the synthetic environment
