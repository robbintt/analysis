# Towards explainable decision support using hybrid neural models for logistic terminal automation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07577
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Proposes an Interpretable Neural System Dynamics (INSD) pipeline integrating concept-based interpretability, causal machine learning, and mechanistic equation learning for transparent decision support in logistics

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of making deep learning models in intermodal logistics decision support systems interpretable and causally reliable. The authors propose an Interpretable Neural System Dynamics (INSD) pipeline that integrates concept-based interpretability, causal machine learning, and mechanistic equation learning into a unified framework. This approach extracts semantically meaningful high-level variables from raw data, discovers causal dependencies among them, and learns interpretable structural dynamic equations, enabling both accurate predictions and human-understandable reasoning.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a three-stage INSD pipeline: (1) Concept Learning using Concept-Based Interpretability to extract high-level variables (e.g., yard congestion, crane idleness) from raw sensor data, (2) Causal Learning using Causal Discovery/CML to produce causal graphs encoding cause-effect dependencies, and (3) Equation Learning using neuro-symbolic methods to learn interpretable structural dynamic equations. The framework aims to bridge the gap between predictive performance and transparency in logistics decision support systems.

## Key Results
- Proposes INSD pipeline integrating concept-based interpretability, causal machine learning, and mechanistic equation learning
- Addresses semantic opacity by mapping raw data to human-understandable concepts
- Enables causal reasoning through structural causal model discovery
- Learns interpretable dynamic equations while retaining predictive accuracy
- Supports auditability and regulatory compliance in logistics decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Concept-Based Interpretability
- **Claim:** Raw operational data can be transformed into semantically meaningful "concepts" (e.g., "yard congestion") to bridge the gap between sensor readings and human mental models.
- **Mechanism:** Concept-Based Interpretability (CBI) maps high-dimensional latent representations to explicit, human-understandable variables aligned with domain expertise.
- **Core assumption:** Domain-relevant operational states can be linearly or geometrically separated within the neural network's latent space and mapped to specific activation vectors.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions synergizing DL with Concept-Based Interpretability; section 3 describes concept learning for high-level variables.
- **Break condition:** If raw data lacks statistical structure to form distinct clusters corresponding to expert-defined concepts, semantic alignment fails.

### Mechanism 2: Causal Discovery and Machine Learning
- **Claim:** The system identifies cause-and-effect dependencies among learned concepts rather than relying on statistical correlations.
- **Mechanism:** Causal Discovery and CML analyze temporal evolution of concepts to infer Structural Causal Model (SCM) or Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- **Core assumption:** Underlying system dynamics are governed by sparse, stable causal mechanisms discoverable from observational or limited interventional data.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract discusses discovering causal dependencies; section 3 describes causal learning for uncovering dependencies.
- **Break condition:** If system contains cyclic feedback loops or unobserved confounders, resulting causal graph becomes invalid for counterfactual analysis.

### Mechanism 3: Mechanistic Equation Learning
- **Claim:** The framework expresses system behavior through transparent, mathematical equations derived from data.
- **Mechanism:** Mechanistic Equation Learning fits differential or difference equations to causal variables, simulating System Dynamics behavior while learning from data.
- **Core assumption:** True system dynamics can be approximated by reasonably sparse set of symbolic equations without sacrificing predictive accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions learning interpretable structural dynamic equations; section 3 describes equation learning from causal graphs.
- **Break condition:** If logistics environment is highly stochastic or discontinuous, rigid equation fitting may underperform compared to deep learning models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: System Dynamics (SD)**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper explicitly frames problem as extending traditional SD with Deep Learning; understanding SD is crucial for evaluating interpretability claims.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a stock variable (e.g., inventory level) and a flow variable (e.g., arrival rate) in a logistics terminal?

- **Concept: Semantic vs. Mechanistic Opacity**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper critiques existing XAI for failing to address these distinct types of opacity; understanding difference is crucial for implementing INSD pipeline.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model predicts "delay" but cannot explain why in human terms (Semantic), is that distinct from not knowing how neural weights combined to produce output (Mechanistic)?

- **Concept: Causal Reliability (Correlation vs. Causation)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core motivation is "Causal Reliability"; understanding why correlation fails for decision support compared to causal models is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does observing that "high truck traffic correlates with delays" not prove that "restricting trucks" will reduce delays?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Layer (IIoT/Raw sensory data) -> Concept Learner (Encoder mapping raw data -> Latent Concepts) -> Causal Engine (Discovery algorithm -> Causal Graph) -> Equation Learner (Sparse regression/Symbolic regressor -> Dynamic Equations) -> Digital Twin (Runtime interface for operators)

- **Critical path:** Concept Learning -> Causal Discovery. If concept learner produces noisy or semantically misaligned variables, subsequent causal discovery will be garbage ("Garbage In, Garbage Out"), rendering final equations meaningless.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rigidity vs. Accuracy: Enforcing strict symbolic equations improves auditability but may lose fidelity compared to pure black-box models
  - Automation vs. Oversight: Fully automated causal discovery is risky; architecture likely requires Human-in-the-loop to validate causal graph before equation fitting

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Semantic Drift: Concepts learned by neural network shift meaning over time, causing equation learner to fail
  - Cyclic Confusion: Causal discovery outputs cyclic graph where acyclic equations are required
  - Interventional Mismatch: Model predicts outcomes correctly for historical data but fails on "what-if" scenarios

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Concept Sanity Check: Train Concept Learner on synthetic logistics dataset with known ground-truth concepts; verify learned latent vectors align with known variables via linear probes
  2. Causal Graph Validation: Apply Causal Learning to small observable subsystem (e.g., gate-in/gate-out process); compare generated causal graph against expert intuition
  3. Equation Sparsity Test: Run Equation Learner on discovered graph; measure trade-off between equation complexity and prediction error to find viable operating point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can concept-based interpretability methods be extended to dynamic, streaming sensor data to maintain semantic fidelity despite operational variability?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4 states extending these methods to "dynamic, streaming sensor data (RFID logs, camera feeds, IoT telemetry) demands novel architectures," and learned concepts must "remain robust under operational variability... while preserving alignment with operator mental models."
- **Why unresolved:** Current concept-based techniques often focus on static domains, failing to handle time-series invariance and contextual shifts inherent in terminal logistics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A novel architecture capable of extracting robust concepts from streaming data that align with operator mental models even during equipment maintenance or traffic fluctuations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can causal discovery algorithms be adapted to handle partial observability, cyclic feedback loops, and online updating in intermodal terminals?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4 notes that "Adapting causal discovery to this domain thus entails (i) robust handling of sensor noise and data gaps, (ii) support for cyclic feedback between subsystems, and (iii) online updating mechanisms that can incorporate new evidence without retraining from scratch."
- **Why unresolved:** Existing methods like SPACY assume dense observability and stationary processes, whereas terminals feature partial data, ad-hoc interventions, and non-stationary streaming constraints.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A causal discovery method that accurately infers latent time-series causal graphs in presence of missing data and cyclic subsystem interactions.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can mechanistic equation-learning methods be modified to accurately model the discontinuous and multimodal dynamics of logistics systems?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4 argues that "applying these methods to the inherently discontinuous and multimodal dynamics of logistics terminals remains an open frontier," requiring "modular equation-learning architectures that can isolate subsystem dynamics."
- **Why unresolved:** Techniques like SINDy are typically designed for continuous physical systems, struggling with discrete, event-driven nature of logistics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modular equation learner that successfully recovers interpretable structural equations for specific subsystems without losing end-to-end predictive fidelity.

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation with quantitative results on prediction accuracy or interpretability gains
- No discussion of computational complexity or scalability for large-scale logistics terminals
- Absence of user studies confirming operator comprehension of learned concepts and equations
- Integration challenges of three complex methods into single pipeline may face unforeseen technical difficulties

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence** in overall conceptual validity of three-stage pipeline (strong theoretical foundations but no empirical proof)
- **Low confidence** in practical implementation details (specific architectures, training procedures, validation metrics not specified)
- **Medium confidence** in problem framing (need for interpretable, causally-grounded decision support in logistics aligns with established XAI and SD literature)

## Next Checks
1. Implement full INSD pipeline on controlled synthetic logistics simulation; measure concept alignment scores, causal discovery accuracy, and equation prediction error compared to baseline black-box models
2. Conduct user study with logistics domain experts to evaluate semantic alignment between learned concepts and mental models; assess ability to understand and trust generated causal graphs and equations
3. Test framework's counterfactual reasoning capability by systematically perturbing known causal variables in simulation; measure whether model's predictions align with expected system responses
