## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting future player positions in team-based multiplayer games, where complex environments and interactions between multiple agents require effective use of heterogeneous input data. The proposed method introduces a multimodal architecture that combines a U-Net-based image prediction approach with a multimodal feature encoder. This encoder processes global context, per-vehicle information, and dynamic game data, while a multi-head attention mechanism enables communication between agents. The model predicts endpoint location probability heatmaps, conditioned on a variable prediction horizon. Evaluation on World of Tanks battles shows the approach outperforms baseline U-Net, with relative final displacement error improvements from 1.66 to 1.78 when all components are included. The technique provides a foundation for downstream tasks like bot behavior creation and player anomaly detection.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a multimodal architecture for endpoint position prediction in team-based multiplayer games. The core approach combines U-Net-based image prediction with a multimodal feature encoder that processes global
