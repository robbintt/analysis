# RAVEN: An Agentic Framework for Multimodal Entity Discovery from Large-Scale Video Collections

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.06272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06272
- Authors: Kevin Dela Rosa
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: RAVEN significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in extracting structured, fine-grained entities with contextual attributes from large-scale video collections.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RAVEN, an agentic AI framework for multimodal entity discovery and retrieval from large-scale video collections. RAVEN addresses the challenge of extracting structured information from videos by integrating visual, audio, and textual modalities. The framework operates in two main stages: category understanding and schema generation, followed by rich domain-specific entity extraction. RAVEN uses a vision-language model (VLM) for video-based tasks and a large language model (LLM) for text processing, making it model-agnostic and adaptable to different application requirements.

## Method Summary
RAVEN employs a two-stage agentic pipeline for entity discovery from videos. In Stage 1, video clips are processed by a VLM to infer categories and extract generic entities. An LLM then normalizes and deduplicates these categories into a canonical list and generates domain-specific schemas containing entities, attributes, and example values. In Stage 2, videos are categorized, schemas are retrieved via semantic similarity, and a schema-guided VLM prompt extracts structured entities. The framework synthesizes information across visual, audio, and textual modalities to capture contextual attributes that unimodal baselines miss.

## Key Results
- RAVEN achieves significantly higher recall rates for Person, Location, and Object entities compared to baselines (NER on speech, OCR on scene text, keyword extraction from visual captions, YOLO object detection).
- The framework demonstrates high effectiveness in inferring canonical categories and generating domain-specific schemas from 1.5 million video clips.
- A case study on a historical documentary shows RAVEN's capability to capture detailed relationships and attributes, providing more comprehensive understanding of video content compared to isolated label extraction by baseline methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Agentic Pipeline with Schema Generation
Separating category discovery from entity extraction enables domain-adaptive, consistent structured extraction across heterogeneous video collections. VLM first processes videos to infer raw categories → LLM normalizes and dedupes category names into canonical list → LLM generates domain-specific schemas (entities + attributes + example values) per category → schemas indexed for retrieval. This allows the system to adapt extraction criteria to inferred domain context rather than using fixed schemas.

### Mechanism 2: Schema-Guided In-Context Learning for Extraction
Dynamically retrieved schemas with concrete example values improve VLM extraction consistency and attribute richness compared to open-ended prompting. After category assignment, system retrieves matching schema via semantic similarity → schema (entity types, attributes, example values) injected into VLM prompt → VLM performs in-context learning to extract entities aligned with schema structure rather than free-form labels.

### Mechanism 3: Multimodal Signal Synthesis
Joint processing of visual, audio, and textual modalities captures entities and attributes that unimodal baselines miss. VLM ingests video frames AND audio track simultaneously → synthesizes cross-modal signals (e.g., speech content + visual context + on-screen text) → produces unified structured output. This captures contextual attributes (mood, setting, relationships) invisible to isolated OCR/NER/object detection.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Video**: Core engine for both category inference and entity extraction; must handle multi-frame video + audio input with structured JSON output capability. Quick check: Can your chosen VLM accept video + audio inputs and return structured JSON? Have you tested its context length limits for your longest clips?

- **In-Context Learning with Structured Prompts**: RAVEN relies on schema + examples injected into prompts to guide extraction without fine-tuning. Understanding prompt engineering for structured outputs is essential. Quick check: Can you construct a prompt that includes entity definitions, attribute descriptions, and example values that consistently produces valid JSON?

- **Semantic Retrieval/Similarity**: Matching unnormalized VLM-assigned categories to canonical schemas requires semantic similarity (not exact string match). Quick check: What embedding model and similarity threshold will you use to match raw categories to canonical schema keys?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video clips → VLM (categorization prompt) → raw categories → LLM (normalization + schema generation) → canonical categories + domain schemas (indexed by category name) → Video clips → VLM (category assignment) → semantic retrieval of matching schema → VLM (schema-guided extraction prompt) → structured entities → persistence/indexing

- **Critical path**: Category inference quality — errors here cascade to wrong schema retrieval; Schema generation relevance — poorly matched entity types reduce extraction utility; Schema-guided prompt construction — example values must align with target content

- **Design tradeoffs**: Two-pass VLM processing (categorization + extraction) increases compute cost but enables domain adaptation; Model-agnostic design offers flexibility but requires validating that substitute models handle structured output and context lengths; Generic vs. domain-specific entities: framework extracts both, but domain schemas add richness at cost of complexity

- **Failure signatures**: Category drift: similar videos assigned different categories → inconsistent schema retrieval; Schema over-generation: LLM produces too many entity types → sparse/noisy extractions; Attribute hallucination: VLM infers attributes not grounded in video content (mitigate via prompt constraints); Unimodal blind spots: if audio fails, speech-derived entities are lost; if visual is dark/blurry, appearance attributes suffer

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Category consistency test: Process 100 videos from known categories (e.g., YouTube's labeled categories); measure canonical category agreement with ground-truth labels.
  2. Schema quality assessment: Manually inspect generated schemas for 3-5 diverse domains; verify entity types and attributes are sensible and example values are plausible.
  3. Baseline extraction comparison: On 50 videos, compare RAVEN entity recall against NER-on-speech, OCR, and object detection; quantify attribute richness (number of attributes per entity) across methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can RAVEN be extended to extract and represent entity relationships (e.g., person-to-event, object-to-location links) in addition to individual entities and attributes? Basis: "Future work will explore extending RAVEN's capabilities to support entity relationships." Unresolved because current schemas define entity types with attributes but no cross-entity relation types.

### Open Question 2
How does RAVEN's entity extraction performance vary across different VLM and LLM backends, and what are the trade-offs in accuracy, cost, and latency? Basis: The paper claims model-agnosticism but evaluates only Gemini 1.5 Flash (VLM) and GPT-4o (LLM). Unresolved because no ablation study or comparison across alternative model backends is provided.

### Open Question 3
How should RAVEN handle videos that span multiple categories (e.g., a travel documentary with historical segments), and does single-category schema retrieval limit extraction completeness? Basis: Schema retrieval uses semantic similarity to match one canonical category per clip, but real-world videos often cross domains. Unresolved because assigning a single category per clip risks missing entities relevant to secondary domains.

### Open Question 4
What is the precision and attribute-level accuracy of RAVEN's extractions, beyond recall? Basis: Figure 5 reports recall only; Table 2 provides qualitative examples without quantitative precision or attribute correctness metrics. Unresolved because high recall with low precision could limit utility for downstream structured retrieval tasks.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a small curated subset of 300 videos from a single dataset, with no detailed description of ground-truth labeling methodology for recall computation.
- Framework's effectiveness depends heavily on VLM and LLM model capabilities, particularly their ability to generate consistent structured outputs and handle video+audio inputs with sufficient context length.
- The semantic retrieval mechanism for schema matching is described generically without specifying the embedding model or similarity threshold used.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The two-stage pipeline architecture (category understanding → schema generation → entity extraction) is clearly specified and technically coherent. The multimodal integration approach is well-justified by the need to capture cross-modal contextual attributes.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness claims relative to baselines are supported by the paper's results, but the evaluation scale is limited and lacks independent validation. The schema generation mechanism appears promising but hasn't been validated for diverse or novel domains.
- **Low confidence**: The framework's generalizability beyond the Aligned Video Captions dataset remains unverified. The model-agnostic claim lacks empirical support with alternative VLM/LLM combinations.

## Next Checks
1. **Ground truth validation**: Independently label 50 videos from the evaluation subset with entities and attributes; compute RAVEN's precision and recall against this benchmark to verify claimed recall rates.
2. **Schema adaptability test**: Process videos from 3-5 novel domains not present in the training corpus (e.g., cooking, sports, medical procedures); evaluate schema generation quality and extraction completeness.
3. **Model substitution experiment**: Replace Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o with alternative models (e.g., Claude 3, LLaVA, or open-source VLMs); measure changes in extraction accuracy and schema generation quality to test model-agnostic claims.
