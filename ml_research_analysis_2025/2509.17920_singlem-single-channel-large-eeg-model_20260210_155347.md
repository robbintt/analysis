core_contribution: This paper introduces SingLEM, a self-supervised foundation model
  designed to address the limitations of existing EEG deep learning models that are
  task-specific and dependent on large labeled datasets. Unlike prior multi-channel
  EEG foundation models, SingLEM learns robust, general-purpose representations at
  the single-channel level, making it inherently hardware agnostic and adaptable across
  diverse montages.

# SingLEM: Single-Channel Large EEG Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17920
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Single-channel EEG foundation model outperforms multi-channel approaches on motor imagery and cognitive tasks

## Executive Summary
SingLEM introduces a self-supervised foundation model that learns robust, general-purpose representations from single-channel EEG data. Unlike existing task-specific deep learning models or multi-channel foundation models, SingLEM is hardware-agnostic and adaptable across diverse montages. Pretrained on 71 public datasets with over 9,200 subjects and 357,000 single-channel hours, the model uses a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture to capture both local and long-range temporal dependencies. When evaluated as a fixed feature extractor across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks, SingLEM consistently outperformed leading multi-channel foundation models and handcrafted baselines, demonstrating that single-channel approaches can achieve state-of-the-art generalization while enabling fine-grained neurophysiological analysis.

## Method Summary
The model employs a hybrid encoder architecture combining convolutional layers for local feature extraction with a hierarchical transformer for modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. SingLEM was pretrained using self-supervised learning on 71 public EEG datasets totaling 357,000 single-channel hours from 9,200+ subjects. The architecture processes each channel independently, learning channel-wise representations that are then aggregated. This single-channel approach contrasts with traditional multi-channel models and makes the system inherently hardware-agnostic. The pretrained model was evaluated as a fixed feature extractor across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks, where it consistently outperformed both leading multi-channel foundation models and traditional handcrafted baselines.

## Key Results
- Single-channel representations aggregated across electrodes outperformed leading multi-channel foundation models
- State-of-the-art generalization achieved across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks
- Hardware-agnostic design enables adaptability across diverse EEG montages without retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of SingLEM stems from its ability to learn robust, general-purpose representations at the single-channel level while maintaining hardware agnosticism. By pretraining on a massive corpus of diverse EEG data (357,000+ hours across 71 datasets), the model captures universal patterns that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. The hybrid CNN-transformer architecture is particularly effective because convolutional layers extract local temporal features while transformers model long-range dependencies, creating rich representations that generalize well. The single-channel approach paradoxically enhances generalizability by learning representations that are not tied to specific electrode configurations, making the model adaptable to any montage without retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-supervised learning**: Why needed - to leverage massive unlabeled EEG datasets; Quick check - verify contrastive loss or masked prediction objectives
- **Multi-task transfer learning**: Why needed - to create general-purpose representations applicable across diverse EEG applications; Quick check - assess performance consistency across six different task types
- **Hierarchical temporal modeling**: Why needed - to capture both short-range local features and long-range dependencies in EEG signals; Quick check - examine receptive field sizes and attention patterns
- **Channel-wise independent processing**: Why needed - to enable hardware-agnostic adaptation across different montages; Quick check - test performance when channel order is permuted
- **Large-scale pretraining**: Why needed - to learn universal EEG representations from diverse datasets; Quick check - measure performance gains with increasing pretraining data volume
- **Feature aggregation**: Why needed - to combine single-channel representations into task-specific predictions; Quick check - compare different aggregation strategies (mean, max, attention)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw EEG signal -> CNN layers -> Transformer encoder -> Single-channel representations -> Aggregation layer -> Task predictions

**Critical Path**: The most critical architectural decision is the hybrid CNN-transformer design. CNNs efficiently extract local temporal features from raw EEG signals, providing hierarchical feature representations that serve as input to the transformer. The transformer then models long-range temporal dependencies and complex patterns that are difficult for CNNs alone. This combination is crucial because EEG signals contain both local transient features (spindles, K-complexes) and long-range dependencies (sleep stages, cognitive states).

**Design Tradeoffs**: The single-channel approach sacrifices the potential benefits of cross-channel spatial information but gains hardware agnosticism and potentially better generalization. Multi-channel models can leverage spatial relationships between electrodes, but these relationships vary with montage and recording setup. The hybrid architecture adds computational complexity compared to pure CNN or transformer approaches, but this complexity is justified by the performance gains in capturing both local and global patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may underperform when cross-channel spatial relationships are crucial for the task (e.g., seizure localization requiring spatial propagation patterns). Performance could degrade when fine-grained spatial resolution is essential. The aggregation strategy might fail to properly weight channels with different signal qualities or relevance to specific tasks.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare SingLEM's single-channel representations against raw multi-channel input on tasks where spatial relationships are known to be important
2. Test the model's performance when individual channels are corrupted or missing to assess robustness
3. Evaluate different aggregation strategies (mean pooling vs. attention-based vs. learned weights) to optimize the combination of single-channel features
