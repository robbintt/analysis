# FnRGNN: Distribution-aware Fairness in Graph Neural Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19257
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19257
- Authors: Soyoung Park; Sungsu Lim
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Reduces Wasserstein distance from 0.02 to 0.0055 on Pokec-z while maintaining MSE as low as 0.0622

## Executive Summary
FnRGNN introduces a fairness-aware framework for node-level regression in graph neural networks by targeting bias at three intervention levels: structure, representation, and prediction. It uses edge reweighting to suppress bias propagation, MMD-based representation alignment, and Sinkhorn divergence plus moment matching for fair predictions. The method demonstrates strong performance on four real-world datasets, achieving significant fairness gains with minimal accuracy loss.

## Method Summary
FnRGNN operates on graphs with continuous targets and binary sensitive attributes, applying three key interventions: (1) edge reweighting based on feature similarity and group membership, (2) representation alignment using MMD with RBF kernels, and (3) prediction normalization via Sinkhorn divergence and moment matching. The overall objective combines MSE with fairness regularization terms weighted by hyperparameters tuned via NSGA-II in Optuna. The model uses a 2-layer GCN encoder with 64 hidden units and MLP regression head, trained with Adam optimizer for 500 epochs with early stopping.

## Key Results
- Reduces Wasserstein distance from 0.02 to 0.0055 on Pokec-z and from 0.0181 to 0.0018 on Pokec-n
- Achieves competitive accuracy with MSE as low as 0.0622 on Pokec-z and 0.0511 on Pokec-n
- Maintains strong performance across all four tested datasets (Pokec-z, Pokec-n, NBA, German)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FnRGNN's effectiveness stems from its multi-level approach to fairness: edge reweighting reduces bias propagation through the graph structure, MMD alignment ensures similar representation distributions across sensitive groups, and Sinkhorn divergence with moment matching directly enforces fair prediction distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph Neural Networks: Why needed - learn node representations from graph structure; Quick check - verify GCN layer correctly aggregates neighbor information
- Wasserstein Distance: Why needed - measure distribution discrepancy between groups; Quick check - confirm WD computation matches theoretical definition
- Maximum Mean Discrepancy: Why needed - align feature distributions across sensitive groups; Quick check - verify RBF kernel implementation and gradient flow
- Sinkhorn Divergence: Why needed - compute optimal transport for prediction fairness; Quick check - ensure numerical stability with regularization
- Moment Matching: Why needed - enforce distributional similarity beyond mean; Quick check - verify higher-order moment calculations
- NSGA-II Optimization: Why needed - tune fairness-accuracy tradeoff hyperparameters; Quick check - confirm multi-objective search converges

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Preprocessing -> Edge Reweighting -> GCN Encoder -> MMD Alignment -> MLP Regression -> Fairness Regularization -> Loss Computation

**Critical Path**
Input features → Edge reweighting → GCN layers → MLP head → Sinkhorn divergence + moment matching → Total loss

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Edge reweighting strength (γ) vs. information preservation: Higher γ suppresses bias but may lose signal
- MMD kernel bandwidth (σ) vs. alignment granularity: Larger σ captures broader features but may oversmooth
- Sinkhorn regularization (ε) vs. computational stability: Higher ε ensures stability but may reduce transport accuracy

**Failure Signatures**
- NaN losses: Check Sinkhorn computation stability and input value ranges
- Degraded accuracy: Verify edge reweighting doesn't overly suppress informative edges
- High variance across runs: Confirm consistent hyperparameter tuning and initialization

**First Experiments**
1. Verify edge reweighting correctly suppresses cross-group connections on synthetic biased graph
2. Test MMD alignment on two synthetic distributions with known gap
3. Confirm Sinkhorn divergence computation on simple 1D distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
How can FnRGNN be effectively extended to handle non-binary or multi-class sensitive attributes? The current methodology explicitly defines sensitive attributes as binary ($s_i \in \{0, 1\}$) for group comparisons, but future work will extend to multi-class scenarios.

### Open Question 2
How does FnRGNN perform in dynamic graph environments where structure and attributes evolve over time? The current framework assumes a static graph $G=(V, E)$, and the edge reweighting strategy does not account for temporal shifts in bias or topology.

### Open Question 3
What theoretical fairness guarantees does FnRGNN provide when facing distribution shifts in the input data? The paper currently relies on empirical validation without providing formal bounds on how output distributions behave if test data diverges from training distributions.

## Limitations
- Major uncertainties around exact implementation details of similarity function and hyperparameters
- OOM risks on large graphs like Pokec require careful batch sampling or subgraph methods
- Missing specific RBF kernel bandwidth, Sinkhorn regularization parameter, and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings

## Confidence
- Reproducibility of fairness gains: High
- Exact numerical matching: Medium
- Stability across hyperparameter variations: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify implementation of edge reweighting with cosine similarity and confirm numerical stability of Sinkhorn divergence across datasets
2. Tune λ_MMD, λ_dist, and γ on a validation split for one dataset to match reported performance ranges
3. Run 5 independent training trials on a small dataset (e.g., NBA) to confirm reported MSE and fairness metrics are reproducible within reported variance
