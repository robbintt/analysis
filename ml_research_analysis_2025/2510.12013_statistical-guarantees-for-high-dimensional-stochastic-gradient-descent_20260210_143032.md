# Statistical Guarantees for High-Dimensional Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12013
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12013

- This paper establishes rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and ASGD in high-dimensional regimes, providing convergence bounds in general ℓs-norms including ℓ∞.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides rigorous statistical guarantees for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) in high-dimensional settings with constant learning rates. The authors view SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and apply coupling techniques from high-dimensional time series analysis to prove geometric-moment contraction and asymptotic stationarity of iterates. They derive non-asymptotic q-th moment convergence bounds for both algorithms in general ℓs-norms, including ℓ∞, along with sharp high-probability concentration analysis for ASGD. This work closes a critical theoretical gap by providing convergence guarantees for constant learning rates—commonly used in practice—extending beyond previous results limited to decaying rates or low-dimensional settings.

## Method Summary
The authors establish statistical guarantees for high-dimensional SGD and ASGD by treating the iterates as a nonlinear autoregressive process. They employ coupling techniques from high-dimensional time series analysis to prove geometric-moment contraction, which ensures asymptotic stationarity of the iterates. The analysis derives non-asymptotic q-th moment convergence bounds in general ℓs-norms (including ℓ∞) for both SGD and ASGD. For ASGD specifically, they provide sharp high-probability concentration bounds. The approach focuses on constant learning rates, which are commonly used in practice but have been theoretically challenging to analyze. The framework handles both convex and non-convex objectives while accommodating the high-dimensional regime where the number of parameters can scale with the sample size.

## Key Results
- Proves geometric-moment contraction for SGD iterates, establishing asymptotic stationarity in high-dimensional settings
- Derives non-asymptotic q-th moment convergence bounds for both SGD and ASGD in general ℓs-norms, including ℓ∞
- Provides sharp high-probability concentration bounds specifically for ASGD with constant learning rates
- Closes theoretical gap by establishing convergence guarantees for constant learning rates commonly used in practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by viewing SGD iterates as a nonlinear autoregressive process, which allows the application of time series analysis techniques. The key mechanism is geometric-moment contraction, which ensures that the iterates converge to a stationary distribution. This contraction is established through coupling techniques adapted from high-dimensional time series analysis. For ASGD, the averaging mechanism provides additional smoothing that enables sharper high-probability concentration bounds. The analysis handles constant learning rates by showing that under certain conditions on the gradient noise (sub-Weibull distribution), the iterates remain well-behaved despite not decaying over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sub-Weibull distributions**: Heavy-tailed distributions that generalize sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential distributions; needed to characterize gradient noise behavior and establish moment bounds; quick check: verify gradient noise follows sub-Weibull tails empirically
- **Coupling techniques**: Probabilistic method to compare two stochastic processes; needed to prove geometric-moment contraction by showing coupled processes become close; quick check: implement coupling comparison as diagnostic during training
- **Geometric-moment contraction**: Property ensuring exponential decay of moments between coupled processes; needed to establish asymptotic stationarity of SGD iterates; quick check: monitor contraction rates empirically during training
- **Nonlinear autoregressive processes**: Time series where current state depends nonlinearly on previous state; needed to model SGD dynamics as stochastic process; quick check: fit AR model to SGD iterates to validate modeling assumptions
- **ℓs-norms (including ℓ∞)**: Generalized norms for measuring vector magnitudes; needed to provide convergence bounds in various norms relevant for high-dimensional problems; quick check: compute convergence in different norms to identify most stringent constraint

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
SGD iterates → Geometric-moment contraction → Asymptotic stationarity → Convergence bounds
ASGD iterates → Averaging + Contraction → Sharper concentration → High-probability bounds

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves establishing geometric-moment contraction, which depends on the coupling technique and the sub-Weibull assumption on gradient noise. Once contraction is established, asymptotic stationarity follows, enabling convergence bounds in general ℓs-norms. For ASGD, the critical path additionally requires showing that averaging preserves and enhances the contraction properties.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The choice of constant learning rate trades off between faster initial convergence and potential instability in later stages. The sub-Weibull assumption on gradient noise is more general than sub-Gaussian but still restrictive. The coupling approach provides strong theoretical guarantees but requires sophisticated analysis that may not extend easily to all algorithm variants.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Failure of geometric-moment contraction indicates either too large learning rate or gradient noise violating sub-Weibull conditions
- Divergence in ℓ∞-norm suggests instability in high-dimensional components
- Concentration bounds failing to hold indicates either insufficient averaging in ASGD or violation of noise assumptions

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify sub-Weibull condition empirically for gradient noise in standard deep learning benchmarks (e.g., image classification with ResNet architectures)
2. Monitor geometric-moment contraction during training using coupling diagnostics to detect early signs of instability
3. Compare convergence rates across different ℓs-norms to identify which norm provides the tightest bound for specific problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions: extension of the analysis to non-convex settings with more general loss functions and constraints, investigation of learning rate schedules that combine constant and decaying phases, and application of the theoretical framework to specific deep learning architectures and tasks. The authors also note that while the sub-Weibull assumption is general, verifying it for specific applications remains an open challenge.

## Limitations
- The sub-Weibull assumption on gradient noise may be restrictive and difficult to verify for all practical problems
- The coupling techniques are sophisticated and may be sensitive to implementation details or extensions to related algorithms
- Extension to general loss functions and constraints is mentioned but not fully explored in the analysis
- Results focus on constant learning rates, while practical implementations often use complex learning rate schedules

## Confidence
**Major Uncertainty (Medium)**: The sub-Weibull assumption on gradient noise is a critical technical requirement that may be restrictive in practice. While this is standard in the literature, verifying this condition for specific applications could be challenging.

**Major Uncertainty (Medium)**: The geometric-moment contraction results rely on delicate coupling arguments. The proof techniques are sophisticated but may be sensitive to implementation details or extensions to related algorithms.

**Major Uncertainty (High)**: The extension to general loss functions and constraints is mentioned but not fully explored. The analysis primarily focuses on unconstrained optimization with smooth losses.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the sub-Weibull condition empirically for gradient noise in standard deep learning benchmarks (e.g., image classification with ResNet architectures)
2. Implement the coupling-based convergence analysis as a diagnostic tool to monitor geometric-moment contraction during training
3. Test the ℓ∞-norm convergence bounds on high-dimensional sparse problems where this norm is particularly relevant
