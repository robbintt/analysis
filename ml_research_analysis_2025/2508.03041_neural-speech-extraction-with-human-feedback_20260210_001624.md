# Neural Speech Extraction with Human Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03041
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03041
- Authors: Malek Itani; Ashton Graves; Sefik Emre Eskimez; Shyamnath Gollakota
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Human-in-the-loop TSE system achieves up to 6.69 dB SI-SDR improvement and 0.6 MOS point gain

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that incorporates human feedback for iterative refinement. Users mark segments in TSE output that need improvement, generating an edit mask. A refinement network then processes only marked sections while preserving unmarked regions. Since collecting large-scale human-annotated error datasets is impractical, the authors generate synthetic datasets using automated masking functions. The best-performing model uses noise power-based masking (in dBFS) with probabilistic thresholding. In a study with 22 participants, refined outputs were preferred over baseline TSE.

## Method Summary
The system combines a SepFormer-based TSE model with FiLM conditioning on d-vectors, followed by a refinement network that improves marked segments. The TSE model is trained first on LibriSpeech + WHAM! noise mixtures using negative SI-SDR loss. Synthetic edit masks are generated using dBFS-prob: per-window error power (10 log) compared against thresholds sampled from N(-40, 3). The refinement network uses a separate encoder, average-pooled edit masks, fusion with refinement state S (from adaptation layer), and speaker embeddings via FiLM, followed by L=2 SepFormer blocks and mask decoder. Final output blends refined and original TSE using the edit mask.

## Key Results
- Up to 6.69 dB improvement in SI-SDR and 0.6 point improvement in MOS compared to TSE-only output
- Refined outputs were preferred over baseline TSE in a study with 22 participants
- Best masking function: dBFS-prob (τ ~ N(-40, σ=3), 0.25s windows)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages human feedback to focus computational resources on problematic segments while preserving correctly extracted regions. By using synthetic edit masks for training, the model learns to identify and correct common TSE errors without requiring expensive human annotation. The dBFS-prob masking function effectively simulates human perceptual error detection by thresholding error power in decibels with controlled randomness.

## Foundational Learning

1. **SepFormer Architecture**
   - Why needed: Self-attention mechanism excels at long-range dependencies in speech signals
   - Quick check: Verify attention weights focus on relevant speaker components

2. **FiLM Conditioning**
   - Why needed: Enables speaker-aware processing without complex speaker modeling
   - Quick check: Confirm conditioning scales appropriately with different speakers

3. **dBFS-prob Masking**
   - Why needed: Simulates human error detection without manual annotation
   - Quick check: Visualize mask density distribution across test samples

4. **Edit Mask Blending**
   - Why needed: Preserves correctly extracted regions while refining only marked segments
   - Quick check: Verify SI-SDR doesn't degrade on unmarked regions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Mixture -> TSE -> Edit Mask -> Refinement Network -> Final Output

**Critical Path**: Original mixture → TSE (SepFormer + FiLM + d-vector) → Edit mask generation → Refinement (separate encoder + fusion + SepFormer blocks) → Weighted blend with TSE output

**Design Tradeoffs**:
- Using original mixture for refinement vs. re-running TSE (SI-SDR degrades if re-TSE)
- Probabilistic vs. deterministic masking (probabilistic better matches human perception)
- Separate encoder vs. shared encoder (separate provides better refinement capability)

**Failure Signatures**:
- SI-SDR degradation after refinement (indicates processing original mixture incorrectly)
- Artifacts in unmarked regions (indicates over-aggressive refinement)
- Mask density too high or too low (affects model's ability to learn meaningful corrections)

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify TSE baseline performance matches Table 1 (12.18 dB SI-SDR)
2. Test refinement on synthetic masks with known errors
3. Validate dBFS-prob mask generation produces reasonable densities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human feedback loop validation relies on subjective preference without detailed experimental protocol
- dBFS-prob masking parameters (window size, threshold distribution) chosen empirically without justification
- d-vector extractor architecture and pretraining details unspecified

## Confidence

**High**: Core TSE architecture (SepFormer + FiLM + d-vector conditioning) and synthetic mask generation methodology are well-specified and reproducible.

**Medium**: Refinement network architecture and training procedure are described with sufficient detail, though exact implementation of adaptation and fusion layers remains partially unspecified.

**Low**: Human feedback loop validation (22 participants, MOS improvements) relies on subjective preference and lacks detail on experimental protocol.

## Next Checks

1. Verify refinement model does not degrade SI-SDR by confirming it processes the original mixture, not re-TSE output, and compare against baseline TSE performance.

2. Test sensitivity of dBFS-prob masking by varying σ (3→5) and threshold mean (-40→-35) to determine optimal mask density for MOS vs. SI-SDR trade-off.

3. Evaluate alternative fusion strategies (FiLM vs. concatenation-only vs. gated addition) in the refinement network to confirm FiLM is optimal for this human-feedback setting.
