# RicciFlowRec: A Geometric Root Cause Recommender Using Ricci Curvature on Financial Graphs

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09334

- Key outcome: Geometric recommendation framework integrating discrete Ricci curvature and Ricci flow on dynamic financial graphs for risk-aware asset ranking

## Executive Summary
RicciFlowRec introduces a geometric recommendation framework for financial risk-aware asset ranking by integrating discrete Ricci curvature and Ricci flow on dynamic financial graphs. The approach quantifies structural stress and traces shock propagation through evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment. Curvature gradients identify root causes of instability, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function that adjusts predicted returns based on exposure to unstable regions.

On S&P 500 data with FinBERT sentiment, RicciFlowRec improves ranking stability under synthetic perturbations, achieving 0.512 NDCG@10, 0.041 top-10 volatility, and 0.78 RCA fidelity. Ablation shows both Ricci flow and curvature-based risk adjustment are essential. The method provides transparent, geometry-based explanations for asset recommendations, supporting early warning and decision-making in volatile markets.

## Method Summary
RicciFlowRec constructs a temporal financial graph where nodes represent stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and sentiment scores, with edges weighted by historical correlations and text-derived interactions. The framework applies discrete Ricci curvature computation to quantify edge-level stress and systemic vulnerability. Ricci flow dynamics iteratively smooth the graph geometry to reveal stable and unstable regions. A risk-aware ranking function incorporates curvature gradients to adjust predicted asset returns, penalizing exposure to structurally vulnerable areas. The system is trained on multi-modal inputs and evaluated using ranking metrics and stability measures under perturbations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.512 NDCG@10 for risk-aware asset ranking
- Maintains 0.041 top-10 volatility under synthetic perturbations
- Demonstrates 0.78 RCA fidelity in identifying root causes of instability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The geometric approach leverages the fact that financial networks exhibit varying structural stability, where highly curved edges indicate stress points prone to shock propagation. By computing discrete Ricci curvature, the method quantifies local vulnerability in the graph topology. Ricci flow dynamics then reveal how stress concentrates and spreads through the network over time, enabling early detection of systemic risk. The risk-aware ranking function uses these geometric insights to adjust asset scores, prioritizing positions with lower exposure to unstable regions. This integration of graph geometry and financial data creates a more robust recommendation system that adapts to structural changes in market dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

**Discrete Ricci curvature** - Measures edge-level geometric properties in graphs, quantifying how much the network deviates from flatness. Needed to identify structural vulnerabilities in financial interactions where traditional correlation metrics may miss nonlinear dependencies.

**Ricci flow dynamics** - Iterative smoothing process that evolves graph geometry over time, revealing stable and unstable regions. Required to trace how financial shocks propagate and concentrate through the network structure.

**Graph-based risk propagation** - Models how stress and instability spread through interconnected assets. Essential for understanding systemic risk beyond individual asset fundamentals.

**Multi-modal graph construction** - Combines stock prices, macroeconomic indicators, and sentiment data into unified network structure. Necessary to capture complex interdependencies driving market behavior.

**Risk-aware ranking adjustment** - Modifies predicted returns based on geometric vulnerability measures. Provides a principled way to incorporate structural risk into investment decisions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Financial data → Graph construction → Ricci curvature computation → Ricci flow smoothing → Risk-aware ranking → Asset recommendations

**Critical path**: Graph construction and curvature computation form the bottleneck, requiring efficient algorithms for large-scale financial networks. The Ricci flow iteration adds computational overhead but is essential for dynamic risk assessment.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for geometric interpretability and robustness. Using discrete Ricci curvature provides more nuanced risk signals than traditional graph metrics but requires careful parameter tuning.

**Failure signatures**: Over-smoothing from Ricci flow can mask important local structures, while under-smoothing fails to reveal systemic patterns. Poor graph construction or noisy sentiment data can lead to spurious curvature signals.

**First experiments**: 1) Test Ricci curvature sensitivity to different correlation thresholds in graph construction. 2) Compare risk-aware ranking performance with and without Ricci flow smoothing. 3) Evaluate robustness to varying levels of synthetic perturbations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that the assumption of discrete Ricci curvature accurately capturing systemic risk propagation in financial markets remains an open question in financial graph theory. It also notes that synthetic perturbations used for stability testing may not fully represent real-world market shocks, and that the method's sensitivity to parameter choices in Ricci flow dynamics and curvature computation requires further exploration.

## Limitations
- The accuracy of discrete Ricci curvature in capturing systemic risk propagation is not fully validated against established financial theories
- Reliance on synthetic perturbations for stability testing may not generalize to real market conditions
- The method's sensitivity to parameter choices in Ricci flow and curvature computation is not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks

1. Conduct out-of-sample validation using historical market crashes to assess predictive power for real shock propagation
2. Perform sensitivity analysis across different market regimes (bull, bear, volatile) to test parameter robustness
3. Implement a controlled backtesting framework comparing investment returns against baseline methods using actual capital allocation
