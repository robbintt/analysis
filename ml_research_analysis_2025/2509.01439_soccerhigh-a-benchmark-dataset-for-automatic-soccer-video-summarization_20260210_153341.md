# SoccerHigh: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Soccer Video Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01439

- First publicly available dataset for soccer video summarization with 237 full-match broadcast video pairs and corresponding highlight summaries

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SoccerHigh, the first publicly available dataset for soccer video summarization, comprising 237 pairs of full-match broadcast videos and corresponding highlight summaries from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues. To address the challenge of annotating such data at scale, the authors propose a semi-automated pipeline that combines shot boundary detection, frame-level feature alignment, and manual refinement. Experiments compare various feature extraction backbones and shot segmentation strategies, with DINOv2 pretrained features and kNN-based segmentation achieving the best results. A baseline model is introduced, using VideoMAEv2 features, 60-second chunks, and a dual-head architecture with NMS-based shot selection. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 on the test set. The paper also proposes a novel evaluation metric constrained by the ground-truth summary length, enabling more objective assessment of generated content.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing the SoccerHigh dataset, combining shot boundary detection, frame-level feature alignment, and manual refinement. The dataset contains 237 pairs of full-match broadcast videos and corresponding highlight summaries from Spanish, French, and Italian leagues. For the baseline model, the authors use VideoMAEv2 features, process 60-second chunks, and employ a dual-head architecture with NMS-based shot selection. The model is trained to predict highlight segments, achieving an F1 score of 0.3956 on the test set. A novel evaluation metric is introduced that constrains generated summaries to match ground-truth lengths for more objective assessment.

## Key Results
- SoccerHigh dataset contains 237 pairs of full-match broadcast videos and highlight summaries
- DINOv2 pretrained features and kNN-based segmentation achieved the best results in feature extraction comparisons
- Baseline model achieves F1 score of 0.3956 on test set using VideoMAEv2 features and 60-second chunks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of the SoccerHigh dataset and baseline model stems from the combination of high-quality visual features (DINOv2, VideoMAEv2) that capture semantic content, effective shot segmentation strategies that identify meaningful action boundaries, and a semi-automated annotation pipeline that balances scalability with quality control. The dual-head architecture with NMS-based shot selection effectively identifies and ranks highlight-worthy segments while avoiding redundancy. The novel evaluation metric provides a more realistic assessment by constraining summary lengths to match ground truth, addressing the challenge of comparing variable-length generated content.

## Foundational Learning

**Shot boundary detection** - Why needed: To identify transitions between meaningful segments in soccer broadcasts where action changes. Quick check: Visual inspection of detected shot boundaries against ground truth.

**Frame-level feature extraction** - Why needed: To capture semantic content and visual patterns that distinguish highlight-worthy moments from regular play. Quick check: Feature dimensionality and clustering quality on highlight vs non-highlight segments.

**kNN-based segmentation** - Why needed: To group similar frames into coherent shots without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Quick check: Consistency of segmentation across different matches and leagues.

**NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)** - Why needed: To select the most representative highlights while eliminating redundant or overlapping segments. Quick check: Diversity and coverage of selected highlights compared to ground truth.

**Dual-head architecture** - Why needed: To separately predict highlight scores and segment boundaries for more precise control. Quick check: Performance of each head independently and in combination.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Shot boundary detection -> Feature extraction (DINOv2/VideoMAEv2) -> kNN segmentation -> Dual-head prediction -> NMS selection

**Critical path**: Raw video frames → Feature extraction → Shot segmentation → Highlight prediction → Post-processing (NMS) → Final summary

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice between feature extraction backbones (DINOv2 vs VideoMAEv2) involves balancing computational efficiency with semantic richness. The 60-second chunk size trades temporal context for manageable memory usage. The length-constrained evaluation metric prioritizes realistic summary duration over potentially more comprehensive but longer summaries.

**Failure signatures**: Poor shot boundary detection leads to merged or fragmented highlights; inadequate feature extraction fails to distinguish important moments; suboptimal segmentation creates unnatural highlight boundaries; NMS parameters that are too aggressive eliminate important content; length constraints that are too strict force omission of relevant content.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test different chunk sizes (30s, 60s, 90s) to evaluate impact on F1 score and computational efficiency
2. Compare DINOv2 and VideoMAEv2 feature extraction on a validation set with identical model architecture
3. Evaluate the impact of NMS threshold on summary diversity and redundancy using the proposed evaluation metric

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (237 pairs) may not capture full diversity of soccer match styles and broadcast formats
- Semi-automated annotation pipeline may introduce systematic biases in highlight selection
- Length-constrained evaluation metric may not reflect real-world use cases where users prefer different summary durations
- Baseline model performance (F1 score of 0.3956) indicates significant room for improvement

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The dataset construction methodology, feature extraction comparisons, and baseline model architecture are clearly described and technically sound. The experimental results are reproducible based on the provided information.

**Medium confidence**: The claim about this being the first publicly available dataset for soccer video summarization is supported by the literature review, but the field is rapidly evolving. The effectiveness of the proposed evaluation metric requires validation across different use cases.

**Low confidence**: The generalizability of results to matches from other leagues, different broadcast styles, or varying user preferences for highlight length. The optimal choice of feature extraction method and segmentation strategy may depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the dataset.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the baseline model on a held-out test set with matches from leagues not represented in the training data to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct ablation studies on the proposed evaluation metric by testing summaries of varying lengths to understand the trade-off between adherence to ground-truth duration and summary quality.

3. Compare the semi-automated annotation pipeline against fully manual annotations on a subset of videos to quantify the impact of potential annotation biases on model performance.
