# LLM Bias Detection and Mitigation through the Lens of Desired Distributions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06354
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06354
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Achieves 98%+ bias reduction under equality target and 30-75% reduction under real-world target while preserving language modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel perspective on LLM bias detection and mitigation by defining bias as deviation from a user-specified desired distribution, which can be either an equal distribution or a real-world distribution depending on application goals. The authors propose a weighted adaptive loss-based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession output distribution with the desired distribution while preserving language modeling capability. Using U.S. labor statistics (2024), they assess their adaptive method for reflecting reality and a non-adaptive variant for equality across three profession sets (male-dominated, female-dominated, gender-balanced). Across three masked language models, they achieve near-complete mitigation under equality (over 98% reduction) and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. For autoregressive LLMs, they observe no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with Llama Instruct models achieving a 50-62% reduction.

## Method Summary
The method computes KL divergence between the LLM's predicted gender-profession distribution and a desired distribution (equal or real-world). For each profession, the normalized probability p(r)pred(g) is derived from association scores across templates and gendered words, then compared to the target p(r)true(g). The weighted adaptive loss scales updates by profession category using exponentially-weighted moving average of historical KL and stability-aware weighting based on variance. For MLMs, a secondary token-level MLM loss is added to preserve language modeling capability. The approach uses LoRA for models <7B parameters and QLoRA for larger models.

## Key Results
- Near-complete bias mitigation under equality target (>98% KL reduction across all models)
- 30-75% KL reduction under real-world target, with DPmale showing most mitigation and DPfemale least
- Language modeling preservation: MLM loss increases <8% for MLMs, perplexity stable for ALMs
- DPbalanced category shows smallest KL values pre-mitigation (<0.005) but still benefits from adaptive weighting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distributional Bias via KL Divergence
The method operationalizes bias as KL divergence from a user-specified target distribution rather than requiring demographic parity. This allows flexible application to either equality (50-50) or real-world distributions based on application goals.

### Mechanism 2: Weighted Adaptive Loss for Group-Balanced Learning
Each training batch is grouped by profession category (DPmale, DPfemale, DPbalanced). The adaptive loss normalizes by exponentially-weighted moving average of historical loss and uses variance-based stability weighting to prevent domination by high-loss groups.

### Mechanism 3: Language Modeling Preservation via Secondary MLM Loss
For MLMs, adding a token-level MLM loss during fine-tuning recovers language modeling degradation without substantially harming bias mitigation. The total loss combines KL divergence (primary) with MLM loss (controlled by γ).

## Foundational Learning

- **KL Divergence**:
  - Why needed here: Central metric for quantifying distributional misalignment; must understand asymmetry (P||Q ≠ Q||P) and interpretation
  - Quick check question: If KL divergence is 0.05 for a profession, what does this mean about predicted vs. target distributions?

- **Template-Based Bias Probing**:
  - Why needed here: Association scores are derived from masking gendered attributes in probe sentences; understanding template design affects interpretability
  - Quick check question: Why might T1 ("[DET/PRONOUN] [attribute] is [ARTICLE] [target]") be "rarer" than T5 based on pseudo-perplexity?

- **Exponential Moving Averages for Online Statistics**:
  - Why needed here: Adaptive loss uses β-weighted updates to track historical KL per group; must understand momentum effects
  - Quick check question: If β = 0.95 and current batch loss spikes, how quickly does µKL,new reflect this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  1. Probe Generator: Templates + gendered words + professions → masked sentences
  2. Association Score Computer: Log-likelihood ratios (MLM) or sentence loss negation (ALM)
  3. Distribution Normalizer: Softmax over genders per profession
  4. Adaptive Loss Engine: Per-group µKL tracking, variance weighting, scaling α(c)
  5. Fine-tuning Loop: LoRA/QLoRA for ALMs; full fine-tuning for MLMs

- **Critical path**:
  1. Validate target distributions against external sources (e.g., BLS 2024 data)
  2. Compute initial KL divergence per profession category to assign α(c)
  3. Run validation-set sweep for β, γ, learning rate before full fine-tuning
  4. Monitor per-group KL during training; early stop if balanced categories degrade

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Equal vs. real-world target: Equality gives >98% reduction but may conflict with factual grounding; real-world preserves truth but retains societal biases
  - Uniform vs. adaptive loss: Uniform is simpler but over-emphasizes high-KL groups; adaptive balances but requires validation statistics
  - MLM loss inclusion: Recovers capability but adds hyperparameter γ; critical for MLMs, unnecessary for ALMs

- **Failure signatures**:
  - KL divergence increases for DPfemale or DPbalanced while DPmale improves → uniform loss may be dominating
  - Perplexity spikes >15% → MLM loss γ may be too low; increase or add external corpus
  - DPbalanced KL diverges sharply (>200% increase) despite low absolute values → adaptive weights may be misassigned

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate equal-distribution mitigation on DistilBERT with 5 seed runs; verify >98% KL reduction and <8% MLM loss increase on WikiText-103
  2. Ablate adaptive scaling (set all α(c) equal) on BERT-base real-world target; compare ALL KL reduction against full adaptive method
  3. Test Llama3.2-3B-Instruct with LoRA (r=64, α=16) on real-world target; measure whether DPbalanced KL remains <0.005 post-mitigation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1: Non-binary Gender Generalization**
Can the weighted adaptive KL loss method generalize to non-binary gender identities and underrepresented gender categories when appropriate real-world distribution data becomes available? The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation and call for future work to include non-binary and underrepresented gender identities.

**Open Question 2: Open-ended Generation Transfer**
Does the bias mitigation approach transfer effectively to open-ended text generation settings, where contextual relevance and generation quality introduce additional complexities? The authors note that template-based probing may not capture the nuanced, context-dependent nature of bias in free-form generation.

**Open Question 3: Out-of-Distribution Template Robustness**
How robust is the bias mitigation to out-of-distribution template variations, such as altered attribute-target ordering or diverse syntactic structures? The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not comprehensively evaluate template variation scenarios.

**Open Question 4: Systemic Inequality Reinforcement**
Does the real-world distribution alignment approach inadvertently reinforce systemic inequalities when applied to domains beyond profession-gender associations? The authors raise ethical concerns about using real-world distributions that may reflect underlying systemic inequalities.

## Limitations

- Binary gender analysis only due to availability of real-world distribution data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Template-based probing may not capture contextual nuances of open-ended generation settings
- No evaluation of out-of-distribution template variations or rare professions
- Potential reinforcement of systemic inequalities when applying real-world alignment to domains with documented bias

## Confidence

**High Confidence (≥0.8)**:
- Bias can be operationalized as KL divergence from a user-specified distribution
- Weighted adaptive loss improves mitigation compared to uniform loss in all MLM settings
- Adding MLM loss preserves language modeling capability for MLMs

**Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)**:
- Real-world target achieves 30-75% KL reduction across models
- ALMs show no bias under equality target but retain bias under real-world target
- DPfemale consistently shows less mitigation than DPmale across all settings

**Low Confidence (<0.5)**:
- Exact α(c) and λ(c) assignment rules derived from validation statistics
- Whether the 0.8 threshold for "low bias" (DPbalanced) is universally appropriate
- Long-term stability of mitigation after fine-tuning

## Next Checks

1. **Validation Set Sensitivity Analysis**: Re-run the DistilBERT equal-distribution experiment with 5 different random validation set seeds. Measure coefficient of variation in ALL KL reduction across seeds. If CV > 0.1, the α(c) assignment procedure is unstable.

2. **Cross-Demographic Extension**: Apply the real-world target method to a subset of 50 professions with available LGBTQ+ workforce data. Compare binary vs. expanded gender attribute KL reduction. If binary-only achieves >20% higher mitigation, the binary assumption limits real-world applicability.

3. **Long-Tail Profession Stress Test**: Create a synthetic test set of 50 rare professions (employment <10k) by sampling from SOC codes excluded from the main study. Measure KL divergence before/after fine-tuning on DistilBERT. If post-mitigation KL >0.1 for >20% of rare professions, the method overfits to common occupations.
