# ORCA: Mitigating Over-Reliance for Multi-Task Dwell Time Prediction with Causal Decoupling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.16573
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16573
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ORCA achieves 10.6% average improvement in dwell time prediction without harming CTR performance across three datasets

## Executive Summary
ORCA addresses a critical problem in multi-task recommendation systems where dwell time prediction models over-rely on click-through rate signals, leading to systematic under-prediction of moderate dwell time durations. This over-reliance occurs because CTR acts as a confounding variable that masks the true factors influencing user engagement duration. The proposed solution uses causal decoupling to explicitly separate CTR's positive and negative transfer effects, allowing the model to preserve beneficial CTR signals while removing harmful biases that cause under-prediction.

The method introduces feature-level counterfactual intervention and a task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting to weaken CTR-mediated effects and restore direct dwell time semantics. Experimental results demonstrate that ORCA consistently improves dwell time prediction accuracy by an average of 10.6% across multiple backbone models and datasets, while maintaining or improving click-through rate prediction performance. This dual improvement validates the effectiveness of the causal decoupling approach in addressing the fundamental bias in multi-task learning architectures.

## Method Summary
ORCA employs causal decoupling to address the over-reliance problem in multi-task dwell time prediction by explicitly modeling and separating CTR's positive and negative transfer effects. The method introduces feature-level counterfactual intervention that modifies CTR features to break their mediating influence on dwell time prediction, while a task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting mechanism reduces the weight of CTR-mediated examples during training. This approach allows the model to preserve CTR's beneficial signals for dwell time prediction while removing the confounding bias that leads to systematic under-prediction of moderate dwell time durations.

## Key Results
- ORCA achieves 10.6% average improvement in dwell time prediction metrics across three datasets
- CTR performance is preserved or improved while enhancing dwell time prediction
- The method demonstrates consistent effectiveness across multiple backbone models
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of both counterfactual intervention and instance inverse-weighting components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ORCA works by breaking the spurious correlation between CTR and dwell time that develops in standard multi-task learning architectures. The causal decoupling approach identifies CTR as both a mediator (positive transfer) and a confounder (negative transfer) in the relationship with dwell time. By applying counterfactual interventions at the feature level, ORCA creates scenarios where CTR signals are modified while keeping other features constant, allowing the model to learn dwell time patterns that are independent of CTR-mediated effects. The instance inverse-weighting mechanism then reduces the influence of examples where CTR strongly mediates dwell time prediction, effectively training the model to rely more on direct dwell time features rather than CTR-derived signals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal graphs**: Represent causal relationships between CTR and dwell time; needed to identify confounding paths and mediators; quick check: verify graph structure matches domain knowledge
- **Backdoor adjustment**: Statistical method to control for confounding variables; needed to isolate direct effects from mediated effects; quick check: ensure adjustment formula correctly accounts for all backdoor paths
- **Counterfactual intervention**: Hypothetical modification of features to break causal dependencies; needed to create training examples that reveal direct relationships; quick check: verify counterfactuals preserve feature plausibility
- **Instance inverse-weighting**: Reweighting scheme that reduces influence of mediator-heavy examples; needed to balance training signal between direct and mediated effects; quick check: monitor weight distribution for extreme values
- **Multi-task learning bias**: Tendency for models to over-rely on shared features; needed to understand why over-prediction occurs; quick check: analyze feature importance before and after intervention
- **Feature-level causality**: Understanding how individual features contribute to predictions; needed to implement targeted counterfactuals; quick check: validate feature modifications don't break domain constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input features -> Feature Encoder -> Task-Specific Heads (CTR, Dwell Time) -> Causal Decoupler (Counterfactual Intervention + Instance Weighting) -> Output Predictions

**Critical Path**: User features and item features → Shared representation learning → Task-specific heads for CTR and dwell time → Causal decoupler applies counterfactual intervention → Instance inverse-weighting adjusts training loss → Final predictions for both tasks

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades increased computational complexity during training (due to counterfactual generation and weighting) for improved prediction accuracy and reduced bias. The counterfactual intervention requires careful feature modification to maintain plausibility while breaking causal dependencies. The inverse-weighting scheme must balance between removing harmful bias and preserving useful shared information.

**Failure Signatures**: Over-aggressive counterfactual intervention may eliminate beneficial CTR signals, leading to degraded performance on both tasks. Insufficient weighting may fail to remove the confounding bias, resulting in continued under-prediction of moderate dwell times. Poor counterfactual generation may introduce artifacts that the model learns instead of genuine dwell time patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing counterfactual intervention to measure its isolated impact; 2) Sensitivity analysis of inverse-weighting parameters across different datasets; 3) Comparison of feature importance distributions before and after causal decoupling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Causal assumptions about CTR and dwell time relationships may not hold across all recommendation domains
- Computational overhead from counterfactual intervention and instance weighting could impact real-time deployment
- Method's effectiveness for other multi-task pairs beyond CTR and dwell time remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental methodology is rigorous with clear ablation studies and multi-dataset validation supporting the 10.6% improvement claim
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical foundation of causal decoupling is sound but practical implementation details may require domain-specific tuning
- **Medium confidence**: Dual improvement in both CTR and dwell time metrics is well-supported, but long-term system-wide effects remain unclear

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on weighting scheme sensitivity to determine robustness boundaries across different dataset characteristics
2. Cross-domain generalization test applying ORCA to fundamentally different multi-task scenarios like CTR and conversion rate prediction
3. Real-time performance evaluation measuring inference latency and computational overhead in production-like environments
