- Primary result: Introduces S-QUBED, the first uncertainty quantification method for video generation models, decomposing uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components with statistical significance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in video generation by introducing the first uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for video models. Video generation models currently cannot express when they are uncertain about their outputs, making it impossible to detect hallucinated or inaccurate content. The authors propose S-QUBED, a black-box method that generates multiple latent prompts from inputs and produces videos conditioned on each, then fits von Mises-Fisher distributions to estimate entropy-based uncertainty.

The method decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric (input ambiguity) and epistemic (model knowledge gaps) components, providing both a total uncertainty measure and insight into its sources. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that S-QUBED's total uncertainty estimates are negatively correlated with accuracy at high statistical significance levels, while effectively disentangling the two uncertainty types.

## Method Summary
S-QUBED introduces a novel black-box uncertainty quantification framework for video generation models. The method generates multiple latent prompts from the input using an auxiliary LLM, produces videos conditioned on each latent prompt, and fits von Mises-Fisher distributions to the resulting video embeddings. The entropy of these distributions provides uncertainty estimates, decomposed into aleatoric uncertainty (input ambiguity) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge gaps). The approach is model-agnostic and does not require access to model internals, making it applicable to both open and closed-source video generation systems.

## Key Results
- Total uncertainty estimates show negative correlation with accuracy at 99% significance for one dataset and 89.9% for another
- Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components are successfully disentangled with 94.5% and 98.3% statistical confidence respectively
- Introduces CLIP-based Kendall rank correlation as a new metric for evaluating video generation calibration
- Demonstrates effectiveness on two large-scale video datasets with significant statistical backing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
S-QUBED works by sampling the space of possible video generations given an input prompt. By generating multiple videos from diverse latent prompts, the method captures the inherent ambiguity in the input (aleatoric uncertainty) and the model's uncertainty about its knowledge (epistemic uncertainty). The von Mises-Fisher distribution fitting provides a principled way to estimate entropy from directional data in the embedding space. The decomposition is achieved by conditioning video generation on either the original input (capturing aleatoric uncertainty) or the latent space (capturing epistemic uncertainty).

## Foundational Learning
- **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**: The practice of estimating model confidence in predictions. Needed to detect when video models produce unreliable outputs. Quick check: Can the model identify inputs where it's likely to hallucinate?
- **Aleatoric vs Epistemic Uncertainty**: Aleatoric captures inherent input ambiguity, while epistemic reflects model knowledge gaps. Needed to understand whether uncertainty comes from unclear inputs or model limitations. Quick check: Does uncertainty decrease with clearer inputs or more training data?
- **von Mises-Fisher Distribution**: A probability distribution on directional data (unit vectors). Needed to model the distribution of video embeddings in high-dimensional space. Quick check: Does the distribution adequately capture the spread of generated videos?
- **CLIP Embeddings for Evaluation**: Using CLIP distance as a proxy for video accuracy. Needed because traditional metrics don't apply to video generation. Quick check: Does CLIP distance correlate with human judgments of video quality?
- **Black-box UQ Methods**: Approaches that don't require model internals. Needed for applicability to closed-source models. Quick check: Can the method work without access to model gradients or architecture?
- **Latent Space Sampling**: Generating diverse samples from model latent spaces. Needed to explore uncertainty comprehensively. Quick check: Are the sampled latents sufficiently diverse to capture uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Prompt → LLM → Multiple Latent Prompts → Video Model → Multiple Videos → CLIP Embeddings → von Mises-Fisher Fitting → Uncertainty Estimates

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves generating diverse latent prompts, producing corresponding videos, extracting CLIP embeddings, and fitting the von Mises-Fisher distribution. The most computationally expensive step is generating multiple full videos per prompt, which directly impacts the quality and stability of the uncertainty estimates.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Black-box approach vs. model-specific methods: Black-box enables broad applicability but may be less efficient than methods leveraging model internals
- Multiple video generation vs. computational cost: More samples improve uncertainty estimation but increase latency
- CLIP-based evaluation vs. ground truth: CLIP provides scalable evaluation but may not perfectly align with semantic accuracy
- von Mises-Fisher fitting vs. alternative distributions: Provides principled entropy estimation for directional data but may not capture all uncertainty patterns

**Failure Signatures:**
- High uncertainty assigned to high-quality videos (false positives)
- Low uncertainty assigned to hallucinated or incorrect videos (false negatives)
- Unstable uncertainty estimates across repeated runs
- Poor correlation between uncertainty and accuracy metrics
- Computational timeouts during multiple video generation

**3 First Experiments to Run:**
1. Generate videos from a diverse set of prompts with known ambiguity levels to validate aleatoric uncertainty detection
2. Compare S-QUBED uncertainty estimates against human quality ratings on a small validation set
3. Test the method on inputs designed to trigger known model failure modes (e.g., rare objects, complex scenes)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can epistemic uncertainty be estimated accurately by sampling in the video model's latent space rather than generating multiple full videos?
- Basis in paper: The authors identify the computational overhead of generating multiple videos as a limitation and explicitly propose exploring latent space sampling strategies as future work in Section 7.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation requires generating numerous videos per prompt to fit the von Mises-Fisher distribution, which is computationally expensive.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified S-QUBED implementation that operates on intermediate latents, demonstrating comparable Kendall rank correlation scores to the video-based method with reduced latency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the S-QUBED framework generalize to closed-source video models (e.g., Veo3) or autoregressive architectures given the current experimental reliance on a single diffusion model?
- Basis in paper: The experiments were restricted to the open-source Cosmos-Predict2 model because closed-source alternatives had prohibitive costs or rate limits (Section 5.1), leaving the method's efficacy on other architectures unverified.
- Why unresolved: The black-box design theoretically applies to any model, but the calibration and entropy decomposition rely on specific behaviors of the tested diffusion model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing statistically significant negative correlation between S-QUBED uncertainty and accuracy on diverse architectures like autoregressive or closed-source video generators.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the aleatoric uncertainty estimates to the choice of the auxiliary Large Language Model (LLM) used for latent prompt generation?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.1 relies on an external LLM to generate the distribution p(Z|ℓ), assuming it effectively models the input ambiguity, but does not ablate the impact of the LLM's own hallucinations or biases on the uncertainty calculation.
- Why unresolved: If the LLM fails to generate diverse latent prompts for vague inputs, the entropy h(Z|ℓ) may underestimate the true aleatoric uncertainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing aleatoric uncertainty estimates using different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 vs. smaller models) against the ground-truth vagueness of input prompts.

## Limitations
- CLIP-based evaluation may not perfectly correlate with semantic accuracy, particularly for creative or abstract video content
- Computational overhead of generating multiple videos per prompt limits practical deployment
- Limited validation on architectures beyond the tested diffusion model, leaving generalization uncertain
- No ground truth uncertainty validation, relying instead on proxy metrics

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: S-QUBED successfully decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components with statistical significance (94.5% and 98.3% confidence levels); The method produces uncertainty estimates that correlate with accuracy on tested datasets (99% and 89.9% significance levels); CLIP-based evaluation provides a reasonable proxy for video generation accuracy assessment

**Medium Confidence**: S-QUBED is the first UQ method specifically designed for video generation models; The proposed uncertainty decomposition effectively distinguishes between input ambiguity and model knowledge gaps; The von Mises-Fisher distribution fitting provides stable entropy estimates for video uncertainty

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies where human annotators rate video quality and compare these ratings against S-QUBED's uncertainty estimates to validate the CLIP-based correlation assumption.

2. Evaluate S-QUBED on multiple video generation architectures (e.g., GAN-based, diffusion-based, autoregressive) to assess its generalizability beyond text-to-video models.

3. Perform detailed analysis of false positives/negatives in uncertainty estimation, particularly examining cases where high uncertainty is assigned to high-quality videos and vice versa, to understand failure modes and limitations.
