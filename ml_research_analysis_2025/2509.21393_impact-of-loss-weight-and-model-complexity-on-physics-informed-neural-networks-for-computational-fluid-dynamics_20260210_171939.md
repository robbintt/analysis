# Impact of Loss Weight and Model Complexity on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21393
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21393
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PINNs achieve stable, accurate CFD predictions using dimensional analysis-based loss weighting, particularly for high-Peclet-number convection-diffusion problems

## Executive Summary
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free approach to solving PDEs but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. This study proposes two weighting schemes based on dimensional analysis—one balancing only quantifiable terms, the other also incorporating unquantifiable terms—to improve training stability and accuracy. Benchmarks on heat conduction, convection-diffusion, and lid-driven cavity flows show the second scheme consistently outperforms equal weighting, particularly in high-Peclet-number convection-diffusion where traditional solvers fail. PINNs with the proposed scheme achieve stable, accurate predictions, demonstrating robustness and generalizability in CFD applications.

## Method Summary
The study introduces two loss weighting schemes for PINNs based on dimensional analysis. The first scheme balances only quantifiable terms in the loss function using dimensional consistency, while the second scheme also incorporates unquantifiable terms. These approaches address the instability issues in PINN training caused by inappropriate loss weight selection. The methods are validated on benchmark CFD problems including heat conduction, convection-diffusion, and lid-driven cavity flows, with particular focus on high-Peclet-number cases where traditional solvers struggle.

## Key Results
- Dimensional analysis-based weighting schemes significantly improve PINN training stability compared to equal weighting
- The second weighting scheme (including unquantifiable terms) consistently outperforms the first scheme across all test cases
- PINNs with the proposed weighting handle high-Peclet-number convection-diffusion problems where traditional CFD solvers fail to converge
- The method demonstrates robust performance across multiple CFD benchmark problems with varying complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed weighting schemes work by addressing the fundamental imbalance in loss function terms that have different physical dimensions and magnitudes. By ensuring dimensional consistency in the weighted loss, the PINN training process can properly balance the contributions from different physical constraints (residuals, boundary conditions, initial conditions). The inclusion of unquantifiable terms in the second scheme further improves stability by accounting for subtle interactions that affect training dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Neural networks trained to satisfy PDEs and boundary conditions simultaneously - needed to understand the core methodology being improved
2. **Loss function weighting in PINNs**: How different terms in the composite loss function are balanced - critical for understanding the proposed improvements
3. **Dimensional analysis**: Using physical dimensions to guide mathematical formulations - key principle behind the proposed weighting schemes
4. **Convection-diffusion equations**: Fundamental PDEs in CFD that exhibit challenging behavior at high Peclet numbers - important for understanding benchmark problems
5. **Peclet number**: Dimensionless parameter indicating relative importance of convection vs diffusion - relevant for understanding high-Peclet-number challenges
6. **Mesh-free methods**: Numerical approaches that don't require grid discretization - context for PINNs as an alternative to traditional CFD

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
PINN Model -> Composite Loss Function -> Weighted Terms (Physical Residuals, BCs, ICs) -> Dimensional Analysis-based Weights -> Training Optimization

**Critical Path:**
Data generation → PINN initialization → Loss function construction → Dimensional analysis-based weighting → Training loop → Validation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Equal weighting: Simple to implement but unstable training
- First scheme: Better stability but may miss subtle interactions
- Second scheme: Best performance but requires more careful formulation

**Failure Signatures:**
- Training instability or divergence
- Poor convergence of residuals
- Inability to handle high-Peclet-number cases

**First Experiments:**
1. Heat conduction with varying thermal conductivity
2. Low-Peclet-number convection-diffusion
3. Lid-driven cavity flow with moderate Reynolds numbers
