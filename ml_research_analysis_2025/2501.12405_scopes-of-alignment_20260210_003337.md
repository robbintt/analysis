- Key outcome: Framework proposes expanding AI alignment beyond current focus on large language models and generic values to include three dimensions: competence (knowledge, skills, behaviors), transience (semantic vs episodic), and audience (mass, public, small-group, dyadic).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a three-dimensional framework for expanding the scope of AI alignment beyond current mainstream approaches. The authors argue that existing alignment efforts are overly focused on mass semantic alignment for behaviors, primarily through large language models aligned to generic values of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. They propose that alignment can be characterized across three dimensions: competence (the knowledge, skills, or behaviors needed), transience (whether alignment is based on general semantic information or specific episodic context), and audience (the scale and intimacy of the intended users). The framework aims to provide more precise specification of technical needs for alignment technologies and workflows.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than a specific technical methodology. The authors identify three dimensions for characterizing alignment scope: competence (knowledge, skills, behaviors), transience (semantic vs episodic), and audience (mass, public, small-group, dyadic). They analyze how current alignment approaches are limited to mass semantic alignment for behaviors and discuss how different combinations of these dimensions would require different technical approaches. The framework is intended to guide the development of more diverse and pluralistic alignment methodologies.

## Key Results
- Current AI alignment approaches are predominantly focused on mass semantic alignment for behaviors in large language models
- The three-dimensional framework (competence, transience, audience) provides a structured way to think about different alignment scopes
- Different alignment scopes require different technical approaches - for example, knowledge alignment benefits from question-answer pairs while skill alignment requires examples and repetition
- Small-group and dyadic alignment present unique challenges for capturing diverse perspectives and maintaining coherence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a structured way to think about alignment that moves beyond the current narrow focus. By explicitly considering competence, transience, and audience dimensions, it reveals the limitations of current approaches and points toward more diverse technical solutions. The mechanism relies on recognizing that different types of alignment tasks require different methodologies - knowledge alignment benefits from question-answer generation, skill alignment from examples and repetition, and behavior alignment from preference learning with scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Competence dimension (knowledge vs skills vs behaviors) - needed to determine appropriate data types and learning algorithms; quick check: identify whether target alignment involves declarative knowledge, procedural skills, or normative behaviors
- Transience dimension (semantic vs episodic) - needed to understand when alignment must be context-specific versus generalizable; quick check: determine if alignment should adapt to specific situations or apply broadly across contexts
- Audience dimension (mass vs public vs small-group vs dyadic) - needed to understand scale and diversity requirements; quick check: identify the intended scope of users and their relationship to each other
- Pluralistic alignment concept - needed to recognize that different groups may require different alignment approaches; quick check: assess whether a one-size-fits-all approach is appropriate for the use case
- Reflective equilibrium process - needed for determining appropriate alignment scope; quick check: engage stakeholders in iterative refinement of alignment goals

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Competence (knowledge, skills, behaviors) -> Transience (semantic, episodic) -> Audience (mass, public, small-group, dyadic) -> Technical approach selection
- Critical path: Define target competence → Identify appropriate transience → Determine audience scope → Select technical methodology → Implement alignment → Evaluate and refine
- Design tradeoffs: Mass alignment enables scalability but risks excluding minority perspectives; episodic alignment enables context-specificity but increases computational costs; dyadic alignment enables personalization but doesn't scale
- Failure signatures: Overgeneralization when mass semantic approaches are applied to small-group contexts; context-insensitivity when episodic information is ignored; cultural bias when alignment data lacks diversity
- First experiments: 1) Map existing alignment techniques to the three-dimensional framework to identify gaps, 2) Compare performance of knowledge vs skill vs behavior alignment approaches on the same task, 3) Test inference-time episodic alignment using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What systematic process can determine the appropriate alignment scope for a given application context?
- Basis in paper: "The discussion in this paper does not detail choosing the right scope of alignment, but such a process is clearly necessary. It may be a human-centered activity that aims for a reflective equilibrium..."
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes the three-dimensional framework but does not specify how practitioners should navigate it to select scopes for specific deployments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated methodology or decision procedure for scope selection, tested across diverse application domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What technical medium can effectively capture and represent the full diversity of human knowledge, skills, and behaviors for mass alignment?
- Basis in paper: "In the case of mass LLM alignment... the medium needs to somehow bring in the valued knowledge, skills, and behavior from all individuals, groups, communities, cultures, and publics... We do not know of any such effective medium."
- Why unresolved: Current approaches rely on limited data sources that systematically exclude many cultures and perspectives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a scalable mechanism that captures representative values across cultures without systematic exclusions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What data requirements and optimization algorithms are most effective for each competence type (knowledge, skills, behaviors)?
- Basis in paper: "Different competences of alignment may lead to different kinds of data requirements and optimization algorithms. Knowledge is often best learned by generating a lot of questions and answers... for skills, many examples and repetition is more effective. Behaviors are better learned as preferences supplemented with scenarios..."
- Why unresolved: These are preliminary observations; systematic empirical comparison of approaches across competence types remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing alignment methods across competence types with standardized evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can episodic alignment be efficiently implemented at inference time while maintaining model performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes episodic alignment "needs to be done at inference time based on the context" and suggests parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like adapters "applied on the fly," but does not address latency, computational, or quality tradeoffs.
- Why unresolved: Dynamic alignment at inference time introduces engineering constraints that current methods may not satisfy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks showing inference-time episodic alignment achieving acceptable latency and output quality across use cases.

## Limitations
- The characterization of current alignment approaches as predominantly mass semantic may not fully capture the diversity of existing research efforts
- The framework lacks concrete empirical validation or demonstration of how different technical approaches would map to different scope configurations
- The distinction between semantic and episodic transience, while theoretically interesting, may prove difficult to operationalize in practice
- The paper does not provide specific methodologies for practitioners to navigate the framework and select appropriate alignment scopes

## Confidence
High confidence in the conceptual clarity of the three-dimensional framework and its value for expanding thinking about alignment scope. Medium confidence in the characterization of current alignment limitations and the claim that this narrow focus constrains pluralistic alignment development. Low confidence in specific technical recommendations for different scope configurations due to lack of empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Empirical study mapping existing alignment techniques to the proposed scope framework to identify gaps and validate the claim about current limitations
2. Case studies of real-world alignment scenarios (e.g., medical AI, educational AI, personal AI assistants) using the framework to assess its practical utility
3. Technical feasibility analysis of developing distinct alignment approaches for different scope configurations, particularly for small-group and dyadic audience types
