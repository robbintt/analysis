# AI-Powered Assistant for Long-Term Access to RHIC Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09688
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: RAG-enhanced models outperform commercial LLMs for scientific queries using proprietary RHIC documentation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an AI-powered assistant system for preserving and accessing scientific knowledge from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiments. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) wrapper to enable natural language queries across heterogeneous RHIC documentation. A custom web scraping framework extracts content from various formats (HTML, PDF, Office documents) to build a searchable knowledge base. The assistant provides domain-specific responses with access to proprietary and unpublished data through fine-grained role-based access controls.

## Method Summary
The system employs a custom web scraping framework to extract content from heterogeneous sources (HTML, PDF, PS, Office documents) and stores it in a vector database (ChromaDB). When users submit queries, the MCP wrapper retrieves relevant context from the vector store and passes it to an LLM inference engine (vLLM or LlamaCpp). The RAG pipeline grounds responses in RHIC-specific documentation, including internal collaboration mailing lists inaccessible to commercial LLMs. The architecture separates orchestration logic from execution through MCP, enabling flexible deployment across different backends.

## Key Results
- RAG-enhanced models outperform commercial LLMs for scientific queries, particularly when accessing internal collaboration resources
- vLLM inference engine maintains high GPU utilization (>80%) with multi-GPU scaling, while LlamaCpp shows dramatic utilization drops
- The system provides domain-specific responses with access to proprietary and unpublished data through fine-grained role-based access controls

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RAG enables superior response accuracy for domain-specific scientific queries by grounding LLM reasoning in proprietary local data
- Mechanism: The system embeds heterogeneous RHIC documents into a vector database. User queries trigger semantic retrieval of relevant chunks, which are injected into the LLM context window, forcing the model to synthesize answers based on specific, non-public text
- Core assumption: The semantic embedding space effectively captures the meaning of technical jargon and informal scientific discourse
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] Mentions the system "indexes structured and unstructured content... enabling domain-adapted interaction." [section 4] States the "primary differentiator... emerged from its ability to incorporate private, unpublished information... specifically... context from internal collaboration mailing lists."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MCP wrapper separates orchestration logic from execution, enabling reproducible and flexible multi-backend inference
- Mechanism: MCP decorates requests with a JSON header defining the "context graph" (retrieval, summarization, inference). A dispatcher uses this graph to route tasks to specific backends while maintaining a traceable reasoning chain
- Core assumption: The overhead of the MCP orchestration layer is negligible compared to the latency of inference and retrieval
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] Describes MCP as exposing "each logical step... as composable 'contexts'" and separating "execution logic... from deployment target."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Specialized inference engines (specifically vLLM) provide superior throughput scaling for multi-GPU deployments compared to memory-centric engines like LlamaCpp
- Mechanism: vLLM optimizes for parallelization, maintaining high GPU utilization (>80%) as GPU count increases, whereas LlamaCpp distributes memory across GPUs, causing compute utilization to drop
- Core assumption: The workload is throughput-bound rather than single-request latency-bound
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] Figure 3.1 analysis shows vLLM throughput "consistently increases with the addition of GPUs" while LlamaCpp shows "dramatic decrease in resource utilization."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: This is the core technique allowing the AI to "know" about RHIC specific data without requiring the massive cost of retraining the base model
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why simply feeding a document into a standard LLM chat interface is different from a RAG system?

- **Concept**: Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search
  - Why needed here: The system relies on ChromaDB to match natural language questions with technical text based on semantic meaning rather than keyword matching
  - Quick check question: How does a vector database handle a query for "space charge effects" if the document only mentions "beam dynamics distortion"?

- **Concept**: Inference Engines & GPU Utilization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the trade-offs between engines (vLLM vs. LlamaCpp) is critical for deploying the system cost-effectively at scale
  - Quick check question: Why would high GPU memory usage with low compute utilization be a problem for a multi-user chat service?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Custom Web Scraper -> Embedding Pipeline -> ChromaDB -> MCP Wrapper (FastAPI) -> Inference Engine (vLLM/LlamaCpp) -> User
- **Critical path**: The quality of the Recursive Multi-Format Web-Content Extraction Framework is the rate-limiting step. If PDF-to-Markdown conversion fails, the knowledge base will be incomplete
- **Design tradeoffs**: vLLM vs. LlamaCpp. The team chose vLLM for multi-GPU production to maximize throughput/efficiency, trading off potentially higher single-request speed of LlamaCpp
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Pedagogical/Verbose answers without citations: Indicates the system is falling back to the base model's internal knowledge rather than the RAG pipeline
  - High GPU memory but low utilization (21%): Indicates the wrong inference engine (e.g., LlamaCpp) is configured for a multi-GPU setup
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Query the system for a known fact from a recent (post-cutoff) internal mailing list to verify the "freshness" of the ingestion pipeline
  2. Monitor GPU utilization metrics while simulating concurrent user load to validate the vLLM scaling behavior claimed in Section 3.2
  3. Inspect the MCP JSON headers on a sample request to confirm the "context graph" is correctly attaching ChromaDB documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a formal, multi-dimensional benchmark systematically quantify the qualitative advantages of RAG-enhanced models over commercial LLMs in scientific contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the "development of a formal, multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark... is currently in progress," noting current evaluations are qualitative
- Why unresolved: The paper currently relies on expert visual comparison rather than systematic, automated metrics
- What evidence would resolve it: A published benchmark suite providing quantitative scores for factual accuracy and relevance that correlate with expert judgment

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do independent LLM judges align with human domain experts when evaluating scientific responses using structured prompts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will deploy independent LLM judges using structured prompts... to assess outputs across factual accuracy, completeness, relevance, and clarity dimensions."
- Why unresolved: The system currently lacks automated evaluation, relying solely on human specialists for validation
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical correlation data comparing LLM judge scores against the established ground truth of domain experts

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the ingestion framework be evolved to support authentication and asynchronous I/O for protected institutional resources without sacrificing access etiquette?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "The web scraping framework requires enhancement for scalability, fault tolerance, and authentication support for protected institutional resources."
- Why unresolved: The current framework cannot access content behind authentication walls, limiting the completeness of the knowledge base
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful ingestion statistics from authenticated sessions showing improved throughput and fault tolerance

## Limitations

- The system's primary advantage—access to proprietary internal collaboration mailing lists—cannot be validated by external reviewers due to access restrictions
- Critical implementation details remain underspecified, including chunking strategy for RAG, embedding model configuration, and complete MCP orchestration graph structure
- Limited evidence regarding performance across diverse scientific domains or different types of collaborative research environments

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The RAG architecture effectively grounds responses in local document collections
- The vLLM inference engine demonstrates superior throughput scaling for multi-GPU deployments
- The MCP wrapper successfully separates orchestration logic from execution

**Medium Confidence**:
- The system outperforms commercial LLMs specifically for internal scientific queries
- The custom scraper framework handles heterogeneous document formats reliably
- Role-based access controls effectively protect proprietary data

**Low Confidence**:
- Cost-effectiveness relative to commercial APIs (based on qualitative assessment only)
- Performance metrics for LlamaCpp vs vLLM (single datapoint from controlled experiment)
- Long-term knowledge preservation capabilities (system described as "early-stage")

## Next Checks

1. **RAG Retrieval Accuracy Test**: Conduct blind comparison between RAG-enhanced responses and commercial LLM responses for a set of domain-specific technical questions where ground truth exists in public documentation. Measure citation accuracy and hallucination rates.

2. **Multi-Format Extraction Validation**: Systematically test the Recursive Multi-Format Web-Content Extraction Framework on a diverse corpus of scientific documents (LaTeX, legacy PS files, complex tables in PDFs). Quantify extraction accuracy and identify failure modes.

3. **Access Control Penetration Test**: Perform security audit of the role-based access control system by attempting to access restricted content through various authentication vectors. Document any privilege escalation vulnerabilities or data leakage paths.
