# From Claims to Evidence: A Unified Framework and Critical Analysis of CNN vs. Transformer vs. Mamba in Medical Image Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01306
- Reference count: 25
- CNN-based models remain most efficient in speed and accuracy for medical image segmentation

## Executive Summary
This study introduces nnUZoo, a benchmarking framework for comparing CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based models in medical image segmentation. The research evaluates five newly proposed X2Net architectures alongside established models like nnUNet, UNETR, and SwinTransformer across six diverse medical imaging datasets. The findings reveal that while CNN-based models maintain superior efficiency, Mamba architectures show competitive accuracy with fewer parameters but require significantly longer training times. The study emphasizes the need for dynamic architectures that adapt to imaging modalities and hardware constraints, suggesting future exploration of self-supervised pre-training for Transformer and Mamba-based models.

## Method Summary
The study employs nnUZoo as a unified benchmarking framework to systematically compare CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based architectures in medical image segmentation. Five newly proposed X2Net architectures were evaluated alongside established models including nnUNet, UNETR, and SwinTransformer across six diverse medical imaging datasets. The evaluation focused on both efficiency metrics (speed and parameters) and accuracy performance, with particular attention to computational costs and training requirements for each architecture type.

## Key Results
- CNN-based models (nnUNet and U2Net) demonstrate superior efficiency in both speed and accuracy
- Transformer models show effectiveness for specific modalities but suffer from high computational costs
- Mamba-based architectures, particularly SS2D2Net, achieve competitive accuracy with fewer parameters but require significantly longer training times

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that different architectural approaches offer distinct trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy in medical image segmentation. CNN-based models leverage localized feature extraction through convolutional operations, providing computational efficiency and strong performance across diverse modalities. Transformer models utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which proves beneficial for certain imaging types despite higher computational costs. Mamba architectures introduce selective state spaces that reduce parameter counts while maintaining competitive accuracy, though at the expense of training time.

## Foundational Learning
1. **CNN-based architectures**: Use convolutional operations for localized feature extraction; needed for computational efficiency and strong baseline performance; quick check: verify receptive field sizes match anatomical structures
2. **Transformer mechanisms**: Employ self-attention for long-range dependency capture; needed for complex spatial relationships in medical images; quick check: assess attention map quality for anatomical boundaries
3. **Mamba selective state spaces**: Utilize selective state space models to reduce parameters; needed for parameter-efficient architectures; quick check: validate state space dynamics match segmentation requirements
4. **Multi-modality adaptation**: Different architectures perform variably across imaging types; needed for clinical applicability; quick check: compare performance across CT, MRI, and ultrasound datasets
5. **Computational efficiency metrics**: Balance between accuracy and resource requirements; needed for practical deployment; quick check: benchmark on target hardware configurations
6. **Benchmarking framework design**: Systematic comparison across architectures; needed for objective evaluation; quick check: ensure consistent evaluation protocols across all models

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input → Preprocessing → Backbone (CNN/Transformer/Mamba) → Decoder → Postprocessing → Output

**Critical Path**: Backbone selection → Feature extraction strategy → Decoder design → Computational optimization

**Design Tradeoffs**: CNN offers speed vs Transformer provides context awareness vs Mamba balances parameters with training time

**Failure Signatures**: CNN may miss long-range dependencies, Transformer suffers from high computational cost, Mamba requires extended training periods

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline performance comparison across all architectures on a single modality
2. Efficiency benchmarking on target hardware configurations
3. Ablation study isolating the impact of attention mechanisms vs convolutional operations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study identifies several open questions for future research, including the potential benefits of self-supervised pre-training for Transformer and Mamba-based models, the need for dynamic architectures that can adapt to different imaging modalities and hardware constraints, and the exploration of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different architectural paradigms. The authors also highlight the importance of investigating practical deployment scenarios, particularly addressing the long training times required by Mamba architectures.

## Limitations
- Computational cost comparisons may vary across different hardware configurations
- Study focuses on specific datasets and architectures, potentially limiting broader applicability
- Long training times for Mamba-based models raise practical deployment concerns

## Confidence
- CNN efficiency claims: Medium confidence (hardware dependency variations)
- Transformer effectiveness for certain modalities: High confidence (established research support)
- Mamba performance comparison: Medium confidence (limited testing environments)

## Next Checks
1. Cross-platform performance validation across different GPU configurations to verify efficiency claims
2. Extended testing on additional medical imaging modalities to assess model generalizability
3. Investigation of self-supervised pre-training impacts on Transformer and Mamba-based models' performance
