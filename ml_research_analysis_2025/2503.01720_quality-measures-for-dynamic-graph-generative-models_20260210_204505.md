# Quality Measures for Dynamic Graph Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01720
- Reference count: 22
- Unified metric for CTDG evaluation with fidelity (0.988-1.000), diversity (0.915-1.000), sample efficiency (3 events), and computational efficiency (1.05s/100 events)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of evaluating generative models for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs), which evolve over time with changing topology and node features. Traditional evaluation metrics fail to provide a unified measure that captures both structural and feature changes while remaining computationally tractable for large-scale graphs. The authors propose a novel metric based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma that transforms dynamic graph data into fixed-dimensional representations using random projections, enabling efficient comparison of both topology and features.

The proposed approach overcomes three key limitations of existing methods: treating temporal events as independent samples, lacking unified measures sensitive to both topology and features, and requiring impractical runtime for large-scale graphs. The metric demonstrates superior performance across four key properties—fidelity, diversity, sample efficiency, and computational efficiency—while maintaining practical efficiency for real-world evaluation tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified evaluation metric for CTDGs using Johnson-Lindenstrauss random projections. The method transforms dynamic graph data into fixed-dimensional representations through a two-stage projection process: first projecting node embeddings (W1) and then projecting descriptors (W2) that capture both topology and features. The approach uses structured random matrices with Hadamard transforms and Rademacher diagonal matrices for efficient computation. Min-max normalization is applied to timestamps and features before projection, and final comparison is performed using cosine distance on Frobenius inner products.

The evaluation is conducted on four Jodie datasets (Reddit, Wikipedia, LastFM, MOOC) truncated to 1,000 interactions each, plus a synthetic Grid dataset. Perturbation schemes test fidelity (edge rewiring, time perturbation, event permutation), while diversity experiments use TGN clustering for mode dropping and collapse. The metric is benchmarked against baseline snapshot metrics and evaluated for sample efficiency and computational runtime.

## Key Results
- Superior fidelity with Spearman correlation of 0.988-1.000 for edge rewiring, 0.944 for time perturbation, and 0.988 for feature perturbation
- Strong diversity performance with correlation of 0.915-1.000 for mode dropping and collapse detection
- High sample efficiency requiring only 3 events for reliable evaluation
- Excellent computational efficiency at 1.05 seconds per 100 events compared to 3-20 seconds for baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric works by leveraging the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to preserve similarity between dynamic graph events in lower-dimensional space. Random projections compress the high-dimensional temporal graph data while maintaining the essential geometric relationships between events. The two-stage projection approach separates node-level and graph-level features, allowing the metric to capture both local topological changes and global temporal patterns. By using structured random matrices with Hadamard transforms, the method achieves computational efficiency while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of random projection for preserving pairwise distances.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma**: Mathematical guarantee that random projections preserve pairwise distances with high probability. Needed for theoretical foundation of dimensionality reduction approach. Quick check: Verify projection preserves distances within (1±ε) factor for sample dataset.

2. **Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs)**: Graph structures evolving continuously over time with events as (source, destination, timestamp, features). Needed for understanding the temporal nature of data being evaluated. Quick check: Confirm event format c(ti) = (src, dst, ti, esrc,dst(ti)) is correctly implemented.

3. **Structured Random Matrices**: Using Hadamard transforms with Rademacher diagonal matrices for efficient computation. Needed to achieve computational efficiency while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Quick check: Verify matrix dimensions M=max events per node and Z=max nodes across graphs.

4. **Min-Max Normalization**: Independent scaling of timestamps and feature channels to [0,1]. Needed to prevent feature magnitude dominance in projection space. Quick check: Confirm all features are independently scaled before projection.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Events -> Node Embeddings (W1) -> Descriptors -> Graph Embedding (W2) -> Cosine Distance

Critical path: Data preprocessing → Structured random matrix generation → Two-stage projection → Similarity computation

Design tradeoffs: Dimensionality reduction vs. information preservation (solved via JL lemma), computational efficiency vs. accuracy (structured matrices), unified measure vs. separate topology/feature metrics (integrated projection).

Failure signatures: Dimension mismatch in projection matrices, incorrect normalization causing feature dominance, computational bottlenecks in Hadamard transforms.

First experiments:
1. Verify projection preserves distances within theoretical bounds on synthetic dataset
2. Test normalization by comparing feature distributions before/after scaling
3. Benchmark computational efficiency on small dataset vs. baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unknown random seed values affecting reproducibility of perturbation experiments
- Unclear Nyquist rate computation for baseline snapshot metrics
- Ambiguous grid search stopping criterion beyond performance stagnation

## Confidence

High confidence in Johnson-Lindenstrauss framework and theoretical justification
Medium confidence in empirical performance claims due to missing random seed details
Medium confidence in diversity experiments dependent on unspecified TGN parameters

## Next Checks

1. Implement exact random seed specification (10 seeds) and rerun all perturbation experiments to verify reported Spearman correlations (0.988-1.000 for edge rewiring, 0.944 for time perturbation, 0.988 for feature perturbation)

2. Reconstruct Nyquist rate calculation method for each dataset and verify baseline snapshot metric results match reported computational efficiency (1.05s per 100 events vs 3-20s for baselines)

3. Validate min-max normalization procedure by checking timestamps and all feature channels are independently scaled to [0,1] before random projection, and verify embedding dimensions match (n=100, o=100)
