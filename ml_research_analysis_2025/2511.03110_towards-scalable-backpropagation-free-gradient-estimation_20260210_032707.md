- Primary result: Introduces ˜W ⊥ method for scalable gradient estimation that reduces bias and variance by orthogonalizing upstream Jacobian matrices

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling gradient estimation methods beyond small neural networks, which struggle due to high variance when using forward-mode automatic differentiation. The authors introduce the ˜W ⊥ method, which reduces both bias and variance by orthogonalizing the upstream Jacobian matrix when computing guess directions for gradient estimation. The method exploits the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients by projecting them onto a carefully chosen subspace.

## Method Summary
The ˜W ⊥ method introduces a novel approach to gradient estimation that addresses the variance explosion problem in backpropagation-free methods. It works by computing the singular value decomposition of the upstream Jacobian matrix and projecting it onto an orthonormal, low-rank form. This orthogonalization process effectively narrows the guessing space while maintaining better alignment with the true gradient. The authors also propose a variant called ˜W ⊥-NS that accelerates the orthogonalization using Newton-Schulz iterations, and introduce a preconditioning method (˜W P) for comparison. The key insight is that by exploiting the low-rank structure of neural network gradients, the method can achieve more stable and accurate gradient estimates.

## Key Results
- Achieved training accuracy of 0.581 on MNIST-1D with 512-width layers compared to 0.486 for baseline ˜W T method
- Demonstrated that smaller values of k (controlling subspace dimension) perform best due to variance reduction
- Showed that bias reduction comes from better alignment with gradient's low-rank structure rather than just covariance matrix manipulation
- ˜W ⊥-NS variant provides accelerated orthogonalization using Newton-Schulz iterations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the inherent low-rank structure of neural network gradients. When computing gradients in backpropagation-free methods, the upstream Jacobian matrix captures how small changes in parameters affect the loss. By performing singular value decomposition and projecting onto an orthonormal basis, ˜W ⊥ effectively reduces the dimensionality of the guessing space while maintaining critical directional information. The orthogonalization ensures that the guess directions are not correlated, which reduces variance in the final gradient estimate. The Newton-Schulz iteration variant accelerates this process while maintaining numerical stability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Forward-mode automatic differentiation**: Needed to understand the baseline approach that suffers from variance explosion; quick check: verify that dual numbers are used for gradient computation
- **Jacobian matrix properties**: Essential for understanding how parameter changes affect loss; quick check: confirm that upstream Jacobian captures local sensitivity
- **Singular value decomposition**: Critical for the orthogonalization technique; quick check: verify that SVD provides optimal low-rank approximation
- **Newton-Schulz iterations**: Used for accelerated matrix orthogonalization; quick check: confirm convergence properties for the specific matrix structure
- **Variance reduction techniques**: Important for understanding why the method outperforms baselines; quick check: verify that orthogonalization reduces correlation between guess directions
- **Low-rank matrix approximation**: Key to understanding how the method exploits neural network gradient structure; quick check: confirm that gradients indeed have low effective dimensionality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input data → Forward pass → Upstream Jacobian computation → SVD → Orthonormal projection → Gradient estimate

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves computing the upstream Jacobian matrix, performing SVD, projecting onto the orthonormal basis, and computing the final gradient estimate. The SVD step is computationally intensive but can be accelerated with Newton-Schulz iterations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (SVD is expensive) for reduced variance and bias. The choice of k (subspace dimension) involves a bias-variance tradeoff - smaller k reduces variance but may increase bias. The Newton-Schulz variant trades some numerical precision for speed.

**Failure Signatures**: If the gradient estimates show high variance, it may indicate insufficient orthogonalization or inappropriate choice of k. If bias is high, the subspace dimension may be too restrictive. Numerical instability in Newton-Schulz iterations could indicate ill-conditioned matrices.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify gradient estimation accuracy on simple linear regression with known gradients
2. Compare variance of gradient estimates across different values of k on a small MLP
3. Test convergence speed of Newton-Schulz iterations versus direct SVD on typical Jacobian matrices

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope limited to simple 1D MNIST dataset with MLPs, raising questions about generalizability
- No theoretical analysis of variance reduction properties or bias guarantees provided
- Limited comparison to other gradient estimation methods with only single baseline
- Critical hyperparameters (particularly k) lack clear guidance for selection

- Scalability claims: Low
- Comparison to alternatives: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on standard vision datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) with deeper architectures to assess scalability claims
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of rank reduction versus other components (e.g., orthogonalization)
3. Perform theoretical analysis deriving variance bounds for the proposed method compared to baselines
