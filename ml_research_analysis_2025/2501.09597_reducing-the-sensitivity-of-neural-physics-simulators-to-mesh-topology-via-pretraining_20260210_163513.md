# Reducing the Sensitivity of Neural Physics Simulators to Mesh Topology via Pretraining

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.09597
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09597
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Pretraining mesh embedding models using an autoencoder objective on large mesh datasets (like Shapenet) reduces sensitivity of neural simulators to mesh topology variations, achieving Simple MSE of 58.2, Complex MSE of 164.1, and Variation MSE of 125.6

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in neural network-based physics simulators: their sensitivity to variations in mesh topology. The authors demonstrate that different mesh representations of the same object can significantly degrade simulator performance, particularly in radar simulation tasks. To mitigate this issue, they propose a pretraining approach where mesh embedding models are first trained using an autoencoder objective on large mesh datasets such as Shapenet. This pretraining strategy enables the neural simulators to learn more robust representations that are less sensitive to topological variations in the input meshes.

The evaluation shows that pretraining with graph embedding models and an autoencoder task substantially reduces the sensitivity of neural simulators to mesh topology changes. The authors introduce the Basic Shapes dataset to facilitate systematic analysis of mesh topology sensitivity in physics simulation tasks. Their results indicate that the best-performing model achieved improved robustness compared to models without pretraining, with specific performance metrics showing reduced error across different mesh variations.

## Method Summary
The core methodology involves pretraining mesh embedding models using an autoencoder objective on large-scale mesh datasets like Shapenet. The autoencoder learns to reconstruct mesh geometry from its encoded representation, forcing the model to capture essential structural features that are invariant to topological variations. After pretraining, these learned embeddings are used as inputs to physics simulators, which are then fine-tuned on specific simulation tasks. The approach leverages graph neural networks to process mesh structures, treating vertices and edges as nodes and connections in a graph. The Basic Shapes dataset was introduced to systematically evaluate sensitivity to mesh topology by providing controlled variations of the same underlying geometry.

## Key Results
- Pretrained models achieved Simple MSE of 58.2, Complex MSE of 164.1, and Variation MSE of 125.6
- Pretraining with graph embedding models and autoencoder tasks reduced sensitivity to mesh topology variations
- The Basic Shapes dataset enabled systematic analysis of mesh topology sensitivity in physics simulations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works because autoencoder pretraining forces the model to learn representations that capture essential geometric features while discarding superficial topological differences. By reconstructing meshes from their encoded representations during pretraining, the model learns to identify and preserve invariant structural properties that matter for physics simulation while becoming robust to variations in how the same geometry is represented as a mesh. This learned invariance transfers to the downstream physics simulation task, where the model can now handle different mesh topologies of the same object more effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks:** Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data, essential for processing mesh topologies. Why needed: Meshes are naturally represented as graphs with vertices and edges. Quick check: Verify the model correctly propagates information across mesh connections.
- **Autoencoder Architecture:** Neural networks trained to reconstruct their input through a compressed latent representation. Why needed: Forces learning of invariant features by requiring reconstruction from compressed form. Quick check: Ensure reconstruction loss decreases during pretraining.
- **Mesh Topology:** The connectivity pattern of vertices and edges in a 3D mesh representation. Why needed: Different topologies can represent the same geometry but affect simulator performance differently. Quick check: Compare multiple mesh representations of identical objects.
- **Physics Simulation:** Computational methods for modeling physical phenomena like electromagnetic wave propagation. Why needed: The ultimate application domain where topology sensitivity manifests. Quick check: Validate simulator outputs against known physical principles.
- **Shapenet Dataset:** Large-scale dataset of 3D shapes used for pretraining. Why needed: Provides diverse mesh examples for learning robust representations. Quick check: Verify dataset diversity covers relevant mesh variations.
- **Basic Shapes Dataset:** Curated dataset for analyzing mesh topology sensitivity. Why needed: Enables controlled experiments with systematic topology variations. Quick check: Confirm dataset includes intended topology variations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**

**Critical Path:**
Input mesh → Graph embedding extraction → Pretrained autoencoder encoding → Physics simulation → Output prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational cost of pretraining vs. runtime performance gains
- Dataset diversity vs. pretraining efficiency
- Model complexity vs. generalization to new mesh topologies
- Reconstruction accuracy vs. simulation accuracy
