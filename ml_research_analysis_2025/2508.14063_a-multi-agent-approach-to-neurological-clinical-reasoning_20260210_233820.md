# A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.14063
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Multi-agent framework improves neurological clinical reasoning accuracy from 69.5% to 89.2% for LLaMA 3.3-70B on board certification questions

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models for neurological clinical reasoning using a comprehensive benchmark of 305 board certification questions across 13 subspecialties. The research compares base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent framework that decomposes reasoning into specialized cognitive functions. Results show that while OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), the multi-agent approach dramatically improved performance for mid-range models, particularly LLaMA 3.3-70B, which increased from 69.5% to 89.2% accuracy. The framework also transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence across all complexity levels.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated large language models on a comprehensive benchmark of 305 neurological board certification questions classified by three dimensions of complexity: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. Models were assessed in three configurations: base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent framework that decomposes reasoning into specialized cognitive functions. The multi-agent approach consists of distinct agents for symptom analysis, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning, coordinated through a central reasoning agent. Performance was validated on an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases, with accuracy measured across all complexity levels.

## Key Results
- OpenAI-o1 achieved highest base performance at 90.9% accuracy across all complexity levels
- Multi-agent framework improved LLaMA 3.3-70B accuracy from 69.5% to 89.2%
- Most substantial gains observed on level 3 complexity questions requiring integration of multiple clinical concepts
- Framework transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence across all 13 subspecialties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent framework succeeds by decomposing complex clinical reasoning into specialized cognitive functions that mirror expert neurologist workflows. Each agent focuses on a specific reasoning task (symptom analysis, differential diagnosis, treatment planning) while a central coordinator manages the integration of these components. This modular approach allows the system to handle increasing complexity by distributing cognitive load across specialized agents rather than requiring a single model to perform all reasoning tasks simultaneously. The framework also incorporates iterative refinement through feedback loops between agents, enabling progressive improvement in reasoning quality.

## Foundational Learning

**Clinical Reasoning Complexity** - Understanding how neurological diagnosis involves multiple cognitive layers from basic factual knowledge to complex pattern recognition and probabilistic reasoning.
*Why needed:* Provides framework for evaluating model performance across different reasoning demands
*Quick check:* Can the model correctly answer simple factual questions before attempting complex differential diagnoses?

**Multi-Agent System Design** - Knowledge of how autonomous agents can be coordinated to solve complex problems through specialized sub-tasks.
*Why needed:* Enables decomposition of clinical reasoning into manageable cognitive components
*Quick check:* Do individual agents perform their specialized tasks accurately before integration?

**Medical Knowledge Retrieval** - Understanding how to effectively access and integrate medical literature and guidelines into clinical reasoning processes.
*Why needed:* RAG components require understanding of medical knowledge organization and retrieval
*Quick check:* Can the system retrieve relevant medical information when presented with specific clinical scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Central reasoning agent -> Symptom analysis agent -> Differential diagnosis agent -> Treatment planning agent -> Feedback loop

**Critical Path:** Clinical case input → Symptom analysis → Differential diagnosis generation → Treatment planning → Central agent verification → Final answer output

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes accuracy over speed, with multiple agent interactions increasing computational cost but improving reasoning quality. Specialization allows handling of complex cases but requires careful coordination to prevent conflicting outputs.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Symptom analysis agent misses key clinical features
- Differential diagnosis agent generates incomplete or incorrect diagnosis lists
- Treatment planning agent suggests inappropriate interventions
- Central coordinator fails to integrate agent outputs effectively
- Feedback loops create infinite cycles without convergence

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate individual agent performance on isolated tasks before integration
2. Test framework on progressively complex case scenarios to identify failure points
3. Compare multi-agent performance against single-model approaches on identical cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on board certification-style questions that may not represent real-world clinical complexity
- Focus on closed-book, multiple-choice format questions potentially underestimates open-ended clinical decision-making challenges
- Independent validation dataset (155 cases) is relatively small compared to primary benchmark (305 questions)

## Confidence
- **High** for base model performance comparisons across different models and complexity levels
- **Medium** for multi-agent framework effectiveness, particularly for mid-tier models and complex question types
- **Low** for framework performance in actual clinical settings due to artificial evaluation format and lack of patient outcome data

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the multi-agent framework on real-world clinical cases with open-ended responses and patient outcomes
2. Test framework performance across different medical specialties beyond neurology to assess generalizability
3. Conduct comparative study between multi-agent reasoning and experienced neurologists on identical clinical cases to establish practical clinical value
