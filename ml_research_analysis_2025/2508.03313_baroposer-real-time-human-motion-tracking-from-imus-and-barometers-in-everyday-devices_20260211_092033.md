# BaroPoser: Real-time Human Motion Tracking from IMUs and Barometers in Everyday Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03313
- Authors: Libo Zhang; Xinyu Yi; Feng Xu
- Reference count: 39
- Achieves up to 3.4° improvement in angular error and 2.8 cm in positional error over IMU-only methods

## Executive Summary
BaroPoser introduces a real-time human motion tracking system that leverages sparse IMUs and barometers from everyday devices like smartphones and smartwatches. The method addresses the limitations of IMU-only tracking by introducing a thigh-rooted local coordinate frame and incorporating barometric height measurements. This allows the system to accurately track full-body poses and global translations, including vertical motion, in everyday scenarios where traditional methods struggle with sparse sensors.

## Method Summary
BaroPoser transforms sensor inputs from a smartphone (thigh) and smartwatch (wrist) into a local thigh-rooted coordinate frame, decoupling global orientation from local pose. It incorporates barometric height differences between sensors as an additional geometric constraint to improve pose estimation accuracy, particularly for motions involving height changes. For translation, it uses a hybrid approach: an LSTM predicts horizontal velocity while barometric height provides direct vertical translation after filtering out local body movement effects.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art IMU-only methods by up to 3.4° in angular error and 2.8 cm in positional error
- Enables accurate global translation estimation including vertical motion on non-flat terrain
- Achieves real-time performance with unidirectional LSTMs for causality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Thigh-Rooted Local Coordinate Frame
By transforming sensor inputs into a local "thigh-rooted" coordinate frame, the system decouples global orientation from local pose learning. The smartphone in the thigh pocket serves as a stable root origin, allowing the model to learn relative joint angles independent of the user's global facing direction. This prevents the network from having to learn the same pose in infinite rotational variations.

### Mechanism 2: Barometric Height as Geometric Constraint
Sparse IMUs lack geometric constraints to distinguish between poses like squats versus sitting. By calculating the relative height between wrist and thigh sensors and feeding this into the pose network, the model gains an explicit distance signal that constrains possible skeletal configurations. This reduces kinematic ambiguity, particularly in the vertical axis.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Translation Decomposition
Instead of relying solely on inertial integration (which drifts) or contact-based heuristics, BaroPoser calculates vertical translation directly from filtered barometric height of the thigh, subtracting local body movement. Horizontal velocity is regressed by an LSTM. This hybrid approach improves global translation accuracy on non-flat terrain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inertial Integration Drift** - Understanding why IMUs drift (noise accumulation) is essential to see why Kalman filtering and barometer corrections are necessary. Quick check: If you double-integrate an accelerometer signal with a bias of 0.01 m/s², how does the error grow over 60 seconds?

- **Concept: Coordinate Frame Transformations (SO(3))** - The core innovation moves data from a global frame to a "thigh-local" frame. You must understand rotation matrices (R^T) to interpret Equations 2–6. Quick check: If the "root" rotates 90° left, how should the wrist's global rotation be transformed to appear static in the local frame?

- **Concept: Kalman Filtering for Sensor Fusion** - Barometers are noisy. The paper uses a Kalman filter to fuse barometric pressure with IMU data for stable height. Quick check: In a 1D Kalman filter fusing a barometer (noisy absolute) and accelerometer (drifty relative), which sensor drives the high-frequency response and which corrects the long-term drift?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (IMUs + Barometers) -> Pre-processing (Kalman Filter + Calibration) -> Localizer (Thigh-Root Transformation) -> Pose Estimator (LSTM + MLP) -> Translation Estimator (Hybrid approach)

- **Critical path:** The Sensor Calibration and Thigh-Root Transformation are the most fragile parts. If calibration is wrong, Δh is noise. If the local frame is wrong, the LSTM learns garbage.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed placement (wrist + thigh) limits generalizability. Unidirectional LSTM chosen for real-time causality, sacrificing smoothing benefit of bidirectional models for lower latency.

- **Failure signatures:** "Sinking" avatar indicates vertical drift (Kalman filter tuning issue). Spinning root suggests local frame calculation failure. Stair-induced jitter indicates height-difference feature overpowering inertial priors.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablation on coordinate frame: Retrain using global coordinates vs. local thigh frame to validate disentanglement claim. 2) Noise injection on height: Add Gaussian noise to synthetic height during training and test robustness against real-world barometer fluctuations. 3) Terrain generalization: Run translation estimator on real-world dataset containing ladders/stairs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Flexible sensor placement and body shapes**: The current assumption of mean body shape and fixed sensor placement limits generalizability to diverse shapes or user-defined configurations. The architecture relies on specific thigh-rooted coordinate frame and known height offsets that break if phone/watch locations change.

2. **Robust sensor fusion in diverse environments**: Barometers remain susceptible to environmental factors like temperature and humidity, causing drift or fluctuations in estimated vertical translation despite current Kalman filtering. The paper doesn't propose solutions for "in-the-wild" scenarios where pressure changes aren't caused by human motion.

3. **Real-world barometric data training**: The lack of datasets combining real IMU and barometer data limits current experiments to synthetic height information. It's unknown how much more effective the system would be if trained on real sensor physics where noise is non-Gaussian and correlated with motion.

## Limitations
- Fixed sensor placement requirement (wrist + thigh) limits generalizability compared to more flexible placement methods
- Barometer noise robustness in real-world conditions (HVAC, weather changes) not empirically validated beyond synthetic noise injection
- Kalman filter tuning parameters not specified, critical for barometer height estimation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Thigh-rooted local coordinate frame and its ability to decouple global/local motion is well-supported by mathematical formulation and ablation results
- **Medium Confidence**: Barometric height integration as geometric constraint is theoretically sound, but real-world noise resilience needs more validation
- **Medium Confidence**: Translation accuracy on non-flat terrain is demonstrated on limited real-world data; broader terrain diversity testing needed

## Next Checks
1. Coordinate Frame Ablation: Retrain with global coordinates on DIP-IMU to quantify exact contribution of thigh-rooted transformation
2. Barometer Noise Robustness: Test with real-world barometer fluctuations (HVAC, door opening) to validate Kalman filter stability
3. Terrain Diversity Testing: Evaluate translation accuracy across varied terrain (stairs, slopes, uneven surfaces) to validate non-flat terrain claims
