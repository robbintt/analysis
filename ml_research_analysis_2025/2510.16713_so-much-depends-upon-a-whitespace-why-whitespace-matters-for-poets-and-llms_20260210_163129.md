# so much depends / upon / a whitespace: Why Whitespace Matters for Poets and LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16713
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16713
- Reference count: 27
- This paper investigates the treatment of whitespace in poetry and its implications for large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how whitespace is treated in poetry across published, unpublished, and LLM-generated poems, and how different linearization methods affect the preservation of this critical poetic element. The authors introduce WISP, a novel whitespace typology for poetry that categorizes five types of whitespace usage: line breaks, prefix space, internal space, vertical space, and line length. Using a dataset of 19k published poems, 12k unpublished poems from Reddit, and 51k LLM-generated poems, they demonstrate that standard HTML-to-text linearization methods systematically strip semantic whitespace, degrading the structural integrity of poetic data. The study evaluates various linearization methods and finds that specialized tools like resiliparse perform best, though none perfectly capture all whitespace features.

## Method Summary
The study scraped 19k poems from Poetry Foundation and 12k from Reddit's r/OCPoetry, then generated 51k poems using GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 with both standard and whitespace-explicit prompts. Five linearization methods were compared: resiliparse (with formatting preservation), trafilatura, jusText, a custom WISP-ify method, and multimodal OCR using Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3. The WISP typology was implemented to detect and classify whitespace features, and a WISP-Bench evaluation set of 76 poems was used to assess preservation quality. Statistical analysis compared whitespace usage across datasets, poetic forms, and time periods.

## Key Results
- Standard HTML-to-text linearization methods (trafilatura, jusText) fail to preserve semantic whitespace, scoring near 0% on prefix/internal space preservation
- Published poets use significantly more varied and complex whitespace patterns than LLM-generated poetry, even when explicitly prompted
- The WISP typology provides a useful framework for categorizing and analyzing whitespace usage patterns across different poetry datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linearization Fidelity Loss
Standard HTML-to-text linearization methods systematically strip semantic whitespace (indentation, internal spacing), degrading the structural integrity of poetic data. Tools like trafilatura and jusText prioritize content extraction and treat variable spacing as "junk," flattening poetry's visual elements into prose-like text.

### Mechanism 2: Generative Distribution Mismatch
LLMs generate different whitespace patterns than human poets due to training data flattening and sampling biases. Unprompted LLMs default to standard formatting, while prompted models over-index on specific tokens (e.g., NOUN → SPACE) rather than the complex enjambment (VERB → PUNCT) found in human verse.

### Mechanism 3: Temporal & Stylistic Drift Detection
Whitespace usage serves as a robust macroscopic signal for analyzing literary history and differentiating poetic forms. By quantifying mean length of whitespace across decades, one can observe the "sculptural" turn in modernism, and forms like free verse and sonnet have distinct whitespace profiles.

## Foundational Learning

- **Linearization (HTML-to-Text)**: Critical data preprocessing step where semantic layout is often destroyed. Quick check: Why does trafilatura fail to capture indentation while resiliparse (with preserve_formatting=True) partially succeeds?

- **Unicode Whitespace & Tokenization**: The paper notes 25+ Unicode characters for whitespace that LLMs tokenize differently. Quick check: How does a BPE tokenizer typically handle a sequence of 5 spaces versus 5 alphabetic characters?

- **Enjambment (Syntactic-Spatial coupling)**: The paper analyzes "dependency triples" spanning line breaks. Quick check: What does a "VERB -> PUNCT" triple spanning a line break imply about the poet's style compared to a "NOUN -> SPACE" triple?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Web Scraper (Poetry Foundation) / API (Reddit) -> Linearization Layer (resiliparse, trafilatura, jusText, WISP-ify, OCR) -> Annotation Layer (WISP Typology parser) -> Evaluation (WISP-Bench)

- **Critical path**: The Linearization Layer. Using standard tools like trafilatura will destroy the data signal required for this research.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - HTML Parsers: Fast but ignore CSS/JS rendering, capture raw structure but may miss visual alignment
  - Multimodal OCR: Captures visual fidelity perfectly but suffers from hallucination errors and high latency/cost
  - Recommendation: Use resiliparse for bulk processing but validate with multimodal OCR on a subset

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Flattening: All text appears in single block or standard paragraphs
  - Left-Alignment: All lines start at column 0
  - Hallucination: Inconsistent spacing where lines don't align visually

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run the "Mars.1" poem through current text extraction pipeline to check if indentation is lost
  2. Feed a poem with non-standard internal spacing into the LLM's tokenizer and measure token count inflation
  3. Implement the "Presence Match" unit tests on 10 poems using resiliparse vs trafilatura to validate Table 3 results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can linearization methods incorporate CSS and JavaScript styling to better preserve whitespace during web scraping?
- How does whitespace usage in poetry differ across non-English languages and non-Roman scripts?
- What is the impact of OCR errors on whitespace preservation in book-derived poetry datasets?
- Can WISP-based features be used to reliably detect synthetically generated poetry?

## Limitations

- The study relies on digitized archives where OCR errors are significant, particularly in older texts, introducing noise in whitespace measurements
- Multimodal OCR methods show high error rates (16-31%) for whitespace preservation, creating a tradeoff between completeness and accuracy
- The WISP typology is developed and tested primarily on English poetry and may not capture the full complexity of poetry in other languages or scripts

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Standard HTML-to-text linearization methods fail to preserve semantic whitespace with near-zero performance
- Published poets use significantly more varied and complex whitespace patterns than LLM-generated poetry
- WISP typology provides a useful framework for analyzing whitespace usage patterns

**Medium Confidence**:
- Temporal trends showing increasing use of "bold" whitespace reflect genuine stylistic evolution
- Distributional differences between human and LLM whitespace usage are robust enough for detection
- Free verse and sonnets can be reliably distinguished based on whitespace profiles

**Low Confidence**:
- Specific quantitative comparisons between published and unpublished poetry may be confounded by platform-specific formatting
- Exact ranking of linearization methods depends heavily on specific poetry corpus and may vary across domains

## Next Checks

1. Test the WISP typology and linearization methods on poetry from multiple platforms to verify that observed differences in whitespace usage are intrinsic to poetic style rather than platform-specific formatting conventions.

2. Validate the temporal analysis by examining a smaller subset of poems where original print editions can be compared against digitized versions to quantify the impact of OCR errors on observed whitespace trends.

3. Apply the WISP typology and linearization evaluation to poetry in at least one other language (e.g., Chinese or Arabic) to test generalizability and identify any language-specific whitespace patterns.
