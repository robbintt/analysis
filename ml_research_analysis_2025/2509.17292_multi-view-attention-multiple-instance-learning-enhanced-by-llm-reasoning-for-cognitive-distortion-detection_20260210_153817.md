# Multi-View Attention Multiple-Instance Learning Enhanced by LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17292
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Achieved F1-scores up to 0.505 on KoACD and 0.394 on Therapist QA, outperforming previous models for cognitive distortion detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect cognitive distortions in mental health texts. The approach decomposes utterances into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which are used by LLMs to infer multiple cognitive distortion instances, each with a type, expression, and salience score. These instances are aggregated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism to classify the utterance. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets show that incorporating ELB and salience scores improves performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity.

## Method Summary
The framework uses LLMs to generate multiple instances of potential cognitive distortions from an utterance, each with a type, text span, and salience score. Utterances are first decomposed into Emotion-Logic-Behavior (ELB) components using a zero-shot prompt. A Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism aggregates these instances, weighting them by their salience scores, to classify the utterance into one of 10 cognitive distortion types. The model is trained on KoACD (Korean, 4,510 utterances) and Therapist QA (English, 1,597 utterances) datasets using a MiniLM embedder and cross-entropy loss.

## Key Results
- ELB decomposition reduced the average missing rate from 10.89% to 8.93% on KoACD dataset
- Integration of salience scores improved F1 from 0.483 to 0.505 on KoACD
- The framework achieved F1-scores up to 0.505 on KoACD and 0.394 on Therapist QA, outperforming previous models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Psychologically Grounded Decomposition (ELB)
Structuring raw text into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components before inference reduces the rate at which the system misses ground-truth cognitive distortion labels. A Zero-shot LLM prompt extracts explicit emotional states, reasoning chains (Logic), and action-oriented language (Behavior) from an utterance. These enriched inputs provide the primary inference LLM with disentangled psychological signals, allowing it to identify subtle distortions that might be masked in unstructured text.

### Mechanism 2: Ambiguity Handling via Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
Formulating the task as Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) improves robustness against semantic overlap and label ambiguity by treating an utterance as a "bag" of multiple potential distortion "instances." Instead of forcing a single label, the system allows the LLM to propose multiple distortion hypotheses, each with a type and text span. The aggregation model then classifies the "bag" based on the presence of key instances, accommodating the reality that multiple distortions often co-occur in a single sentence.

### Mechanism 3: Salience-Weighted Gated Attention
Integrating LLM-derived "salience scores" into the attention mechanism improves classification by weighting the influence of specific instances based on the LLM's perceived importance. The architecture uses a Gated Attention mechanism where the attention score is calculated using standard transformations multiplied by the LLM-provided salience score. This forces the model to pay more attention to instances the LLM is confident about, effectively filtering low-confidence noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies entirely on the MIL paradigm where labels are assigned to "bags" (utterances) rather than individual "instances" (LLM hypotheses).
  - Quick check question: If a bag has 10 instances and the label is "Personalization," how many instances must actually be "Personalization" for the MIL assumption to hold?

- **Concept: The Cognitive Triangle (CBT)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the interplay of Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) is critical to justify the prompt engineering strategy.
  - Quick check question: Why might separating "Logic" (reasoning) from "Emotion" (feeling) help an LLM detect "Emotional Reasoning" (believing something is true because you feel it)?

- **Concept: Gated Attention**
  - Why needed here: The core aggregator is not standard self-attention but a gated mechanism that incorporates external scalar signals (salience).
  - Quick check question: In Eq. 3 ($h_i = \sigma(W_g \cdot x_i) \cdot \tanh(W_f \cdot x_i) \cdot s_i$), what is the functional role of the sigmoid gate $\sigma$ versus the salience scalar $s_i$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ELB Extractor (GPT-4o/Gemini/Claude) -> Instance Generator (LLM) -> Embedder (MiniLM) -> Multi-View Gated Attention (Trainable) -> Classifier
- **Critical path:** The system hinges on the Instance Generator. If the LLM fails to generate an instance matching the ground truth, the downstream attention mechanism cannot recover the signal.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Heavy reliance on pre-inference via LLMs adds significant latency and cost compared to fine-tuning a BERT model directly, but enables "fine-grained reasoning" without massive labeled training sets.
- **Failure signatures:** High Missing Rate for specific distortion types like "Discounting the Positive" (up to 15%), Instance Imbalance bias toward frequent types, Attention collapse to single view.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run the Multi-View MIL model with random salience scores to confirm the LLM's specific salience values provide signal beyond just the instance text.
  2. Test with K=1 (Single View) vs. K=4 (Multi-View) to verify the benefit of multiple attention heads.
  3. For validation errors, manually check if the ground truth label appears in the LLM-generated instance list to determine if errors are upstream or downstream.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the omission rate of ground-truth labels be reduced for cognitive distortion types characterized by high interpretive ambiguity or subtle emotional cues?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the Conclusion and Limitations that future work must focus on reducing omission rates and improving performance for types with "low predictive accuracy or interpretive ambiguity," noting that true labels were often missed for subjective phrasing.
- Why unresolved: The current ELB decomposition reduces missing rates but does not eliminate them for complex types like Emotional Reasoning, where LLMs struggle to consistently detect psychologically meaningful patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified framework that demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in the "missing rate" metric for high-ambiguity distortion types compared to the current ELB + Salience baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can quality-aware modeling or attention regulation mechanisms correct the model's bias toward distortion types with high instance frequency?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in the Limitations section that the model "disproportionately focused on distortion types with more abundant or salient instances," potentially overlooking valid signals from sparser types, and explicitly call for "balanced instance generation and attention regulation mechanisms."
- Why unresolved: The current attention mechanism weights instances based on LLM-assigned salience, which correlates with frequency, thereby propagating label imbalance rather than correcting for it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing improved F1-scores for low-frequency distortion types (e.g., Discounting the Positive) without degrading performance on high-frequency types, using a regulated attention mechanism.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does integrating explicit explanation generation or quantitative evidence frameworks improve the clinical applicability and transparency of the model's predictions?
- Basis in paper: The Limitations section highlights that while the model offers indirect interpretability via attention, it "lacks explicit and quantitatively grounded explanations" which are essential for clinical judgment.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture provides attention scores but does not generate natural language justifications or map predictions to specific psychological theory, leaving a gap between model output and clinical utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study with clinical experts showing that the addition of an explanation module significantly increases trust or diagnostic utility compared to the attention weights alone.

## Limitations
- The framework depends entirely on LLM quality for instance generation; high missing rates suggest fundamental upstream failure that attention cannot fix.
- The reliance on structured ELB decomposition and salience-weighted attention may not generalize to other languages or clinical contexts without retraining.
- The analysis focuses on overall F1 and per-type breakdowns but lacks human-in-the-loop validation of whether the system's identified instances are clinically meaningful or actionable.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The architectural design and its mathematical formulation are clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance improvements are statistically supported within the dataset but may not generalize to other domains.
- **Low Confidence**: The assumption that LLM-generated salience scores are reliable indicators of instance correctness is weakly supported.

## Next Checks
1. For utterances where the model fails, have clinicians manually verify if the ground-truth distortion is truly absent from the LLM-generated instances or if the model missed it.
2. Apply the trained model to a held-out subset of a different mental health dataset without retraining to measure cross-dataset generalization.
3. Replace LLM-derived salience scores with random values or uniform weights in the attention mechanism to validate whether salience adds meaningful signal.
