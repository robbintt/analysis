# Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generative LLMs For Automated Metadata Description Generation to Enhance Data Catalogs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09003
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Automated metadata generation achieves >80% Rouge-1 F1 and 87-88% human acceptance rate

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a retrieval-augmented framework for automatically generating metadata descriptions in data catalogs. The system addresses the challenge of incomplete metadata by leveraging existing catalog content through semantic retrieval and few-shot prompting. By combining abbreviation expansion, semantic similarity search, and LLM generation, the approach significantly reduces manual effort while maintaining high accuracy in generated descriptions.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline where existing metadata descriptions are semantically searched and retrieved to provide context for LLM generation. Column names are expanded using a rule-based abbreviation expander, then used to retrieve similar examples from a vector database. The retrieved examples, along with expanded terms and business glossaries, are incorporated into prompts for few-shot learning with LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo or fine-tuned Llama2-7B models.

## Key Results
- Generated descriptions achieve over 80% Rouge-1 F1 score for content accuracy
- Human acceptance rate of 87-88% for generated descriptions requiring no or minor edits
- Fine-tuned Llama2-7B shows tendency to copy text verbatim (49.5% of instances) while GPT-3.5 paraphrases
- 50% reduction in manual effort for metadata curation reported

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by combining semantic retrieval with LLM generation to create contextually relevant metadata descriptions. The retrieval component finds semantically similar columns using vector embeddings, providing the LLM with relevant examples and context. The abbreviation expansion step ensures domain-specific jargon is properly interpreted. By augmenting prompts with these elements, the LLM can generate accurate, contextually appropriate descriptions that align with existing catalog conventions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core architecture. The framework is not just a prompt engineering exercise; it's a RAG system. The LLM's "knowledge" for a specific task is dynamically retrieved from a vector database of existing descriptions. Without this concept, an engineer might try to fine-tune a model on all data or provide static few-shot examples, which won't scale or adapt to new contexts.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why retrieving similar examples dynamically is better than using a fixed set of examples in the prompt for a data catalog with thousands of entries?

- **Concept: Semantic Search & Vector Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: This is the "retrieval" part of RAG. The system doesn't search by keyword match; it uses an embedding model (BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) to find columns with semantically similar names and contexts. Understanding that meaning is captured as a vector and similarity is a distance metric is crucial for grasping the retrieval pipeline.
  - Quick check question: If two columns have different names but represent the same business concept, why would a vector search be more effective than a simple string match?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering & Few-Shot Learning**
  - Why needed here: The retrieved data must be presented to the LLM effectively. This system uses a dynamically constructed prompt with few-shot examples. The engineer must understand how to structure these prompts to guide the LLM's behavior, include the expanded terms, and frame the task for optimal generation.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of a "system instruction" in a prompt, and how do the few-shot examples interact with it to shape the LLM's output?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Pre-processor -> Expander Pipeline -> Retrieval Pipeline (Vector Store + Re-ranker) -> Prompt Builder -> LLM Inference Engine -> Evaluation Module

- **Critical path:** The correctness of the final output hinges on the **Retrieval Pipeline's Re-ranker**. The initial vector search (top 100) is broad; the LCS algorithm's job is to narrow this down to the most relevant examples. A failure here propagates irrelevant context to the LLM, leading to poor generations. The **Expander Pipeline** is also critical for handling the domain-specific jargon in enterprise catalogs.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Fine-tuning vs. Few-Shot Prompting:** The paper shows fine-tuned models can "copy" examples verbatim, while GPT-3.5 paraphrases. The choice depends on the desired output style: fidelity to source text vs. more natural language generation.
  - **Cost vs. Performance:** GPT-4 was not used for column descriptions due to cost, highlighting a key enterprise constraint. The tradeoff is between the higher accuracy of larger models and the operational expense at scale.
  - **Automation vs. Curation:** The system is designed to *augment* data stewards, not replace them. The architecture is built to provide a "jumpstart" that requires human validation, not a fully autonomous system.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Hallucination:** If the Expander Pipeline fails to map an abbreviation, the LLM may invent a plausible but incorrect expansion.
  - **Copying:** The fine-tuned Llama2-7B model showed a tendency to copy text from the prompt verbatim (49.5% of instances), reducing the quality of the generated description.
  - **Lack of Factual Grounding:** Low AlignScore indicates the LLM's output contradicts the information provided in the prompt, a key risk the evaluation module is designed to catch.
  - **Irrelevant Context:** If the LCS re-ranking fails, the few-shot examples may be poor, leading the LLM to generate a description that is contextually inappropriate.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Evaluation:** Run the framework on a sample dataset (e.g., 100 columns) with the retrieval pipeline *disabled* (zero-shot). Measure the quality of generated descriptions against the ground truth. This establishes a baseline.
  2. **Ablation Study on Re-ranking:** Run the framework with vector search *only* (no LCS re-ranking). Compare the Rouge-1 F1 scores and AlignScore with the full pipeline to quantify the value added by the LCS re-ranking step.
  3. **Model Comparison (Copying vs. Paraphrasing):** Generate descriptions for the same dataset using both a fine-tuned model and a few-shot prompted model (like GPT-3.5). Manually review a sample to understand the qualitative difference between "copying" and "paraphrasing" behavior to decide which is preferred for the target use case.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**
  - Question: Does incorporating logical or physical data models as inputs to language models improve the generation of metadata descriptions by better capturing relationships between assets compared to metadata-only inputs?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "The availability of data models as inputs to language models can further help them judge the relationships among assets in a better way," noting there is room for improvement beyond the current methodology.
  - Why unresolved: The current framework relies primarily on column names, similarity searches, and business glossaries; it does not currently utilize structural data models to define relationships during the generation process.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of description quality (using BertScore or human feedback) on a dataset where prompts are enriched with schema relationship information versus the current baseline.

- **Open Question 2**
  - Question: To what extent does the inclusion of actual column data samples in the prompt improve the factual alignment and accuracy of generated descriptions in scenarios where data accessibility is permitted?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "in scenarios where the underlying data is accessible and does not pose any shareability concerns, the enrichment of prompt could also involve using a sample of actual values for better alignment."
  - Why unresolved: The current study was constrained to using only metadata (names, glossaries) and excluded actual data values, leaving the potential benefit of data sampling untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the AlignScore or factual grounding metrics of models prompted with data samples against those prompted with metadata alone.

- **Open Question 3**
  - Question: Can improved in-domain knowledge adaptation techniques (such as advanced fine-tuning or RAG) prevent the "copying behavior" observed in fine-tuned models while maintaining high domain relevance?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The results section highlights that the fine-tuned Llama2-7B model often copies text from prompts (49.47% of instances) rather than paraphrasing like GPT-3.5. The conclusion explicitly calls for exploring "better finetuning or retrieval augmented generation approaches" to address this.
  - Why unresolved: There is a trade-off observed between the high copying rate of the fine-tuned model and the paraphrasing capability of the pretrained model; it is unclear if a technique exists that balances domain acquisition with generative flexibility.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a new fine-tuning strategy that maintains high Rouge-1 F1 scores but significantly reduces the "Exact Matched Example" copy rate compared to the current Llama2-7B baseline.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on proprietary datasets and business glossaries, making independent validation difficult
- Human acceptance rate comes from limited sample of 300 columns, may not represent edge cases
- Performance on entirely new data sources without existing descriptions is unknown
- Cannot generate descriptions for truly novel concepts absent from semantic search index

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The retrieval-augmented architecture and prompt engineering approach are sound and well-validated. The empirical results showing 80%+ Rouge-1 F1 and the distinction between fine-tuned and few-shot model behaviors are robust.

**Medium Confidence**: The claimed reduction in manual effort (50% decrease) is reasonable but depends heavily on the quality of the existing catalog content and business glossary. The cost-effectiveness claims assume enterprise-scale deployment with specific usage patterns.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the framework's performance on entirely novel datasets or different enterprise domains are speculative without cross-domain validation. The long-term maintenance costs and scalability of the vector index for very large catalogs are not addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on New Data Sources**: Test the framework on datasets from entirely different domains or organizations without overlapping content in the existing catalog to assess true generalization capability.

2. **Longitudinal Cost Analysis**: Measure the operational costs (vector index maintenance, LLM API calls) and performance degradation over time as the catalog grows to thousands of tables and millions of columns.

3. **Edge Case Stress Test**: Create a test suite of ambiguous abbreviations, domain-specific jargon, and columns with minimal existing metadata to evaluate how the expander pipeline and retrieval system handle truly challenging cases.
