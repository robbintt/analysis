core_contribution: The study introduces MOIS-SAM2, an interactive segmentation model
  designed for neurofibroma (NF) detection in whole-body MRI scans of neurofibromatosis
  type 1 patients. Unlike existing approaches, MOIS-SAM2 leverages exemplar-based
  semantic propagation, where previously segmented lesions serve as exemplars to guide
  the segmentation of similar, unprompted lesions across the scan.

# MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurofibromas in whole-body MRI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19277
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19277
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MOIS-SAM2 achieved scan-wise DSC of 0.60, outperforming SAM2 (0.35) and nnU-Net (0.54) on neurofibroma segmentation in WB-MRI

## Executive Summary
MOIS-SAM2 introduces an exemplar-based interactive segmentation model for neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients. The model leverages previously segmented lesions as exemplars to guide the segmentation of similar lesions throughout the scan, reducing the interaction burden compared to prompting each lesion individually. The approach was evaluated on 119 whole-body MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy over baseline models and achieving clinical relevance with model-to-expert agreement comparable to inter-expert agreement.

## Method Summary
MOIS-SAM2 extends the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture to enable exemplar-based semantic propagation for multilesion segmentation. The model uses pre-segmented lesions as exemplars to guide the segmentation of similar, unprompted lesions across the scan. It was trained and evaluated on whole-body MRI scans from NF1 patients, leveraging the model's ability to maintain strong performance across domain shifts. The approach is publicly available via GitHub and integrated into MONAI Label for 3D Slicer, facilitating clinical adoption.

## Key Results
- Scan-wise DSC: MOIS-SAM2 achieved 0.60, outperforming SAM2 (0.35) and nnU-Net (0.54)
- Clinical relevance: Model-to-expert agreement (DSC=0.64) comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC=0.70)
- Robustness: Maintained strong performance across domain shifts in validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The exemplar-based approach leverages previously segmented lesions as reference points, allowing the model to propagate segmentation knowledge across similar lesions in the scan. This reduces the need for individual prompts per lesion, addressing the challenge of interactive segmentation in multilesion scenarios. By building on SAM2's strong foundation, MOIS-SAM2 benefits from advanced feature representation and prompt engineering capabilities while adding semantic propagation through exemplar matching.

## Foundational Learning
- Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1): Genetic disorder causing neurofibromas throughout the body, requiring whole-body MRI for monitoring
  - Why needed: Defines the clinical context and segmentation challenge
  - Quick check: Confirm NF1 diagnosis criteria and typical lesion distribution

- Whole-Body MRI (WB-MRI): Comprehensive imaging technique capturing multiple anatomical regions in a single scan
  - Why needed: Understanding the scan complexity and lesion distribution patterns
  - Quick check: Verify WB-MRI protocols and typical acquisition parameters

- Exemplar-based Learning: Method using known examples to guide segmentation of similar instances
  - Why needed: Core mechanism for reducing interaction burden in multilesion segmentation
  - Quick check: Test exemplar matching performance on held-out lesions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: WB-MRI scan -> Preprocessing -> SAM2 backbone -> Exemplar matching -> Segmentation output

Critical path: The exemplar matching module is critical, as it bridges SAM2's feature extraction with semantic propagation across lesions. Performance depends on accurate feature representation and effective exemplar selection.

Design tradeoffs: The model prioritizes reduced interaction burden over absolute segmentation accuracy, accepting some performance trade-offs to enable practical clinical workflow. This decision balances the need for efficiency with the requirement for clinically acceptable results.

Failure signatures: Performance degrades when exemplars are not representative of target lesions (size, location, or appearance differences), when lesions are poorly defined in the original exemplars, or when significant domain shifts occur between training and deployment scenarios.

First experiments:
1. Validate exemplar matching accuracy on a subset of lesions with known ground truth
2. Test model performance with varying numbers of exemplars to establish minimum requirements
3. Evaluate segmentation quality on lesions with different characteristics (size, location, appearance) to identify performance limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Reliance on pre-segmented exemplars may limit practical applicability in clinical workflows
- Validation confined to NF1 patients restricts generalizability to other pathologies or anatomical regions
- Model-to-expert agreement (DSC=0.64) suggests room for improvement before clinical deployment
- No quantification of time savings compared to full manual annotation

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Model performance vs baselines | High |
| Clinical relevance and agreement metrics | Medium |
| Generalizability to other diseases/modalities | Low |
| Workflow efficiency gains | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Validate MOIS-SAM2 on a separate external cohort with different scanner vendors or protocols to assess robustness to domain shift
2. Conduct a time-motion study comparing MOIS-SAM2 to manual segmentation and other interactive methods in a real clinical setting
3. Evaluate the model's performance on segmentation of other tumor types or pathologies in MRI to test generalizability beyond neurofibromas
