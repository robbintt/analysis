# Neuromorphic Cybersecurity with Semi-supervised Lifelong Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.04610
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04610
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Hierarchical SNN with Ad-STDP and structural plasticity achieves 85.3% accuracy on UNSW-NB15 lifelong intrusion detection with reduced catastrophic forgetting.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical spiking neural network (SNN) architecture for lifelong network intrusion detection that combines static pattern recognition with dynamic adaptation to new attack types. The system uses a two-phase approach: an initial unsupervised LIF layer with standard STDP for binary attack/benign classification, followed by a dynamic layer incorporating Grow When Required-inspired structural plasticity and Adaptive STDP modulated by neuron-specific firing factors. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 dataset in a continual learning setting with six attack classes, the approach demonstrates effective adaptation to new threats while maintaining knowledge of previous classes, achieving 85.3% overall accuracy and high operational sparsity suitable for neuromorphic hardware deployment.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a hierarchical SNN architecture with two distinct phases for lifelong network intrusion detection. Phase 1 consists of a static 100-neuron LIF layer using standard STDP, lateral inhibition, and adaptive thresholds to perform unsupervised binary classification of attack versus benign traffic. Phase 2 introduces a dynamic LIF layer with GWR-inspired structural plasticity and Adaptive STDP, where neurons grow when their activity falls below a threshold and prune when inactive for extended periods. The system uses Poisson spike encoding of 42 selected features from UNSW-NB15, trains sequentially across tasks without revisiting prior data, and employs semi-supervised labeling using limited labeled samples. The firing factor mechanism modulates synaptic plasticity to balance adaptation and stability, while maintaining high sparsity (0.0008-0.002 spikes/neuron/timestep) for energy efficiency.

## Key Results
- **Overall accuracy:** 85.3% on UNSW-NB15 lifelong intrusion detection
- **Phase 1 performance:** 94.3% detection accuracy for binary attack/benign classification
- **Phase 2 performance:** 66.3% classification accuracy for multi-class attack identification
- **Sparsity metrics:** High operational sparsity (0.0008-0.002 spikes/neuron/timestep) indicating energy efficiency potential
- **Catastrophic forgetting:** Reduced compared to static baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages the complementary strengths of static and dynamic learning mechanisms to achieve lifelong adaptation. Phase 1 establishes stable, reliable binary classification through unsupervised STDP learning, creating a robust foundation for threat detection. Phase 2 then employs structural plasticity and firing-factor-modulated Ad-STDP to dynamically adapt to new attack patterns while preserving existing knowledge. The firing factor mechanism acts as a homeostatic control, reducing plasticity in neurons that have specialized for specific patterns and enabling growth of new neurons for novel threats. This hierarchical approach, combined with semi-supervised labeling and high sparsity, enables effective continual learning with minimal catastrophic forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for neuromorphic hardware deployment.

## Foundational Learning

**Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP):**
*Needed because:* Enables unsupervised learning in SNNs by strengthening synapses when pre-synaptic spikes precede post-synaptic spikes, and weakening them otherwise, allowing neurons to learn temporal patterns in network traffic.
*Quick check:* Verify weight updates follow the temporal order rule with appropriate learning rates (A+, A−) and time constants (τpre, τpost).

**Structural Plasticity:**
*Needed because:* Allows the network to grow new neurons when existing ones cannot adequately represent new patterns, and prune unused neurons to maintain efficiency, crucial for lifelong learning.
*Quick check:* Monitor neuron count during Phase 2 training to ensure it grows when BMU ASR < a_th and prunes when age > age_max with appropriate firing factor thresholds.

**Homeostatic Plasticity:**
*Needed because:* Maintains stable neuronal activity across varying input patterns through adaptive thresholds and firing factor decay, preventing runaway excitation or complete quiescence.
*Quick check:* Track average firing rates and firing factor distributions to ensure they remain within target ranges and decay with appropriate time constant τff.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
UNSW-NB15 features -> Poisson Spike Encoding -> Phase 1 (Static LIF + STDP + Lateral Inhibition) -> Binary Classification -> Phase 2 (Dynamic LIF + Ad-STDP + Structural Plasticity) -> Multi-class Attack Classification

**Critical Path:**
Input spike trains flow through Phase 1 for initial binary classification, then concatenate with Phase 1 ASRs as input to Phase 2 for dynamic multi-class learning. The firing factor mechanism modulates Ad-STDP updates and growth/pruning decisions throughout Phase 2 training.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Static Phase 1 provides stability and reliability but cannot adapt to new attack types; Dynamic Phase 2 enables adaptation but risks catastrophic forgetting. The firing factor mechanism balances these competing needs by modulating plasticity based on neuron specialization.

**Failure Signatures:**
Catastrophic forgetting indicates insufficient firing factor decay or overly permissive growth conditions; Phase 2 accuracy degradation suggests incorrect pruning thresholds or insufficient neuron specialization; low sparsity indicates excessive firing requiring threshold adjustment.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Train Phase 1 only on all tasks sequentially to establish baseline forgetting without dynamic adaptation.
2. Vary STDP learning rates (A+, A−) in Phase 1 to find optimal binary classification performance.
3. Test different growth threshold (a_th) values in Phase 2 to observe impact on neuron count stability and adaptation speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters for Ad-STDP, firing factor decay, and structural plasticity thresholds are not specified, making faithful reproduction challenging.
- Sequential task design is vaguely described without detailing specific attack class orderings or transition patterns.
- Semi-supervised labeling approach lacks detail on sample size and assignment strategy, potentially affecting reproducibility.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- SNN architecture design (two-phase hierarchy with static then dynamic layers)
- Evaluation methodology (UNSW-NB15 dataset, 8:1:1 split, Poisson encoding)
- Overall accuracy (85.3%) and sparsity metrics are specifically reported

**Medium Confidence:**
- General framework and component interactions are well-described
- Sequential learning setup and task-incremental approach is clearly outlined

**Low Confidence:**
- Specific task sequences and attack class orderings
- Exact values for STDP/Ad-STDP parameters and structural plasticity thresholds
- Detailed semi-supervised labeling protocol

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary STDP learning rates, firing factor decay constants, and growth/pruning thresholds to quantify their impact on catastrophic forgetting and accuracy retention across tasks.

2. **Task Sequence Validation:** Test multiple orderings of the six attack classes to determine if reported accuracy and forgetting metrics are robust to sequence design rather than optimized for a specific ordering.

3. **Neuron Dynamics Monitoring:** Track neuron count evolution, average age distribution, and firing factor histograms during Phase 2 training to verify growth/pruning mechanisms function as intended and correlate with accuracy improvements.
