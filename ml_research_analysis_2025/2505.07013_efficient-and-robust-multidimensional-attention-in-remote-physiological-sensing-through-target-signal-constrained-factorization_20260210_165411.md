# Efficient and Robust Multidimensional Attention in Remote Physiological Sensing through Target Signal Constrained Factorization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.07013
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07013
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TSFM achieves 75% reduction in HR MAE when trained on SCAMPS and tested on BP4D+, with 1.27ms inference latency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Target Signal Constrained Factorization (TSFM), a novel attention mechanism for remote physiological sensing that uses ground-truth physiological signals as constraints for non-negative matrix factorization. The authors propose MMRPhys, an efficient dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture that supports simultaneous multi-task estimation of rPPG and rRSP signals from multimodal RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on five benchmark datasets, MMRPhys with TSFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining minimal inference latency suitable for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
MMRPhys is a dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture with Target Signal Constrained Factorization (TSFM) attention. The method uses ground-truth physiological signals as constraints during NMF-based attention computation to improve cross-dataset generalization. The architecture processes T×H×W×Ch video frames through a preprocessing layer, applies TSFM to create constrained embeddings, and splits into BVP and RSP branches with different temporal receptive fields. The BVP branch preserves full temporal resolution while the RSP branch applies spatiotemporal strides with temporal upsampling. Training uses either single-task negative Pearson correlation loss or multi-task Smooth L1 loss, with TSFM attention primarily shaping learned weights rather than being required at runtime.

## Key Results
- MMRPhys with TSFM achieves 75% reduction in HR MAE when trained on SCAMPS and tested on BP4D+ compared to state-of-the-art methods
- The approach demonstrates superior generalization across domain shifts including ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, and facial poses
- Maintains minimal inference latency of 1.27ms while achieving top performance across five benchmark datasets
- Thermal modality outperforms RGB for respiratory estimation but underperforms for cardiac estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Target Signal as Factorization Constraint
Incorporating ground-truth physiological signals as explicit constraints during NMF-based attention computation improves cross-dataset generalization by biasing low-rank reconstruction toward signal-correlated features. The TSFM module reconstructs embeddings as **ŷ_V_TSF = y_sig · W · H**, where y_sig is the target signal (rPPG or rRSP). This forces the factorization to preserve spatial-channel features that exhibit temporal correlation with the physiological signal, rather than allowing standard NMF to recover arbitrary dominant patterns (e.g., motion artifacts).

### Mechanism 2: Multiplicative Update for Constrained NMF
Solving the constrained factorization via multiplicative updates (3-4 iterations in `no_grad` blocks) maintains computational efficiency while providing stable gradients. The method adapts the Hamburger module's multiplicative update approach, functioning as a linear approximation of backpropagation-through-time. This avoids unstable gradients from iterative update rules while enabling explicit constraint integration.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Branch Temporal Receptive Field Design
Separate BVP and RSP branches with different temporal strides capture the distinct frequency characteristics of cardiac (~60-100 BPM) versus respiratory (~12-18 BPM) signals. The BVP branch preserves full temporal resolution while aggregating spatial dimensions. The RSP branch applies convolutional strides across both spatial and temporal dimensions, then upsamples temporally in final layers to align with output signal length.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**
  - Why needed here: TSFM builds on NMF principles for multidimensional attention; understanding reconstruction as **V ≈ WH** is essential for debugging factorization behavior.
  - Quick check question: Given a 50×100 embedding matrix, what rank would you choose for factorization, and what determines reconstruction quality?

- **Concept: Multiplicative Update Rules**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly uses multiplicative updates rather than gradient-based optimization for the NMF subproblem.
  - Quick check question: Why might iterative multiplicative updates be preferred over backpropagation for constrained matrix factorization?

- **Concept: Remote Physiological Sensing Signal Characteristics**
  - Why needed here: rPPG and rRSP have different frequency ranges and spatial distributions; thermal RGB modalities provide complementary information.
  - Quick check question: Why does thermal imaging outperform RGB for respiratory estimation but underperform for cardiac estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input frames → 1×1×1 conv + ReLU → non-negative embeddings ε → reshape to V → TSFM constraint with ground-truth signal → reshape back → element-wise multiply with original embeddings → BVP branch (spatial aggregation, temporal preserved) and RSP branch (spatiotemporal strides, temporal upsampling) → rPPG and rRSP outputs

- **Critical path**: Ground-truth signal availability during training → TSFM constraint quality → cross-dataset generalization. The attention module can be omitted during inference, but training requires aligned signal labels.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Spatial resolution: 36×36 performs comparably to 72×72, enabling efficiency gains. Modality selection: Thermal for RSP, RGB for BVP yields optimal multitask performance. Attention during inference: TSFM can be omitted post-training with retained performance, implying attention primarily shapes learned weights.

- **Failure signatures**: Low correlation but high MACC on RSP indicates short video clips (<20s) lacking frequency resolution for FFT-based rate extraction. Thermal modality for BVP yields negative SNR, indicating rPPG signal is weak/absent in thermal domain. Cross-dataset with SCAMPS training shows degraded performance due to synthetic-to-real domain shift.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train MMRPhys-BVP (single branch, single task) on UBFC-rPPG with TSFM vs. FSAM; compare within-dataset HR MAE to verify implementation.
  2. Replicate Table 1 on PURE dataset—TSFM vs. GRBF constraint vs. unconstrained NMF to confirm target signal constraint efficacy.
  3. Train on iBVP, test on PURE and UBFC-rPPG; verify reported HR MAE ~0.42-0.43 BPM with MMRPhys-TSFM.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent can Target Signal Constrained Factorization (TSFM) be generalized to estimate other physiological signals beyond rPPG and rRSP, such as blood pressure or oxygen saturation?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion states, "Future research should explore extending TSFM to other physiological signals beyond rPPG and rRSP..."
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the method on Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) and Respiration (RSP) signals; it remains untested whether the factorization constraints are compatible with the distinct temporal characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios of other biomarkers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the TSFM mechanism be effectively adapted for general computer vision tasks involving weak signal extraction from high-dimensional data subject to significant distribution shifts?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion suggests researchers should "investigate its application in different computer vision domains that require extracting weak signals from high-dimensional data with significant distribution shifts."
- Why unresolved: The mathematical formulation of TSFM is tailored to physiological signal characteristics (smoothness, periodicity), and it is unclear if the target signal constraint logic applies to non-physiological features or sparse events in natural scenes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the TSFM attention mechanism to noise or artifacts within the ground-truth signals used as factorization constraints during training?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that ground-truth signals are used as explicit constraints (Equation 1). While the results show robustness to domain shifts in video input, the method assumes the constraint signal $y_{sig}$ is reliable. If the training ground truth contains motion artifacts or sensor noise, the factorization might inadvertently attend to these noise features.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the quantitative cross-dataset performance of MMRPhys for thermal-based respiratory estimation?
- Basis in paper: The authors note they "could not perform a quantitative multitask assessment of the models trained with the BP4D+ dataset... given the lack of additional multimodal datasets containing ground-truth labels for rRSP signals."
- Why unresolved: There is currently a lack of standard multimodal (RGB and Thermal) datasets with respiratory ground truth to facilitate a rigorous cross-dataset benchmark for this specific modality.

## Limitations
- Ground-truth physiological signal dependency: TSFM requires high-quality ground-truth signals during training, creating vulnerability to signal noise or misalignment
- Synthetic-to-real domain gaps: SCAMPS synthetic data training shows significant performance degradation when tested on real datasets
- Scalability constraints: 3-4 iteration multiplicative updates may not scale to more complex signal scenarios or tighter constraints

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Within-dataset performance improvements (HR MAE reduction from 1.6 to 0.43 BPM on UBFC-rPPG)
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-dataset generalization claims, with consistent improvements but synthetic-to-real domain shift limitations
- **Low confidence**: Computational efficiency claims (1.27ms inference latency) due to lack of detailed timing methodology

## Next Checks

1. **Signal Quality Sensitivity Test**: Train MMRPhys-TSFM with progressively corrupted ground-truth signals (Gaussian noise, temporal misalignment, missing segments). Measure performance degradation to establish signal quality thresholds for reliable constraint application.

2. **Constraint Complexity Scaling**: Modify TSFM to handle multiple physiological targets simultaneously (e.g., rPPG + rRSP + GSR if available). Test convergence stability and performance impact with increased constraint complexity beyond current single-signal design.

3. **Synthetic-to-Real Transfer Analysis**: Systematically compare MMRPhys performance when trained on synthetic SCAMPS versus real datasets (PURE, iBVP) across identical test sets. Quantify domain gap magnitude and identify specific physiological features that transfer poorly from synthetic to real data.
