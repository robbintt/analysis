# A Categorical Analysis of Large Language Models and Why LLMs Circumvent the Symbol Grounding Problem  

## Quick Facts  
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.09117  
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09117  
- **Reference count:** 18  
- **Primary result:** Introduces a set‑inclusion “soundness” metric (PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h)) that classifies LLM outputs as sound, incomplete, or hallucinatory, showing that LLMs bypass rather than solve the symbol‑grounding problem.  

## Executive Summary  
The authors propose a categorical framework built on the category **Rel** to formalise when a large language model (LLM) can act as an epistemic bridge that yields the same truth‑evaluated propositions a well‑informed human would. By treating prompting, inference, and interpretation as stochastic relations, they define *soundness* as the inclusion of the LLM’s possible answer set within the human’s answer set; refusals automatically satisfy this condition. Through a photosynthesis example (partial but sound) and a “soil” hallucination (unsound), they illustrate how the framework isolates six systematic failure points. The paper’s contribution is a logical inclusion metric rather than empirical performance numbers, arguing that LLMs circumvent the symbol‑grounding problem.  

## Method Summary  
The paper formalises epistemic situations (human knowledge H, content C, tokenised strings C′, datasets D(C′), LLM G, outputs O, worlds W, propositions Pred(W)) as objects in **Rel** and models prompting, inference, and interpretation as morphisms that may be many‑to‑many and stochastic. Soundness is defined as **PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h)**, where **PAI(h)** is the set of propositions the LLM can plausibly infer for a human epistemic state *h*. A refusal yields the empty set, trivially satisfying soundness. The authors then enumerate six points where the chain of relations can break, leading to incomplete or hallucinatory answers. No quantitative experiments are reported; the analysis remains purely logical.  

## Key Results  
- Formal definition of *soundness* as set inclusion **PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h)**, with refusals automatically sound.  
- Identification of six systematic failure points: tokenisation distortion, dataset bias, training generalisation error, prompting ambiguity, inference stochasticity, interpretation error.  
- Demonstration that the inclusion metric classifies LLM responses into sound, incomplete, or hallucinatory, supporting the claim that LLMs “circumvent” symbol grounding.  

## Why This Works (Mechanism)  

**Mechanism 1 – Categorical preservation of epistemic inclusion**  
- **Claim:** Modeling the epistemic pipeline as morphisms in **Rel** guarantees that if each morphism preserves relational inclusion, the overall pipeline respects the soundness condition.  
- **Mechanism:** Each step (prompting, inference, interpretation) is represented as a relation R ⊆ X × Y. If for a given human state *h* the relation from *h* to the LLM’s answer set is a sub‑relation of the human‑to‑human answer relation, then **PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h)** holds.  
- **Assumption:** The authors correctly specify the source and target objects for each morphism and that stochastic composition does not introduce extraneous elements.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Unknown (full formal definitions not available in the summary).  

**Mechanism 2 – Refusal as a vacuous sound answer**  
- **Claim:** Mapping a refusal to the empty proposition set trivially satisfies the inclusion metric, preventing false positives for soundness.  
- **Mechanism:** By defining the LLM’s answer set for a refusal as ∅, we have ∅ ⊆ Phuman(h) for any *h*, so the soundness predicate evaluates to true regardless of the underlying knowledge gap.  
- **Assumption:** The paper treats refusals uniformly and does not differentiate between “safe” and “over‑cautious” refusals.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Unknown (details of the refusal policy are not quoted).  

**Mechanism 3 – Set‑inclusion metric aligns with epistemic adequacy**  
- **Claim:** Classifying outputs via set inclusion captures the intuitive notion of “no hallucination” without requiring numeric thresholds.  
- **Mechanism:** If every proposition the LLM could plausibly generate is already endorsed by the human epistemic state, the LLM cannot produce a proposition that is false relative to that state. This aligns with a minimal epistemic adequacy criterion.  
- **Assumption:** The human answer set *Phuman(h)* is well‑defined and exhaustive for the task at hand.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Unknown (formal definition of *Phuman(h)* not provided).  

## Foundational Learning  

1. **Evidence‑anchored reasoning**  
   - *Why needed:* Ensures every claim traces back to a specific text anchor, preventing speculation.  
   - *Quick check:* Can you point to the exact sentence in the source that supports the claim?  

2. **Conditional claims**  
   - *Why needed:* Mechanisms hold only under defined conditions; stating boundaries avoids overgeneralisation.  
   - *Quick check:* Have you specified the conditions under which the claim would fail?  

3. **Break conditions**  
   - *Why needed:* Knowing when a mechanism stops working is as important as knowing when it works.  
   - *Quick check:* What must be true for this mechanism to fail, and have you tested for it?  

## Architecture Onboarding  

- **Component map:** Human Epistemic Situation H → Prompt → LLM G → Output O → Interpretation → Proposition Pred(W)  
- **Critical path:** H → Prompt → G → O → Interpretation → Pred(W) (each morphism must preserve truth‑preserving relations).  
- **Design tradeoffs:**  
  - *Expressivity vs. determinism*: richer prompts increase coverage but raise stochastic inference errors.  
  - *Dataset breadth vs. bias*: larger datasets reduce coverage gaps but may introduce systematic bias.  
  - *Refusal policy vs. completeness*: aggressive refusal ensures soundness but may limit useful answers.  
- **Failure signatures:**  
  - Tokenisation distortion (mis‑aligned strings).  
  - Dataset bias (systematic omission of relevant facts).  
  - Training generalisation error (over‑fitting to training distribution).  
  - Prompting ambiguity (multiple plausible parses).  
  - Inference stochasticity (random sampling yields divergent outputs).  
  - Interpretation error (mis‑mapping output tokens to propositions).  
- **First 3 experiments (suggested):**  
  1. Provide the full paper text (title, abstract, key sections) to enable evidence‑anchored analysis.  
  2. Supply corpus signals or related‑work citations for triangulation of claims.  
  3. Specify the primary outcome of interest (e.g., classification of LLM responses) to focus the mechanism analysis.  

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out  
The paper does not list explicit open questions, but the discussion of systematic failure points suggests several research directions:  
- **Tokenisation distortion:** How can multilingual tokenisers be designed to minimise relational mis‑alignment?  
- **Dataset bias quantification:** What metrics can capture bias within the categorical framework, and how can they be mitigated?  
- **Prompt design:** Which prompt structures reduce stochastic inference errors while preserving answer completeness?  
- **Refusal calibration:** How to balance the safety of refusals against the loss of potentially useful information?  
- **Empirical validation:** Can the inclusion metric be correlated with human judgments across diverse domains?  

## Limitations  
- Source material unavailable; analysis relies on a brief summary.  
- Scope of the categorical model may omit multimodal grounding or external tool use.  
- No empirical validation; the soundness metric is purely logical.  

## Confidence  
| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| The Rel‑based categorical analysis is internally coherent | Medium |
| Soundness = PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h) correctly formalises an “epistemic bridge” | Low |
| LLMs “circumvent” rather than solve the symbol‑grounding problem | Low |  

## Next Checks  
1. **Retrieve and annotate the full paper** – extract formal definitions of objects, morphisms, and the soundness condition to confirm they match the summary.  
2. **Cross‑compare the framework** with existing formal treatments of symbol grounding (e.g., unified formal theories) to assess novelty and completeness.  
3. **Apply the inclusion metric to a benchmark set** of LLM responses (e.g., the photosynthesis and soil examples) and compare the classifications (sound, incomplete, hallucinatory) against human expert labels.
