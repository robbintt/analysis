# Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process  

## Quick Facts  
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.17380  
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17380  
- **Reference count:** 40  
- **Primary result:** RLVR‑trained language‑reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit markedly better alignment with the ideal causal graph and reduced spurious feature reliance compared with vanilla LLMs and distilled LRMs.  

## Executive Summary  
The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) and distilled language‑reasoning models (LRMs) solve reasoning tasks by exploiting genuine causal mechanisms or by leaning on surface correlations. By formalizing the reasoning pipeline as a structural causal model (SCM) over four variables—problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y)—the authors compare three model families: standard LLMs, distilled LRMs, and LRMs further optimized with reinforcement‑learning‑via‑rewards (RLVR). Empirical analyses reveal that RLVR‑trained LRMs achieve substantially higher fidelity to the prescribed causal graph, display fewer spurious feature dependencies, and consequently mitigate unfaithfulness and bias. In contrast, vanilla LLMs and non‑RLVR LRMs retain notable causal deficiencies.  

## Method Summary  
The authors construct an SCM linking instruction, internal thinking, intermediate reasoning steps, and final answer. They train baseline LLMs and distilled LRMs, then apply an RLVR stage that augments the loss with a causal‑consistency reward encouraging alignment between the learned graph and the ideal causal structure. Model behavior is probed using feature‑importance and intervention analyses to quantify spurious dependencies and causal fidelity. Comparative experiments track how these metrics evolve throughout RLVR optimization.  

## Key Results  
- RLVR‑trained LRMs achieve significantly higher alignment with the ideal causal graph than vanilla LLMs and distilled LRMs.  
- Spurious feature dependence declines steadily as RLVR training progresses, coinciding with improvements in causal‑relationship metrics.  
- The enhanced causal alignment translates into measurable reductions in unfaithfulness, bias, and answer inconsistency.  

## Why This Works (Mechanism)  
The paper does not provide explicit mechanistic details beyond the high‑level claim that RLVR introduces a causal‑consistency reward. Consequently, specific causal pathways, assumptions, or break conditions cannot be extracted from the available material.  

## Foundational Learning  
| Concept | Why needed | Quick check |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Structural Causal Models (SCM) | Provides the formal language to represent the four‑variable reasoning pipeline and to define “ideal” causal relationships. | Verify that the SCM correctly encodes Z → T → X → Y without extra edges. |
| Reinforcement Learning via Rewards (RLVR) | Supplies an optimization signal that explicitly penalizes deviations from the ideal causal graph. | Confirm that the reward term correlates with a reduction in structural‑Hamming‑distance. |
| Causal Graph Alignment Metrics | Quantifies how closely a model’s learned dependencies match the prescribed causal structure. | Compute SHD or similar metric on a held‑out validation set. |
| Feature‑Importance / Intervention Analysis | Detects spurious dependencies that the model may be exploiting. | Perform mask/perturb experiments on identified “spurious” features and measure answer change. |
| Bias / Unfaithfulness Evaluation | Links causal fidelity to downstream fairness and reliability concerns. | Compare bias scores (e.g., demographic parity) before and after RLVR. |

## Architecture Onboarding  
- **Component map:** Instruction (Z) → Thinking Process (T) → Reasoning Steps (X) → Answer (Y) → Reward (causal‑consistency) → Parameter Update  
- **Critical path:** Accurate estimation of the causal graph from model internals → computation of the causal‑consistency reward → gradient update that reduces graph‑misalignment.  
- **Design tradeoffs:**  
  1. **Reward strength vs. task performance** – a strong causal reward may hurt raw accuracy if the ideal graph is misspecified.  
  2. **Computation overhead** – graph inference and intervention steps add latency compared with standard fine‑tuning.  
  3. **Model capacity** – enforcing causal structure may require larger models to capture both task knowledge and causal constraints.  
- **Failure signatures:**  
  - Persistent high structural‑Hamming‑distance despite RLVR training.  
  - No reduction in spurious feature importance after many RLVR epochs.  
  - Degraded downstream accuracy while causal metrics improve, indicating over‑regularization.  
- **First 3 experiments:**  
  1. Replicate the baseline SCM construction and compute alignment metrics for a vanilla LLM on a reasoning benchmark.  
  2. Apply the RLVR reward to a distilled LRM and track the evolution of spurious feature importance across training steps.  
  3. Conduct controlled interventions on identified spurious features to validate that RLVR‑trained models rely less on them than baselines.  

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out  
- How does the reported improvement in causal‑graph alignment generalize to other model families and domains beyond the proprietary LLM/LRM sets examined?  
- Are the causal‑consistency rewards robust to misspecification of the “ideal” causal graph, and what are the consequences of such misspecification?  
- Can controlled interventions on spurious features conclusively demonstrate that RLVR reduces reliance on correlation‑based shortcuts?  
- What is the relative contribution of each RLVR reward component (e.g., causal‑consistency term vs. standard task reward) to the observed gains?  

## Limitations  
- Lack of detailed methodological description (e.g., exact SCM specification, reward formulation) hampers reproducibility.  
- Causal claims rely on indirect proxies (feature importance, graph distance) rather than direct interventional experiments.  
- Results are reported on a limited set of proprietary models, leaving external validity uncertain.  

## Confidence  
- **RLVR‑trained LRMs show markedly better causal‑graph alignment** → Low  
- **Spurious feature dependence declines as RLVR progresses** → Medium  
- **Vanilla LLMs and distilled LRMs retain significant causal deficiencies** → Low  

## Next Checks  
1. **Re‑implement the SCM analysis** on a publicly available reasoning benchmark (e.g., GSM‑8K) and compute structural‑Hamming‑distance between the learned graph and the prescribed ideal graph for each model variant.  
2. **Run controlled interventions** on identified “spurious” features (e.g., mask or perturb them) and measure the change in answer correctness to confirm that RLVR truly reduces reliance on those features.  
3. **Ablate the RLVR reward components** (e.g., remove the causal‑consistency term) and observe whether the reported improvements in causal‑graph metrics and bias reduction disappear, establishing a causal link between the reward design and the outcomes.
