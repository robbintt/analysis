# Multimodal Attention-Aware Fusion for Diagnosing Distal Myopathy: Evaluating Model Interpretability and Clinician Trust

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.01316
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01316
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture achieves improved classification accuracy and interpretability for distal myopathy diagnosis, though clinical trust and anatomical specificity remain limited.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture to diagnose distal myopathy, a rare muscular disorder, by combining global contextual features from ResNet50 and local details from BagNet33. The architecture uses an attention gate mechanism to integrate these features, aiming to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability for clinical use. While the model outperforms single-stream and alternative fusion strategies on proprietary and benchmark datasets, radiologist feedback reveals persistent gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical utility. The findings highlight the need for richer interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinical expectations and support trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture that leverages ResNet50 for global contextual features and BagNet33 for local, interpretable details. These features are integrated via an attention gate mechanism, which weights and combines the inputs to improve classification accuracy and interpretability. The model is evaluated on a proprietary distal myopathy dataset and the BUSI benchmark, using both quantitative metrics (such as coherence and incremental deletion) and qualitative feedback from radiologists. The approach aims to balance model performance with clinical trust by enhancing the interpretability of AI-driven diagnostic tools.

## Key Results
- The multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture outperforms single-stream and alternative fusion strategies in classification accuracy on both distal myopathy and BUSI datasets.
- Quantitative interpretability metrics show functional improvements, but radiologist feedback indicates insufficient anatomical specificity and clinical utility.
- The study underscores the need for richer interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to enhance clinician trust in AI diagnostics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture combines global and local features using an attention gate mechanism, which allows the model to focus on the most relevant information for diagnosis. This multimodal approach leverages the strengths of both ResNet50 (global context) and BagNet33 (local details), enabling more accurate and interpretable predictions. The attention mechanism dynamically adjusts feature weights, improving the model's ability to highlight clinically relevant regions while maintaining high classification performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combining multiple data streams (e.g., global and local features) to improve model performance and robustness. *Why needed*: Distal myopathy diagnosis requires both broad context and fine-grained details. *Quick check*: Compare single-stream vs. multimodal performance on validation sets.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Dynamically weighting input features to focus on the most relevant information. *Why needed*: Enhances interpretability by highlighting clinically significant regions. *Quick check*: Analyze attention maps for alignment with radiologist annotations.
- **Interpretability Metrics**: Quantitative measures (e.g., coherence, incremental deletion) to evaluate model transparency. *Why needed*: Ensures the model's decisions are understandable and trustworthy for clinicians. *Quick check*: Correlate metric scores with clinician feedback.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Incorporating clinician input to refine model interpretability and trust. *Why needed*: Bridges the gap between technical performance and clinical utility. *Quick check*: Conduct surveys or interviews with radiologists to validate model outputs.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: ResNet50 (global features) -> Attention Gate -> BagNet33 (local details) -> Fusion Layer -> Classification Output
- **Critical Path**: Global features extracted by ResNet50 are weighted by the attention gate and combined with local details from BagNet33, followed by classification.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing global context (ResNet50) with local interpretability (BagNet33) to optimize both accuracy and trust.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor attention gate performance may lead to overemphasis on irrelevant features, reducing interpretability and clinical trust.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate attention gate sensitivity by varying input feature weights.
  2. Compare interpretability metrics (coherence, incremental deletion) across fusion strategies.
  3. Validate model outputs against radiologist annotations for anatomical specificity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- The proprietary dataset limits external validation and generalizability of the findings.
- Interpretability metrics may not fully capture the clinical nuances required for rare diseases like distal myopathy.
- Limited radiologist feedback sample size may affect the generalizability of trust assessments.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multimodal attention-aware fusion improves classification accuracy over single-stream and alternative fusion strategies.
- **Medium Confidence**: Interpretability metrics show functional improvements, but clinical utility and anatomical specificity remain insufficient for full clinician trust.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to broader clinical settings, given reliance on proprietary datasets and limited radiologist feedback.

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional, publicly available datasets specific to distal myopathy or similar rare diseases to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct a larger-scale study with a diverse group of radiologists to validate the interpretability and trustworthiness of the model in real-world clinical settings.
3. Explore advanced interpretability techniques, such as saliency maps or gradient-based methods, to improve anatomical specificity and align with clinical expectations.
