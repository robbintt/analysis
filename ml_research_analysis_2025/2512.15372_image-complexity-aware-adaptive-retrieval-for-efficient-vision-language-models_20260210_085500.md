# Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15372
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 20% faster image encoding while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance

## Executive Summary
ICAR introduces an adaptive retrieval mechanism that enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images while processing complex images through full network depth. The approach solves cross-modal alignment challenges through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both early-exit and full-depth paths. This enables sustainable scaling of vision-language systems by reducing computational costs without sacrificing significant performance.

## Method Summary
The ICAR framework combines image complexity assessment with adaptive retrieval to optimize VLM inference. It uses ConvNeXt-IC for image complexity prediction, achieving 0.959 Pearson correlation with human judgment. The dual-path training strategy addresses cross-modal alignment by training early-exit and full-depth paths to produce compatible embeddings. The system is evaluated across standard benchmarks and real-world web data, demonstrating significant efficiency gains while maintaining high accuracy.

## Key Results
- 20% faster image encoding while maintaining category-level performance
- Maintains 95% of instance-level performance compared to full-depth processing
- ConvNeXt-IC achieves 0.959 Pearson correlation with human judgment for image complexity assessment
- 4.4x faster complexity prediction compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ICAR works by dynamically adjusting the depth of vision transformer processing based on image complexity. Simple images are processed through early exits, saving computation, while complex images go through full network depth to maintain accuracy. The dual-path training ensures that embeddings from both early-exit and full-depth paths remain aligned for cross-modal tasks. This adaptive approach balances efficiency and performance by matching computational resources to image complexity requirements.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision Transformers** - Transformer architectures applied to image processing instead of text. Needed for understanding the base architecture that ICAR modifies. Quick check: Verify that ViT blocks can be interrupted at multiple stages for early exits.

**Cross-Modal Alignment** - Ensuring visual and textual embeddings occupy compatible semantic spaces. Critical for VLM performance. Quick check: Confirm that dual-path training produces embeddings with similar distribution statistics.

**Image Complexity Assessment** - Quantifying visual information density and processing difficulty. Enables adaptive computation. Quick check: Validate that complexity scores correlate with actual processing requirements.

**Early-Exit Strategies** - Stopping model execution at intermediate layers based on confidence or complexity metrics. Key efficiency mechanism. Quick check: Ensure early exits don't create distribution shifts in output embeddings.

**ConvNeXt Architecture** - ConvNet-inspired design adapted for vision tasks. Used as backbone for complexity assessment. Quick check: Verify that ConvNeXt features capture relevant visual complexity cues.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Image -> ConvNeXt-IC (complexity assessment) -> Decision module -> Early-exit path OR Full-depth path -> Shared embedding space

Critical Path: Input image flows through ConvNeXt-IC for complexity scoring, then routing decision determines whether to use early-exit or full-depth processing, with both paths converging to compatible embeddings for cross-modal tasks.

Design Tradeoffs: Early exits provide efficiency but risk accuracy loss on complex images; dual-path training adds training complexity but ensures alignment; complexity assessment overhead must be outweighed by computational savings.

Failure Signatures: Over-aggressive early exits on borderline complex images, misalignment between early-exit and full-depth embeddings, complexity assessment errors leading to incorrect routing decisions.

First Experiments:
1. Measure distribution similarity between early-exit and full-depth embeddings using metrics like KL divergence
2. Test routing accuracy by manually labeling image complexity and comparing to ConvNeXt-IC predictions
3. Benchmark end-to-end latency with and without ConvNeXt-IC overhead to verify claimed efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The cross-modal alignment strategy using dual-path training with additional text encoders introduces complexity that may not generalize well to other VLM architectures or training regimes. The performance degradation metrics are measured against specific benchmarks that may not represent the full diversity of real-world web images. The computational overhead of running ConvNeXt-IC at inference time needs clearer accounting in the total system efficiency claims.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Image complexity assessment correlation with human judgment, basic early-exit implementation
- Medium confidence: Cross-modal alignment effectiveness, real-world web data generalization
- Low confidence: Total system efficiency claims accounting for ConvNeXt-IC overhead

## Next Checks

1. Measure total end-to-end latency including ConvNeXt-IC complexity prediction to verify the claimed 20% speedup isn't offset by additional processing overhead
2. Test ICAR's cross-modal alignment on diverse VLM architectures beyond the specific models used in the paper to assess generalization
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the dual-path training to isolate the contribution of each component to the final performance metrics
