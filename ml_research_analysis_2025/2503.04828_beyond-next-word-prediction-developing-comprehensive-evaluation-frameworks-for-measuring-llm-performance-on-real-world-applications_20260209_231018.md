# Beyond Next Word Prediction: Developing Comprehensive Evaluation Frameworks for measuring LLM performance on real world applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.04828
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04828
- **Authors**: Vishakha Agrawal; Archie Chaudhury; Shreya Agrawal
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: Proposed generalized evaluation framework combining game-based architectures and tool-based environments for comprehensive LLM assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world applications by moving beyond traditional next-token prediction tasks. The authors propose a novel evaluation framework that models environments as state-transition machines, where LLMs interact through defined action spaces and scaffolding infrastructure. This approach enables systematic observation of LLM decision-making over time, capturing reasoning traces that reveal both technical performance and potential safety concerns. The framework aims to provide a more realistic assessment of model capabilities across various contexts, from financial reasoning to ethical decision-making.

## Method Summary
The framework models environments as state-transition systems where LLMs interact through bounded action spaces rather than free-form text generation. At each time step t, the environment's current state is readable by the LLM, which then issues action calls (state-transition functions) via tool interfaces. Scaffolding infrastructure validates and applies these transitions, returning the new state to the LLM for the next iteration. The system captures reasoning traces at each turn, enabling post-hoc analysis of decision patterns and safety considerations. The framework supports various evaluation dimensions including technical performance, practical applicability, user experience, latency, resource utilization, and ethical behavior.

## Key Results
- Framework combines game-based architectures and tool-based environments for dynamic assessment scenarios
- Enables measurement of LLM capabilities beyond technical performance to include practical applicability and user experience
- Provides systematic observation of reasoning traces to identify safety concerns and decision patterns
- Allows evaluation across diverse contexts including financial reasoning, game playing, and ethical decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modeling evaluations as state-transition systems enables systematic observation of LLM decision-making over time.
- Mechanism: The environment exists as a readable state at time t; the LLM issues actions (state-transition functions) via tool calls; scaffolding infrastructure applies these transitions; the LLM observes the new state and iterates. This creates an observable reasoning loop rather than a single-shot output.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably parse state representations and select appropriate actions from a defined tool space.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section 6]
- Break condition: If state representations become too large or ambiguous for the LLM to parse, action selection degrades and the loop collapses into random or default behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Constraining interaction through a bounded action space makes LLM behavior inspectable and reproducible.
- Mechanism: Rather than free-form text generation, the LLM selects from a predefined set of tools (API calls). Each tool maps to a specific state transition. This constraint forces the LLM's reasoning into observable decision points, enabling systematic comparison across models and runs.
- Core assumption: The action space is sufficiently expressive to accomplish meaningful tasks without being so large that selection becomes intractable.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 6], [Section 5]
- Break condition: If the action space is underspecified or tools have ambiguous effects, the LLM may produce syntactically valid but semantically meaningless action sequences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Capturing reasoning traces at each turn surfaces decision patterns that final-output metrics miss, including potential safety violations.
- Mechanism: The LLM is prompted to explain its action choice at every turn. These traces are stored and analyzed alongside outcomes. This reveals whether correct results came from sound reasoning, luck, or problematic shortcuts (e.g., deceptive strategies).
- Core assumption: LLMs will produce reasoning traces that meaningfully reflect their actual decision process, not post-hoc rationalizations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section 6]
- Break condition: If the LLM learns to produce plausible but unfaithful justifications, safety analysis becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: State machines and formal game representations
  - Why needed here: The entire framework models environments as state-transition systems with bounded action spaces. Without understanding states, transitions, and turn-taking dynamics, the architecture will be opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you sketch how a chess game maps to (state, action space, transition function, terminal condition)?

- **Concept**: LLM tool use and function calling
  - Why needed here: The LLM interacts with the environment via structured API calls, not free text. Understanding how models parse tool schemas and generate valid calls is prerequisite for designing the action space.
  - Quick check question: Given a tool schema with parameters, what failure modes occur when an LLM generates malformed or semantically incorrect calls?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metrics beyond accuracy
  - Why needed here: The paper argues for measuring technical performance, practical applicability, user experience, latency, resource utilization, and safety—all dimensions static benchmarks ignore.
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves 95% accuracy but takes 10x longer than alternatives and produces unethical reasoning traces, how would you weight these factors for deployment decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment (state-transition machine) -> Action space (tool schemas) -> Scaffolding (infrastructure) -> Simulation controller (turn management) -> Trace logger (reasoning capture)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Define the environment's state variables and legal transitions
  2. Specify the action space as tool schemas the LLM can call
  3. Build scaffolding to validate and execute actions against the environment
  4. Design simulation parameters (goal, turns, termination conditions)
  5. Implement trace logging for reasoning and actions
  6. Run pilot simulations, analyze traces, iterate on action-space expressiveness

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Action-space granularity: Finer-grained tools enable more precise behavior but increase selection complexity; coarser tools simplify selection but reduce observability
  - State visibility: Full state exposure aids reasoning but may exceed context limits; partial observability increases realism but risks confusion
  - Simulation length: Longer simulations reveal multi-step reasoning but cost more; shorter ones are cheaper but may miss emergent behaviors
  - Safety probing: Adding "forbidden" tools to test unethical behavior increases safety insight but requires careful containment

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Action-space mismatch: LLM attempts actions not in the tool schema or produces syntactically invalid calls
  - State parsing errors: LLM misinterprets environment state, leading to incoherent action sequences
  - Reasoning-trace drift: Justifications become disconnected from actual actions, reducing trace utility
  - Simulation deadlock: LLM loops on the same action or fails to make progress toward the goal
  - Scaffolding brittleness: Edge cases in action execution cause unhandled errors, terminating the simulation prematurely

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a minimal environment (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or simple grid navigation) with a constrained action space; validate that scaffolding correctly applies state transitions and logs traces
  2. Compare two models on the same simulation: measure accuracy, latency, and reasoning-trace quality. Identify where reasoning diverges from action selection
  3. Introduce a safety-probing tool (e.g., an action that could be used unethically) in a low-stakes simulation; analyze whether models use it and how they justify its use in traces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LLMs on the proposed state-transition framework correlate with real-world deployment success compared to traditional static benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will involve creating an actual live implementation of this framework... [to] measure... base-level performance... [and] reasoning traces."
- Why unresolved: The paper currently provides a theoretical architecture and generalized foundation but has not yet validated the framework through a live implementation or empirical study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from a live deployment where model performance in the simulation environment accurately predicts outcomes in practical business scenarios (e.g., financial reasoning).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the analysis of reasoning traces in long-term simulations effectively identify safety risks or unethical strategies that remain undetected in single-turn evaluations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "a longer-term simulation may reveal thought processes inherent within the LLM that may raise various safety flags" and suggest adding tools for fraudulent actions to test guardrails.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluations focus on final outputs; it is unclear if the proposed "scaffolding" can reliably surface harmful intermediate reasoning steps across diverse models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a model employing unethical strategies (e.g., fraud in a trading simulation) that are visible in the reasoning trace but would pass in a result-oriented static benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what degree does incorporating crowd-sourced tasks improve the validity and coverage of evaluations compared to expert-designed datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose "future work could also include the inclusion of specific tasks created by a crowd sourced set of humans... for tasks centered around specific tasks."
- Why unresolved: While crowd-sourcing is proposed to address the disconnect between current complex benchmarks and typical user interactions, its efficacy within this specific framework is hypothetical.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that crowd-sourced environment tasks better predict user satisfaction or model utility than datasets like "Humanity's Last Exam."

## Limitations

- The framework's practical effectiveness hinges on unverified assumptions about LLM ability to parse complex state representations and produce faithful reasoning traces
- Safety analysis capability depends on detecting subtle reasoning patterns that current evaluation methods may miss
- The paper lacks empirical validation through controlled experiments demonstrating the proposed mechanisms work as intended

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core architectural design (state-transition environment + bounded action space + trace logging) is internally consistent and builds on established patterns from game-based evaluation and tool-use research
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this framework enables more comprehensive evaluation than static benchmarks, as this requires empirical comparison across diverse domains
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that reasoning traces can reliably surface safety concerns, given the lack of validation that LLMs produce faithful justifications

## Next Checks

1. **State-parsing benchmark**: Test the framework with incrementally complex state representations to identify the context-window and parsing limits where LLM performance degrades
2. **Trace-fidelity study**: Compare LLM reasoning traces against ground-truth decision processes in controlled simulations to quantify the rate of rationalization versus faithful explanation
3. **Action-space expressiveness analysis**: Systematically vary the granularity of action spaces in identical tasks and measure the tradeoff between reasoning quality and selection complexity
