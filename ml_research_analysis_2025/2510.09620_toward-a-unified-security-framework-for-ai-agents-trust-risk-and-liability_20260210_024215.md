# Toward a Unified Security Framework for AI Agents: Trust, Risk, and Liability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09620
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09620
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Introduces a unified Trust, Risk, and Liability (TRL) framework linking interdependent trust, risk, and liability systems to guide development and deployment of trustworthy, low-risk, and responsible AI agents.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fragmentation in AI agent security governance by proposing a unified Trust, Risk, and Liability (TRL) framework. The framework integrates three interdependent systems—trust, risk, and liability—into a cyclic structure where each subsystem affects and is affected by the others. By systematically establishing trust through four dimensions, analyzing risks via ranking-based or math-based models, and attributing liability through role-based or causality-based models, the TRL framework aims to foster public trust, reduce legal disputes, and enable broader AI adoption in sectors like 6G networks.

## Method Summary
The TRL framework consists of three interconnected systems: (1) a Trust System with four establishment dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) mapped to three core requirements (dependability, controllability, alignability); (2) a Risk System using either ranking-based evaluation (risk indicators → matrix → level 0-3 → mitigation strategy) or math-based models (Monte-Carlo, Bayesian networks); and (3) a Liability System employing role-based (RACI/DACI) or causality-based (intention-culpability, risk-negligence) attribution models. The framework is designed to be applied cyclically to any AI agent scenario, with no specific datasets or quantitative metrics defined—reproduction requires defining scenarios and stakeholders, then applying each system sequentially.

## Key Results
- The TRL framework links trust, risk, and liability into an interdependent cyclic structure where improvements in one subsystem propagate to others.
- Four trust dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) systematically increase user willingness to activate AI agent functionalities when optimized.
- Layered risk mitigation strategies matched to quantified risk levels reduce both over-caution and under-protection in AI agent deployment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating trust, risk, and liability into a single cyclic framework may produce more coherent governance outcomes than addressing each domain independently.
- Mechanism: The three subsystems form interdependent relationships—responsibility influences trust; risk triggers accountability mechanisms; trust levels reduce risk management costs. This creates feedback loops where improvements in one subsystem propagate to others.
- Core assumption: Organizations will actually operationalize all three subsystems rather than cherry-picking components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately without acknowledging their inter-influential nature."
  - [section III] "The three systems are interdependent and interconnected... Each system affects and is affected by the others."
  - [corpus] Related work on "Securing Agentic AI" similarly emphasizes comprehensive threat models but does not explicitly model the trust-liability feedback loop.
- Break condition: If any subsystem is omitted or under-resourced, the feedback loop weakens; e.g., strong risk analysis without liability attribution may leave stakeholders unaccountable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structured trust establishment through four dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) may systematically increase user willingness to activate AI agent functionalities.
- Mechanism: Trust is decomposed into designable components—cultural significance and memorability (name), facial expressions and voice modulation (exterior), response comprehensibility and timeliness (behavior), and model capability plus privacy protection (interior). These map to three core requirements: dependability, controllability, and alignability.
- Core assumption: Users form trust judgments along these specific dimensions in the order presented.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV] "The trust system... consists of four establishment dimensions, three core trust requirements, two trust aspects, and one purpose."
  - [section VII.A] Details how each dimension applies to AI agents specifically (e.g., "varying volumes, tones, and occasional emphasis will increase listener's perceived authenticity").
  - [corpus] Evidence is weak; neighboring papers focus on threat modeling rather than trust decomposition.
- Break condition: If dimensions conflict (e.g., highly capable but non-transparent interior), trust may not form despite individual dimension optimization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Layered risk mitigation strategies (avoidance, transfer, reduction, acceptance) matched to quantified risk levels may reduce both over-caution and under-protection.
- Mechanism: Risk levels (0-3) are determined via either ranking-based evaluation against indicators (privacy, confidentiality, auditability) or math-based models (Monte-Carlo, Bayesian networks). Each level maps to a specific mitigation posture, enabling context-sensitive responses rather than one-size-fits-all policies.
- Core assumption: Risk indicators can be reliably evaluated and mapped to discrete levels before harm occurs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V] "Risk avoidance should be adopted for scenarios or events corresponding to the highest level of risks. Risk transfer is suitable for high-risk events."
  - [section VII.B] Demonstrates the phone call scenario with four risk levels and corresponding mitigation strategies.
  - [corpus] "A Survey on Autonomy-Induced Security Risks in Large Model-Based Agents" documents cascading risks in multi-agent systems but does not propose tiered mitigation mapping.
- Break condition: If risk indicators are poorly defined or evaluation is inconsistent, the level assignment becomes arbitrary, leading to mismatched mitigation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **RACI/DACI Attribution Models**
  - Why needed here: Role-based liability attribution requires understanding how to map stakeholders to Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (or Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed) roles per scenario.
  - Quick check question: Given an AI agent making an erroneous phone call, can you assign RACI roles to the user, AI agent, developer company, and call recipient?

- Concept: **Risk Mitigation Tiering**
  - Why needed here: The framework maps risk levels to specific strategies (avoid, transfer, reduce, accept); understanding when to apply each is essential for operationalization.
  - Quick check question: A scenario scores high on privacy risk but low on auditability risk—which mitigation strategy applies and why?

- Concept: **Trustworthiness vs. Trust Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes trust (subjective relationship) from trustworthiness (objective measure); conflation leads to designing for perception rather than capability.
  - Quick check question: An AI agent has strong technical trust markers (identity, algorithm fairness) but weak societal trust markers (brand, cultural fit)—is it trustworthy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Trust System**: 4 establishment dimensions → 3 core requirements → 2 trust aspects (societal/technical) → 1 purpose (word-deed consistency)
  - **Risk System**: Risk indicators → evaluation (ranking or math-based) → risk level (0-3) → mitigation strategy
  - **Liability System**: Attribution model selection (role-based or causality-based) → stakeholder-role mapping → accountability mechanism enforcement

- Critical path: For any AI agent use case—(1) evaluate trust dimensions to determine if functionality should be enabled; (2) analyze risks using chosen model to assign risk level; (3) apply mitigation strategy; (4) if harm occurs, use attribution model to assign liability; (5) accountability mechanisms enforce consequences, feeding back to trust.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ranking-based risk analysis is simpler but less precise than math-based models (Monte-Carlo, Bayesian networks).
  - Role-based attribution is faster to apply but may miss causal nuance compared to intention-and-culpability models.
  - High trust reduces risk management cost but may mask latent risks if trust is misplaced.

- Failure signatures:
  - Trust system failure: Users avoid activating AI features despite technical capability (low utilization as with Siri cited in [section I]).
  - Risk system failure: Unexpected harm occurs that was not classified or mitigated (indicator gaps).
  - Liability system failure: Post-harm disputes with no clear stakeholder responsibility assignment (attribution model not applied or ambiguous roles).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Phone Call Scenario Walkthrough**: Apply the full TRL framework to the paper's phone call example—document trust dimensions, evaluate risk indicators, assign risk level, choose mitigation, and map RACI roles. Verify outputs match the paper's guidance.
  2. **Indicator Sensitivity Test**: For a chosen AI agent use case (e.g., email drafting), vary risk indicator weights and observe how risk level assignments change. Document threshold conditions that shift the mitigation strategy.
  3. **Attribution Model Comparison**: For a simulated failure scenario, apply both role-based (RACI) and causality-based attribution. Identify where they converge and diverge in responsibility allocation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the qualitative factors in the trust system (e.g., cultural significance, societal trust) be formally quantified to serve as valid inputs for the proposed math-based risk analysis models (e.g., Monte-Carlo simulations)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper lists qualitative "establishment dimensions" for trust (Section IV) and separate "math-based" models for risk (Section V), but does not define the mathematical interface connecting subjective trust metrics to probabilistic risk calculations.
- **Why unresolved:** The framework describes the inputs (trust dimensions) and the processing method (probability models) independently without providing a conversion mechanism.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formalized mapping function or metric system that translates specific trust attributes (like "brand" or "exterior") into numerical values suitable for Bayesian network analysis.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the "control condition" (free/voluntary choice) and "epistemic condition" (actual knowledge/awareness) be technically verified in non-deterministic, learning-based AI agents for the purpose of causality-based liability attribution?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section VI.B defines these conditions based on human-centric concepts like "intention" and "foreseeability," but applies them to AI agents that operate via complex, often opaque learning algorithms.
- **Why unresolved:** Current AI agents often lack the specific "awareness" or "voluntary choice" mechanisms defined by the model, making the application of these legalistic conditions to algorithmic agents ambiguous.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A technical auditing method or interpretability tool capable of extracting "intention" or "knowledge state" proofs from an AI agent's internal model logs.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the specific technical and regulatory obstacles that must be cleared to successfully launch and promote the TRL framework within 6G network architectures?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states: "efforts still need to be taken to ensure a successful and effective launch and promotion. After clearing potential obstacles along the way, the TRL framework has the potential to contribute remarkably to... 6G networks."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper proposes the high-level framework and its value for 6G but does not detail the specific integration challenges or implementation barriers unique to telecommunications infrastructure.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A feasibility study or implementation roadmap identifying conflicts between TRL requirements (e.g., data transparency for liability) and 6G standards (e.g., low latency, privacy).

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does the interdependent TRL framework significantly improve risk mitigation speed or accuracy compared to running independent trust verification, risk analysis, and liability attribution systems in parallel?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper claims current solutions fail by targeting problems separately and proposes that the TRL's "inter-influential cyclic structure" (Section III) provides superior systematic guidance.
- **Why unresolved:** While theoretically distinct, the paper does not provide experimental data or simulations proving that the cyclic integration offers performance benefits over isolated systems.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative performance metrics from simulation environments where agents using the integrated TRL framework are tested against agents using disjointed security protocols.

## Limitations

- No operational thresholds or scoring mechanisms for ranking-based risk analysis—indicator evaluation criteria remain unspecified.
- Math-based models (Monte-Carlo, Bayesian networks) are named but lack computational parameters, distributions, or calibration methods.
- No validation methodology exists to assess whether the framework actually improves trust, reduces risk, or resolves liability disputes in practice.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The conceptual value of integrating trust, risk, and liability into a unified framework rather than treating them separately. The interdependency claims are logically sound given the cited relationships between responsibility, trust, and accountability.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific trust dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) and risk mitigation tiering approach are plausible but lack empirical validation. The order and weight of trust dimensions remain unverified assumptions.
- **Low Confidence**: The operational effectiveness of the framework in practice. Without standardized indicators, evaluation thresholds, or validation data, the framework cannot be reliably implemented as described.

## Next Checks

1. **Operationalization Test**: For a concrete AI agent use case (e.g., email drafting), implement the full TRL framework following the paper's methodology. Document where specifications are missing (indicator thresholds, scoring rubrics) and whether different evaluators reach consistent conclusions.

2. **Interdependency Validation**: Design a simulation or case study where trust, risk, and liability subsystems interact. Measure whether improvements in one subsystem (e.g., stronger liability attribution) actually propagate to others (e.g., increased user trust) as the framework claims.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Apply both role-based (RACI) and causality-based liability attribution models to the same simulated failure scenario. Quantify where they agree/disagree in responsibility allocation and assess which model better predicts actual dispute outcomes or stakeholder behavior.
