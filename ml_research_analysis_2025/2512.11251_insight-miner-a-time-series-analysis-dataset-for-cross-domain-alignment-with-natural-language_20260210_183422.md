# Insight Miner: A Time Series Analysis Dataset for Cross-Domain Alignment with Natural Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11251
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11251
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Insight Miner significantly outperforms LLaVA and GPT-4 in generating accurate time series descriptions, with performance competitive to GPT-4 when provided with extracted statistical features.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Insight Miner, a large multimodal model for generating natural language insights from time series data. The authors construct TS-Insights, the first general-domain dataset for time series and language alignment, containing 100k time series windows from 20 forecasting datasets. The dataset is generated using an agentic workflow that leverages STL decomposition and GPT-4 to synthesize coherent trend descriptions. Fine-tuning LLaVA on TS-Insights yields Insight Miner, which significantly outperforms LLaVA and GPT-4 in generating accurate time series descriptions, with performance competitive to GPT-4 when provided with extracted statistical features. The results demonstrate the feasibility of aligning time series with language through instruction tuning and highlight the potential of LMMs for time series analysis.

## Method Summary
The authors create TS-Insights by applying STL decomposition (or Gaussian Process when seasonality is absent) to extract trends from time series, then using GPT-4 to generate descriptions of these trends. The dataset contains 100k time series windows from 20 forecasting datasets. To train Insight Miner, they fine-tune LLaVA by converting time series to line plot images, processing them through a frozen vision encoder, and training only the linear projection layer while keeping both the vision encoder and LLM frozen. This approach enables efficient training (~1 hour/epoch on 8×A100 40GB) while achieving strong performance on trend description generation.

## Key Results
- Insight Miner significantly outperforms LLaVA and GPT-4 in generating accurate time series descriptions
- Performance is competitive to GPT-4 when provided with extracted statistical features
- Human evaluation by domain experts shows clear improvements over baseline approaches
- The projection-only fine-tuning approach proves sufficient for time series-language alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Statistical decomposition enables reliable trend extraction that raw LLMs cannot perform directly.
- Mechanism: The agentic workflow applies STL decomposition (or Gaussian Process when seasonality is absent) to separate time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals. The extracted trend is smoothed with a Gaussian kernel, downsampled to ~25 points, and rounded before being fed to GPT-4 for description generation.
- Core assumption: GPT-4 can accurately verbalize patterns from pre-extracted statistical features but fails to do so from raw numerical vectors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we use statistical tools to extract features from raw time series before synthesizing them into coherent trend descriptions with GPT-4"
  - [section 2]: "we found that GPT-4 fails to accurately extract each component from the raw vector"
  - [corpus]: Related work on time series-language alignment exists (e.g., "Time Series Language Model for Descriptive Caption Generation," FMR=0.54), but direct evidence on decomposition necessity is limited.
- Break condition: If raw time series vectors can be processed by stronger LLMs without decomposition, the preprocessing overhead becomes unnecessary.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Converting time series to line plot images enables reuse of pretrained vision encoders for temporal pattern recognition.
- Mechanism: Time series windows are rendered as line plots using Seaborn, then processed through LLaVA's vision encoder (CLIP-based). A linear projection layer maps vision embeddings to the language embedding space, allowing the frozen LLM to condition on visualized temporal patterns.
- Core assumption: Visual representations of time series preserve sufficient information for trend description, and vision encoders trained on natural images transfer to chart-like inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "we first convert the time series window into an image using a line plot, feed the image into the vision encoder"
  - [section 4]: Vision (3 epochs) achieves scores competitive with Engineering GPT-4 on holdout datasets
  - [corpus]: FinVis-GPT (referenced in paper) demonstrates similar image-based alignment for financial charts, suggesting cross-domain transferability.
- Break condition: If dedicated time series encoders pretrained on temporal data outperform vision encoders, the image conversion step adds unnecessary information loss.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Freezing both vision encoder and LLM while only fine-tuning the projection layer is sufficient for time series-language alignment.
- Mechanism: Only the linear projection layer between vision encoder output and LLM input is trained on TS-Insights. This preserves pretrained representations while learning the cross-modal mapping. Training is efficient (~1 hour/epoch on 8×A100 40GB).
- Core assumption: The pretrained vision encoder already captures visual features relevant to time series charts, and the LLM requires no additional linguistic adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "we only finetune the linear projection layer, while keeping both the vision encoder and the language model frozen"
  - [section 5]: Using OneFitsAll (a time series encoder) instead of vision encoder failed because "the time-series encoder is not pretrained"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on projection-only fine-tuning for time series; related LMM alignment work (LLaVA, LLaVA-Med) uses similar approaches.
- Break condition: If complex temporal patterns require vision encoder adaptation or LLM domain adaptation, projection-only training may underfit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LoESS)
  - Why needed here: Core to the agentic workflow; separates time series into interpretable components for description generation.
  - Quick check question: Given a time series with daily seasonality, what three components does STL extract?

- Concept: Large Multimodal Model (LMM) Architecture
  - Why needed here: Insight Miner is built on LLaVA; understanding vision encoder + projection + LLM pipeline is essential.
  - Quick check question: In LLaVA-style architectures, what is the role of the linear projection layer?

- Concept: Instruction Tuning
  - Why needed here: TS-Insights is formatted as instruction-following examples; fine-tuning aligns model outputs with desired description format.
  - Quick check question: How does instruction tuning differ from continued pretraining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time series window -> Line plot image (Seaborn) -> Vision encoder (CLIP-based, frozen) -> Projection (Linear layer, trainable) -> LLM (Vicuna, frozen) -> Natural language trend description

- Critical path:
  1. STL/GP decomposition extracts trend from raw time series
  2. Trend -> GPT-4 -> Text description (dataset generation)
  3. Time series -> Line plot image -> Vision encoder -> Projection -> LLM -> Description (training)
  4. Only projection layer weights are updated during fine-tuning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Image-based encoding vs. direct numerical encoding: Vision encoders are well-pretrained but may lose precision; numerical encoders lack pretrained representations.
  - Projection-only fine-tuning vs. full fine-tuning: Efficient and stable but may limit adaptation capacity.
  - Trend-only descriptions vs. full decomposition: Current version focuses on trend; seasonality and residual descriptions are future work.

- Failure signatures:
  - Incoherent descriptions: Likely due to undertrained projection or vision encoder mismatch (as seen with OneFitsAll encoder).
  - Incorrect trend direction: Vision encoder may struggle with subtle slopes; consider longer training or data augmentation.
  - Domain shift on holdout: Model performs better on seen patterns; ensure training data covers diverse seasonality types.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce projection-only fine-tuning on TS-Insights subset (1 epoch, 1 GPU) to validate pipeline.
  2. Ablate vision encoder: Compare line plot images vs. raw numerical vectors processed through same LLaVA pipeline.
  3. Test on held-out domain: Evaluate Insight Miner on a new time series dataset not in Monash Archive to assess generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can pretraining a specialized time-series encoder replace the standard vision encoder to enable coherent text generation without relying on plot-to-image conversion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that replacing the vision encoder with OneFitsAll failed due to the time-series encoder not being pretrained, and explicitly leave "the pretraining of the time-series encoder as future work."
- Why unresolved: The current Insight Miner relies on a vision encoder trained on natural images. Initial attempts to use a time-series encoder resulted in incoherent descriptions, indicating a domain adaptation gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training of a time-series encoder that matches or exceeds the performance of the vision-encoder baseline on description generation tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does instruction tuning on the TS-Insights dataset improve the accuracy of LMMs on downstream numerical tasks like forecasting or classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "It will be interesting to see whether the proposed dataset can enable large multimodal models to improve forecasting or classification accuracies."
- Why unresolved: The current work focuses exclusively on the semantic alignment task (generating descriptions) and does not evaluate the model's ability to perform traditional numerical analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results showing that models fine-tuned on TS-Insights achieve lower error rates (e.g., MSE, MAE) on forecasting tasks compared to baseline models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the agentic workflow be adapted to generate descriptions for time series with multiple features, specifically capturing cross-correlations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "descriptions for time series with multiple features, such as by studying their cross-correlations" as a "more challenging task" for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology is restricted to single-feature windows ($W_k \in R^{1 \times \tau_k}$) because semantic meanings are harder to describe for multi-dimensional vectors.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the TS-Insights dataset containing multivariate windows with ground-truth descriptions of inter-feature dynamics, validated by domain experts.

## Limitations

- The methodology is restricted to single-feature windows, with multivariate time series and cross-correlation descriptions identified as future work
- Performance on time series with characteristics not represented in the 20 forecasting datasets is unknown
- The agentic workflow depends on GPT-4's accuracy for dataset generation, with no quantitative validation of this step

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core methodology of using STL decomposition + GPT-4 for dataset generation, and LLaVA fine-tuning for alignment, is well-specified and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The claim that projection-only fine-tuning is sufficient for alignment is supported by experimental results, but lacks ablation studies
- Low confidence: The assertion that GPT-4 cannot extract trends from raw vectors is based on informal observation rather than systematic testing

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative GPT-4 accuracy validation**: Measure GPT-4's accuracy on trend description generation from preprocessed features (after STL decomposition and smoothing) using automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) against ground truth statistical descriptions.
2. **Vision encoder ablation study**: Compare Insight Miner performance when using different encoders: (a) CLIP-based vision encoder on line plots, (b) raw numerical vectors processed through same LLaVA architecture, (c) specialized time series encoder with temporal pretraining.
3. **Out-of-distribution generalization test**: Evaluate Insight Miner on time series datasets with characteristics not represented in the 20 forecasting datasets (e.g., irregular sampling, multivariate, non-seasonal) to quantify performance degradation and identify generalization limits.
