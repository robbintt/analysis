# Reverse Physician-AI Relationship: Full-process Clinical Diagnosis Driven by a Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10492
- Reference count: 40
- DxDirector-7B achieves 36.23%–63.46% diagnostic accuracy across 26,018 cases, surpassing medical-adapted and general-purpose LLMs while using 25×–100× fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
This study introduces DxDirector-7B, a large language model that reverses the traditional physician-AI relationship by autonomously driving full-process clinical diagnosis from vague chief complaints. The model employs deep thinking capabilities to iteratively reason, request necessary clinical information from physicians, and generate diagnoses with authoritative medical references. DxDirector-7B significantly outperformed medical-adapted and commercial general-purpose LLMs across diverse clinical scenarios while dramatically reducing physician workload requirements.

The research demonstrates that DxDirector-7B can substitute for medical specialists in 60–75% of cases across multiple departments, establishing a new paradigm for AI-assisted clinical diagnosis. The model's structured, literature-annotated outputs provide a robust accountability framework for misdiagnosis scenarios, addressing critical concerns about liability and transparency in AI-driven healthcare applications.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed DxDirector-7B by fine-tuning a 7B-parameter base language model on clinical data to enable autonomous diagnostic reasoning. The model was trained to handle the complete diagnostic process, starting from vague chief complaints and iteratively requesting necessary clinical information from physicians. The training incorporated deep thinking capabilities that allow the model to reason through complex diagnostic scenarios and generate diagnoses supported by authoritative medical references. The evaluation spanned 26,018 cases across rare diseases, complex cases, and real-world clinical scenarios, comparing performance against both medical-adapted LLMs and commercial general-purpose models.

## Key Results
- DxDirector-7B achieved 36.23%–63.46% diagnostic accuracy, significantly surpassing medical-adapted LLMs (23.98%–35.76%) and commercial general-purpose LLMs (24.07%–46.66%)
- The model reduced physician workload to 2.68–3.15 clinical operations per case versus 4.63–12.51 for baselines, maintaining 97–98% operational effectiveness
- Expert evaluations confirmed DxDirector-7B could substitute for medical specialists in 60–75% of cases across departments including pulmonology and gastroenterology

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reversed physician-AI relationship fundamentally changes how diagnostic AI systems interact with clinical workflows. Traditional approaches require physicians to input structured data, but DxDirector-7B autonomously drives the diagnostic process by requesting relevant clinical information. This approach leverages the model's deep thinking capabilities to perform iterative reasoning, similar to how human physicians refine their diagnostic hypotheses based on emerging clinical data. The model's ability to generate structured, literature-annotated outputs creates a transparent decision-making process that facilitates physician review and establishes accountability for diagnostic decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- Clinical diagnostic reasoning patterns - Why needed: Enables the model to understand how physicians progress from symptoms to diagnosis through iterative information gathering. Quick check: Model correctly sequences diagnostic questions based on symptom presentations.
- Medical literature integration - Why needed: Provides authoritative references to support diagnostic claims and establish clinical validity. Quick check: Generated diagnoses include relevant citations from established medical sources.
- Iterative query generation - Why needed: Allows the model to request specific clinical information needed to refine diagnostic hypotheses. Quick check: Requested information directly addresses gaps in the diagnostic reasoning process.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Patient data → DxDirector-7B reasoning engine → Information request generator → Physician response → Diagnosis generator → Literature annotation → Final diagnosis output

Critical path: Vague chief complaint → Deep thinking reasoning → Targeted information requests → Clinical data integration → Literature-supported diagnosis

Design tradeoffs: The 7B parameter size enables efficient deployment while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, trading off some reasoning depth for practical clinical integration. The model prioritizes operational effectiveness (97–98%) over marginal accuracy gains to ensure reliable workflow integration.

Failure signatures: Incomplete clinical information leading to diagnostic uncertainty, conflicting symptom patterns causing reasoning dead-ends, and literature gaps preventing authoritative support for certain diagnoses.

3 first experiments:
1. Baseline accuracy comparison: Test DxDirector-7B against commercial LLMs on identical case sets to verify the 25×–100× parameter efficiency advantage
2. Workload reduction validation: Measure actual physician time savings when using DxDirector-7B versus traditional diagnostic workflows
3. Specialist substitution testing: Have medical experts independently evaluate DxDirector-7B's diagnostic recommendations against gold-standard specialist diagnoses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated on retrospective datasets that may not capture real-world clinical complexity and variability
- Workload reduction claims assume ideal conditions and don't account for time costs of reviewing and validating AI-generated requests
- The assertion that DxDirector-7B can substitute for medical specialists in 60–75% of cases is based on expert evaluations rather than direct clinical implementation

## Confidence

High: Technical innovation of reversing physician-AI relationship and model architecture are well-described and theoretically sound.

Medium: Comparative performance metrics against baselines, while methodologically documented, require independent replication to confirm generalizability.

Low: Clinical substitution claims (60–75% specialist replacement) and real-world workflow integration assessments, given their reliance on retrospective data and expert opinion rather than prospective clinical trials.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a prospective clinical trial with DxDirector-7B in actual hospital settings to measure diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and physician workload under real-world conditions with diverse patient populations.

2. Perform independent replication studies using different medical datasets and clinical scenarios to verify the model's performance claims and generalizability across various medical specialties.

3. Implement a blinded comparison study where physicians diagnose cases with and without DxDirector-7B assistance to quantify the actual impact on diagnostic accuracy, time efficiency, and decision-making quality.
