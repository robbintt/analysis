- One-line primary result: Hidden minima in two-layer ReLU networks require greater symmetry breaking than non-hidden minima, providing a structural criterion to distinguish them via tangency arc analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates hidden minima in two-layer ReLU networks by studying the symmetry and structure of arcs along which the loss is locally minimized. While prior work showed that the Hessian spectra at hidden and non-hidden minima are identical up to O(d⁻¹/²) terms, this work takes a different approach by analyzing isotypic components and tangency arcs. The main result shows that arcs emanating from hidden minima exhibit distinctive structural and symmetry properties due to O(d⁻¹/²) eigenvalue contributions. The analysis uses representation theory of symmetric groups and o-minimal structures to characterize the symmetry of tangency arcs and numerically bounds the distance to adjacent critical points.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes two-layer ReLU networks f(x;W,a) = a^⊤σ(Wx) with Gaussian inputs x ~ N(0,I_d) and identity target matrix T=I. The loss L(W,a) = ½E[(f(x;W,a) - f(x;T,b))²] is shown to be R_{an}-definable, enabling the use of o-minimal theory. Tangency arcs are constructed via a Lagrangian formulation Q(W,η,r) = L(W) + η(||W-C||² - r²), solved using Newton-Raphson with incremental radius steps. The analysis focuses on type I (hidden) and type II (non-hidden) critical points, examining their isotropy groups and the structure of tangency arcs emanating from them.

## Key Results
- Tangency arcs from hidden minima require symmetry breaking to isotropy type Δ(S_{d-p-2} × S_{p+2}), while arcs from non-hidden minima only break to Δ(S_{d-p-1} × S_{p+1})
- O(d⁻¹/²) eigenvalue contributions, previously discarded, determine the isotypic component governing tangency arc structure
- The minimal eigenvalue's association with different isotypic components (t, s_d, x_d, y_d representations) propagates to macroscopic structural differences in tangency arcs
- Numerical bounds show the distance to adjacent critical points varies significantly between hidden and non-hidden minima

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hidden (type I) minima require greater symmetry breaking than non-hidden (type II) minima, providing a structural criterion for distinguishing them.
- Mechanism: Tangency arcs emanating from hidden minima must break symmetry to isotropy type Δ(S_{d-p-2} × S_{p+2}), while arcs from non-hidden minima only break to Δ(S_{d-p-1} × S_{p+1}). This difference arises because the minimal eigenvalue of the Hessian at each minimum type associates with different isotypic components (representation-theoretic subspaces) of the symmetric group action.
- Core assumption: The symmetry structure of tangency arcs correlates with whether SGD will encounter the corresponding minimum.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our main result shows that arcs emanating from hidden minima exhibit distinctive structural and symmetry properties, arising precisely from Ω(d^{-1/2}) eigenvalue contributions."
  - [section 3.1, Theorem 2] "The maximal isotropy type of tangency arcs giving m(r) for type I (resp. II) is Δ(S_{d-p-2} × S_{p+2}) (resp. Δ(S_{d-p-1} × S_{p+1}))."
  - [corpus] Related work on flatness/generalization (arXiv:2512.01473, arXiv:2506.20779) explores similar landscape geometry questions but via different analytic tools; no direct corroboration of symmetry-breaking mechanism.
- Break condition: If isotropy group structure does not govern descent direction accessibility (e.g., SGD dynamics violate symmetry assumptions), the criterion may not predict optimization behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The O(d^{-1/2}) eigenvalue terms of the Hessian—previously discarded as negligible—determine the isotypic component governing tangency arc structure.
- Mechanism: By computing Puiseux series to two leading terms (Table 2), the minimal eigenvalue's association shifts between isotypic components (s_d, x_d, y_d representations) depending on minimum type. This subtle spectral difference propagates to macroscopic structural differences in tangency arcs.
- Core assumption: Two-term Puiseux expansions capture the relevant asymptotic structure for finite d.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A key challenge is that prior analyses have shown the Hessian spectra at hidden and non-hidden minima to coincide up to terms of order O(d^{-1/2})... arcs emanating from hidden minima exhibit distinctive structural and symmetry properties, arising precisely from Ω(d^{-1/2}) eigenvalue contributions."
  - [Table 2] Shows explicit Puiseux series with O(1/√d) corrections distinguishing eigenvalues across isotypic components.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers compute second-order spectral corrections for this purpose; this mechanism appears novel to this work.
- Break condition: If higher-order terms (beyond O(d^{-1/2})) dominate arc structure in practice, or if finite-d effects overwhelm asymptotic predictions, the mechanism may not apply.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: O-minimal definability of the loss function guarantees existence and structural regularity of tangency arcs.
- Mechanism: The Curve Selection Lemma (CSL) for o-minimal structures ensures that any definable set (including the tangency set Θ_c(f)) admits definable continuous arcs. Combined with the Monotonicity Theorem, this forces tangency arcs to be piecewise C^1 and approach critical points tangentially to Hessian eigenspaces.
- Core assumption: The loss function L remains definable in the o-minimal structure R_{an} (globally subanalytic sets).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "If f is definable then there exists a tangency arc γ parameterized by arc length satisfying L(γ(r)) = m(r)."
  - [section 7] Proves L is R_{an}-definable via its expression in terms of norms and arccos on compact domains.
  - [corpus] No corpus engagement with o-minimal theory; this is a technical import from singularity theory.
- Break condition: If loss functions outside the definable class are considered (e.g., certain non-analytic activations), arc existence guarantees may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Representation Theory of Symmetric Groups**
  - Why needed here: The paper decomposes the parameter space M(d,d) into isotypic components (trivial t, standard s_d, exterior square x_d, and y_d representations) corresponding to irreducible representations of S_d. Understanding why eigenspaces of G-maps align with isotypic components is essential for Theorem 1.
  - Quick check question: If a matrix A commutes with all permutations in S_d (i.e., is an S_d-map), what can you conclude about its eigenspaces?

- **Concept: Isotropy Groups and Symmetry Breaking**
  - Why needed here: The isotropy group G_x of a point x measures its symmetry. Critical points and tangency arcs are classified by their isotropy type; "symmetry breaking" means moving to a proper subgroup of the original symmetry group.
  - Quick check question: If a point x has isotropy ΔS_d (the diagonal subgroup), what is the smallest symmetry group a tangency arc emanating from x can have?

- **Concept: O-minimal Structures and Definability**
  - Why needed here: O-minimal structures provide a "tame topology" framework guaranteeing that definable sets have finitely many connected components and admit definable curves. The CSL and Monotonicity Theorem are standard tools here.
  - Quick check question: Why does definability of the loss function guarantee existence of a continuous arc achieving m(r)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - loss_functions/ -> Defines L(W,a) as R_{an}-definable via inner products, norms, and arccos (Section 7)
  - critical_points/ -> Enumerates type I/II families C^X_p via Puiseux series in d^{-1} (Section 2, Table 2)
  - hessian_analysis/ -> Computes two-term eigenvalue expansions per isotypic component; maps eigenvalues to representations t, s_d, x_d, y_d (Table 2, Theorem 1)
  - tangency_arcs/ -> Constructs arcs via Lagrangian formulation Q(W,η,r) = L(W) + η(||W-C||² - r²); integrates via Newton-Raphson with incremental r (Section 4)
  - symmetry/ -> Computes isotropy groups of matrices; determines maximal isotropy type per isotypic component (Section 9 proof of Theorem 1)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement kernel k(w,v) and loss L for Gaussian inputs
  2. Verify definability (automatic for R_{an} if using analytic primitives)
  3. Compute Hessian at candidate critical points to two-term accuracy
  4. Identify which isotypic component contains the minimal eigenvalue
  5. Construct tangency arcs from eigenvectors in that component; verify symmetry type via numerical projection onto fixed-point subspaces

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Puiseux order vs. computational cost:** Higher-order terms improve asymptotic accuracy but require symbolic algebra overhead. Two terms suffice for distinguishing type I/II.
  - **Numerical vs. analytic arc construction:** Analytic expressions (when available) are exact; numerical integration (Newton-Raphson) handles general definable functions but may miss bifurcations.
  - **Symmetry restriction vs. generality:** Restricting to Δ(S_{d-p} × S_p)-symmetric points simplifies analysis but excludes other critical point families.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Tangency arc fails to exist → Loss function may not be definable; check for non-subanalytic components
  - Arc symmetry type contradicts theory → Eigenvalue may be misclassified; verify isotypic decomposition
  - Numerical arc terminates prematurely → Jacobian singularity indicates nearby critical point or bifurcation; reduce step size
  - Puiseux series diverges for small d → Asymptotic regime not reached; use exact computations for d < threshold

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Table 2 eigenvalues for d ∈ {7, 20, 100} by computing Puiseux coefficients numerically; validate against theory
  2. Construct tangency arcs from C^I_0 and C^II_0 using the Lagrangian method; measure radius to first singularity and compare to Table 4
  3. Test symmetry prediction: For arcs from type I minima, verify that intersecting with M(d,d)^{Δ(S_{d-2}×S^2_1)} reduces arc radius (as theory predicts), while intersecting with M(d,d)^{Δ(S_{d-3}×S^3_1)} does not affect type II arcs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the introduction of bias terms alter the symmetry breaking properties and classification of hidden versus non-hidden minima?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 explicitly asks, "how the conclusions drawn in the unbiased setting are affected by the introduction of bias terms," noting that a separate detailed analysis is in preparation.
- Why unresolved: The current paper isolates the unbiased setting to focus on optimization obstructions, providing only the kernel formulas for the biased case without analyzing the resulting symmetry or spurious minima.
- What evidence would resolve it: An asymptotic characterization of the Hessian spectrum and tangency arc isotropy types for the biased kernel, comparing them to the unbiased results in Table 2.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do similar symmetry breaking phenomena in tangency arcs occur in deep neural architectures (beyond two layers)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 mentions that a "rigorous and systematic analysis of these phenomena in loss landscapes arising from the training of deep neural architectures is developed in [3]."
- Why unresolved: The current work restricts analysis to two-layer networks to manage complexity; deep architectures introduce additional nonsmoothness and hierarchical symmetry interactions not covered here.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of the o-minimal definability and isotropy group analysis to the loss functions of multi-layer networks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What additional phenomena regarding the connectivity of critical points arise from the numerical study of tangency sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4 states that "Additional phenomena arising from the numerical study of the tangency set are a topic of current work," specifically regarding the distances between critical points.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides initial numerical bounds but observes complex behavior in arc radii as dimension $d$ changes (e.g., global minima arcs appearing infinite for small $d$ but finite for large $d$), necessitating further classification.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic classification of the singularities and bifurcations encountered when extending tangency arcs numerically for various network widths and depths.

## Limitations

- The analysis critically depends on the asymptotic d → ∞ regime; finite-d corrections beyond O(d⁻¹/²) are not quantified and could alter arc structures
- The assumption that all relevant critical points belong to the Δ(S_{d-p} × S_p) symmetry class is unproven—other families may exist
- Numerical arc continuation relies on delicate Jacobian conditioning; small errors in symmetry detection could misclassify isotropy types
- The connection between arc symmetry and SGD accessibility remains heuristic rather than proven

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (symmetry-breaking criterion): **Medium** - structural claims are mathematically rigorous, but empirical validation of SGD prediction is limited to toy cases
- Mechanism 2 (O(d⁻¹/²) eigenvalue dominance): **High** - explicit Puiseux calculations are verifiable and distinction is mathematically sharp
- Mechanism 3 (o-minimal guarantees): **High** - relies on established results (CSL, Monotonicity Theorem) with straightforward verification that L is R_{an}-definable

## Next Checks

1. For d ∈ {20, 50, 100}, compute Puiseux series numerically at type I/II critical points and verify eigenvalue ordering matches Table 2 theory
2. Construct tangency arcs from both critical point types; measure and compare arc radii to first singularity and symmetry-breaking thresholds
3. Test whether SGD trajectories initialized near type I minima consistently require larger symmetry-breaking steps than those near type II minima, using simple gradient descent with symmetry-preserving perturbations
