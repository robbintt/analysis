# Solving Neural Min-Max Games: The Role of Architecture, Initialization & Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00389
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sufficient conditions on architecture, initialization, and dynamics guarantee global convergence to Nash equilibrium in neural min-max games with hidden convex-concave structure

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of solving non-convex non-concave zero-sum games involving neural networks. The authors focus on scenarios where both players use overparameterized two-layer networks with smooth activations, identifying conditions that ensure global convergence to Nash equilibrium. By analyzing the hidden convex-concave structure underlying these games, the paper provides theoretical guarantees for gradient-based methods in neural min-max optimization. The key insight is that overparameterization ensures Jacobian conditioning, which preserves the necessary structure for convergence despite the non-convexity of the original problem.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural min-max games through three main technical contributions. First, they establish a path-length bound for alternating gradient descent-ascent (AltGDA) using a carefully constructed potential function that tracks progress toward equilibrium. Second, they perform a spectral analysis of neural Jacobians under Gaussian initialization, showing how overparameterization ensures good conditioning properties. Third, they provide convergence guarantees for both input-optimization games and neural-parameter min-max games, demonstrating that with sufficient overparameterization (width Ω(n³)), AltGDA converges to an ε-approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. The analysis hinges on identifying and exploiting the hidden convex-concave structure that emerges from the overparameterized network architecture.

## Key Results
- Overparameterization with width Ω(n³) guarantees AltGDA convergence to ε-Nash equilibrium with high probability
- Hidden convex-concave structure preservation is critical for convergence in neural min-max games
- Gaussian initialization ensures sufficient Jacobian conditioning when networks are sufficiently wide
- First theoretical explanation for empirical success of gradient methods in large-scale neural min-max optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The convergence mechanism relies on the preservation of hidden convex-concave structure through careful control of the Jacobian spectrum. When networks are sufficiently overparameterized, the Jacobian matrix becomes well-conditioned, preventing gradient descent-ascent dynamics from being destabilized by non-convexities. The Gaussian initialization plays a crucial role in ensuring that the spectral properties of the Jacobian meet the required bounds. The alternating gradient updates exploit this structure by making monotonic progress along the potential function, which measures distance to equilibrium. This creates a self-stabilizing dynamic where the hidden convex-concave properties dominate the overall optimization landscape.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Hidden convex-concave structure** - The key theoretical construct showing that neural min-max games can be decomposed into convex-concave subproblems despite apparent non-convexity
   - Why needed: Enables application of convex optimization theory to non-convex problems
   - Quick check: Verify that the Hessian spectrum satisfies the required bounds

2. **Jacobian conditioning** - Analysis of how the spectral properties of neural network Jacobians affect optimization dynamics
   - Why needed: Determines whether gradient-based methods can reliably find equilibria
   - Quick check: Compute singular value bounds on the Jacobian under initialization

3. **Overparameterization scaling** - The relationship between network width and convergence guarantees
   - Why needed: Establishes theoretical requirements for practical success
   - Quick check: Verify that width scaling meets the Ω(n³) threshold

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Gaussian Initialization -> Neural Jacobian Analysis -> AltGDA Dynamics -> Nash Equilibrium

Critical path: The spectral analysis of neural Jacobians under Gaussian initialization directly determines whether the alternating gradient dynamics can maintain progress toward equilibrium.

Design tradeoffs: The paper balances theoretical guarantees against practical feasibility, showing that while Ω(n³) width is sufficient, it may be larger than necessary in practice.

Failure signatures: Convergence failure occurs when Jacobian conditioning is lost, typically due to insufficient overparameterization or poor initialization schemes that violate the spectral bounds.

First experiments:
1. Test AltGDA convergence on synthetic convex-concave problems with varying width parameters
2. Analyze Jacobian spectral properties under different initialization schemes
3. Compare convergence rates for input-optimization vs neural-parameter min-max games

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that the Ω(n³) overparameterization requirement may be prohibitive for large-scale applications. The analysis critically depends on the hidden convex-concave structure assumption, which may not hold for general neural min-max problems. The connection between theoretical frameworks and actual neural network training dynamics requires further validation. Alternative initialization strategies beyond Gaussian may not satisfy the required conditions, limiting generalizability.

## Limitations
- Theoretical width requirement of Ω(n³) may be impractical for large datasets
- Hidden convex-concave structure assumption may not hold for general neural min-max problems
- Results depend critically on Gaussian initialization, limiting applicability to other schemes

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of convergence on synthetic convex-concave problems with varying overparameterization levels
2. Investigation of whether the Ω(n³) scaling can be improved through refined analysis or alternative architectures
3. Experimental study of Jacobian conditioning under different initialization schemes beyond Gaussian to assess robustness of theoretical guarantees
