# Beyond Templates: Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Demonstrations via Feasibility-Aware Exploration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.20700
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20700
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: Dynamic adaptation framework improves SLM reasoning performance by up to 8.5% over static fine-tuning by selectively imitating expert steps based on feasibility estimation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting expert reasoning demonstrations to small language models (SLMs), which often suffer performance degradation due to distributional mismatch and limited capacity. The authors propose DART (Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Trajectories), a framework that estimates step-wise adaptability through solution simulation, selectively imitates feasible expert steps, and autonomously explores alternative reasoning paths when imitation becomes infeasible. The method maintains outcome consistency while aligning training data with the student model's reasoning capabilities. Experiments across multiple model scales (0.5B to 3B) and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over static fine-tuning approaches.

## Method Summary
DART operates through three core mechanisms: step-wise adaptability estimation via Monte Carlo rollouts, selective imitation guided by adaptability thresholds, and autonomous path exploration with outcome consistency constraints. For each expert reasoning step, the method simulates multiple completions from the partial trajectory prefix to estimate how often the student reaches the correct answer. When adaptability scores drop below a threshold, the framework halts expert imitation and samples alternative continuations from the student's own policy, retaining only trajectories that match the expert's final answer. The adapted trajectories are then used for standard cross-entropy fine-tuning, resulting in training data that better matches the student's reasoning capacity.

## Key Results
- DART improves reasoning accuracy by up to 8.5% over static fine-tuning across model scales
- Adaptability scores show consistent peak-and-decline patterns revealing imitation gaps across all tested model sizes
- Lexical analysis shows adapted trajectories shift toward goal-directed language (reduced "but", increased "find") aligning with student capacity
- Performance gains are most pronounced for smaller models (0.5B-1.5B) where distributional mismatch is most severe

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Step-wise Adaptability Estimation via Solution Simulation
The framework estimates learnability of expert steps before training by simulating multiple completions from trajectory prefixes. For each step, N=4 rollouts at temperature 0.1 generate completions, with adaptability scores computed as the fraction reaching correct answers. This reveals a peak-and-decline pattern indicating where expert steps exceed student capacity, allowing selective truncation of non-learnable content.

### Mechanism 2: Autonomous Path Exploration with Outcome Consistency
When expert steps become infeasible, the student explores alternative reasoning paths from high-adaptability prefixes. Sampling 8 continuations at temperature 0.7, the method retains only trajectories matching the expert's final answer. This preserves correct outcomes while allowing reasoning path divergence that better fits student capacity, outperforming simple truncation alone.

### Mechanism 3: Capacity-Aligned Lexical and Structural Adaptation
The adaptation process shifts reasoning vocabulary toward decisive, solution-oriented language. Analysis shows reduced hedging markers ("but") and increased goal-directed terms ("find") in adapted trajectories, particularly for smaller models. This lexical alignment correlates with improved reasoning performance by reducing cognitive load.

## Foundational Learning

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) / Rollout-based Evaluation**: Understanding rollout-based value estimation is prerequisite for adaptability estimation. Quick check: Can you explain why averaging outcomes from N stochastic rollouts provides a more robust estimate than a single greedy completion?
- **Distributional Mismatch in Imitation Learning**: The core problem is that expert demonstrations come from a different distribution than what the student can produce. Quick check: Why does training on expert trajectories fail when the student's inference-time distribution diverges from the training distribution?
- **Outcome vs. Process Supervision**: DART chooses outcome-level constraints over process-level supervision due to ambiguity challenges. Quick check: What are the tradeoffs between rewarding correct final answers versus rewarding correct intermediate reasoning steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Expert trajectory → Step-wise simulation → Gap detection → Exploration rollout → Outcome filtering → Distillation training
- **Critical path**: The exploration phase (temp=0.7, N=8 samples) is the computational bottleneck, sampling alternative continuations from high-adaptability prefixes
- **Design tradeoffs**: N_sim=4 balances estimation reliability vs. compute; temperature 0.7 balances diversity vs. coherence; removing repeated paths improves performance but reduces dataset size
- **Failure signatures**: High repetition ratio in exploration outputs indicates student lacks capacity to generate diverse valid paths; low retention rate suggests expert problems exceed student's reachable solution space
- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Baseline static SFT comparison to confirm distribution mismatch problem, (2) Adaptability curve profiling to verify peak-and-decline pattern, (3) Gap detection vs. exploration ablation to quantify selective truncation benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Open Question 1**: How can DART be adapted for open-ended tasks with inherent output uncertainty? The current framework relies on hard outcome consistency constraints requiring verifiable final answers, limiting application to structured reasoning tasks.

2. **Open Question 2**: Does the "Imitation Gap" phenomenon appear in non-mathematical reasoning domains like logical deduction or code generation? Current validation is restricted to mathematical benchmarks, leaving generalization to other domains uncertain.

3. **Open Question 3**: Does DART provide utility for larger models (>3B parameters), or does the "Imitation Gap" disappear as model capacity increases? The framework is designed for resource-constrained models, but its effectiveness for larger models remains unexplored.

## Limitations

- Simulation reliability concerns due to limited rollouts (N_sim=4) potentially introducing noise in adaptability estimation
- Outcome supervision limitations prevent fine-grained reasoning skill transfer, only distinguishing correct vs. incorrect final answers
- Lexical analysis interpretations lack grounding in cognitive load theory, potentially conflating statistical artifacts with meaningful reasoning capacity alignment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Experimental results showing DART's performance gains over static fine-tuning are well-supported by data
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism linking adaptability estimation to learnability is plausible but not definitively proven through causation
- **Low confidence**: Lexical analysis interpretation lacks theoretical grounding in cognitive science

## Next Checks

1. **Simulation parameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary N_sim and ε threshold to quantify impact on gap detection accuracy and downstream performance
2. **Process vs. outcome supervision ablation**: Implement hybrid approach with process supervision for high-adaptability steps vs. pure outcome consistency to measure value of finer-grained supervision
3. **Generalization stress test**: Evaluate DART-adapted models on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks to assess robustness vs. overfitting to expert demonstration distribution
