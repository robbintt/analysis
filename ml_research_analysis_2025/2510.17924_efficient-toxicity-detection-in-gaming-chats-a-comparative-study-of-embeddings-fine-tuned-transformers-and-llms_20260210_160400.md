# Efficient Toxicity Detection in Gaming Chats: A Comparative Study of Embeddings, Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17924
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17924
- Authors: Yehor Tereshchenko; Mika Hämäläinen
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieves 94.3% accuracy, outperforming general-purpose LLMs at 260x lower cost

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates multiple approaches for detecting toxic content in gaming chat, comparing traditional embeddings, fine-tuned transformers, and large language models. The authors demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning of smaller models like DistilBERT achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to general-purpose LLMs. They propose a tiered cascading architecture that routes messages through increasingly sophisticated models based on confidence scores, reducing human moderator workload by 85-90% while maintaining high detection accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study employs a tiered architecture with four levels: rule-based profanity filtering (Tier 0), embedding-based machine learning classifiers (Tier 1), fine-tuned transformers or LLM API calls (Tier 2), and RAG-enhanced LLM with human fallback (Tier 3). Models are evaluated on gaming chat datasets including GOSU.ai Dota 2 chats and the Jigsaw Toxic Comments dataset. Fine-tuning uses DistilBERT-base-uncased with AdamW optimizer, learning rate 2e-5, batch size 8, and 3 epochs. Preprocessing includes HTML stripping, URL normalization, emoji-to-text mapping, and contraction expansion.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieves 94.3% accuracy at 260x lower cost than GPT-4 API
- Embedding-based SGD-SVM classifier provides 80.8% accuracy with minimal computational overhead
- RAG-enhanced GPT-3.5 achieves highest recall (96.9%) but lowest precision (49.2%)
- Confidence-based cascading reduces human workload by 85-90% while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning Outperforms General-Purpose LLMs
- Claim: Fine-tuning a smaller transformer (DistilBERT, 66M parameters) on domain-specific gaming chat data achieves higher accuracy than prompting larger general-purpose LLMs, at dramatically lower cost.
- Mechanism: Task-specific fine-tuning adapts model weights to the linguistic patterns, slang, and toxicity forms unique to gaming communities, whereas general LLMs rely on pre-trained knowledge that may not capture gaming-specific context.
- Core assumption: Gaming chat toxicity has domain-specific patterns (e.g., "The cancer lancer" as a hero nickname vs. actual toxicity) that benefit from targeted adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs"
  - [Section 4.6.2] DistilBERT achieves 94.3% accuracy vs. GPT-4 zero-shot at 91.0%, with 260x cost reduction ($5 vs ~$1,400 per 1M messages)
  - [corpus] Context-Aware Toxicity Detection paper confirms "context-dependent nature of toxicity" in games requires domain adaptation
- Break condition: If training data is insufficient (<2,600 samples as in DialoGPT experiment), fine-tuning may underperform; DialoGPT achieved only 67.4% accuracy due to data scarcity and architectural mismatch.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence-Guided Cascading Reduces Human Workload
- Claim: Routing messages through increasingly sophisticated models based on confidence scores reduces human moderator workload by 85-90% while maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: High-confidence predictions (P_toxic <5% or >95%) are automated; only uncertain cases escalate. This concentrates human effort on edge cases requiring nuanced judgment.
- Core assumption: Model confidence scores correlate with actual correctness, and uncertainty aligns with cases needing human oversight.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.4] Tiered architecture: Tier 0 (rule-based, <1ms), Tier 1 (embedding+ML, ~35ms), Tier 2 (LLM/fine-tuned), Tier 3 (RAG + human)
  - [Section 6.2.1] "embedding-based first tier can process 28.24 messages per second... approximately 80,000 messages would be automatically classified, leaving only 20,000 borderline cases for human review"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of the 85-90% workload reduction claim; related papers focus on detection accuracy rather than workload metrics
- Break condition: If confidence calibration is poor (models being confidently wrong), automated routing will misdirect cases and either overwhelm human reviewers or let toxic content through.

### Mechanism 3: RAG Maximizes Recall at Precision Cost
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation achieves the highest recall (96.9%) among all methods by grounding decisions in similar labeled examples, but this comes with reduced precision.
- Mechanism: Semantic retrieval fetches top-k similar examples from a knowledge base, providing domain-specific context that guides the LLM toward more sensitive (high-recall) classifications.
- Core assumption: Retrieved examples are representative and relevant; similarity in embedding space correlates with similar toxicity judgments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.5.1] "RAG achieves the highest recall among all methods (96.9% with GPT-3.5, 93.8% with GPT-4)" but "GPT-3.5 RAG" precision drops to 49.2%
  - [Section 5.1] GPT-3.5 RAG: 67.0% accuracy, 49.2% precision, 96.9% recall
  - [corpus] Unified Game Moderation paper notes similar trade-offs in resource-efficient detection across games
- Break condition: If the knowledge base contains biased or outdated examples, RAG will amplify those biases; retrieval overhead also adds ~200ms latency per message.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contextual vs. Static Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares Sentence-BERT (contextual) embeddings with traditional TF-IDF approaches; understanding the difference explains why embedding+ML methods achieve 80.8% accuracy while handling gaming slang better than rule-based filters.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "cancer" in "The cancer lancer" (a Dota 2 hero nickname) might be misclassified by static methods but correctly handled by contextual embeddings?

- **Concept: Precision-Recall Trade-off in Moderation**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly evaluates this trade-off—RAG maximizes recall (catching more toxic content) but sacrifices precision (more false positives). Deployment decisions depend on whether the platform prioritizes safety (high recall) or user experience (high precision).
  - Quick check question: If a gaming platform values minimizing user frustration from false bans, which metric should they prioritize, and which method from the paper best serves that goal?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The DialoGPT experiment uses LoRA adapters (rank=4, only 0.44% trainable parameters) to reduce computational requirements. Understanding PEFT is essential for practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between full fine-tuning and LoRA-based PEFT in terms of performance, memory, and training
