# On Measuring Unnoticeability of Graph Adversarial Attacks: Observations, New Measure, and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.05015
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05015
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces HideNSeek, a learnable measure that detects attack edges in graphs with significantly lower bypassability than statistical baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental problem of measuring the noticeability of graph adversarial attacks, which is critical for both evaluating attack stealth and developing robust defenses. The authors identify critical limitations in existing statistical measures that can be easily bypassed by adaptive attacks and fail to detect small-scale attacks. To overcome these limitations, they propose HideNSeek, a novel learnable noticeability measure that uses a Learnable Edge Scorer (LEO) to distinguish attack edges from original edges. LEO, an ensemble of three GNN modules (topology, structure learning, and proximity), achieves significantly better detection performance than 11 competing methods across five attack types on six real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
HideNSeek measures noticeability as the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of edge scores produced by a Learnable Edge Scorer (LEO). LEO is trained self-supervised on the attacked graph without ground truth labels, using an ensemble of three modules: a vanilla GNN for intrinsic topology/features, a Graph Structure Learning module to infer latent graphs robust to noise, and a Node Proximity module for explicit similarity scoring. The ensemble outputs are fused via attention. A key innovation is adaptive filtering during training, where low-scoring "positive" edges are progressively removed from the training set to avoid overfitting to attack edges mislabeled as benign. The final noticeability score is the AUROC computed on all edge scores.

## Key Results
- LEO achieves 0.79-0.95 AUROC in distinguishing attack edges from original edges across 5 attack methods on 6 datasets
- HideNSeek is 0.38× to 5.75× less bypassable than the best baseline (DegreeKS)
- HideNSeek maintains high sensitivity even at low attack rates (detects attacks at rates below 1%)
- LEO improves GNN robustness by removing attack-like edges, achieving up to 12.4% improvement in node classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Ensemble Edge Scoring (LEO)
If a scorer uses an ensemble of diverse graph views (topological, latent, and feature-based), it is less likely to be bypassed by adaptive attacks that exploit single-metric blind spots. LEO employs three modules: a vanilla GNN ($M_G$) for intrinsic topology/features, a Graph Structure Learning module ($M_S$) to infer latent graphs robust to noise, and a Node Proximity module ($M_P$). These sub-scores are weighted by an attention layer, allowing the model to emphasize the view most disrupted by the attack. The core assumption is that attack edges exhibit detectable anomalies in at least one of the three views that distinguish them from benign edges.

### Mechanism 2: Imbalance-Aware Aggregation (AUROC)
If the final noticeability score uses Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) aggregation, the system maintains sensitivity to low-rate attacks that global statistical tests miss. Standard statistical tests (like KS tests) compare global distributions where a small number of attack edges are "drowned out" by the massive volume of benign edges. HideNSeek treats edge scoring as a binary classification problem and calculates the AUROC. Because AUROC evaluates the ranking of scores, it remains sensitive even if the positive class (attack edges) is extremely small relative to the negative class (original edges).

### Mechanism 3: Self-Supervised Filtering
If the training process adaptively filters out low-scoring "positive" edges during self-supervision, the model avoids overfitting to attack edges that are incorrectly labeled as "normal." LEO is trained on the attacked graph without knowing ground truth. It initially treats all existing edges as positive samples and non-edges as negative. However, if an edge is an attack, it might receive a low score initially. The mechanism filters the top k% of positive pairs by score, effectively removing likely attack edges from the positive set in subsequent epochs, gradually purifying the "benign" concept.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Structure Learning (GSL)**
  - **Why needed here:** LEO uses a GSL module ($M_S$) to infer a latent graph structure ($G_S$). Standard GNNs assume the input graph is perfect, but adversarial graphs are noisy. GSL helps the model "see past" the attack edges to the underlying clean structure, which is crucial for scoring edges based on their deviation from this latent norm.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a GSL model handle an input adjacency matrix that has been deliberately corrupted?

- **Concept: AUROC in Imbalanced Classification**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on AUROC to solve the "overlooking" problem. A practitioner must understand that Accuracy is misleading when the positive class (attack edges) is <5% of the data, whereas AUROC measures the probability that the classifier ranks a random positive higher than a random negative.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a high accuracy score (e.g., 95%) be misleading when evaluating a detector for a 1% attack rate?

- **Concept: Topological vs. Feature-based Attacks**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper primarily addresses topological attacks (modifying edges) but extends to features in Appendix A. Understanding the difference is necessary to interpret why LEO uses both node features (via $M_G$) and structural proximity (via $M_P$) to catch different attack vectors.
  - **Quick check question:** Does modifying an edge (topology) affect the output of a Graph Convolutional Network differently than modifying a node's feature vector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Attacked Graph $\hat{G} = (\hat{A}, X)$
  - Encoders (Parallel): $M_G$ (Vanilla GNN) -> $M_S$ (GSL-based GNN) -> $M_P$ (Proximity)
  - Scoring & Fusion: Attention Layer combines embeddings from $M_G, M_S, M_P$ -> outputs Edge Score $f(u,v)$
  - Aggregator: Calculates HideNSeek score using AUROC on the set of edge scores
  - Training Loop: Self-supervised binary cross-entropy loss with adaptive filtering of low-scoring positive edges

- **Critical path:** The **Training Loop's Filtering Step** is the most delicate operation. If the filtering threshold $k$ is too aggressive, you drop real edges; if too loose, you memorize attack edges as real.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Ensemble Size vs. Speed:** Running 3 modules (GNN, GSL, Prox) increases inference time significantly compared to a single GCN
  - **Sensitivity vs. False Positives:** By optimizing for AUROC on the attacked graph, the system may flag "rare but real" edges as attacks if they deviate from the majority structure

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Metric Collapse:** HideNSeek score $\approx 0.5$ (random guessing) suggests the attack is too subtle or the model failed to converge
  - **Overlooking Returns:** If the attack rate is extremely low (e.g., <0.1%) and adaptive filtering accidentally purges the few attack edges from the training set *too early*, the model might learn to treat them as normal

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the "Bypass" Check (Fig 1):** Train LEO on Cora, run PGD Attack vs. Adaptive Attack. Verify that the Adaptive Attack cannot significantly reduce the HideNSeek score without ruining attack performance.
  2. **Sensitivity Limit Test:** Inject random/PGD edges at rates $\gamma \in \{0.1\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 5\%\}$. Plot HideNSeek score vs. Baseline (DegreeKS) to confirm detection at sub-1% rates.
  3. **Module Ablation:** Disable $M_S$ (GSL) or $M_P$ (Proximity) independently to quantify their contribution to robustness against specific attack types (e.g., does $M_S$ matter more for DICE which destroys homophily?).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can HideNSeek and the LEO model be effectively adapted to measure the noticeability of node injection attacks, where new nodes (and their features) are added to the graph rather than just perturbing existing edges? The current methodology of LEO relies on scoring existing or potential edges between original nodes to distinguish them from attack edges; it does not inherently handle the scenario where the attacker introduces entirely new entities (nodes) with associated new edges.

### Open Question 2
Is HideNSeek robust against a fully white-box adaptive attack where the attacker optimizes perturbations specifically to minimize the LEO model's edge scores? The paper demonstrates that HideNSeek is "less bypassable" than baselines, but the adaptive attacks defined appear to select edges from a candidate pool to minimize the final noticeability score, rather than using gradient-based white-box optimization to directly attack the parameters of the LEO neural network.

### Open Question 3
Can LEO maintain its sensitivity and computational efficiency when applied to massive graphs (millions/billions of nodes) given the reliance on Graph Structure Learning (GSL)? GSL modules often require computing pairwise similarities or kNN graphs on embeddings, which can become a computational bottleneck or memory hazard on industrial-scale graphs.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies on post-hoc identification of attack edges, assuming perfect knowledge of which edges were added during attack
- All experiments use relatively small academic graphs (max 7,624 nodes), limiting generalizability to larger real-world graphs
- The adaptive filtering mechanism's sensitivity to hyperparameters (particularly the retention rate k) could affect reproducibility and robustness

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that AUROC-based aggregation handles class imbalance better than statistical tests (supported by theoretical reasoning and empirical comparison)
- **Medium Confidence**: The ensemble architecture's superiority over 11 competitors (requires careful replication of all baselines)
- **Medium Confidence**: The robustness against adaptive attacks (demonstrated on PGD attacks, but generalizability to other attack types needs verification)

## Next Checks

1. **Ground Truth Independence Test**: Evaluate HideNSeek on semi-synthetic attacks where attack edges are unknown, using downstream GNN performance degradation as the success metric instead of AUROC.

2. **Scalability Assessment**: Test HideNSeek on a larger graph (e.g., OGB datasets) with >100K edges to verify computational feasibility and measure degradation in detection accuracy.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the adaptive filtering rate k and observe its impact on both detection accuracy and robustness against adaptive attacks to establish stable operating ranges.
