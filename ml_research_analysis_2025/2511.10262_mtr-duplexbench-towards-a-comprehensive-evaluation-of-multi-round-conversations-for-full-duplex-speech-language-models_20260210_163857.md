# MTR-DuplexBench: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Round Conversations for Full-Duplex Speech Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.10262
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10262
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces MTR-DuplexBench, a benchmark evaluating FD-SLMs across 10-round conversations with 4 dimensions: dialogue quality (GPT-score 1.94/5.0 for Moshi), conversational features, instruction following (41.9% success rate for 10 rounds), and safety

## Executive Summary
MTR-DuplexBench addresses the critical need for comprehensive evaluation of Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) in multi-round conversational scenarios. The benchmark segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns for turn-by-turn evaluation, addressing challenges like blurred turn boundaries and context inconsistency. Experiments with Moshi reveal significant performance degradation across rounds, with dialogue quality scoring 1.94/5.0 and instruction following success dropping from 68.0% to 41.9% as rounds increase. Safety performance remains relatively stable at ~90% refusal rate.

## Method Summary
MTR-DuplexBench evaluates FD-SLMs through a four-step pipeline: (1) VAD extraction using Whisper-timestamped and Silero VAD to identify speech segments, (2) GPT-4o turn boundary detection with 6-run majority voting and 30% overlap clustering, (3) final overlap resolution, and (4) ground truth context injection for previous turns. The benchmark uses four evaluation dimensions: dialogue quality (GPT-score 0-5), conversational features (smooth turn-taking, interruption, pause handling, background speech, backchanneling), instruction following (binary success/failure), and safety (refusal rate). Data sources include Candor (natural dialogues), synthetic data from GPT-4o + CosyVoice 2, Llama Question, and AdvBench.

## Key Results
- Moshi achieves GPT-score of 1.94/5.0 for dialogue quality across 10 rounds
- Instruction following success rate degrades from 68.0% (round 1) to 41.9% (rounds 1-10 average)
- Conversational feature success rates consistently decrease with more interaction rounds
- Safety refusal rates remain relatively stable at ~90% regardless of rounds or interruptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Continuous full-duplex dialogues can be segmented into discrete turns for turn-by-turn evaluation. A four-step pipeline extracts VAD segments from dual-channel audio using Whisper-timestamped and Silero VAD, then uses GPT-4o to identify semantic turn boundaries, stabilizes results through 6-run majority voting with 30% overlap clustering, and resolves remaining overlaps to produce final user turns. Core assumption: GPT-4o can reliably identify semantic turn boundaries from transcribed text and timestamps. Break condition: If GPT-4o segmentation becomes inconsistent on highly overlapping speech or low-quality audio, majority voting may fail to converge on coherent turns.

### Mechanism 2
Ground truth injection for prior turns prevents context drift during evaluation. For each evaluated turn, the assistant channel is populated with ground truth speech from all previous rounds, while only the current turn response is generated by the model. The response window spans `[C.start, C_next.end]` with the next user turn muted. Core assumption: Context mismatch between model outputs and ground truth responses would lead to unrealistic evaluation scenarios. Break condition: If ground truth responses are unavailable or low quality for any prior turn, the evaluation cannot proceed reliably.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-round stress testing reveals performance degradation patterns invisible in single-round benchmarks. Each dimension uses 10-round evaluation protocols with cumulative metrics (e.g., success rate averaged over rounds 1-2, 1-5, 1-10), exposing how latency, instruction following, and conversational features degrade as context accumulates. Core assumption: Real-world FD-SLM usage involves sustained multi-turn interactions where performance consistency matters. Break condition: If degradation is caused by implementation artifacts (e.g., memory leaks) rather than model capability, the benchmark may misattribute root cause.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Full-Duplex vs. Half-Duplex Speech Models
  - Why needed here: FD-SLMs can listen and speak simultaneously, enabling interruptions and backchannels; HD-SLMs operate in strict turn-taking. This distinction defines the evaluation challenges MTR-DuplexBench addresses.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why blurred turn boundaries are a problem unique to FD-SLMs but not HD-SLMs?

- **Concept**: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speech Segmentation
  - Why needed here: The turn segmentation pipeline depends on VAD to identify speech fragments before semantic grouping. Understanding VAD limitations (false positives on background noise, misses on soft speech) is critical for debugging segmentation failures.
  - Quick check question: How would persistent background noise in the user channel affect the VAD extraction step?

- **Concept**: GPT-based Evaluation and Subjective Scoring
  - Why needed here: Dialogue quality uses GPT-score (0-5 scale), instruction following uses binary GPT-4o decisions. These are proxy metrics with known limitations—bias toward verbosity, sensitivity to prompt phrasing.
  - Quick check question: What are two failure modes of using GPT-4o as an instruction-following judge that the benchmark authors might not have controlled for?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio input -> VAD extraction -> GPT turn segmentation -> ground truth context assembly -> model inference -> transcription -> GPT-4o scoring
- **Critical path**: Audio input → VAD extraction → GPT turn segmentation → ground truth context assembly → model inference → transcription → GPT-4o scoring. Failure at segmentation or context assembly propagates to all downstream metrics.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Natural vs. synthetic data: Candor provides realistic dynamics but limited scale; synthetic data (CosyVoice 2) enables controlled feature injection but may lack natural prosody.
  - Turn-by-turn vs. overall evaluation: Discrete turns enable granular analysis but may miss cross-turn phenomena (e.g., topic drift across 10 rounds).
  - GPT-4o dependency: Provides scalable evaluation but introduces model-specific bias; no human baseline reported.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Turn segmentation producing highly irregular turn lengths (e.g., many <2s or >60s) suggests VAD or GPT-4o failure
  - Latency monotonically increasing across rounds without corresponding content complexity suggests implementation issue (memory/state accumulation)
  - Safety refusal rate near 100% across all rounds may indicate over-refusal rather than genuine safety
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline segmentation validation**: Run the turn segmentation pipeline on 10 Candor dialogues with human-annotated turn boundaries; compute precision/recall of detected vs. ground truth turns to quantify GPT-4o segmentation accuracy.
  2. **Single-feature degradation analysis**: Run Moshi on 20 synthetic dialogues per conversational feature (smooth turn-taking, interruption, pause handling, background speech) with detailed logging of per-round latency and success; identify which feature causes fastest degradation.
  3. **Context consistency ablation**: For dialogue quality evaluation, replace ground truth history with model-generated history for rounds 3-10; compare GPT-score degradation vs. ground truth condition to quantify context drift impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can FD-SLM architectures be optimized to prevent the linear accumulation of latency observed during extended multi-round full-duplex interactions?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1.2 reports "consistent latency grows as interaction rounds increase" (e.g., rising from 0.61s to 0.85s in smooth turn-taking), and the authors explicitly advocate that "future research should report multi-round latency."
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that current inference mechanisms degrade in speed over time (state accumulation), but the benchmark focuses on evaluation rather than proposing architectural solutions to maintain real-time processing speeds.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A model demonstrating statistically stable, sub-second latency (e.g., < 700ms) across 10+ rounds of interaction on the MTR-DuplexBench dataset.

- **Open Question 2**: Why does performance degrade for complex tasks like instruction following over multiple rounds while safety capabilities remain robust?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.1.3 shows instruction following success rates dropping significantly (from 68.0% to 41.9%), whereas Section 4.1.4 shows safety refusal rates remaining relatively stable (~90%) regardless of the number of rounds or interruptions.
  - Why unresolved: The paper establishes the divergence in robustness between "capability" tasks and "safety" guardrails but does not investigate the specific attention or memory mechanisms that allow safety filters to persist while reasoning capabilities falter.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies identifying specific layers or attention heads responsible for the differential decay rates between instruction following and safety refusal in multi-round contexts.

## Limitations

- Turn segmentation reliability is questionable without human-annotated ground truth validation
- GPT-4o evaluation proxy lacks human baseline and may introduce model-specific bias
- Results based on Moshi may not generalize to other FD-SLM architectures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The benchmark framework design (turn-by-turn evaluation, ground truth context injection) is methodologically sound and addresses documented FD-SLM evaluation challenges. The four evaluation dimensions are comprehensive and relevant.
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results showing Moshi's performance degradation across rounds are reproducible but may not generalize to other FD-SLMs. The segmentation pipeline description is detailed but lacks validation metrics.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about GPT-4o's segmentation accuracy and evaluation reliability are unsupported by empirical validation against human judgments or alternative metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Segmentation Accuracy Validation**: Run the turn segmentation pipeline on 20 Candor dialogues with human-annotated turn boundaries. Compute precision, recall, and F1-score to quantify segmentation reliability and identify failure modes.
2. **Human Evaluation Baseline**: Have 3-5 human annotators score 50 randomly selected Moshi responses (across all rounds and dimensions) using the same GPT-4o prompts. Compute inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha) and compare against GPT-4o scores to assess proxy metric validity.
3. **Cross-Model Generalization**: Repeat the full benchmark evaluation with at least two other FD-SLMs (e.g., Cartesia Sonic, Suno). Compare degradation patterns across models to determine whether observed performance trends are implementation-specific or general FD-SLM phenomena.
