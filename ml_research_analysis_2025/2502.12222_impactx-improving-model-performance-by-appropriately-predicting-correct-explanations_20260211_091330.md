# IMPACTX: Improving Model Performance by Appropriately predicting CorrecT eXplanations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.12222
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12222
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: IMPACTX improves deep learning model performance by integrating XAI as a fully automated attention mechanism, achieving consistent performance gains across three architectures and datasets

## Executive Summary
IMPACTX introduces a novel approach to deep learning that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) as a core component of model architecture rather than as a post-hoc analysis tool. The method employs a dual-branch architecture where one branch performs standard feature extraction and classification while the second branch learns to generate attribution maps during training. By using SHAP explanations as ground truth, IMPACTX simultaneously optimizes for classification accuracy and explanation reconstruction through a combined loss function, resulting in models that are both more accurate and more interpretable.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent performance improvements across three well-established image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10) and three different model architectures (EfficientNet-B2, MobileNet, and LeNet-5). The approach not only outperforms baseline models but also generates more reliable attribution maps compared to traditional post-hoc XAI methods, as validated through deletion and insertion metrics.

## Method Summary
IMPACTX implements a dual-branch architecture that integrates XAI into the training process. The first branch performs standard feature extraction and classification, while the second branch is an Encoder-Decoder network that learns to generate attribution maps. During training, SHAP explanations are used as ground truth for the attribution maps, and the model optimizes a combined loss function that simultaneously minimizes classification error and explanation reconstruction error. This approach ensures that the model learns to focus on the most relevant features for each class while maintaining high classification performance.

## Key Results
- Consistent performance improvements across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets
- Outperforms baseline models and similar approaches (ABN, WAE) across three architectures
- Generates more reliable attribution maps than post-hoc XAI methods, validated by MoRF curves
- Successfully identifies relevant features while maintaining or improving classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IMPACTX works by making explainability an integral part of the learning process rather than an afterthought. By training the model to generate attribution maps alongside classifications, it learns to focus on the most relevant features for each class. The dual optimization objective ensures that the model cannot simply memorize patterns but must learn meaningful representations that are both predictive and interpretable. This approach effectively combines the benefits of attention mechanisms with the rigor of XAI, creating models that are inherently more transparent and robust.

## Foundational Learning

**Deep Learning Fundamentals**: Understanding of neural network architectures, backpropagation, and optimization techniques is essential for grasping how IMPACTX modifies standard training procedures. This knowledge is needed to understand the dual-branch architecture and combined loss function. Quick check: Can you explain how backpropagation works in a standard CNN?

**Explainable AI Concepts**: Familiarity with attribution methods like SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM is crucial for understanding how IMPACTX uses explanations as training signals. This is needed to comprehend how attribution maps are generated and evaluated. Quick check: What is the difference between SHAP and Grad-CAM?

**Dual-Branch Architecture**: Understanding of multi-task learning and how separate branches can be trained simultaneously is important for grasping IMPACTX's design. This is needed to understand how the classification and explanation branches interact. Quick check: How does multi-task learning differ from single-task learning in neural networks?

**Loss Function Design**: Knowledge of how different loss components can be combined and weighted is essential for understanding IMPACTX's training objective. This is needed to comprehend how classification and explanation reconstruction errors are balanced. Quick check: What are the challenges in combining multiple loss functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images -> Feature Extractor (Branch 1) -> Classifier -> Output Predictions; Input Images -> Encoder-Decoder (Branch 2) -> Attribution Maps -> Combined Loss -> Backpropagation

**Critical Path**: Input images flow through both branches simultaneously. Branch 1 performs feature extraction and classification, while Branch 2 generates attribution maps. The combined loss function backpropagates errors from both classification and attribution map reconstruction to update all model parameters.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual-branch architecture increases computational complexity and memory requirements but provides the benefit of integrated explainability. The choice of SHAP as ground truth for attribution maps assumes SHAP's explanations are optimal, which may not always be true. The combined loss function requires careful weighting to balance classification and explanation objectives.

**Failure Signatures**: If the attribution branch dominates training, the model may produce good explanations but poor classifications. If the classification branch dominates, the model may achieve high accuracy but generate unreliable attribution maps. Poor convergence can occur if the loss weighting is not properly tuned.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train IMPACTX on CIFAR-10 with EfficientNet-B2 to verify basic functionality
2. Compare attribution maps generated by IMPACTX against SHAP explanations
3. Evaluate performance degradation when ablating the attribution branch

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, focusing instead on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

## Limitations

- Limited validation to only three well-established image datasets, restricting generalizability to other domains
- No analysis of computational overhead from the dual-branch architecture and its impact on real-time applications
- Reliance on SHAP explanations as ground truth assumes SHAP is always optimal, which may not hold across all scenarios
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification accuracy and attribution map quality, leaving robustness to adversarial attacks unexplored

## Confidence

- **High**: Performance improvements over baseline models and ABN/WAE approaches are supported by quantitative results across multiple architectures and datasets
- **Medium**: The claim about generating more reliable attribution maps than post-hoc XAI methods is substantiated by MoRF curves but lacks comparison with a broader range of XAI techniques
- **Low**: The assertion that IMPACTX is fully automated and eliminates the need for external explanations is not fully validated, as the method still depends on SHAP for training

## Next Checks

1. Test IMPACTX on diverse datasets outside the standard image classification domain (e.g., medical imaging or text data) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability of the dual-branch architecture in resource-constrained environments
3. Compare IMPACTX's attribution maps against a wider range of post-hoc XAI methods to strengthen claims about reliability and robustness
