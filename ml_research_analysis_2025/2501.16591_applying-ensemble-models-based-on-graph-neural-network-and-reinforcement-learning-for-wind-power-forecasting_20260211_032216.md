# Applying Ensemble Models based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning for Wind Power Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.16591
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16591
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Proposed EMGRL model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 12.89% on wind power forecasting datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting wind power output from wind farms across different time scales, which is critical for wind power trading and utilization. The proposed solution, an ensemble model based on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning (EMGRL), models wind turbines as graph nodes and uses graph neural networks to capture time-series data from neighboring wind farms. The model integrates target wind farm data with historical base model performance through a general state embedding, and employs an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework to ensemble the advantages of all base models. The EMGRL model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 12.89% on open datasets for wind power forecasting.

## Method Summary
The EMGRL framework combines spatio-temporal graph neural networks with reinforcement learning for wind power forecasting. Wind turbines are modeled as graph nodes based on geographical locations, enabling the model to capture spatial correlations between geographically proximate turbines. The approach uses four base models (ARIMA, LightGBM, LSTM, SGNN) whose predictions are dynamically weighted by an actor-critic RL agent. The state embedding combines spatio-temporal features from neighboring farms (processed through dilated CNNs and GNNs) with historical performance metrics of each base model. The RL agent learns optimal weight assignments to minimize prediction error across different forecasting horizons.

## Key Results
- EMGRL achieves up to 12.89% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on wind power forecasting
- Model demonstrates strong performance across two public datasets: NREL (4 offshore wind farms) and GEFC (7 wind farms)
- Dynamic weighting through RL outperforms static ensemble methods in handling non-stationary wind patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modeling wind farms as graph nodes enables the model to capture spatial correlations between geographically proximate turbines, improving prediction accuracy when neighboring farm data is informative.
- Mechanism: The GNN uses a message-passing framework (Message Computation → Message Aggregation → Message Update) to propagate time-series features across the graph structure defined by turbine locations. This allows the target wind farm's embedding to incorporate signals from neighbors that share correlated wind patterns.
- Core assumption: Wind conditions at nearby farms contain predictive signal for the target farm's future output; spatial adjacency correlates with meteorological similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we model all wind turbines within a wind farm as graph nodes in a graph built by their geographical locations"
  - [section 3.2]: Equations 2-4 formalize the three-stage message-passing process
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on wake steering control rather than forecasting spatial correlations
- Break condition: If wind farms are too distant, topologically disconnected, or meteorologically decorrelated, the GNN may add noise without signal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Actor-critic reinforcement learning can dynamically weight base model predictions based on recent performance, adapting to non-stationary wind patterns better than fixed ensembles.
- Mechanism: The Actor network outputs weight vectors over base models given a state embedding; the Critic estimates value to guide policy updates via gradient ascent. The state embedding includes historical loss trajectories of each base model, enabling the agent to learn which model performs well under which conditions.
- Core assumption: Base models exhibit complementary strengths across different temporal regimes (e.g., ARIMA for linear patterns, LSTM for long-term dependencies, LightGBM for nonlinear features), and recent performance is predictive of near-future performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "employing an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework to ensemble the advantages of all base models"
  - [section 4.3]: Describes the training loop where Actor outputs weights, Critic evaluates, and transitions are stored in replay buffer
  - [corpus]: No direct validation of RL-based ensemble weighting for WPF; related work uses RL for turbine control, not forecasting
- Break condition: If base models all fail simultaneously (e.g., during extreme weather outliers), or if regime shifts are faster than the RL adaptation window, dynamic weighting degrades to random selection.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Jointly embedding spatio-temporal features and model loss histories produces a state representation that enables more informed ensemble decisions than either alone.
- Mechanism: Dilated CNN compresses raw time-series into temporal embeddings; GNN fuses spatial context; a separate dilated CNN compresses historical losses from all base models. These are concatenated into a unified state vector SE for the RL agent.
- Core assumption: Historical loss patterns encode information about which model is likely to succeed next; this signal is extractable via dilated convolutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: Equations 6-8 formalize STSE (spatio-temporal) and MLE (model loss embedding) construction
  - [section 4.2]: "we obtain the embedding vector SE of wind farm A through splicing: SE = (STSE, MLE)"
  - [corpus]: No external validation of loss-embedding effectiveness
- Break condition: If loss histories are too short, too noisy, or if past performance has low autocorrelation with future performance, the embedding provides weak signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing)**
  - Why needed here: The model relies on GNN to aggregate information across spatially distributed wind farms; understanding how node features propagate through neighborhoods is essential for debugging embedding quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding more GNN layers might cause over-smoothing of node representations in this wind farm graph?

- Concept: **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed here: The ensemble weighting mechanism uses this framework; practitioners must understand the Actor's policy gradient and the Critic's value estimation to diagnose training instability.
  - Quick check question: What would happen to training if the Critic consistently overestimates the value of certain actions?

- Concept: **Dilated Convolutions for Sequence Compression**
  - Why needed here: Both spatio-temporal and loss embeddings use dilated CNNs to compress sequences; this preserves longer-range dependencies than standard convolutions without excessive parameter growth.
  - Quick check question: How does the dilation rate affect the receptive field, and what's the tradeoff versus simply increasing kernel size?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input Layer: Raw time-series from multiple wind farms + geographical coordinates
  - Temporal Encoder: Dilated CNN per farm → compressed temporal vectors
  - Spatial Encoder: GNN aggregates temporal vectors across farm graph → STSE
  - Loss Encoder: Dilated CNN on historical base model losses → MLE
  - State Fusion: Concatenate(STSE, MLE) → SE
  - RL Core: Actor network (policy → weight vector) + Critic network (value estimation)
  - Ensemble Output: Weighted sum of base model predictions (ARIMA, LightGBM, LSTM, SGNN)

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure graph construction correctly reflects geographical adjacency (break here if farms are uncorrelated)
  2. Verify each base model is trained and produces loss histories before RL training begins
  3. Monitor Actor weight distribution during training—should not collapse to single model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More base models → richer ensemble but higher RL state dimension and slower convergence
  - Longer loss history → more context but increased embedding size and potential overfitting to stale patterns
  - Deeper GNN → larger receptive field but risk of over-smoothing spatial features

- Failure signatures:
  - Weights oscillating wildly → learning rate too high or reward scaling unstable
  - All weights converge to one model → other models uninformative or reward not discriminating
  - RMSE worse than best single model → RL not learning; check replay buffer sampling and Critic convergence

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate the GNN (replace with independent temporal encoders) to quantify spatial contribution on NREL dataset; expect degraded performance if spatial correlations are meaningful.
  2. Vary loss history window length (e.g., 10 vs 50 vs 100 timesteps) to find minimum sufficient context; plot validation RMSE vs window size.
  3. Replace Actor-Critic with simple averaging and performance-weighted averaging baselines; confirm RL adds value beyond static heuristics on GEFC dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed EMGRL framework incur computational latency that limits its applicability for very-short-term wind power forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors critique physical methods for "excessive computational time" making them unsuitable for short-term forecasting (Page 4), yet EMGRL combines complex GNNs and Actor-Critic reinforcement learning, which are typically resource-intensive.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses exclusively on accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE) and does not report training duration or inference speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Time-complexity analysis and runtime benchmarks comparing EMGRL against simpler baselines on the very-short-term time scale.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the reinforcement learning agent's convergence and performance stability change as the number or type of base models varies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model is tested with a fixed set of four base models (ARIMA, LightGBM, LSTM, SGNN) (Page 17).
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if adding more diverse base models improves the ensemble or creates optimization difficulties (curse of dimensionality) for the RL agent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies demonstrating the change in RL reward and prediction error when systematically adding or removing base learners.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the GNN-based spatial embedding to data sparsity or communication failures from neighboring wind farms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The state embedding generation relies on capturing "time-series data from neighboring wind farms" via graph connections (Page 12).
- Why unresolved: The study assumes complete data availability for the graph structure. Real-world deployment often faces missing data from adjacent nodes, but the model's sensitivity to this is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments simulating "node dropout" or missing data intervals in neighboring farms to observe the impact on target farm prediction accuracy.

## Limitations
- Critical architectural details such as specific GNN variant, dilated CNN configurations, and RL hyperparameters are unspecified, limiting reproducibility
- Performance claims of 12.89% improvement cannot be independently verified without access to exact implementation details and baseline models
- Computational efficiency and inference latency for very-short-term forecasting are not evaluated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using GNNs to capture spatial correlations between wind farms is well-supported by the literature on spatio-temporal modeling. The basic actor-critic framework for ensemble weighting is theoretically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The integration of loss history embeddings with spatio-temporal features through dilated convolutions is plausible but untested in the broader literature. The reported performance gains are specific to the datasets and baselines used.
- **Low Confidence**: Without knowing the exact graph construction method, GNN architecture, or RL training parameters, the reproducibility of the 12.89% improvement claim is uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Remove the GNN component and compare performance to the full model on both NREL and GEFC datasets. This will quantify the contribution of spatial information.
2. **Robustness Testing**: Train the model on synthetic data with controlled spatial correlations to verify the GNN's ability to learn meaningful spatial patterns versus random graphs.
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Implement and test simple ensemble methods (uniform averaging, performance-weighted averaging) against the RL-based approach to isolate the value added by the actor-critic framework.
