# TEN: Table Explicitization, Neurosymbolically

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09324
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09324
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TEN achieves higher exact match accuracy and lower hallucination rates than purely neural baselines for table extraction from unstructured text

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEN, a neurosymbolic method for extracting structured tables from unstructured text. TEN combines a large language model (LLM) with a symbolic checker in an iterative feedback loop. The LLM first generates a table from raw text using structural decomposition prompting, then the symbolic checker evaluates the table and flags structural inconsistencies. A critique LLM translates these symbolic feedback signals into natural language guidance, which is used to refine the table. Experiments show TEN achieves higher exact match accuracy and lower hallucination rates than purely neural baselines. A user study found participants rated TEN-generated tables as more accurate and preferred them in over 60% of cases.

## Method Summary
TEN employs an iterative neurosymbolic framework where an LLM generates tables from unstructured text using structural decomposition prompts. A symbolic checker then evaluates these tables for structural inconsistencies like merged cells, missing rows, or delimiter errors. The checker's feedback is translated into natural language by a critique LLM, which guides the next iteration of table generation. This loop continues until the table passes all sanity checks. The method explicitly balances content fidelity (exact match, cell value match) with structural fidelity (TED metric) while maintaining interpretability through the symbolic components.

## Key Results
- TEN achieves 85.3% exact match accuracy on average across three datasets (BrokenCSV, PubTabNet, FinTabNet), outperforming neural baselines
- Hallucination rates are significantly lower with TEN (1.8% vs 9.6% for TableGPT on average)
- User study shows participants preferred TEN-generated tables over neural baselines in 62.5% of cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TEN's effectiveness stems from combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with the precision of symbolic checking. The LLM can understand context and generate plausible table structures, while the symbolic checker provides rigorous validation that catches structural errors. The iterative feedback loop allows the system to progressively refine the table based on specific, actionable feedback rather than just raw error signals. This approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms: neural models for pattern recognition and contextual understanding, and symbolic systems for precise validation and error correction.

## Foundational Learning

**Neurosymbolic Systems** - Hybrid AI approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning; needed to balance the flexibility of neural generation with the precision of symbolic validation. Quick check: Can identify when neural-only approaches fail due to lack of rigorous structure validation.

**Iterative Refinement Loops** - Sequential improvement processes where output from one stage becomes input to the next; needed to progressively improve table quality through targeted feedback. Quick check: Can trace how each iteration specifically addresses previous errors.

**Structural Decomposition Prompting** - Prompt engineering technique that breaks complex tasks into simpler subtasks; needed to guide LLMs toward generating valid table structures. Quick check: Can map decomposition steps to specific table components.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Unstructured Text -> LLM Generator -> Generated Table -> Symbolic Checker -> Critique LLM -> Natural Language Feedback -> Refined Table (loop)

**Critical Path**: The core execution path is: LLM generation → symbolic checking → critique translation → LLM refinement. Each iteration adds approximately 10-15 seconds of latency due to multiple LLM calls.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using multiple LLM calls versus single-shot generation. The symbolic checker is intentionally kept simple and domain-agnostic to ensure generalizability, though this limits its ability to catch domain-specific structural issues.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when the initial LLM generation is too far from any valid structure (fails sanity checks repeatedly), when the critique LLM mistranslates symbolic feedback, or when structural normalization choices improve content metrics at the expense of structural fidelity.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test convergence behavior by running TEN on increasingly complex tables and measuring iterations to convergence
2. Evaluate the impact of different symbolic checker rule sets on final accuracy
3. Measure the contribution of each component by performing ablations (removing symbolic checker, removing critique LLM)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can TEN's iterative neurosymbolic feedback loop be extended to handle multi-page or cross-document table extraction where individual tables span multiple input sources?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates single-table extraction from isolated text blocks (copy-paste or OCR output). Tables spanning page breaks or requiring cross-document reconciliation are not addressed, though the motivating scenario of financial/regulatory document processing frequently involves such cases.
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline assumes a single contiguous text input per table; convergence criteria and sanity checks do not account for partial or distributed table fragments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dataset of multi-page tables with ground-truth alignments across pages, and evaluation of TEN with modified prompting that explicitly identifies continuation cues.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the trade-off between content fidelity (EM, CVM) and structural fidelity (TED) be systematically balanced when the two metrics diverge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that TEN sometimes normalizes header layouts or flattens spans in ways that improve EM/CVM but increase TED, reflecting "granularity differences rather than content errors," and that TED "should be interpreted alongside content-fidelity metrics."
- Why unresolved: The system does not currently have a mechanism for weighting or jointly optimizing these metrics; normalization choices are emergent from the critique feedback.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study varying structural normalization rules in the sanity checker, measuring the Pareto frontier between TED and EM/CVM.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the hand-crafted, domain-agnostic symbolic sanity-check rules be replaced or augmented with learned, domain-specific constraints to improve performance on specialized table formats?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that the sanity checker uses "hand-crafted and domain-agnostic" rules. While this ensures generality, performance varies significantly across datasets (e.g., FinTabNet is much harder than BrokenCSV), suggesting domain-specific structure may help.
- Why unresolved: The current rules detect generic issues (merged cells, delimiter errors) but cannot leverage domain patterns (e.g., financial row hierarchies, scientific notation conventions).
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation comparing generic rules vs. domain-specialized rules on FinTabNet or PubTabNet, measuring EM, CVM, and hallucination rates.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology relies heavily on exact match accuracy and hallucination rates, which may not capture real-world usability
- User study has limited sample size (10 participants) and focuses on subjective perceptions rather than objective utility
- Performance on complex nested tables and multi-dimensional data is not thoroughly explored
- Computational overhead of iterative feedback loop and multiple LLM calls is not well-characterized

## Confidence

- Neurosymbolic framework effectiveness: High confidence - The iterative feedback mechanism between LLM and symbolic checker is well-described and theoretically sound
- Performance improvements over baselines: Medium confidence - While results show improvements, the evaluation methodology has limitations
- User preference for TEN-generated tables: Low confidence - The user study has a small sample size and focuses on subjective perceptions rather than objective utility

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale user study with domain experts to evaluate the practical utility of TEN-generated tables in real-world applications
2. Test TEN's performance on more complex table structures, including nested tables and multi-dimensional data
3. Perform a comprehensive analysis of the computational overhead and runtime efficiency compared to purely neural baselines across various table sizes and complexities
