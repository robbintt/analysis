# How Far I'll Go: Imagining Futures of Conversational AI with People with Visual Impairments Through Design Fiction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12268
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12268
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Design fiction probes reveal PVI aspire to expanded careers and social participation with CAI, but need balance between support and autonomy.

## Executive Summary
This study uses design fiction methodology to explore how people with visual impairments (PVI) envision future lives with conversational AI (CAI). Through audio-based speculative dialogues personalized with participant names and contexts, 14 PVI participants imagined using CAI to pursue new careers, travel independently, and enhance social participation. The research reveals desires for personalized, context-aware AI that respects diverse needs while balancing support with autonomy. Findings emphasize designing CAI not just for functionality but to support dignity, agency, and inclusion in PVI lives.

## Method Summary
The study employed design fiction methodology with 14 PVI participants in South Korea. Researchers conducted formative interviews to identify key life domains, then created speculative society scenarios using Schwartz's framework. Two audio dialogues (Traveling Future ~4min, Policy Planning Future ~2:46min) were developed with expert feedback and rendered with natural TTS. Probes were personalized per participant (gender-matched voice, name insertion, contextual references). Participants engaged with audio probes in controlled settings, responded to embedded prompts, then participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis via open coding and affinity diagramming yielded 156 codes, 5 categories, and 32 subcategories.

## Key Results
- PVI participants imagined using CAI to pursue previously inaccessible careers (prosecutors, professors, baristas) and travel independently
- Participants valued personalized features (name insertion, contextual references) that enhanced immersion and emotional engagement
- Key tensions emerged around balancing CAI support with maintaining autonomy and self-reliance skills
- Participants emphasized need for multimodal CAI that respects diverse preferences and promotes social visibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Audio-based Design Fiction probes enable PVI to articulate aspirations and concerns about future CAI that conventional interviews may not surface.
- Mechanism: Immersive speculative scenarios create concrete "experience of the future" that grounds abstract reflection in narrative detail, reducing cognitive distance between present capabilities and imagined possibilities.
- Core assumption: PVI can meaningfully extrapolate from 10-year speculative scenarios to personal aspirations.
- Evidence anchors: Participants described the activity as "thought-provoking and enjoyable" and projected themselves into scenarios describing new career possibilities.
- Break condition: If scenarios feel implausible or culturally alien, immersion fails and responses become abstract or disengaged.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Personalization features enhance immersion and emotional engagement with speculative probes.
- Mechanism: Personalized signals reduce perceived distance between fictional user and participant, triggering self-referential processing when CAI references "stairs about the same height as the ones at [participant name]'s house."
- Core assumption: Personalized elements are perceived as authentic rather than gimmicky.
- Evidence anchors: Participants highlighted personalized elements as "particularly meaningful" and noted they enhanced sense of immersion.
- Break condition: If personalization feels awkward, invasive, or technically flawed, it creates dissonance and breaks immersion.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Envisioning expanded possibilities through CAI can shift self-perception among PVI, revealing latent aspirations shaped by current structural barriers.
- Mechanism: When participants encounter fictional peers successfully navigating environments or pursuing careers typically inaccessible to PVI, they recognize barriers as technological/structural rather than personal limitation.
- Core assumption: Present-day self-limiting beliefs are partly shaped by lack of visible role models and accessible pathways.
- Evidence anchors: Participants envisioned careers "once dismissed as unattainable" after engaging with speculative scenarios.
- Break condition: If scenarios depict capabilities too far beyond plausible technological reach, participants may dismiss them as fantasy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Design Fiction methodology**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is methodological—using speculative artifacts to elicit future-oriented reflections.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how Design Fiction differs from traditional user needs elicitation methods like surveys or usability testing?

- **Relational and social models of disability**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly grounds its analysis in frameworks that locate disability in social structures and interactions rather than solely in individual impairment.
  - Quick check question: How would designing for "social visibility of PVI" differ from designing for "task completion by PVI"?

- **Agency vs. dependency tension in assistive technology**
  - Why needed here: A central finding is that PVI want CAI support without becoming over-reliant.
  - Quick check question: What design feature might help a user maintain orientation skills while still receiving CAI navigation assistance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Formative interviews -> Society construction (Schwartz framework) -> Probe script development -> Personalization engine -> Audio delivery interface -> Elicitation protocol -> Thematic analysis pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Formative interviews → identify key life domains
  2. Scenario development with expert/novelist feedback
  3. Personalization and audio production
  4. Probe delivery + interview
  5. Thematic analysis → theme development

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Audio-only vs. multimodal probes: Audio maximizes accessibility but limits scenario types; participants want future CAI to be multimodal
  - Positive-future framing vs. dystopian provocation: Probes depicted primarily beneficial futures with subtle dependency risks embedded
  - Single cultural context: Findings reflect specific South Korean employment constraints and welfare structures

- Failure signatures:
  - Participants unable to engage with probe (say "this doesn't feel realistic to me")
  - Responses remain purely abstract without personal extrapolation
  - Post-probe reflections identical to pre-probe baseline
  - Technical failures in personalization (wrong name, awkward synthesis)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation test: Run study with non-personalized probe vs. personalized version to measure depth of reflection and emotional engagement
  2. Scenario expansion: Develop and test probes covering additional life domains (healthcare, relationships, creative pursuits)
  3. Cross-cultural replication: Adapt probes for PVI in different welfare/employment contexts (US, Nordic countries)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cultural context differences**: How do envisioned futures and design requirements for CAI differ for PVI across distinct cultural and welfare contexts? (explicitly called for cross-cultural Design Fiction studies)
- **Adolescent perspectives**: How do adolescents with visual impairments envision their future career paths and daily independence with CAI compared to older demographics? (noted current sample skewed toward older adults)
- **Additional domains**: How might PVI envision the role of CAI in domains such as healthcare, leisure, and family relationships? (identified navigation/employment focus as limitation)
- **Friction mechanisms**: What interaction mechanisms can effectively balance the "positive friction" needed to maintain user agency against desire for seamless assistance? (suggested need for mechanisms to encourage reflection without being annoying)

## Limitations

- Small sample size (N=14) from single cultural context limits generalizability
- Reliance on participants' ability to project themselves into speculative scenarios may not be equally accessible to all
- No comparative evidence that design fiction elicits different insights than conventional interviews
- Findings shaped by specific South Korean structural constraints and welfare systems

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Personalization features enhance immersion; participants valued imagining expanded career and social possibilities with CAI
- **Medium confidence**: Audio-based design fiction elicits different insights than conventional interviews
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of specific aspiration patterns to other cultural contexts or welfare systems

## Next Checks

1. **Cultural context validation**: Replicate study with PVI in at least two different countries with distinct welfare systems to compare whether career aspirations shift with structural context
2. **Mechanism isolation test**: Conduct controlled experiment comparing responses to personalized vs. non-personalized design fiction probes to measure differences in reflection depth and emotional engagement
3. **Longitudinal aspiration tracking**: Interview same participants 3-6 months later to assess whether CAI aspirations persist, evolve, or fade, distinguishing temporary engagement from genuine shifts in perceived possibilities
