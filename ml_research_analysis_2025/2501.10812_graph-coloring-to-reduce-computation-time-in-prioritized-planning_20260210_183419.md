# Graph Coloring to Reduce Computation Time in Prioritized Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.10812
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10812
- Reference count: 20
- One-line primary result: Decentralized graph coloring reduces maximum computation time by 57.9% in MAPF prioritized planning at the cost of 26.2% solution quality degradation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational bottleneck in prioritized planning (PP) for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) by transforming the prioritization problem into a graph coloring problem. The key insight is that minimizing the chromatic number of the coupling graph directly minimizes the longest sequential computation chain, thereby reducing makespan. A decentralized greedy graph-coloring algorithm based on Saturation Degree Ordering (SDO), Largest Degree Ordering (LDO), and First-Fit Ordering (FFO) is proposed, which guarantees consistent coloring across agents without communication overhead during the coloring phase. The method is evaluated on an intersection scenario with eight connected and automated vehicles, demonstrating a 57.9% reduction in maximum computation time compared to baseline approaches, albeit with a 26.2% increase in solution cost.

## Method Summary
The method maps the prioritization problem in PP to a graph coloring problem where the number of colors corresponds to the longest path length in the coupling directed acyclic graph (DAG). A decentralized greedy graph-coloring algorithm is used to determine agent priorities, ensuring all agents with the same color can plan in parallel as they are non-adjacent in the coupling graph. The algorithm uses deterministic tie-breaking (SDO → LDO → FFO with unique vertex IDs) to guarantee consistent coloring across all agents without communication during the coloring phase. This approach is particularly effective for sparse coupling graphs where the chromatic number is much lower than the number of agents.

## Key Results
- 57.9% reduction in maximum computation time compared to baseline sequential prioritization approaches
- 26.2% increase in solution cost (trajectory sub-optimality) as a trade-off for reduced computation time
- Effective for sparse coupling graphs where chromatic number is significantly lower than the number of agents
- Consistent decentralized coloring achieved without communication overhead during the coloring phase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Mapping the prioritization ordering problem to a graph coloring problem minimizes the longest sequential computation chain (makespan) in Prioritized Planning (PP). The method relies on the equivalence between the chromatic number of the undirected coupling graph and the longest path in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) used for scheduling. By assigning "colors" to agents, all agents with the same color can plan in parallel because they are non-adjacent (uncoupled) in the graph. Minimizing the number of colors directly minimizes the number of sequential "computation levels." The core assumption is that computation time is dominated by the sequential depth of the dependency graph rather than the total number of agents. This fails if the coupling graph is fully connected, requiring as many colors as agents and offering no speedup.

### Mechanism 2
A deterministic tie-breaking heuristic allows decentralized agents to arrive at a consistent global prioritization without communication overhead during the coloring phase. Algorithm 1 uses a combination of Saturation Degree (SDO), Largest Degree (LDO), and First-Fit Ordering (FFO). Because all agents share the same vertex IDs and graph topology, and the selection criteria are strictly deterministic, every agent independently calculates the identical color assignment. The core assumption is that all agents possess a consistent view of the global coupling graph topology and unique vertex identifiers before the algorithm begins. This fails if the local view of the coupling graph differs between agents, leading to inconsistent colorings and circular dependencies.

### Mechanism 3
Reducing computation time via graph coloring prioritization creates a trade-off that increases solution cost (trajectory sub-optimality). The graph coloring objective optimizes solely for parallelization (speed), ignoring the physical constraints or "difficulty" of the planning problems. By forcing a specific order to minimize levels, the algorithm may prevent lower-priority agents from accessing optimal paths reserved by higher-priority agents, forcing them into costlier maneuvers. The core assumption is that planning times are roughly uniform across agents. This fails if solution quality is a hard constraint unless the cost function is modified to weight priority inversions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Coupling Graphs & Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes the reader understands how physical interactions (collision potential) translate to edges in a graph, and how orienting these edges based on priority creates a DAG.
  - Quick check question: If Agent A must avoid Agent B, and Agent B must avoid Agent C, does this imply a transitive dependency in the DAG? (Yes, if priorities are A > B > C).

- **Concept: Chromatic Number (χ(G))**
  - Why needed here: The core theoretical result links the minimum computation depth to this graph property. You must understand that χ(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure no adjacent vertices share a color.
  - Quick check question: What is the chromatic number of a bipartite graph (e.g., a path or even cycle)? (Answer: 2).

- **Concept: Receding Horizon Control (MPC) vs. MAPF**
  - Why needed here: The paper applies this to Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP), which uses receding horizons rather than full-path planning.
  - Quick check question: Why does changing the priority at every time step (as done here) potentially destabilize a standard Model Predictive Control scheme? (It changes the constraints/obstacles predicted for the future horizon).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Coupling Module -> Decentralized Coloring Module (Algo 1) -> Prioritization Mapper -> OCP Solver
- **Critical path:** The Decentralized Coloring Module. Specifically, the calculation of Saturation Degree (s) in Line 6 of Algorithm 1. If this logic differs across agents, the system fails.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Speed vs. Quality: The primary tradeoff. The system sacrifices 26.2% solution quality (higher cost) for 57.9% speedup.
  - Centralized vs. Decentralized: The authors avoid a central scheduler to remove the single point of failure, accepting the O(N³) local computation cost instead of communication latency.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Priority Inversion Loops: If coupling graphs are inconsistent, Agent A waits for B, while B waits for A. Timeout occurs.
  - Constraint Infeasibility: The greedy coloring might assign high priority to an agent that "blocks the door," leaving lower-priority agents with no feasible solution (collision inevitable).
  - Churn: If the graph topology changes rapidly, the colors may swap constantly, causing "jitter" in the trajectory plans.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Determinism Test:** Run Algorithm 1 on 3 different agents (threads/processes) with the same random graph input. Verify `hash(ColorMap)` is identical for all.
  2. **Sparsity Stress Test:** Generate random graphs with varying edge probabilities (p=0.1 to 0.9). Plot Computation Levels (Nc) vs. Edge Density. Verify the speedup drops as p → 1.
  3. **Baseline Timing:** Replicate the intersection scenario. Measure "Time to Solution" for `p_constant` (sequential) vs. `p_color`. Confirm the ~57% reduction holds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the graph-coloring prioritization strategy be extended to explicitly consider the feasibility of planning problems and the quality of solutions?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states, "In the future, we will further investigate prioritization considering feasibility and quality of solutions."
- Why unresolved: The current method ignores application-specific constraints to maximize generalization, resulting in a 26.2% increase in solution cost compared to baseline heuristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified prioritization algorithm that successfully reduces solution cost and improves feasibility rates while maintaining the decentralized computation time reduction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific impacts of the increased parallel communication load on the reliability and latency of the communication infrastructure?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 notes that while sequential communication is reduced, communication "takes place in parallel, which puts a higher communication load on the communication infrastructure."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not quantify the bandwidth requirements or packet loss risks associated with this parallelization, noting only that implications can be "beneficial or detrimental."
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from a network simulation or hardware test measuring bandwidth usage, latency, and message success rates under the proposed parallel communication scheme.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the approach when Assumption 1 (similar planning times for all agents) is violated in heterogeneous networks?
- Basis in paper: The method relies on Assumption 1 (T^(i) ≈ T) to correlate computation time with the number of computation levels.
- Why unresolved: If agents have significantly different computational capabilities or problem complexities, the longest path in the DAG may no longer accurately predict the actual makespan.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the method in a heterogeneous multi-agent scenario where planning times vary significantly across the network.

## Limitations
- Solution quality degradation: The method increases solution cost by 26.2% as a trade-off for reduced computation time.
- Dependence on coupling graph sparsity: Speedup is only significant when the chromatic number is much lower than the number of agents.
- No consideration of feasibility: The algorithm may assign high priority to agents that block the solution space for others.

## Confidence
- **High:** The theoretical equivalence between chromatic number and computation levels (Theorem 1), and the decentralized consistency mechanism (Algorithm 1 tie-breaking).
- **Medium:** The empirical speedup results on the intersection scenario, as they depend on the specific coupling graph construction which is not fully detailed.
- **Low:** Generalization to highly dynamic environments where coupling graphs change rapidly, as this could cause "churn" in priority assignments.

## Next Checks
1. **Determinism Test:** Run Algorithm 1 on 3 different agents with the same random graph input. Verify `hash(ColorMap)` is identical for all.
2. **Sparsity Stress Test:** Generate random graphs with varying edge probabilities (p=0.1 to 0.9). Plot Computation Levels (Nc) vs. Edge Density. Verify the speedup drops as p → 1.
3. **Baseline Timing:** Replicate the intersection scenario. Measure "Time to Solution" for `p_constant` (sequential) vs. `p_color`. Confirm the ~57% reduction holds.
