# Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in Time-Series LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.11512
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11512
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Position paper proposing three alignment paradigms (Injective, Bridging, Internal) to activate time-series reasoning in LLMs, arguing for paradigm prioritization over task-specific customization

## Executive Summary
This position paper argues that Large Language Models can be adapted for time-series reasoning through strategic alignment paradigms rather than task-specific customization. The authors propose a taxonomy based on three alignment paradigms—Injective, Bridging, and Internal—each targeting different time-series primitives: domain knowledge, temporal characteristics, and representation structures. By analyzing commonly used time-series datasets, the paper identifies essential primitives and provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate alignment strategies based on resource constraints and reasoning requirements.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a qualitative framework for adapting LLMs to time-series data through three distinct alignment paradigms. Injective Alignment injects numerical values into textual prompts for external interaction with frozen LLMs. Bridging Alignment uses learnable adapters to map numerical representations to semantically aligned textual forms. Internal Alignment modifies LLM components through fine-tuning to intrinsically capture time-series semantics. The framework emphasizes selecting paradigms based on which time-series primitive (domain, characteristic, or representation) is most critical for the application.

## Key Results
- Three alignment paradigms identified: Injective (prompt-based), Bridging (adapter-based), and Internal (fine-tuning-based)
- Time-series primitives categorized as Domain (medical context), Characteristic (temporal patterns), and Representation (numerical format)
- Practical guidance provided for selecting alignment strategies based on resource constraints and reasoning requirements
- Analysis of common time-series datasets reveals essential primitives that determine semantics and properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Injective Alignment via Prompt-Level Injection
- Claim: Numerical values can activate time-series reasoning in LLMs when domain knowledge is explicitly provided through prompts
- Mechanism: Embeds XNumber into textual context XText via injective function h_γ, yielding LLM-compatible X′_Text processed externally
- Core assumption: LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that surface through carefully constructed prompts containing both numerical data and domain context
- Evidence anchors: TEMPO-GPT demonstrates prompt sensitivity; GenG reduces dimensionality to suppress noise

### Mechanism 2: Bridging Alignment via External Adapter Mapping
- Claim: Learnable adapters can bridge the modality gap by mapping numerical time-series to semantically aligned textual representations
- Mechanism: Learnable mapping function g_ϕ(XNumber) transforms numerical input into textual form X″_Text, combined with original text via adapter modules
- Core assumption: A learnable transformation exists between numerical time-series embeddings and textual semantic space preserving essential temporal characteristics
- Evidence anchors: Time-LLM uses "reprogramming space"; TEST employs "contrastive learning at multiple instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned" levels

### Mechanism 3: Internal Alignment via Architectural Modification
- Claim: Modifying internal LLM components through fine-tuning can produce representations intrinsically capturing time-series semantics
- Mechanism: Internal functions d_ψ(·) enhance both numerical and textual representations, or induce entirely new representations through encoder/decoder modifications
- Core assumption: Time-series primitives can be encoded into LLM parameter space through targeted architectural changes
- Evidence anchors: GPT4TS preserves "enhanced position embedding layers"; CALF introduces "cross-modal matching module"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Modality Gap**
  - Why needed here: The fundamental challenge is that "a fundamental limitation arises from the modality gap between the symbolic natural language and time series data"
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a continuous numerical sequence (like hourly glucose readings) and discrete tokens (like words) create alignment challenges for transformer architectures?

- Concept: **Time-Series Primitives (Domain, Characteristic, Representation)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's taxonomy is built on these three primitives as "intrinsic, atomic, and indivisible components" that determine semantics, properties, and structural forms
  - Quick check question: Given a multivariate EEG dataset with patient metadata, can you identify which aspects correspond to Domain (medical context), Characteristic (temporal patterns), and Representation (numerical format)?

- Concept: **Zero-Shot vs. Task-Specific Customization Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues for "prioritizing alignment paradigms over task-specific model customization," requiring understanding of this trade-off
  - Quick check question: What are the resource cost implications of training a domain-specific model versus applying alignment paradigms to a general-purpose LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Injective Alignment: Prompt engineering layer → LLM (frozen) → Output
  - Bridging Alignment: Time-series input → Adapter module (g_ϕ) → Semantic mapping → LLM (frozen) → Output
  - Internal Alignment: Time-series input → Modified encoder (d_ψ) → Fine-tuned LLM (f′_θ) → Modified decoder → Output

- Critical path:
  1. Identify which primitive is most critical for your use case (Domain, Characteristic, or Representation)
  2. Assess resource constraints (computational budget, labor expertise, data quality)
  3. Select paradigm: Injective (economical, domain-focused) → Bridging (flexible, characteristic-focused) → Internal (efficient, representation-focused)
  4. The paper recommends: "Practitioners should continue optimization and evaluation with sufficient domain expertise well-suited to craft precise prompts" for Injective; "proficiency in hyperparameter tuning and adapter debugging" for Bridging; "deep understanding of LLM internals and significant engineering expertise" for Internal

- Design tradeoffs:
  | Paradigm | Resource Cost | Reasoning Improvement | Complexity | Best For |
  |----------|---------------|----------------------|------------|----------|
  | Injective | Minimal | Low-Medium | Low | Domain-specific applications with available expertise |
  | Bridging | Moderate | High | Medium | General alignment emphasizing temporal characteristics |
  | Internal | Maximum | Maximum | High | Representation-critical applications with engineering resources |

- Failure signatures:
  - Injective: "High information loss" from poorly constructed prompts; performance sensitive to "quality of prompt design"
  - Bridging: Inference latency degradation; adapter misalignment producing semantically incoherent mappings
  - Internal: Overfitting to limited time-series data; catastrophic forgetting of general LLM capabilities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Injective baseline**: Implement prompt quantization on your domain's time-series data using a frozen LLM; measure zero-shot performance on forecasting vs. reasoning tasks
  2. **Bridging comparison**: Add a trainable adapter layer (e.g., contrastive learning approach from TEST) and compare alignment quality against inference latency overhead
  3. **Internal exploration**: Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA-style adaptation mentioned in references) to encoder components only; evaluate whether representation enhancement improves downstream task performance without full model modification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can time-series LLMs effectively align with infinite-length, streaming data under constraints of storage, computation, and processing frequency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 identifies "Infinite-length Alignment" as a key future direction, explicitly listing storage, computation, and processing frequency as constraints that challenge real-time understanding
- Why unresolved: Streaming data is unbounded and non-stationary, causing semantic drift over time, whereas current models largely operate on static or bounded contexts
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanism that enables adaptive interpretation and extreme-length reasoning in real-time without violating resource constraints

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific alignment strategies are required to transition time-series LLMs from multi-modality to omni-modality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1 posits that time-series LLMs will progress to omni-modality, necessitating strategies like omni-modal fusion to unify heterogeneous features
- Why unresolved: Current alignment paradigms generally handle specific modalities (text, number) or pairs, but efficient, unified alignment across all potential modalities remains undefined
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework demonstrating improved efficiency and reduced ambiguity through unified omni-modal feature alignment compared to multi-modal baselines

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the trade-off between resource costs (computational and labor) and reasoning improvements be quantified when selecting an alignment paradigm?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.2 discusses "Alignment Advantages and Disadvantages," noting that costs vary significantly and require a "thorough cost–benefit analysis," yet provides only qualitative instructions
- Why unresolved: The paper provides rules of thumb (e.g., Injective is low cost) but lacks a standardized metric or benchmark to quantify this trade-off for specific deployment scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: A quantitative evaluation framework that measures specific resource expenditures against performance gains for Injective, Bridging, and Internal alignment

## Limitations

- No empirical validation or quantitative performance comparisons between alignment paradigms
- Lacks standardized evaluation benchmarks for comparing alignment quality and inference efficiency
- Limited discussion of catastrophic forgetting risks and cross-domain generalization challenges

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental premise that time-series data requires special alignment with LLM architectures is well-supported
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed taxonomy based on Domain, Characteristic, and Representation primitives provides a useful organizing principle
- **Low Confidence**: The practical implementation guidance lacks specificity for bridging and internal alignment architectures

## Next Checks

1. Implement the three alignment paradigms on a standardized time-series reasoning task (e.g., forecasting from ETTh1 dataset) and measure both accuracy and inference latency to quantify the trade-offs the paper describes
2. Conduct an ablation study varying prompt quality, adapter complexity, and encoder depth to determine the sensitivity of each paradigm to design choices and identify breaking points
3. Test cross-domain transfer by applying an alignment paradigm trained on financial data to medical time-series, measuring performance degradation to validate the domain-primitive assumptions
