# CHARM: Considering Human Attributes for Reinforcement Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.13079
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13079
- Reference count: 40
- Human characteristics (robot experience, education) improve scalar feedback prediction accuracy from 32.59% to 55.83%

## Executive Summary
This work addresses how human characteristics affect feedback patterns in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The authors challenge the assumption that human feedback is purely task-dependent and correct by investigating how attributes like robot experience and educational background influence feedback. Through a public space study with 46 participants across six domains, they found fair correlations between human characteristics and feedback values, particularly for robot experience and educational background. Their novel CHARM method incorporates human characteristics alongside task statistics to predict feedback, significantly outperforming baselines that use only task statistics.

## Method Summary
The CHARM approach collects human feedback and characteristics through questionnaires across six domains (trust, robot experience, education, teaching experience, teaching style, personality) during robot manipulation tasks. An MLP oracle takes both human characteristics and task statistics (cumulative reward from Density-Based Reward Modeling) as input to predict feedback values and delays. The model is trained with weighted cross-entropy loss for value prediction and MSE for delay prediction, using 10-fold cross-validation on 4,655 data points from 46 participants.

## Key Results
- CHARM achieved 55.83% accuracy on five-point feedback scale versus 32.59% for task-only baseline
- Binary feedback accuracy improved from 79.35% to 87.03% with CHARM
- Robot experience and educational background showed fair correlations with feedback accuracy (0.25 and 0.16 coefficients)
- No significant correlations found between questionnaire domains and feedback delay

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human characteristics—particularly robot experience and educational background—contain signal that improves prediction of scalar feedback values beyond task statistics alone.
- Mechanism: Participants with domain-relevant backgrounds may better interpret robot behavior and map it to feedback scales more consistently, reducing noise in the feedback-value mapping function.
- Core assumption: The relationship between characteristics and feedback is at least partially systematic and learnable, not purely idiosyncratic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "human feedback value can be more accurately predicted with human characteristics compared to only using task statistics"
  - [section V-B] "Robot experience and educational background exhibit correlation coefficients of 0.25 and 0.16 with feedback accuracy"
  - [corpus] Related work on personalized preference learning (MiCRo, arXiv:2505.24846) similarly assumes heterogeneous preferences are partially predictable from user attributes.
- Break condition: If correlations were near-zero across all domains, or if the MLP with characteristics failed to outperform task-only baselines, the mechanism would not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Feedback value prediction benefits from jointly modeling human characteristics and task statistics, even when individual characteristic correlations are modest.
- Mechanism: An MLP can capture non-linear interactions between multiple characteristic domains and task statistics that univariate correlation analysis misses.
- Core assumption: The mapping F(hc, r) → f* is non-linear and multi-factorial; individual linear correlations underestimate the joint predictive power.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V-C] CHARM achieved 55.83% vs 32.59% accuracy on five-point scale and 87.03% vs 79.35% on binary feedback (p < 0.001 for both)
  - [section VI] "the relationship between human characteristics and feedback patterns might not be linear, and multiple domains of human characteristics can jointly affect human feedback"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on joint modeling specifically; related work focuses on reward calibration or preference heterogeneity rather than human attribute conditioning.
- Break condition: If a linear model with characteristics matched MLP performance, or if ablation showed no benefit from joint inputs, the non-linear joint mechanism would be unsupported.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feedback delay is not meaningfully predicted by the measured human characteristic domains under paused-interaction conditions.
- Mechanism: Delay may be driven by situational factors (distraction, hesitation) not captured by trait-level questionnaires, or by the experimental design (paused robot, 5-second timeout).
- Core assumption: The questionnaire domains span the relevant predictors; delay is not simply measurement noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V-B] "we did not find any significant correlation between any domain of the questionnaire and feedback delay"
  - [section V-C] Both task-statistics-only and CHARM models performed poorly on delay prediction (MSE 0.30 vs 0.37, R² 0.19 vs 0.02)
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly address delay prediction from user attributes.
- Break condition: If follow-up studies with continuous (unpaused) interaction showed strong delay-characteristic correlations, the mechanism would be limited to paused paradigms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
  - Why needed here: CHARM is a feedback simulator for RLHF pipelines; understanding the feedback loop (agent → behavior → human → feedback → reward model → policy update) is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you sketch the RLHF data flow and identify where a feedback simulator would be inserted?

- Concept: **Scalar vs. binary feedback and delay modeling**
  - Why needed here: The paper models both feedback value (5-point Likert scale, binarizable) and delay; understanding tradeoffs between richness and noise is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might scalar feedback be noisier than binary, and what does delay add to the feedback pattern representation?

- Concept: **Correlation analysis limitations and non-linear modeling**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Pearson correlation to identify candidate features, but relies on MLP to capture non-linear joint effects; confusing the two can lead to misinterpretation.
  - Quick check question: If individual feature correlations are ~0.2, how could a joint non-linear model still provide substantial prediction gains?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Questionnaire module → vectorized hc
  Task statistics extractor → cumulative reward r̂
  Feedback oracle F (MLP) → inputs (hc, r̂) → outputs (predicted value f*, predicted delay d*)
  Loss function → L = CrossEntropy(value_pred, value_gt) + MSE(delay_pred, delay_gt)

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train agents at varied proficiencies (500/1000/2000 epochs) to generate diverse trajectories
  2. Collect human characteristics via questionnaire
  3. Collect feedback (value + delay) for sampled trajectories
  4. Train MLP oracle with k-fold cross-validation, weighted loss for class imbalance
  5. Evaluate on 5-point and binary scales

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Paused vs. continuous interaction**: Paused collection enables precise delay measurement but may not generalize to real-time RLHF.
  - **6 domains vs. fewer**: Broader coverage increases feature dimensionality; some domains (trust, teaching style) showed lower correlations, suggesting pruning could reduce noise.
  - **MLP vs. simpler models**: MLP captures non-linear interactions but reduces interpretability compared to linear baselines.

- Failure signatures:
  - Delay prediction R² near zero (observed) indicates the model is not learning meaningful delay patterns.
  - Large gap between training and validation accuracy would suggest overfitting to the 46-participant sample.
  - If binary accuracy were only marginally above chance, the task statistics alone would be insufficient signal.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce baseline vs. CHARM comparison**: Train two MLPs (task-only vs. task+characteristics) on the released dataset; verify the 55.83% vs 32.59% and 87.03% vs 79.35% accuracy gaps with k-fold cross-validation.
  2. **Ablate characteristic domains**: Train CHARM variants with one domain removed at a time; quantify contribution of robot experience and education vs. lower-correlation domains (trust, teaching style).
  3. **Test on held-out participants**: Hold out 6–10 participants entirely; evaluate whether CHARM generalizes to new users whose characteristics were not seen during training, probing risk of participant-level overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the relationship between human characteristics and feedback patterns remain consistent during continuous, unpauseed human-robot interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that pausing the robot to record feedback is a limitation, noting that "feedback delay data might not be representative for continuous interactions."
- Why unresolved: The study methodology required pausing the robot to prompt users via a GUI, artificially structuring the feedback timing window.
- What evidence would resolve it: A within-subjects study comparing feedback delay and value distributions between paused (GUI-based) and continuous (real-time) interaction conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, cultural background) influence feedback patterns compared to the psychometric and experiential factors studied?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge in Section III-B that while they excluded demographic data to avoid discrimination, these factors "are very likely to influence feedback patterns."
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately restricted data collection to six specific domains (trust, experience, education, etc.), leaving demographic variables unmeasured.
- What evidence would resolve it: Collecting voluntary demographic data alongside the current questionnaire to analyze the variance explained by these factors versus the current characteristic domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the observed correlations between human characteristics and feedback transfer to physical robot platforms outside of simulated environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments were conducted entirely within the Robosuite simulator displayed on a screen. While the goal is to bridge the "lab-to-real-world" gap, the data reflects interaction with a virtual agent rather than a physically embodied one.
- Why unresolved: Physical presence (proximity, noise, safety risks) can alter human trust and attention, potentially changing how characteristics translate into feedback.
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeating the CHARM training protocol using a physical robot arm performing the same tasks (nut assembly, coffee preparation) with human participants.

## Limitations
- Paused interaction design may not generalize to continuous RLHF applications
- Only 46 participants, raising concerns about sample size and representativeness
- Delay prediction shows no meaningful correlation with human characteristics under current experimental conditions

## Confidence

**High** confidence that CHARM improves feedback prediction over task-only baselines based on statistically significant accuracy gains (55.83% vs 32.59% and 87.03% vs 79.35%).

**Medium** confidence that the mechanism involves non-linear interactions between characteristics and task statistics, though individual correlations are modest.

**Low** confidence that the observed relationships generalize beyond the specific 46-participant sample and paused-interaction paradigm.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization to new participants**: Hold out 20-30% of participants entirely during training and test CHARM on their feedback patterns. This directly tests whether characteristic-based prediction generalizes beyond the specific sample, addressing overfitting concerns.

2. **Continuous interaction validation**: Replicate the study with unpaused, real-time interaction where participants provide feedback as the robot acts. Compare whether characteristic correlations persist and whether delay prediction improves without artificial time constraints.

3. **Domain ablation and noise analysis**: Systematically remove each characteristic domain from CHARM and measure accuracy degradation. Additionally, compute noise-adjusted correlations by regressing out task statistics effects to isolate the unique contribution of human attributes.
