# Leveraging Synthetic Priors for Monocular Depth Estimation in Specular Surgical Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23786
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23786
- Authors: Ankan Aich; Yangming Lee
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: V2-based model reduces squared relative error from 0.341 to 0.325 in high-specularity regimes, demonstrating superiority of synthetic priors for surgical depth estimation.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses monocular depth estimation in specular surgical environments where conventional self-supervised methods struggle due to boundary collapse on thin tools and transparent surfaces. The proposed solution leverages high-fidelity synthetic priors from Depth Anything V2 (DAv2), which captures precise geometric details, and adapts them to the medical domain using parameter-efficient Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA). To rigorously evaluate robustness in adverse specular conditions, the authors introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset, clustering frames by ground truth validity density. The approach establishes state-of-the-art performance, achieving an accuracy (δ < 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
The method employs synthetic priors from Depth Anything V2, capturing precise geometric details, and adapts them to surgical domains using DV-LORA. A physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset clusters frames by ground truth validity density to assess performance under varying specularity conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieves accuracy (δ < 1.25) of 98.1%
- Reduces Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to baselines
- In high-specularity regimes, reduces squared relative error from 0.341 to 0.325

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages high-fidelity synthetic priors from Depth Anything V2, which captures precise geometric details, and adapts them to the medical domain using parameter-efficient DV-LORA. This combination addresses the challenges of specular surgical environments where conventional self-supervised methods fail due to boundary collapse on thin tools and transparent surfaces.

## Foundational Learning

**Synthetic Priors**: Pre-trained depth models that provide geometric guidance for downstream adaptation. Needed because surgical environments have unique specular properties that challenge traditional self-supervised learning. Quick check: Verify the synthetic priors capture the geometric details of surgical tools.

**Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts synthetic priors to medical domain. Needed to balance adaptation effectiveness with computational efficiency. Quick check: Confirm DV-LORA maintains depth accuracy while reducing parameter count.

**Physically-Stratified Evaluation Protocol**: Evaluation framework that clusters frames by ground truth validity density. Needed to rigorously assess model performance across varying specularity conditions. Quick check: Ensure stratification captures meaningful differences in specularity levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input frames → Depth Anything V2 (synthetic priors) → DV-LORA adaptation → SCARED evaluation

**Critical Path**: The synthetic priors from DAv2 provide geometric guidance that is crucial for accurate depth estimation in specular environments. The DV-LORA adaptation ensures this guidance is effectively transferred to the medical domain.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parameter-efficient DV-LORA adaptation vs. full fine-tuning - balances computational efficiency with adaptation effectiveness. High-fidelity synthetic priors vs. domain-specific training - trades generalization for specialized accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: Boundary collapse on thin tools and transparent surfaces indicates insufficient adaptation to specular properties. High specularity may still cause depth estimation errors despite synthetic priors.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test depth estimation on thin surgical tools with high specular reflection
2. Evaluate performance on transparent surgical instruments
3. Assess temporal consistency in dynamic surgical scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic priors may not fully capture unique surgical tool characteristics
- DV-LORA adaptation may limit capacity to learn domain-specific features compared to full fine-tuning
- Evaluation metrics don't explicitly address temporal consistency or robustness to rapid motion

## Confidence

- High confidence: Improvement in depth estimation accuracy (98.1% δ < 1.25) and reduction in Squared Relative Error (17% improvement) are well-supported by evaluation protocol and comparative analysis with baselines.
- Medium confidence: Superiority of synthetic priors over traditional self-supervised methods in specular surgical environments is demonstrated, but generalizability to other surgical datasets or real-time applications remains to be validated.
- Low confidence: Long-term robustness and adaptability of DV-LORA-based adaptation strategy to unseen surgical scenarios or instruments are not fully explored.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the model's performance on additional surgical datasets with varying tool designs and tissue types to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct real-time deployment tests to measure temporal consistency and robustness to rapid motion in dynamic surgical environments.
3. Compare the DV-LORA adaptation strategy with full fine-tuning approaches to quantify trade-offs in parameter efficiency versus depth estimation accuracy.
