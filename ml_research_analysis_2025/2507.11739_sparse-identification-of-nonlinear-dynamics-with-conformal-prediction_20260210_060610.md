# Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Conformal Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11739
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11739
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conformal prediction methods improve uncertainty quantification in SINDy models, achieving 90% target coverage with reliable model selection guidance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification in sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) by integrating conformal prediction methods with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy). The authors propose three applications: time series prediction using EnbPI and CP-PID methods, model selection via LOCO and LOCO-path techniques, and model coefficient uncertainty quantification using feature-CP. Experiments on predator-prey and chaotic systems demonstrate that conformal prediction methods significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to standard E-SINDy approaches.

The key innovation lies in adapting conformal prediction - a distribution-free uncertainty quantification framework - to the specific challenges of sparse dynamical system identification. By leveraging ensemble methods and conformal techniques, the approach achieves robust uncertainty estimates even under process noise and non-Gaussian noise conditions, with target coverage rates reaching 90% across different experimental scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper integrates conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) to quantify uncertainty in nonlinear dynamical system models. Three applications are proposed: (1) time series prediction using EnbPI and CP-PID methods, achieving 90% target coverage with relatively narrow intervals even under process noise and non-Gaussian noise; (2) model selection via LOCO and LOCO-path to assess feature importance, showing stable discrimination between active and irrelevant terms; (3) model coefficient uncertainty quantification using feature-CP, producing more robust intervals than standard E-SINDy, especially under non-Gaussian and process noise. Experiments on predator-prey and chaotic systems demonstrate that conformal prediction methods improve uncertainty quantification in SINDy, offering reliable coverage and improved model selection guidance, with potential for real-world applications.

## Key Results
- Time series prediction achieves 90% target coverage using EnbPI and CP-PID methods, even under process noise and non-Gaussian noise
- Model selection via LOCO and LOCO-path shows stable discrimination between active and irrelevant terms in predator-prey and chaotic systems
- Feature-CP produces more robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients than standard E-SINDy, particularly under non-Gaussian and process noise conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of conformal prediction with ensemble methods addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying uncertainty in sparse dynamical system identification. By leveraging the distribution-free nature of conformal prediction, the approach provides reliable coverage guarantees without requiring assumptions about noise distributions. The ensemble framework helps stabilize the sparse regression process inherent in SINDy, while conformal methods ensure that uncertainty quantification remains robust across different noise regimes and system complexities.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction** - Distribution-free uncertainty quantification method that provides coverage guarantees without parametric assumptions. Why needed: Traditional uncertainty quantification in SINDy relies on distributional assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios. Quick check: Verify coverage rates across different noise distributions using quantile calibration plots.

**Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy)** - Ensemble-based approach to sparse regression for dynamical systems. Why needed: Standard SINDy can be unstable due to its sequential thresholding and selection process. Quick check: Compare coefficient stability across different random seeds and ensemble sizes.

**Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)** - Feature importance assessment method that evaluates model performance when individual terms are removed. Why needed: Identifies which nonlinear terms are truly active versus spurious correlations. Quick check: Compare LOCO scores across different regularization parameters to assess stability.

**EnbPI (Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals)** - Conformal prediction method for batch time series forecasting. Why needed: Provides simultaneous uncertainty quantification for multiple future time steps. Quick check: Evaluate interval width versus coverage trade-off across prediction horizons.

**CP-PID (Conformal Prediction Prediction Interval Detection)** - Online conformal prediction method for sequential data. Why needed: Enables adaptive uncertainty quantification for streaming data applications. Quick check: Monitor coverage stability as prediction horizon increases.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Time Series Data -> Preprocessing -> Ensemble Generation -> SINDy Regression -> Conformal Prediction -> Uncertainty Quantification

Critical Path: The most critical sequence involves generating diverse ensemble members through subsampling or perturbation, applying SINDy regression to each ensemble member, then applying conformal prediction to the ensemble predictions to generate calibrated uncertainty intervals.

Design Tradeoffs: Larger ensemble sizes improve uncertainty quantification reliability but increase computational cost. The choice between EnbPI (batch) and CP-PID (online) methods depends on whether predictions are needed sequentially or in batches. LOCO-based feature selection trades computational efficiency for interpretability.

Failure Signatures: Poor coverage rates indicate either insufficient ensemble diversity or violations of exchangeability assumptions in conformal prediction. Wide uncertainty intervals suggest model misspecification or excessive noise levels. Inconsistent LOCO scores across different significance levels indicate unstable feature selection.

First Experiments:
1. Verify coverage rates on simple linear systems with known noise distributions
2. Compare ensemble size effects on uncertainty interval width and computational time
3. Test LOCO feature selection stability across different regularization parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on ensemble size and prediction horizon choices, with no systematic hyperparameter study across diverse dynamical regimes
- Focuses primarily on low-dimensional systems without demonstrating scalability to high-dimensional or spatially extended systems
- Limited comparison against standard E-SINDy uncertainty quantification, lacking validation on real-world noisy data with unknown ground truth

## Confidence
High confidence: Improved uncertainty quantification (feature-CP producing more robust intervals) based on systematic comparison across multiple noise types and explicit coverage metrics.

Medium confidence: Model selection capability via LOCO/LOCO-path showing stable discrimination due to limited comparison with alternative feature selection methods and absence of statistical significance testing.

Low confidence: Real-world applicability claim as experiments remain confined to controlled synthetic datasets without field validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test scalability to high-dimensional systems (e.g., fluid dynamics or large biochemical networks) to verify computational tractability and prediction quality degradation
2. Validate on real experimental time series data (e.g., from mechanical systems or biological sensors) with unknown ground truth to assess practical utility
3. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying ensemble size, prediction horizon, and significance level to characterize robustness boundaries and identify failure modes
