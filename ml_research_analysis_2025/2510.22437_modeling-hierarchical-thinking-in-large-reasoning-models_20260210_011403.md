- Proposes FSM framework to model reasoning dynamics in Large Reasoning Models through six discrete states

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework to systematically analyze and model the reasoning dynamics of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). The framework defines six discrete reasoning states—initialization, deduction, augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and final-conclusion—to represent the functional role of each step in a model's Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Through LLM-based auto-labeling of reasoning traces and dataset-level transition matrix analysis, the authors reveal distinct reasoning patterns between mathematical and scientific tasks, demonstrating that high-performing models exhibit more adaptive reasoning trajectories while weaker models rely on shorter, rigid deduction paths.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a hierarchical FSM framework that models LRM reasoning as transitions between six discrete states representing different reasoning functions. They develop an LLM-based auto-labeling approach to annotate reasoning traces at both sentence and paragraph levels, enabling construction of dataset-level transition matrices. The framework is validated on mathematical (AIME 25) and scientific (GPQA Diamond) reasoning tasks, where transition matrices are computed and analyzed to reveal patterns in reasoning behavior across models and tasks. The approach provides a structured abstraction for interpretable, quantitative comparison of reasoning behaviors and offers insights into improving model training and controllability.

## Key Results
- High-performing models show longer, more adaptive reasoning trajectories with frequent transitions through augmentation, uncertainty estimation, and backtracking states
- Mathematical reasoning benefits from extended, self-regulated exploration while scientific reasoning favors compact, evidence-driven decision-making
- Distinct reasoning styles emerge between mathematical and scientific domains, with weaker models relying on shorter, rigid deduction paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The FSM framework works by abstracting the complex, continuous reasoning process into discrete, interpretable states that capture functional roles in problem-solving. By modeling reasoning as state transitions, the framework reveals how models explore solution spaces, handle uncertainty, and adapt strategies. The auto-labeling approach enables scalable annotation of reasoning traces, while transition matrices provide quantitative measures of reasoning behavior patterns. This structured representation allows for systematic comparison of reasoning quality and identification of differences in problem-solving approaches across domains and model capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**: Understanding how models generate intermediate reasoning steps is crucial for analyzing the reasoning process and identifying functional roles of different thought patterns
- **State transition modeling**: Learning how to represent sequential decision-making as state transitions enables quantitative analysis of reasoning dynamics and comparison across models
- **LLM-based auto-labeling**: Mastering automated annotation techniques is essential for scalable analysis of large reasoning datasets without extensive manual labeling
- **Transition matrix analysis**: Understanding how to construct and interpret transition matrices provides insights into reasoning patterns and quality assessment
- **Domain-specific reasoning**: Recognizing how different problem domains (mathematical vs. scientific) influence reasoning strategies helps tailor model training and evaluation approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM-based auto-labeling -> State annotation -> Transition matrix construction -> Reasoning pattern analysis -> Performance comparison

**Critical Path**
1. Reasoning trace generation by LRM
2. Auto-labeling of states using LLM
3. Construction of transition matrices
4. Analysis of reasoning patterns
5. Comparison across models and tasks

**Design Tradeoffs**
- State granularity vs. interpretability: More states provide finer detail but may complicate analysis
- Auto-labeling accuracy vs. scalability: LLM-based labeling enables large-scale analysis but introduces potential noise
- Domain specificity vs. generalizability: Task-specific states may capture domain nuances better but limit cross-domain applicability

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-reliance on deduction state indicates rigid, inflexible reasoning
- Minimal transitions suggest limited exploration and adaptability
- Excessive backtracking may indicate poor initial problem understanding
- Short reasoning trajectories could signal insufficient problem-solving depth

**First Experiments**
1. Apply FSM framework to commonsense reasoning tasks to test state definition universality
2. Compare human expert annotation with LLM-based auto-labeling on a subset of traces
3. Conduct ablation study by removing individual states to assess their contribution to distinguishing reasoning patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- FSM state definitions may not generalize across diverse reasoning domains beyond mathematical and scientific tasks
- LLM-based auto-labeling introduces potential labeling noise affecting transition matrix construction and analysis
- Interpretation of reasoning quality through state transitions may conflate verbosity with effectiveness

## Confidence
- High confidence: FSM framework's ability to reveal distinct reasoning patterns between mathematical and scientific tasks
- Medium confidence: Generalizability of six-state model across domains, reliability of LLM-based auto-labeling, interpretation of reasoning quality through transitions
- Low confidence: Causal relationship between specific reasoning sequences and task performance, framework's applicability to non-technical reasoning domains

## Next Checks
1. Apply FSM framework to reasoning tasks from diverse domains (commonsense reasoning, ethical decision-making, creative problem-solving) to assess state definition universality
2. Conduct human expert annotation of reasoning traces to validate LLM-based auto-labeling accuracy and quantify labeling noise impact
3. Perform ablation study by systematically removing or merging states to determine which contribute most significantly to distinguishing reasoning patterns and performance differences
