# Reinforcement Learning for Monetary Policy Under Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Analyzing Tabular and Function Approximation Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17929
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17929
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Standard tabular Q-learning (-615.13 ± 309.58 mean return) significantly outperformed sophisticated RL methods and Taylor Rule baselines for dynamic interest rate setting

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates nine reinforcement learning approaches for dynamic interest rate setting under macroeconomic uncertainty using historical FRED data (1955-2025). The authors construct a linear-Gaussian transition model and compare methods ranging from simple tabular Q-learning to deep RL and Bayesian approaches. Surprisingly, the simplest method—tabular Q-learning with manual discretization—achieved the best performance, significantly outperforming both enhanced RL techniques and traditional policy rules. The analysis reveals that algorithmic sophistication does not guarantee improved performance in this domain, with simpler approaches showing greater robustness.

## Method Summary
The study formulates monetary policy as a discrete-action Markov decision process with quarterly timesteps. States consist of inflation (YoY CPI), unemployment, output gap, and policy rate, discretized into a 6×6×7×6 = 1,512 state space. Actions are discrete interest rate changes (±0.5%, hold). The linear-Gaussian transition model x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bi_t + ε_t is fitted via OLS on FRED data. The quadratic reward function r_t = -(w_π(π_t - π*)² + λ_u(u_t - u*)² + η(Δi_t)²) penalizes deviations from inflation (2.0%), unemployment (4.5%), and rate volatility targets. Nine RL methods are evaluated, with tabular Q-learning (α=0.1, γ=0.99, ε=0.1) achieving the best performance.

## Key Results
- Standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 ± 309.58 mean return), significantly outperforming enhanced RL methods
- Despite being the most sophisticated, deep RL methods showed higher variance and no clear advantage over simpler approaches
- Tabular Q-learning achieved better inflation control (8.63±4.74) with similar unemployment performance compared to Taylor Rule baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tabular Q-learning outperforms sophisticated methods in low-dimensional, discretizable macroeconomic state spaces. Manual discretization (6×6×7×6 = 1,512 states) imposes structured abstraction aligned with the linear-Gaussian dynamics, reducing variance and stabilizing learning. The low-dimensional state representation (4 variables) eliminates the representational advantage of function approximation.

### Mechanism 2
The quadratic loss reward function provides dense, differentiable feedback that guides policy toward dual-mandate compliance. The reward r_t = -(w_π(π_t - π*)² + λ_u(u_t - u*)² + η(Δi_t)²) penalizes deviations from inflation target (2.0%), unemployment target (4.5%), and rate volatility. This creates a smooth optimization landscape amenable to gradient-based and value-based learning.

### Mechanism 3
Function approximation methods (DQN, Actor-Critic) suffer from instability and high variance in this domain due to unnecessary flexibility. Deep networks introduce optimization complexity without benefit when the true Q-function is well-approximated by a low-dimensional table. Experience replay and target networks add hyperparameter sensitivity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation**
  - Why needed here: Monetary policy is inherently sequential—current rate decisions affect future inflation and unemployment. Understanding states, actions, transitions, and rewards is prerequisite to any RL approach.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the Bellman equation applies to interest rate setting?

- **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff**
  - Why needed here: Central banks cannot run randomized experiments. The epsilon-greedy exploration in simulation must translate to principled uncertainty handling in deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why might Thompson sampling be preferable to epsilon-greedy for a risk-averse central bank?

- **Policy evaluation under distribution shift**
  - Why needed here: The transition model is fitted on historical data. Performance in simulation ≠ performance under structural breaks or policy-induced feedback.
  - Quick check question: What happens to your learned policy if the Phillips curve relationship changes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data ingestion → State discretization → Q-table lookup → Action selection → Environment step → Reward computation → Q-table update

- **Critical path**: Data → Discretization → Q-value → Action → Environment → Reward → Update

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Discretization granularity: Finer bins capture more nuance but increase sample complexity; 1,512 states worked better than 256 or 64
  - Action space size: 3 actions (±0.5%, hold) vs. 5 actions (±1.0%, ±0.5%, hold)—larger action space requires more exploration
  - Training episodes: Extended training (10,000 episodes) did not improve over standard training, suggesting early convergence or overfitting

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Diverging Q-values: Learning rate too high or reward scale too large
  - High variance across episodes: Insufficient exploration or unstable function approximation
  - Policy ignores unemployment: Check reward weights (λ_u may be too low relative to w_π)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate tabular Q-learning baseline with the specified discretization (6×6×7×6) and hyperparameters (α=0.1, γ=0.99, ε=0.1) on the linear-Gaussian environment. Verify mean return approximately -615.
  2. Ablate discretization: Compare 256-state (coarse) vs. 1,512-state (legacy) to quantify representation effects on performance and variance.
  3. Stress-test transition model: Introduce regime-switching or non-Gaussian shocks to evaluate robustness of tabular vs. DQN methods under model misspecification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Would deep RL methods outperform tabular approaches if the environment utilized non-linear macroeconomic dynamics? The authors hypothesize that tabular Q-learning succeeded due to inductive biases aligning with the linear dynamics, but this was not tested against complex, non-linear environments.

### Open Question 2
Can continuous action spaces improve performance over the discrete action MDP constraints used in this study? The study restricted actions to discrete increments (e.g., +/- 0.5%), potentially preventing the precision required for optimal interest rate setting.

### Open Question 3
Do the learned policies maintain robustness when deployed in non-stationary environments with structural breaks? Agents were trained and evaluated on the same fixed historical transition model, obscuring whether they can adapt to regime shifts like financial crises.

## Limitations

- All methods evaluated on a linear-Gaussian simulation that may not capture critical nonlinearities, regime changes, or structural breaks in real macroeconomic dynamics
- Fixed reward weights may not represent actual central bank preferences across different economic conditions
- Discretization scheme's optimality remains unverified, and the performance advantage may be specific to this modeling assumption

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Tabular Q-learning outperforming sophisticated methods in this specific simulation setup; overall finding that simpler methods show robustness in this domain
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanisms explaining tabular success (structured abstraction reducing variance); claim that function approximation adds unnecessary complexity for this low-dimensional problem
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to real-world deployment; specific reward weight values encoding true central bank preferences; robustness under model misspecification

## Next Checks

1. **Stress test transition model**: Introduce regime-switching or non-Gaussian shocks to evaluate whether tabular methods maintain their advantage under model misspecification
2. **Reward weight sensitivity**: Vary (w_π, λ_u, η) systematically to determine if the performance ranking holds under different central bank preference specifications
3. **Real-world backtest**: Implement the best-performing tabular policy on out-of-sample historical periods to assess performance degradation compared to simulation results
