# Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.19944
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** AML achieves 97.63% accuracy on MNIST without validation data, comparable to optimized MLPs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Algebraic Machine Learning (AML), a novel learning framework that reframes machine learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task. Unlike statistical methods, AML encodes data and objectives as axioms in a semilattice algebra, then uses subdirect decomposition to break down problems into atomic components. The key innovation is Sparse Crossing, an algorithm that directly computes generalizing models from these axioms without requiring validation data or hyperparameter tuning. The approach achieves competitive accuracy on standard datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10 while offering advantages like direct learning from training data and asymptotic convergence to underlying data rules.

## Method Summary
AML encodes machine learning tasks as algebraic problems by mapping data inputs to constants and training examples to "duples" (order relations in a semilattice structure). The Sparse Crossing algorithm iteratively processes these duples, expanding atoms through Full Crossing and pruning them using trace constraints derived from negative examples. This computes a "freest model" of the data that satisfies all axioms without overfitting. The system learns by growing and maturing atoms that converge to the underlying task structure, allowing direct inference without validation sets or hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- AML achieves 97.63% test accuracy on MNIST (vs 98.46% for optimized MLPs) without using validation data
- The method demonstrates capability to solve formal problems like finding Hamiltonian cycles from specifications without search
- Theoretical analysis shows atoms discovered during training converge to the underlying problem structure
- AML scales through model additivity and offers asymptotic convergence to underlying data rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generalization via Atom Maturation
- **Claim:** Learning generalizes because atoms discovered in the freest model of training data asymptotically converge to atoms of underlying task rules.
- **Mechanism:** Atoms grow via Full Crossing as positive axioms are processed. Once mature (stop growing), they theoretically produce zero false negatives. The model selects subsets of these mature atoms to form a generalizing model that satisfies data without overfitting to noise.
- **Core assumption:** Underlying rules of the task can be expressed as finite algebraic axioms, and the freest model of data approximates the freest model of rules.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states atoms converge to underlying problem structure; page 10 explains maturation produces lower false negative probability; no direct validation in corpus.
- **Break condition:** Significant mislabeled examples breaking logical consistency of axioms, or rules not expressible in semilattice algebra, cause atoms to fail convergence or mature incorrectly.

### Mechanism 2: Direct Computation via Sparse Crossing
- **Claim:** Sparse Crossing avoids computational intractability of full algebraic decomposition by selectively retaining only atoms necessary to discriminate negative examples.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of computing massive freest model, Sparse Crossing uses trace function to enforce positive axioms while ensuring trace constraint (from negative axioms) remains satisfied. This discards redundant atoms immediately, keeping model size small while preserving discriminative power.
- **Core assumption:** A generalizing model exists as small subset of freest model's atoms, specifically those required to distinguish positive from negative instances.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions Sparse Crossing computes generalizing subsets directly; page 12 describes selective atom choice for discrimination; no direct validation in corpus.
- **Break condition:** Insufficient or unrepresentative negative examples lead to weak trace constraints, failing to prune model effectively and potentially causing false positives.

### Mechanism 3: Axiomatization via Semantic Embedding
- **Claim:** Machine learning tasks can be reframed as algebraic problems by encoding data and goals as axioms in semilattice structure.
- **Mechanism:** Data inputs mapped to constants; training example encoded as duple (e.g., "image X is digit 7" as TL ≤ TR). This transforms statistical pattern recognition into logical deduction and structural decomposition problem.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic embedding preserves essential features of input domain required for task.
- **Evidence anchors:** Page 3 states goal and data encoded as axioms; page 14 describes black/white image classification using same embedding strategy; related corpus suggests broader context but doesn't validate specific embedding for ML.
- **Break condition:** Lossy or poorly designed embedding fails to capture necessary information (e.g., spatial relationships in images), preventing algebraic model recovery regardless of solver quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Semilattices & Partial Orders**
  - **Why needed here:** AML replaces neural weights with semilattice structure. Understanding idempotent operator (⊙) and order relation (≤) is essential to grasp how model combines constants and satisfies duples.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why operation A ⊙ A = A (idempotence) implies ordering in the algebra?

- **Concept: The Freest Model (Universal Algebra)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core theoretical object is "freest model"—model where only axioms and logical consequences hold. This contrasts with statistical models that fit weights to data; here computing structure of logic itself.
  - **Quick check question:** In this context, does "freest model" represent most specific or most general interpretation of axioms?

- **Concept: Subdirect Decomposition / Atoms**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper claims atoms are "building blocks" of problem. Understanding complex model can be decomposed into irreducible "atoms" is key to understanding generalization (by selecting subsets of atoms).
  - **Quick check question:** What property defines "non-redundant" atom versus "redundant" one in the algebra?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Axiomatizer -> Dual Builder -> Sparse Crossing Engine -> Model State -> Inference
- **Critical path:** The Sparse Crossing loop (Algorithm 1 in text). Efficiency depends on how effectively trace calculation (Algorithm 3) allows atom pruning during crossing steps.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Batch size: Small batches lead to more frequent updates but may cause instability in atom discovery. Large batches are more stable but computationally heavier per step.
  - Model reduction parameter (δ): Aggressive reduction keeps model small (fast inference) but risks discarding discriminative atoms, potentially lowering accuracy.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Inconsistency Error: System throws error if provided axioms are logically inconsistent (e.g., contradictory labels for same input).
  - Stagnant Model: If model size stops growing but training error remains high, trace constraints may be too loose (insufficient negative examples).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Simple Logic Gate: Implement binary classification task (e.g., AND/OR) to visualize how atoms form and how duples are satisfied.
  2. Noisy MNIST Run: Replicate paper's MNIST experiment (page 14) using open-source engine to observe distribution of atom sizes (Figure 4c) and verify lack of overfitting.
  3. Black Bar Problem: Replicate toy example (Figure 2) to explicitly visualize "mature" atoms (e.g., φ[c1, c2]) and confirm they match logical rule of task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can AML be implemented using algebraic structures other than semilattices while preserving generalization capabilities?
- **Basis in paper:** Discussion section: "We hypothesize that the underlying learning method relies primarily on the subdirect decomposition rather than on the particularities of the semilattice algebra. We expect that AML can be implemented with other algebras."
- **Why unresolved:** Current mathematical formulation and Sparse Crossing algorithm rely specifically on properties of semilattices (commutative, associative, idempotent operations) to define atoms and duples.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal proof or empirical demonstration of AML using alternative structures (e.g., lattices, groups) achieving comparable test accuracy on same benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does computational complexity of Sparse Crossing scale compared to gradient-based optimization for high-dimensional data?
- **Basis in paper:** Methods/Results: Paper notes for Hamiltonian cycle problems method is "much slower than state of the art algorithms" and validates accuracy but doesn't provide theoretical scaling analysis for computational cost relative to deep learning optimizers.
- **Why unresolved:** While accuracy is comparable to MLPs, algorithm operates by manipulating sets of atoms in way that may grow combinatorially, and efficiency is flagged as limitation in formal problem solving.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical analysis of time complexity relative to number of constants and training samples, or benchmark of training wall-clock time on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) compared to standard gradient descent.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does hybrid AML-logistic regression architecture strictly partition a task into independent algebraic and statistical sub-components?
- **Basis in paper:** Discussion section: "Hybrid methods combining algebraic approach and statistical learning show significant potential... suggesting that data is separable into between algebraic and statistical components."
- **Why unresolved:** Unclear if logistic regression layer merely smoothing output or learning residual "statistical" noise that algebraic layer fundamentally cannot capture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies analyzing error overlap between pure AML model and logistic regression layer to confirm they capture disjoint features of data distribution.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity analysis and scaling behavior on larger datasets remain unclear, with Hamiltonian cycle problems noted as "much slower than state of the art algorithms"
- Core theoretical claims about atom convergence and generalization lack direct validation in provided corpus
- Semantic embedding process, while conceptually clear, may not preserve all necessary information for complex tasks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Mathematical framework (semilattices, atoms, subdirect decomposition) is internally consistent and well-defined. Experimental results on MNIST show competitive performance without validation data.
- **Medium Confidence:** Sparse Crossing algorithm's efficiency claims are supported by described trace mechanism, but computational complexity analysis and scaling behavior on larger datasets remain unclear.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization mechanism (atom maturation) is theoretically described but not empirically validated beyond reporting test accuracy. Claim that atoms asymptotically converge to task rules needs rigorous proof and experimental demonstration.

## Next Checks

1. **Atom Convergence Analysis:** For controlled synthetic dataset with known underlying rule, track evolution of atom structures during training and measure their convergence to true problem atoms.

2. **Embedding Fidelity Test:** Systematically vary semantic embedding (e.g., different ways to encode spatial relationships in images) and measure impact on model performance to quantify embedding's importance.

3. **Negative Example Robustness:** Conduct experiments with varying qualities and quantities of negative examples to determine minimum requirements for trace constraints to effectively prune model and prevent overfitting.
