# FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.09210
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes FairACE framework that achieves significant degree fairness improvements while maintaining competitive accuracy on graph node classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses degree-based unfairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where high-degree nodes typically achieve better prediction performance than low-degree nodes. The authors propose FairACE, a novel framework that combines asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training and a group-balanced fairness loss. The method captures both local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily relationships while employing a degree fairness regulator to balance performance across different degree groups.

Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining competitive classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GNN models. The paper introduces the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG) metric, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of degree fairness by measuring disparities in prediction accuracy distributions across degree groups.

## Method Summary
FairACE introduces a multi-component framework to address degree-based unfairness in GNNs. The core innovation combines asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training and group-balanced fairness objectives. The asymmetric contrastive component captures both one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily relationships, while the adversarial component uses a discriminator to remove degree-related information from node embeddings. The group-balanced fairness loss explicitly minimizes performance disparities between high-degree and low-degree node groups. The framework introduces the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG) metric as a comprehensive measure of degree fairness that captures distributional differences in prediction accuracy across degree groups.

## Key Results
- FairACE achieves significant improvements in degree fairness metrics (ADG) compared to state-of-the-art GNN models while maintaining competitive accuracy
- The proposed ADG metric provides a more comprehensive assessment of degree fairness than existing metrics
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component, with the asymmetric contrastive learning and adversarial training showing the strongest individual contributions
- Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis demonstrates robust performance across different configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairACE addresses degree-based unfairness by leveraging asymmetric contrastive learning to capture both local and extended neighborhood structures, while adversarial training removes degree-related information from embeddings. The group-balanced fairness loss explicitly regularizes the model to minimize performance disparities between high-degree and low-degree node groups. This multi-pronged approach simultaneously addresses the structural bias introduced by degree heterogeneity and ensures balanced performance across different node degree groups.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Deep learning models designed to operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. *Why needed:* Provide the foundation for understanding how structural biases propagate through graph-based learning systems.

**Degree Fairness:** The concept of ensuring equitable prediction performance across nodes with different degrees in a graph. *Why needed:* Identifies the specific fairness problem that FairACE addresses, distinguishing it from attribute-based fairness concerns.

**Contrastive Learning:** A self-supervised learning approach that learns representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs. *Why needed:* Enables FairACE to capture meaningful structural relationships while being sensitive to degree-based disparities.

**Adversarial Training:** A technique where a discriminator attempts to predict sensitive attributes (in this case, node degree) from embeddings, forcing the main model to remove such information. *Why needed:* Provides the mechanism for removing degree-related bias from node representations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Graph → GNN Encoder → Contrastive Loss + Adversarial Discriminator + Group-Balanced Loss → FairACE Output

**Critical Path:** The main computational path involves graph convolution operations in the GNN encoder, followed by the application of asymmetric contrastive loss, adversarial regularization through the discriminator, and group-balanced fairness regularization.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances fairness improvements against potential accuracy degradation, with the group-balanced loss serving as a tuning parameter to control this tradeoff. The asymmetric contrastive design adds computational complexity but captures richer structural information.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor convergence during training may indicate conflicts between the contrastive and adversarial objectives. High ADG values despite training suggest insufficient strength in the fairness regularization components.

**Three First Experiments:** 1) Train with only the GNN encoder and standard cross-entropy loss to establish baseline performance. 2) Add the group-balanced fairness loss to the baseline to isolate its effect. 3) Add the asymmetric contrastive component to evaluate its contribution to fairness improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does FairACE effectively scale to graphs with millions of nodes while maintaining both fairness improvements and computational efficiency?
- **Basis in paper:** Section V.E claims scalability to large graphs "without requiring major architectural modifications" but provides no empirical validation on truly large-scale datasets; all experiments use graphs with at most 17,716 nodes (DBLP).
- **Why unresolved:** The scalability claim relies on theoretical arguments about sampling and mini-batch training but lacks experimental evidence on web-scale graphs where power-law distributions are more extreme.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments on datasets like OGB (e.g., ogbn-products with 2.4M nodes) with runtime and memory profiling, comparing throughput against baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the choice of Wasserstein-1 distance in ADG compare to alternative distributional metrics (e.g., KL divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance) for capturing degree fairness?
- **Basis in paper:** Section III-C introduces ADG using Wasserstein-1 without justification for this specific choice among distributional distance measures.
- **Why unresolved:** Different metrics may be more sensitive to different aspects of distributional disparity (e.g., tail behavior vs. central tendency), affecting which models appear "fair."
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of multiple distributional metrics across synthetic graphs with controlled accuracy distribution shifts, correlating each metric with human/expert fairness judgments.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can degree fairness and sensitive attribute fairness (e.g., gender, race) be simultaneously achieved, or do these objectives fundamentally conflict?
- **Basis in paper:** Section II-A states: "existing fairness methods in GNNs primarily address biases related to sensitive attributes and ignore structural biases introduced by node degrees. This gap highlights the need for approaches that consider fairness from both attribute-based and structural perspectives."
- **Why unresolved:** FairACE addresses only degree fairness; the adversarial discriminator removes degree information but may conflict with removing sensitive attribute information if these are correlated.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments on datasets with both degree variation and sensitive attributes (e.g., credit networks with demographic information), measuring both degree fairness (ADG) and attribute fairness (DSP/DEO on sensitive attributes) simultaneously.

## Limitations

- Experimental validation is constrained to only four real-world datasets, limiting generalizability to other graph structures and domains
- The framework's reliance on contrastive learning and adversarial training introduces potential stability issues during training, though these are not thoroughly explored
- The paper does not address computational efficiency concerns or scalability to large-scale graphs, which could be significant limitations for practical deployment
