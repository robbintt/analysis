# DiM-TS: Bridge the Gap between Selective State Space Models and Time Series for Generative Modeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.18312
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18312
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 60% improvement in context-FID and 35% in correlation scores over state-of-the-art methods for realistic time series synthesis

## Executive Summary
DiM-TS introduces a novel approach to generative modeling of time series data by bridging selective State Space Models (SSMs) with diffusion models. The method addresses the challenge of synthesizing realistic time series data by enhancing SSMs' ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations during the denoising process. Through innovative architectural modifications including Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, DiM-TS significantly improves the quality of generated time series while preserving multiple time series properties. The approach demonstrates strong performance in long-sequence generation and shows promise for practical applications in synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
DiM-TS enhances selective SSMs by introducing two key architectural innovations: Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba. Lag Fusion Mamba operates by fusing correlated lags in the latent state, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively during the denoising process. Permutation Scanning Mamba employs correlation-aware channel permutations to better capture complex interrelations across different time series channels. These variants are integrated into a diffusion framework that incorporates multi-feature loss terms to ensure the generated data preserves essential time series characteristics. The method combines the strengths of SSMs in handling sequential data with the denoising capabilities of diffusion models, resulting in improved synthesis of realistic time series data.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 60% improvement in context-FID compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates 35% improvement in correlation scores for preserving temporal relationships
- Shows strong performance in long-sequence generation while maintaining multiple time series properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DiM-TS works by addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional SSMs in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and channel correlations during generative modeling. The Lag Fusion Mamba component enhances the model's ability to maintain information across extended time horizons by intelligently fusing correlated lags in the latent state, preventing information degradation over long sequences. The Permutation Scanning Mamba component addresses the challenge of capturing complex interactions between different time series channels by employing correlation-aware permutations that allow the model to learn and preserve these relationships during the denoising process. By integrating these enhancements into a diffusion framework with multi-feature loss terms, DiM-TS ensures that the generated time series not only capture temporal dependencies but also maintain other essential properties such as periodicity, stationarity, and statistical distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **State Space Models (SSMs):** Why needed - Provide efficient modeling of sequential data with linear complexity; Quick check - Verify the model can process sequences of length N in O(N) time
- **Diffusion Models:** Why needed - Enable high-quality generation through iterative denoising; Quick check - Confirm stable training by monitoring loss curves during denoising steps
- **Selective SSMs:** Why needed - Reduce computational overhead by selectively updating state; Quick check - Measure the ratio of updated to total parameters per time step
- **Multi-feature Loss Framework:** Why needed - Ensure generated data preserves multiple time series characteristics; Quick check - Evaluate preservation of statistical moments, autocorrelation, and spectral properties
- **Channel Correlation:** Why needed - Capture relationships between different time series dimensions; Quick check - Measure inter-channel correlation preservation in generated data
- **Long-range Dependencies:** Why needed - Maintain information across extended temporal horizons; Quick check - Test generation quality for sequences significantly longer than training examples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Lag Fusion Mamba -> Permutation Scanning Mamba -> Diffusion Denoiser -> Multi-feature Loss -> Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path for data flow involves: (1) initial time series input, (2) processing through Lag Fusion Mamba for long-range dependency capture, (3) channel permutation via Permutation Scanning Mamba, (4) diffusion-based denoising, and (5) multi-feature loss computation for quality assessment.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The architecture trades increased model complexity and computational overhead for improved generation quality and longer-range dependency capture. The addition of Lag Fusion and Permutation Scanning components increases parameter count and inference time but provides significant gains in context-FID and correlation scores. The multi-feature loss framework requires careful tuning to balance different loss components without introducing instability.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degradation in generation quality for sequences longer than training data
- Loss of specific time series properties (e.g., periodicity or stationarity)
- Computational bottleneck during inference due to increased model complexity
- Training instability from improper balance of multi-feature loss components

**3 First Experiments to Run:**
1. Ablation study comparing DiM-TS with standard Mamba and vanilla SSMs on benchmark datasets
2. Long-sequence generation test to evaluate performance on sequences 2-3x longer than training examples
3. Cross-domain validation on diverse time series datasets (finance, healthcare, sensor data) to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements primarily validated on synthetic and benchmark datasets, requiring further testing on real-world industrial data
- Computational overhead introduced by Lag Fusion and Permutation Scanning components not fully characterized
- Potential limitations in handling non-stationary patterns and irregular sampling intervals in real-world time series
- Need for careful tuning of multi-feature loss components to maintain stability across different time series characteristics

## Confidence
- **High:** The integration of SSMs with diffusion models is technically sound and well-established
- **Medium:** The specific architectural improvements (Lag Fusion Mamba, Permutation Scanning Mamba) show promise but need broader validation
- **Low:** Claims about real-world applicability and computational efficiency require further empirical support

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing on real-world industrial time series datasets to validate generalizability beyond synthetic benchmarks
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the computational overhead of the proposed enhancements relative to standard SSMs
3. Test model robustness across varying time series characteristics including irregular sampling, non-stationarity, and missing data patterns
