# Bridging Functional and Representational Similarity via Usable Information
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21568
- Reference count: 32
- Unifies functional and representational similarity through usable information theory

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework that unifies functional and representational similarity measures through the lens of usable information theory. The authors demonstrate that model stitching, a common technique for comparing neural network representations, is fundamentally linked to conditional mutual information. They show that standard metrics like CKA, RSA, and Procrustes are special cases of usable information estimators under specific constraints, and establish a task-granularity hierarchy where representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework connecting model stitching to usable information theory, showing that functional similarity requires bidirectional analysis rather than unidirectional mapping. They prove that standard similarity metrics are estimators of usable information under specific constraints and establish a task-granularity hierarchy. The framework is validated through experiments measuring stitching asymmetry, the monotonicity of representational similarity with respect to predictive family expressiveness, and the relationship between standard metrics and usable information-based measures.

## Key Results
- Model stitching is fundamentally linked to conditional mutual information
- Representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity
- Standard metrics (CKA, RSA, Procrustes) are estimators of usable information under specific constraints
- Strong alignment between standard metrics and usable information-based measures (R² values of 0.912-0.937 for CKA and RSA)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by establishing that functional similarity requires bidirectional analysis rather than unidirectional mapping. The key insight is that representational similarity provides a sufficient condition for functional similarity but is not necessary, creating a task-granularity hierarchy where similarity on complex tasks guarantees similarity on coarser derivatives.

## Foundational Learning
- Usable information theory: The mathematical framework for quantifying information that can be practically extracted from representations
- Conditional mutual information: Measures the information shared between variables given a third variable
- Model stitching: A technique for comparing neural network representations by training predictors to map between them
- Task-granularity hierarchy: The relationship between similarity measures at different levels of task complexity
- Predictive family expressiveness: The capacity of predictor models to extract information from representations

Why needed: These concepts form the mathematical foundation for understanding how representations relate to functional behavior
Quick check: Understanding these concepts requires familiarity with information theory and neural network analysis

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Model stitching -> Usable information theory -> Standard metrics (CKA, RSA, Procrustes)
Critical path: Functional similarity assessment requires bidirectional stitching analysis
Design tradeoffs: Choice of predictive family affects the granularity of similarity measures
Failure signatures: Asymmetric stitching results indicate unidirectional functional relationships
First experiments:
1. Measure stitching asymmetry between two trained models on the same task
2. Compare representational similarity across different predictive family capacities
3. Validate the task-granularity hierarchy claim with synthetic tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation focuses primarily on synthetic tasks and controlled model comparisons
- Assumption that stitching procedures capture functional similarity in general needs broader validation
- Task-granularity hierarchy claim requires testing across diverse real-world tasks

## Confidence
High: Theoretical framework connecting model stitching to usable information
Medium: Task-granularity hierarchy claim, as experimental validation is somewhat limited
Medium: Bidirectional nature of functional similarity, as asymmetry findings are based on specific setups

## Next Checks
1. Test the task-granularity hierarchy claim across diverse real-world tasks (e.g., language, vision)
2. Validate the stitching-asymmetry findings across different architectural families (transformers, CNNs, MLPs)
3. Examine whether the monotonic relationship between representational similarity and predictive family expressiveness holds for non-linear, high-capacity predictor families
