# Towards Skeletal and Signer Noise Reduction in Sign Language Production via Quaternion-Based Pose Encoding and Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.14574
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14574
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Quaternion encoding + contrastive learning improves PCK by 18% and reduces MBAE by 6% on Phoenix14T

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses high intra-class variability in sign language production caused by morphological differences among signers and stylistic variations. The authors propose encoding skeletal poses using bone rotations in quaternion space with geodesic loss, and adding contrastive learning objectives to the decoder's self-attention embeddings. Evaluated on Phoenix14T, the approach achieves significant improvements in keypoint localization accuracy while maintaining articulation quality.

## Method Summary
The method uses a Progressive Transformer backbone to map gloss sequences to skeletal pose sequences. Poses are encoded as bone rotations using quaternions relative to a T-pose skeleton, with geodesic loss measuring angular deviation. A contrastive loss is applied to decoder self-attention embeddings, either using gloss overlap or SBERT-based similarity to filter out non-semantic stylistic noise. The total loss combines the standard SLP loss with the contrastive term weighted by λ.

## Key Results
- Contrastive loss alone improves PCK by 16% over baseline
- Combining quaternion encoding with contrastive learning reduces MBAE by 6%
- The combined approach achieves 18% increase in PCK while maintaining low MBAE

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Quaternion encoding with geodesic loss
- **Claim:** Encoding poses as bone rotations (quaternions) and optimizing via geodesic loss improves joint articulation precision compared to Cartesian coordinate regression.
- **Core assumption:** Skeletal topology (bone lengths) is constant across dataset, and primary error mode is angular deviation rather than absolute positional drift.
- **Evidence:** MBAE reduced by 6% when using quaternion encoding (abstract), with geodesic loss temporally averaging mean rotation angle (section 3.2).

### Mechanism 2: Contrastive learning for semantic structuring
- **Claim:** Applying contrastive loss to decoder self-attention embeddings filters out non-semantic stylistic noise, improving keypoint localization accuracy.
- **Core assumption:** Variability in training data (signer style) is largely orthogonal to semantic content and can be collapsed without losing linguistic expressiveness.
- **Evidence:** 16% improvement in PCK with contrastive loss alone (abstract), with loss aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that don't convey semantic information (section 3.3.1).

### Mechanism 3: Combined rotational constraints and semantic structuring
- **Claim:** Combining rotational constraints with semantic structuring recovers positional accuracy typically lost when using purely rotational representations.
- **Core assumption:** Ambiguity in rotational reconstruction can be resolved by semantic context provided by contrastive objective.
- **Evidence:** 18% increase in PCK when combining quaternion encoding with contrastive training objectives (section 4.2.3).

## Foundational Learning

- **Manifold Geometry (SO(3) vs R^3)**
  - **Why needed here:** Rotation space is curved; cannot average quaternions or use Euclidean distance without distortion.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does standard MSE loss on quaternion components fail to represent smooth rotation interpolation?

- **Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**
  - **Why needed here:** Supervised contrastive loss requires understanding positive/negative pair construction and temperature parameter effects.
  - **Quick check question:** In gloss-based variant, how does model handle batch where no two sequences share common gloss anchor?

- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**
  - **Why needed here:** Sign language sequences vary in speed; requires alignment before comparison.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is frame-by-frame alignment insufficient for comparing generated sign sequence to ground truth video?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Gloss tokens -> Encoder -> Decoder (Self-Attention) -> Motion Head (Quaternions) + Root Predictor -> Geodesic Loss + MSE
  Semantics Head (Projection) -> Contrastive Loss

- **Critical path:**
  1. Glosses embedded and passed to Encoder
  2. Decoder generates sequence conditioned on encoder output and previous frames
  3. Self-Attention embeddings projected and pulled toward semantically similar samples
  4. Final output predicts rotations, reconstructed into skeleton and scored via angular distance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Gloss vs SBERT supervision: Gloss is binary and creates tighter clusters but ignores nuances; SBERT captures semantic similarity but is "softer"
  - 3D Cartesian: easier to optimize but produces jitter; Quaternions: anatomically correct but harder for positional precision

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Positional Drift: Quaternion model predicts correct angles but hand drifts in space (High PCK error, Low Angle error) - Check Root Loss weight
  - Mode Collapse: Contrastive loss too strong, outputs look identical - Reduce λ
  - Slow Convergence: Quaternion initialization poor - Initialize to predict identity rotations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Calibration: Standard Progressive Transformer (3D Cartesian + MSE) to establish baselines
  2. Ablation (Loss): Swap MSE for Geodesic Loss on Quaternions (no contrastive) - Verify MBAE drops, note PCK drop
  3. Integration: Add Contrastive Loss (Gloss-based, λ=10^-4) to Quaternion model - Verify PCK recovers/improves while MBAE remains low

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- T-pose skeleton coordinates required for quaternion conversion not specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Ablation study lacks pure quaternion model without contrastive loss as intermediate comparison
- Model's generalization to unseen signers or signing styles not evaluated

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (quaternion encoding): **Medium** - 6% MBAE reduction well-supported, but claim about MSE treating skeleton as unstructured is overstatement
- Mechanism 2 (contrastive loss): **High** - 16% PCK improvement directly measurable, contrastive learning framework well-established
- Mechanism 3 (combined approach): **Medium** - 18% PCK improvement reported, but interaction between losses complex and could involve compensating factors

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct exact preprocessing pipeline by reverse-engineering quaternion conversion from T-pose assumption and validate against reported MBAE values
2. Implement ablation study testing quaternion encoding alone (without contrastive loss) to isolate positional accuracy effects
3. Evaluate model on signer-disjoint splits to measure robustness to morphological variations not present in training data
