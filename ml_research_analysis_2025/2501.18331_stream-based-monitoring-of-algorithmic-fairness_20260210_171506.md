- Monitors algorithmic fairness properties in real-time on data streams

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a stream-based monitoring approach for verifying algorithmic fairness in decision and prediction systems using the RTLola specification language. The key idea is to extract independent trials from a single execution of a system by defining a dependence relation between events, then estimating conditional probabilities over these trials in real-time. The approach addresses the challenge of verifying fairness statically in complex systems with large input spaces. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks show RTLola significantly outperforms database implementations in runtime efficiency. On real-world COMPAS data, the monitor successfully detects unfairness in recidivism predictions early, demonstrating its practical utility for reducing the impact of biased decisions.

## Method Summary
The approach extracts independent trials from event streams by defining a dependence relation between events. For each trial, the monitor computes conditional probabilities of decisions given sensitive attributes using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation. The RTLola specification defines parameterized streams that track trial progress, update probability estimates incrementally, and trigger alerts when fairness thresholds are violated. The monitor processes events in real-time, maintaining state only for active trials within a configurable time window. The framework supports standard fairness definitions including Demographic Parity, Conditional Statistical Parity, and Equalized Odds through different probability conditions.

## Key Results
- RTLola runtime efficiency significantly outperforms SQL/RisingWave baseline implementations on synthetic benchmarks
- Monitor successfully detects unfairness in COMPAS recidivism predictions early in the 70-day monitoring window
- MAP estimation with κ=100 and γ=0.5 provides stable probability estimates while maintaining responsiveness to fairness violations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stream-based approach works by converting a single system execution into multiple independent trials through careful event partitioning. By defining a dependence relation between events, the monitor creates statistically independent samples from which conditional probabilities can be reliably estimated. The MAP estimation provides robust probability updates that balance new evidence with prior beliefs, enabling early detection of fairness violations while avoiding spurious alerts from small sample sizes.

## Foundational Learning

**Dependence Relations**
*Why needed:* Essential for extracting independent trials from a single execution stream
*Quick check:* Verify that events within each trial are causally related while trials are independent

**MAP Estimation**
*Why needed:* Provides stable probability estimates from finite samples
*Quick check:* Confirm convergence of estimates with increasing sample size

**RTLola Specifications**
*Why needed:* Enables concise expression of complex temporal fairness properties
*Quick check:* Validate that parameterized streams correctly track trial states

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Event Stream -> Dependence Relation -> Independent Trials -> Probability Estimation -> Fairness Check -> Alert

**Critical Path:** Event ingestion → Trial state update → MAP probability calculation → Threshold comparison → Alert trigger

**Design Tradeoffs:** Real-time monitoring vs. statistical accuracy; memory usage vs. detection latency; sensitivity vs. false positive rate

**Failure Signatures:** Memory leaks from unclosed trials; delayed detection from conservative priors; false positives from insufficient sample sizes

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify MAP estimation converges on synthetic data with known ground truth
2. Test memory usage with varying trial completion rates
3. Confirm alert triggers at correct threshold crossings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the stream-based monitoring approach be extended to verify complex fairness specifications involving expected values of continuous outcomes (e.g., credit scores) or system response times?

**Open Question 2:** How can the monitor verify or automatically infer the correct dependence relation δ required to partition stream events into statistically independent trials?

**Open Question 3:** Is the monitoring approach robust in real-world scenarios where sensitive group attributes are unavailable, obscured, or only available as proxies?

## Limitations

- Requires explicit definition of dependence relations between events, which may be difficult to determine correctly
- Current implementation assumes complete observability of sensitive attributes, limiting real-world applicability
- Performance evaluation lacks comparison to more sophisticated streaming database implementations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** RTLola language design and fairness specification patterns are clearly described and theoretically sound
**Medium Confidence:** Runtime efficiency claims relative to SQL/RisingWave are plausible but baseline implementations are not fully specified
**Low Confidence:** Impact of hyperparameter choices on false positive rates and convergence speed is not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Verify MAP estimation implementation converges correctly on synthetic data with known ground truth
2. Implement baseline SQL monitor for Equalized Odds to confirm runtime efficiency claims
3. Test memory management with long-running streams to verify trial closure prevents leaks
