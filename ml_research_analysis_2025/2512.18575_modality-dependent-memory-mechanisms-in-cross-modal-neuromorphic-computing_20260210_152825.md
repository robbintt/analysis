# Modality-Dependent Memory Mechanisms in Cross-Modal Neuromorphic Computing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.18575
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18575
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Cross-modal ablation study reveals modality-dependent memory mechanisms in spiking neural networks, achieving 603× energy efficiency while maintaining >97% sparsity

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive cross-modal ablation study examining memory mechanisms in spiking neural networks (SNNs) for neuromorphic computing. The researchers systematically evaluate three memory architectures—Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs), and supervised contrastive learning (SCL)—across visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) neuromorphic datasets. The study reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns, with Hopfield networks excelling at visual tasks (97.68%) but underperforming on auditory tasks (76.15%), while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance. All architectures achieve remarkable 603× energy efficiency over traditional neural networks while maintaining >97% sparsity, demonstrating the practical viability of neuromorphic approaches for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The study conducts a systematic ablation analysis of memory mechanisms in cross-modal SNNs by evaluating three distinct architectures across visual and auditory neuromorphic datasets. The researchers implemented Hopfield networks, HGRNs, and SCL, training them both independently on each modality and jointly in multi-modal configurations. They measured performance using standard accuracy metrics while also conducting quantitative engram analysis to assess cross-modal alignment. Energy efficiency was evaluated through direct measurements on neuromorphic hardware, comparing against traditional neural network baselines. The ablation study systematically varied architectural components to isolate the contribution of each memory mechanism to cross-modal performance, revealing modality-dependent patterns in how different architectures handle visual versus auditory input.

## Key Results
- Hopfield networks show 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), demonstrating strong modality dependence
- Supervised contrastive learning achieves more balanced cross-modal performance: 96.72% visual, 82.16% audio (14.56 point gap)
- Joint multi-modal training with HGRN achieves 94.41% visual and 79.37% audio accuracy (88.78% average), matching parallel HGRN performance through unified deployment
- All architectures achieve 603× energy efficiency over traditional neural networks while maintaining >97% sparsity
- Quantitative engram analysis confirms weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity), validating parallel architecture design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The modality-dependent performance patterns emerge from fundamental differences in how memory mechanisms process spatio-temporal patterns characteristic of different sensory modalities. Visual inputs from neuromorphic sensors like N-MNIST contain dense spatial patterns with relatively simple temporal dynamics, making them well-suited to energy-based models like Hopfield networks that excel at pattern completion and attractor states. In contrast, auditory inputs from SHD datasets present more complex temporal sequences with sparser spatial patterns, requiring architectures like SCL that can learn discriminative representations across time. The weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity) indicates that visual and auditory engrams occupy largely separate representational spaces, explaining why joint training can match parallel performance through unified deployment while avoiding interference between modalities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Biological-inspired neural networks that communicate via discrete spikes rather than continuous values; needed for efficient neuromorphic computing and energy-efficient inference
- **Hopfield Networks**: Recurrent neural networks that store patterns as energy minima; quick check: verify pattern completion works by initializing near stored patterns
- **Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs)**: Stacked recurrent architectures with gating mechanisms; needed for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data
- **Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL)**: Representation learning method that pulls similar samples together while pushing dissimilar ones apart; quick check: ensure embedding space shows clear class separation
- **Engram Analysis**: Quantitative measurement of memory representations; needed to understand cross-modal alignment and representational overlap
- **Neuromorphic Datasets (N-MNIST, SHD)**: Event-based sensor data mimicking biological perception; quick check: verify spike timing and spatial distribution match expected patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Sensors → Spike Encoding → Memory Architecture (Hopfield/HGRN/SCL) → Classification Layer → Output

**Critical Path**: Spike encoding directly impacts memory architecture performance, with modality-dependent patterns requiring different architectural choices for optimal results

**Design Tradeoffs**: Energy efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs favor SNNs (603× efficiency gain) but require careful architectural selection based on input modality characteristics

**Failure Signatures**: Modality mismatch leads to significant accuracy drops (21.53 point gap for Hopfield on audio), indicating the need for modality-aware architectural selection

**First Experiments**:
1. Run ablation study varying spike encoding parameters to identify optimal settings for each modality
2. Test cross-modal transfer learning by fine-tuning models trained on one modality for the other
3. Measure energy consumption breakdown across different architectural components to identify optimization opportunities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to two neuromorphic datasets (visual and auditory), potentially constraining generalizability to other sensory modalities
- Cross-modal alignment analysis focuses on quantitative similarity metrics without deeper investigation of underlying representational differences
- The study does not address temporal dynamics in multi-modal sequences or real-world noisy environments

## Confidence

**High**: Modality-dependent performance patterns, energy efficiency measurements, cross-modal alignment analysis
**Medium**: Generalizability beyond specific datasets, applicability to more complex multi-sensory integration tasks

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed architectures on additional neuromorphic datasets representing other sensory modalities (e.g., tactile, olfactory) to verify the modality-dependent performance patterns hold across diverse input types

2. Conduct ablation studies with varying levels of cross-modal noise and temporal complexity to assess robustness of the parallel architecture design in realistic deployment scenarios

3. Perform deeper analysis of representational spaces using techniques like representational similarity analysis (RSA) or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to better understand the nature of weak cross-modal alignment observed
