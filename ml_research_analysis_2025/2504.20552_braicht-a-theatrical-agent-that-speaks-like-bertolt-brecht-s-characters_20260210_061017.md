## Executive Summary
BrAIcht is an AI conversational agent that generates dialogues in the style of German playwright Bertolt Brecht. The system fine-tunes a 7-billion parameter German LeoLM model using a combined dataset of 29 Brecht plays and 907 other German plays with similar stylistic elements. Due to GPU memory constraints, the team employed QLoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that quantizes the model to 4-bit while maintaining performance. The model achieved a perplexity of 3.57 on the Brecht validation set and a BLEU score of 0.67, demonstrating its ability to generate Brecht-style dialogues effectively.

## Method Summary
The researchers employed a two-stage fine-tuning approach on LeoLM-7B using QLoRA. First, they trained the model on 907 German plays (542,474 cues) to establish theatrical dialogue competence. Then, they specialized the model on 29 Brecht plays (17,740 cues) for author-specific style. The German plays were selected based on stylistic similarities to Brecht's works to prevent overfitting on the small Brecht dataset. Training was performed on a single A6000 GPU with 48GB VRAM using 4-bit quantization and low-rank adapter weights. The final model generates dialogue using top-k sampling (k=50) with temperature 0.7.

## Key Results
- Achieved perplexity of 3.57 on the Brecht validation set
- Obtained BLEU score of 0.67 for style preservation
- Successfully generated dialogue in Brecht's distinctive theatrical style

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Language-specific pre-training improves stylistic fine-tuning for non-English theatrical dialogue. LeoLM applies a second pre-training stage on Llama2 weights using a 65B-token German corpus, establishing stronger German grammatical and lexical representations before task-specific fine-tuning. The base model's language competence directly bounds the quality of downstream stylistic imitation.

### Mechanism 2
Two-stage fine-tuning (domain-then-author) mitigates small author-specific corpus limitations. First stage trains on 907 German plays to establish theatrical dialogue competence; second stage specializes on 29 Brecht plays for author-specific style. The broader corpus prevents overfitting to the small Brecht dataset, while stylistic features transfer across German playwrights.

### Mechanism 3
QLoRA enables effective fine-tuning under memory constraints while preserving output quality. 4-bit quantization reduces model memory footprint; low-rank adapter weights capture task-specific modifications without updating full parameter matrix. Quantization-induced precision loss does not critically degrade stylistic learning capacity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: Core technique enabling 7B model training on 48GB GPU; understanding rank selection and quantization impact is essential for replication
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why backpropagating gradients through frozen 4-bit weights to trainable low-rank adapters preserves more model capacity than simple quantization?

- **Concept: Perplexity as Language Model Quality Metric**
  - Why needed here: Primary evaluation metric (3.57 achieved); indicates how well model predicts Brecht-style sequences
  - Quick check question: What does a perplexity of 3.57 mean in terms of average branching factor at each token prediction?

- **Concept: BLEU Score Limitations for Creative Generation**
  - Why needed here: Paper acknowledges BLEU limitations (n-gram focus vs. stylistic coherence); critical for interpreting 0.67 score appropriately
  - Quick check question: Why might a high BLEU score actually indicate poor performance for a creative dialogue task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User prompt → Tokenizer (LeoLM with `<s>`, `</s>`, `<pad>`) → LeoLM-7B (4-bit quantized) → LoRA adapter weights → Top-k sampling (k=50, temperature=0.7) → Output token sequence

- **Critical path:** Data preprocessing (cue extraction → dialogue format → tokenization) → Stage 1 fine-tuning on German plays (80/20 split, ~542K samples) → Stage 2 fine-tuning on Brecht plays (90/10 split, ~17K samples) → Validation: perplexity monitoring, BLEU calculation on held-out set

- **Design tradeoffs:** Model size vs. GPU memory (7B chosen over 13B due to 48GB constraint); dataset breadth vs. specificity (907 non-Brecht plays add diversity but may dilute Brecht-specific patterns); BLEU vs. human evaluation (paper uses BLEU for tractability but acknowledges limitations for creative assessment)

- **Failure signatures:** High perplexity (>15) after Stage 1 (check tokenizer compatibility, data format errors); BLEU degradation at larger sample sizes (may indicate overfitting or poor generalization); repetitive/non-theatrical outputs (possible quantization artifacts or insufficient LoRA rank); German grammatical errors (verify LeoLM weights loaded correctly)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Load LeoLM-7B without fine-tuning, generate Brecht-style responses; measure perplexity on Brecht validation set to quantify improvement magnitude
  2. Ablation on two-stage training: Train directly on Brecht corpus only (skip German plays stage); compare perplexity and BLEU to assess whether domain pre-training provides measurable benefit
  3. LoRA rank sensitivity: Test adapter rank values (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) while holding other hyperparameters constant; monitor both perplexity and qualitative output diversity to identify inflection point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques improve the accuracy of BrAIcht in generating Brecht-style dialogues? The paper explicitly states that future work could enhance model accuracy through the use of "retrieval-augmented generation techniques."

- Does scaling to a larger parameter model (e.g., 13B or 70B) significantly improve the generation of Brecht's style compared to the 7B model? The authors note that GPU resource limitations restricted them to the smallest LeoLM model and that future work could explore "fine-tuning larger models."

- Does BrAIcht capture the creative and stylistic coherence of Brecht's work beyond n-gram overlap? The authors acknowledge that BLEU scores focus on n-gram overlap and have "limitations in evaluating dialogue models" regarding creative coherence, yet they rely on this metric for final results.

## Limitations
- The two-stage training approach assumes stylistic patterns transfer across German playwrights without empirical verification
- Evaluation relies on BLEU score, which the authors acknowledge has limitations for creative generation tasks
- Model size constrained to 7B parameters due to GPU memory limitations, potentially limiting nuanced stylistic capture

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Language-specific pre-training (LeoLM) significantly improves performance on German theatrical dialogue compared to base English models
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of the two-stage fine-tuning approach, though lacking direct comparison with single-stage training
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization of BrAIcht's performance to broader theatrical dialogue generation beyond Brecht's specific style

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study comparing one-stage training (direct Brecht fine-tuning) versus the two-stage approach to quantify the contribution of theatrical domain pre-training
2. Implement systematic human assessment of generated dialogues focusing on stylistic authenticity, grammatical coherence, and conversational quality
3. Analyze the stylistic distribution of the 907 German plays used for pre-training to verify they represent theatrical dialogue patterns relevant to Brecht's work
