# Copyright Infringement Risk Reduction via Chain-of-Thought and Task Instruction Prompting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.15442
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15442
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Key outcome**: Task instruction prompting combined with negative prompting and prompt re-writing can reduce copyright infringement rates by 98% (Stable Diffusion 2) to 96-98% (SD3, PixArt) while maintaining relevance scores

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how chain-of-thought (CoT) and task instruction (TI) prompting can reduce copyright infringement risk in text-to-image models. The authors focus on the generation of copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario) and propose combining CoT/TI with existing strategies such as negative prompting and prompt re-writing. They formulate prompts generically as a generation description concatenated with character descriptions, allowing systematic comparison across methods. Evaluation is based on human-judged copyright infringement rates and relevance scores computed using CLIP embeddings.

Experiments on three models of varying complexity (Stable Diffusion 2/3 and PixArt) show that CoT/TI prompting can significantly reduce infringement. For Stable Diffusion 2, using TI with negative prompting and prompt re-writing achieved a 98% reduction in infringement rate. For larger models (SD3 and PixArt), similar combinations reduced infringement from 70–80% to 2–4%. TI prompts, especially those emphasizing novel shapes, colors, and clothing, often outperformed CoT in reducing infringement while maintaining relevance. The findings suggest that prompt engineering, particularly when combined with negative prompting and re-writing, can substantially mitigate copyright risks in diffusion models.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically evaluate prompt engineering techniques for reducing copyright infringement in text-to-image models. They create generic prompt formulations by concatenating generation descriptions with character descriptions, enabling controlled comparisons across different prompting strategies. The study combines chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting with established methods like negative prompting (excluding specific character traits) and prompt re-writing (modifying prompts to avoid copyrighted elements). Evaluation uses human judgments of infringement and CLIP-based relevance scoring across three diffusion models of varying scales: Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3, and PixArt.

## Key Results
- Task instruction prompting with negative prompting and prompt re-writing achieved 98% reduction in infringement rate for Stable Diffusion 2
- For larger models (SD3, PixArt), infringement rates dropped from 70-80% to 2-4% using similar combinations
- Task instruction prompting generally outperformed chain-of-thought prompting in reducing infringement while maintaining relevance
- Prompts emphasizing novel shapes, colors, and clothing were particularly effective at reducing infringement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that copyright infringement in diffusion models can be significantly reduced through careful prompt engineering that guides the model toward generating novel content while maintaining task relevance. By combining cognitive prompting strategies (CoT/TI) with negative prompting and prompt re-writing, the approach effectively constrains the model's output space away from copyrighted material. The effectiveness appears to stem from both explicit instructions to avoid specific characteristics and implicit guidance through the task framing, with task instruction prompting showing particular promise for steering generation toward non-infringing content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Why needed - Core generation technology being evaluated; Quick check - Understanding how diffusion models generate images from text prompts
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Why needed - One of the primary techniques being evaluated; Quick check - How CoT guides models through reasoning steps before generation
- **Task Instruction Prompting**: Why needed - Alternative prompting strategy being compared to CoT; Quick check - How TI provides direct task guidance without intermediate reasoning
- **Negative Prompting**: Why needed - Critical complementary technique; Quick check - How excluding specific terms affects model output
- **Prompt Re-writing**: Why needed - Additional mitigation strategy; Quick check - How modifying prompts can avoid copyrighted elements
- **CLIP Embeddings**: Why needed - Relevance evaluation metric; Quick check - How semantic similarity between prompt and output is measured

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Prompt -> CoT/TI Module -> Negative Prompting Filter -> Prompt Re-writing Module -> Diffusion Model (SD2/SD3/PixArt) -> CLIP Relevance Scoring -> Human Infringement Judgment

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline flows from prompt construction through multiple mitigation layers (CoT/TI, negative prompting, re-writing) into the diffusion model, then assesses outputs using both automated (CLIP) and human evaluation metrics.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances infringement reduction against relevance maintenance, finding that TI prompts often achieve better infringement reduction while maintaining relevance compared to CoT prompts. The choice of mitigation strategy involves tradeoffs between effectiveness and the degree of prompt modification required.

**Failure Signatures**: When prompt engineering fails to reduce infringement, the failure typically manifests as either high infringement rates (model generates recognizable copyrighted content) or low relevance scores (model output diverges from the intended generation task).

**First Experiments**:
1. Replicate the baseline infringement rates for Mario character generation across all three models
2. Test TI prompting alone versus CoT prompting alone for infringement reduction
3. Evaluate the combined approach of TI + negative prompting + prompt re-writing on a new copyrighted character not in the original study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on human judgments and CLIP-based relevance, which may not capture nuanced legal considerations around fair use or transformative works
- Study focuses specifically on copyrighted characters rather than broader copyrightable content like original artworks or photographs
- Does not investigate whether these approaches transfer to other domains such as music or video generation
- Does not test whether adversaries could circumvent these protections through prompt engineering

## Confidence

**High** confidence in the general finding that prompt engineering reduces infringement rates
**Medium** confidence in the specific superiority of task instruction prompting over chain-of-thought
**Medium** confidence in the transferability of results across model scales
**Low** confidence in the effectiveness of these approaches for non-character copyrightable content

## Next Checks
1. **Legal validation study**: Have copyright law experts evaluate the same generated images to assess alignment between technical infringement metrics and legal standards for copyright violation.

2. **Adversarial prompting evaluation**: Systematically test whether prompt engineering can be used to circumvent the copyright reduction techniques, measuring potential attack surfaces.

3. **Domain generalization test**: Replicate the study using copyrighted artwork, photographs, and text content (beyond characters) to assess whether prompt engineering effectiveness generalizes beyond the character domain.
