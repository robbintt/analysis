# Measuring Iterative Temporal Reasoning with Time Puzzles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07148
- Reference count: 39
- Across 13 diverse LLMs, GPT-5 achieves 49.3% accuracy on Time Puzzles, while all other models stay below 31% without tools, revealing a significant reasoning gap in current models' ability to reliably use tools for iterative temporal reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Time Puzzles, a novel benchmark for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning with tools. Time Puzzles generate constraint-based date inference tasks that combine factual temporal anchors with calendar relations, requiring iterative reasoning and tool use to solve. The benchmark uses a controllable generation algorithm to create dynamic puzzles with one to six valid solutions. Across 13 diverse LLMs, Time Puzzles effectively distinguishes iterative temporal reasoning capabilities, revealing a significant reasoning gap in current models' ability to reliably use tools for iterative temporal reasoning.

## Method Summary
Time Puzzles generate constraint-based date inference tasks where models must find all valid dates satisfying N natural-language temporal constraints (factual anchors + calendar relations). The benchmark uses a controllable generation algorithm to create dynamic puzzles with one to six valid solutions. 600 puzzles per dataset (implicit/explicit) are generated using 50 curated historical facts and 20 well-known facts, spanning 15 fact types across YEAR/MONTH/DAY levels. Models are evaluated using exact match accuracy, F1, and Jaccard Index with zero-shot CoT prompting. The evaluation includes 13 LLMs tested via API or vLLM with default configurations.

## Key Results
- GPT-5 achieves 49.3% accuracy on Time Puzzles, significantly outperforming other models which stay below 31% without tools
- Web search consistently improves performance across models, but gaps remain between implicit and explicit constraints
- Code Interpreter (+CI) shows mixed effects: improving accuracy for GPT-4.1 but degrading it for GPT-5

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Time Puzzles work by combining factual temporal anchors with calendar relations in a way that requires iterative reasoning. The benchmark's generation algorithm creates puzzles that are simple in structure but complex in reasoning requirements. By requiring models to find all valid dates satisfying multiple constraints, Time Puzzles expose the gap between implicit knowledge and explicit reasoning capabilities. The inclusion of tool use (web search, code interpreter) tests whether models can effectively leverage external resources for temporal reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constraint-based reasoning**: Why needed - To evaluate models' ability to handle multiple temporal constraints simultaneously. Quick check - Verify solver correctly identifies valid date ranges from constraint sets.
- **Iterative tool use**: Why needed - To assess whether models can effectively use external tools to augment their reasoning. Quick check - Compare performance with and without tool use across model types.
- **Entropy-based puzzle generation**: Why needed - To create diverse puzzles with controlled solution spaces. Quick check - Validate generated puzzles have the intended number of solutions (1-6).
- **Zero-shot CoT prompting**: Why needed - To evaluate models' reasoning capabilities without training. Quick check - Verify prompt format matches Appendix E exactly.
- **Web search integration**: Why needed - To test models' ability to use external knowledge for implicit constraints. Quick check - Confirm cited URLs are properly scraped and prepended to prompts.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Puzzle Generation -> Entropy-based Solver -> LLMs (with/without tools) -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: The generation algorithm creates puzzles with specific constraint sets, which are then evaluated by LLMs using the provided prompt template. Tool use (web search, code interpreter) is integrated into this pipeline, affecting the models' ability to solve implicit vs explicit constraints.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes simplicity and controllability over ecological validity. While the template-based composition ensures reproducibility, it may miss ambiguity and conflicting evidence that arise in practice. The use of curated historical facts provides a controlled evaluation environment but limits generalizability to real-world scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Solver returns empty or oversized solution sets
- Tool-use inconsistency - web search context not properly prepended for open-weight models
- Code Interpreter degradation for reasoning models like GPT-5

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Generate a small subset of puzzles and manually verify the solution sets
2. Test a single LLM (e.g., GPT-4) on implicit vs explicit constraints to observe the performance gap
3. Enable web search for one model and compare performance with and without tool use

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can LLMs be trained or prompted to reliably identify non-trivial contradictions in "solution-less" temporal puzzles that require substantive iterative reasoning?
- Why does the utility of Code Interpreter (+CI) differ fundamentally between reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) and standard instruction models (e.g., GPT-4.1)?
- To what extent do synthetic, template-based temporal constraints correlate with performance on ambiguous, real-world temporal reasoning tasks?

## Limitations
- The puzzle generation relies on a curated list of 50 historical facts and 20 well-known facts, but the exact content of these fact sets is not provided
- The benchmark prioritizes simplicity and controllability over ecological validity, potentially missing ambiguity and conflicting evidence that arise in practice
- The use of curated historical facts provides a controlled evaluation environment but limits generalizability to real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: The overall framework and methodology for Time Puzzles are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The evaluation setup, including the use of 13 diverse LLMs and the specific prompt templates, is detailed but some implementation specifics may vary
- Low confidence: The exact content of the curated fact sets and the specific constraint templates used for puzzle generation are not provided, which limits full reproducibility

## Next Checks
1. Obtain or reconstruct the exact list of 50 historical facts and 20 well-known facts used in the puzzle generation to ensure the dataset matches the original
2. Implement and test the specific constraint templates for each fact category to verify they align with the paper's generation algorithm
3. Validate the entropy-based solver's performance by running it on a subset of puzzles and comparing the results with the paper's reported accuracy metrics
