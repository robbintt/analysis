# Hardware-Accelerated Event-Graph Neural Networks for Low-Latency Time-Series Classification on SoC FPGA

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.06629
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06629
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 92.3% accuracy on Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmark using graph neural network on SoC FPGA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first hardware-software co-design of an event-graph neural network (E-GNN) for time-series audio classification on a System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA. The approach leverages sparse event-data generated by an artificial cochlea to drastically reduce computational complexity compared to conventional AI methods. A novel skip step graph generation method with simplified features enables efficient hardware implementation while maintaining high accuracy. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance for FPGA-based solutions in this domain.

## Method Summary
The proposed E-GNN architecture processes event-data from an artificial cochlea through a hardware-software co-design approach. The system uses a novel skip step graph generation method that simplifies feature extraction while maintaining classification accuracy. The design exploits temporal sparsity of event-data through asynchronous event-by-event processing, enabling rapid calculations suitable for near-sensor AI processing at the edge. The implementation targets SoC FPGA platforms, combining custom hardware acceleration with software components for optimal performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 92.3% accuracy on Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmark for the quantised model
- Outperforms previous FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 4.5% accuracy
- Uses fewer computational resources and reduces latency compared to prior FPGA solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach exploits the inherent sparsity of event-based data from artificial cochlea sensors. By converting time-series audio data into sparse event representations, the computational load is drastically reduced compared to processing dense continuous data. The graph neural network structure naturally accommodates the irregular, non-Euclidean nature of event-data while the skip step graph generation method simplifies feature extraction without sacrificing accuracy. The asynchronous event-by-event processing capability leverages temporal sparsity for rapid calculations, making the system highly efficient for edge deployment.

## Foundational Learning

**Event-based sensors**: Sensors that output sparse, asynchronous events rather than continuous data streams. *Why needed*: Enable significant computational savings by processing only meaningful changes rather than redundant information. *Quick check*: Verify that event rate is orders of magnitude lower than traditional sampling rates.

**Graph Neural Networks**: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data. *Why needed*: Natural fit for event-data which forms irregular, non-grid structures. *Quick check*: Confirm the network can handle variable-sized graphs and maintain permutation invariance.

**Hardware-software co-design**: Integrated approach where hardware and software components are optimized together. *Why needed*: Critical for maximizing performance and efficiency on resource-constrained FPGA platforms. *Quick check*: Verify that bottlenecks are addressed at both hardware and software levels.

**Skip step graph generation**: Method that reduces computational complexity in graph construction. *Why needed*: Essential for real-time processing on FPGA hardware with limited resources. *Quick check*: Ensure accuracy is maintained despite reduced graph complexity.

**Asynchronous processing**: Event-driven computation rather than clock-driven. *Why needed*: Exploits temporal sparsity to minimize unnecessary computations. *Quick check*: Validate that processing latency scales with event rate rather than fixed clock cycles.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Artificial cochlea -> Event generator -> Skip step graph generator -> Graph neural network -> Classification output

**Critical path**: Event generation to classification output, with the graph neural network processing being the primary computational bottleneck that is mitigated through hardware acceleration and skip step optimization.

**Design tradeoffs**: The skip step graph generation simplifies features to reduce hardware complexity, potentially sacrificing some accuracy for significant gains in efficiency and reduced latency. The asynchronous processing trades predictable timing for computational efficiency.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation under high event rates that overwhelm the hardware processing pipeline, accuracy loss when skip step simplification removes critical features, and potential synchronization issues between hardware and software components.

**First experiments**:
1. Benchmark classification accuracy on Spiking Heidelberg Digits with varying skip step parameters to find optimal balance between accuracy and hardware efficiency
2. Measure processing latency and resource utilization under different event rates to characterize system performance boundaries
3. Compare energy consumption per classification against CPU/GPU implementations for identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability to more complex audio classification tasks and different event-data domains remains uncertain
- Current evaluation is limited to a single benchmark dataset, making generalization difficult to assess

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark the system on additional time-series datasets beyond audio to evaluate cross-domain performance and generalization capabilities
2. Conduct comprehensive energy efficiency measurements comparing the FPGA implementation against state-of-the-art CPU/GPU solutions under identical classification tasks
3. Test the asynchronous processing architecture with real-world sensor data including varying noise levels and non-ideal event generation conditions to validate robustness claims
