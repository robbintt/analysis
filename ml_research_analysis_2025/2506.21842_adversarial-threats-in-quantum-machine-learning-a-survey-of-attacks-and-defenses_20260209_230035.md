# Adversarial Threats in Quantum Machine Learning: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21842
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21842
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Survey identifies vulnerabilities across QML pipeline including data encoding, circuit structure, and training; highlights attacks like model stealing, data poisoning, reverse engineering, and backdoors; proposes defenses leveraging quantum noise signatures, circuit obfuscation, and secure partitioning.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of adversarial threats targeting Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems. It systematically categorizes attacks and defenses across the QML pipeline, identifying vulnerabilities in data encoding, circuit structure, and training processes. The survey emphasizes the unique challenges posed by NISQ hardware noise and QML-as-a-Service environments, proposing quantum-specific countermeasures that leverage hardware-induced signatures and secure partitioning strategies.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing literature on adversarial attacks and defenses in QML systems, organizing threats across black-box, gray-box, and white-box access models. It surveys multiple concrete methods including E-LoQ logic locking, hardware-aware qGAN watermarking, QuMoS partitioning, HVIP/HA VIP perturbation defenses, and QUID data poisoning. The survey references detailed procedures from separate papers for each method, providing a structured overview of the current state of QML security research.

## Key Results
- Identifies model stealing via query-based extraction as a critical vulnerability in QMLaaS environments
- Proposes quantum-specific defenses leveraging hardware noise signatures and circuit obfuscation
- Highlights backdoor attacks exploiting NISQ hardware noise and service provider infrastructure
- Emphasizes need for integrated, adaptive security frameworks for scalable QML deployments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically organizing known attack vectors and defenses in QML, providing a taxonomy that helps practitioners understand and mitigate security risks. It leverages the unique properties of quantum systems, such as hardware-induced noise signatures and quantum entanglement, to propose novel defense mechanisms that are specifically tailored to the quantum computing paradigm.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantum circuit vulnerabilities**: Understanding where adversarial inputs can manipulate quantum states; needed for identifying attack surfaces in QML pipelines.
- **NISQ hardware noise characteristics**: Knowledge of how noise patterns affect quantum computations; essential for developing noise-based watermarking and authentication schemes.
- **Quantum data encoding schemes**: Familiarity with angle encoding, amplitude encoding, and other methods; critical for assessing data poisoning attack vectors.
- **Variational quantum circuit (VQC) structures**: Understanding ansatz design and parameter sensitivity; required for evaluating reverse engineering and model stealing attacks.
- **Quantum-classical hybrid optimization**: Knowledge of SPSA and other optimizers; needed to assess training vulnerabilities and defense effectiveness.
- **QML-as-a-Service security models**: Understanding cloud quantum computing architectures; essential for evaluating practical attack scenarios and defenses.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Encoding -> VQC Ansatz -> Training Loop -> Prediction -> Hardware Backend

**Critical Path**: Input data → Encoding → Variational circuit → Parameter optimization → Output classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Defense effectiveness vs. computational overhead
- Model accuracy vs. security robustness
- Hardware resource utilization vs. attack resilience
- Implementation complexity vs. practical deployability

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High variance in outputs due to NISQ noise
- Clone model convergence failures
- Excessive TVD (>15%) indicating over-perturbation
- Label distribution inconsistencies in adversarial datasets

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement basic QNN classifier on MNIST with angle encoding
2. Execute query-based model extraction attack building surrogate dataset
3. Apply HVIP defense routing queries across multiple backends

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Potential omission of recent attack/defenses due to rapidly evolving field
- Lack of quantitative benchmarking across surveyed methods
- Limited real-world validation data for practical defense effectiveness

## Confidence
- Confidence in taxonomy and threat categorization: High
- Confidence in practical defense effectiveness ratings: Medium
- Confidence in future threat predictions: Low

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce one attack-defense pair from the survey on a public QML framework to verify practical viability
2. Survey recent preprints (last 12 months) to assess coverage gaps in emerging threats
3. Conduct small-scale user study with quantum computing practitioners to validate relevance and clarity of threat classifications and defense recommendations
