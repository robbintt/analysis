# Defending Against Knowledge Poisoning Attacks During Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02835
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02835
- Reference count: 37
- Two defense methods (FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG) significantly reduce attack success rates from 94% to ~9% while maintaining RAG accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses knowledge poisoning attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by proposing two novel defense methods. FilterRAG introduces a new statistical property called Freq-Density that identifies adversarial texts based on word concentration patterns, while ML-FilterRAG enhances this approach using machine learning to combine multiple features for more robust classification. Both methods were evaluated across three benchmark datasets (HotpotQA, MS-MARCO, and NQ) and demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing attack success rates while maintaining system accuracy close to clean RAG performance.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two complementary defense mechanisms against knowledge poisoning attacks in RAG systems. FilterRAG uses a statistical approach based on Freq-Density, which measures the concentration of specific words in documents to distinguish between clean and adversarial texts. ML-FilterRAG builds upon this foundation by incorporating multiple features including word frequency, semantic embeddings, and syntactic patterns, then applying a machine learning classifier to filter out adversarial content before it reaches the retrieval stage. Both methods were tested across multiple attack scenarios including black-box and white-box settings, showing robust performance in reducing poisoning effectiveness while preserving RAG system accuracy.

## Key Results
- Attack success rates reduced from 94% to approximately 9% across benchmark datasets
- Adversarial text ratios decreased from 100% to approximately 1.5% after applying defense methods
- RAG system accuracy maintained close to clean system performance (within 1-2% degradation)
- Both methods demonstrated effectiveness in black-box and white-box attack scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The defense mechanisms work by disrupting the fundamental strategy used in knowledge poisoning attacks. FilterRAG's Freq-Density metric exploits the fact that adversarial documents typically exhibit unnatural word concentration patterns as attackers attempt to manipulate retrieval relevance. By identifying and filtering documents with these suspicious statistical properties before they enter the retrieval pipeline, the system prevents poisoned content from influencing the generation process. ML-FilterRAG enhances this by using multiple complementary features that capture different aspects of adversarial behavior, making it more difficult for attackers to evade detection through simple statistical manipulation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Freq-Density Metric**: A statistical measure of word concentration patterns in documents; needed to identify unnatural distributions typical of adversarial content; quick check: compare word frequency distributions between clean and poisoned datasets
- **RAG System Architecture**: Understanding how retrieval and generation components interact in RAG systems; needed to identify where defense mechanisms should be applied; quick check: trace data flow from retrieval through generation
- **Black-box vs White-box Attacks**: Different threat models where attackers have varying levels of system knowledge; needed to evaluate defense robustness under realistic attack scenarios; quick check: verify defense performance under both knowledge constraints
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Using multiple features to classify documents as clean or adversarial; needed to build robust detection models; quick check: validate feature importance and model performance metrics
- **Knowledge Poisoning Attack Vectors**: Understanding how attackers manipulate retrieval relevance through document poisoning; needed to design effective countermeasures; quick check: analyze attack success patterns in poisoned datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Corpus -> Retrieval Module -> Freq-Density/ML-FilterRAG Defense -> Generator -> Final Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves filtering documents before they enter the retrieval module, ensuring only clean content is available for generating responses. This pre-filtering approach prevents poisoned documents from ever influencing the RAG system's output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff involves balancing defense effectiveness against computational overhead. ML-FilterRAG provides stronger protection but requires additional processing time for feature extraction and classification. FilterRAG offers faster performance but may be more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that can mimic clean document statistics.

**Failure Signatures**: Defense failures manifest as either false positives (legitimate documents being filtered) or false negatives (adversarial documents passing through). The Freq-Density approach may struggle with domain-specific terminology that naturally exhibits high word concentration, while ML-FilterRAG could be vulnerable to adversarial examples designed to fool the classification model.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test defense performance on datasets with varying document lengths and vocabulary sizes to assess robustness across different text characteristics
2. Evaluate false positive rates by applying defenses to clean datasets to ensure legitimate content isn't being unnecessarily filtered
3. Measure computational overhead by timing the defense mechanisms on large document collections to assess real-world deployment feasibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Potential for attackers to adapt strategies once Freq-Density becomes a known defense mechanism
- Results may not generalize beyond the three tested benchmark datasets to other domains or applications
- Computational overhead of ML-FilterRAG could impact performance in large-scale production environments

## Confidence
- High confidence in empirical effectiveness against tested attack scenarios
- Medium confidence in Freq-Density robustness given theoretical foundation but potential for adversarial adaptation
- Medium confidence in accuracy maintenance across tested datasets but uncertain generalization

## Next Checks
1. Test defense methods against adaptive attackers who modify poisoning strategies to evade Freq-Density detection
2. Evaluate performance across broader range of RAG applications and domain-specific datasets beyond current benchmarks
3. Measure computational overhead and latency of ML-FilterRAG in production environments with large-scale document collections
