# Geometry-Aware Deep Congruence Networks for Manifold Learning in Cross-Subject Motor Imagery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18940
- Reference count: 40
- The authors propose a geometry-aware framework that leverages congruence transformations on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold to learn subject-invariant alignment and discriminative representations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of cross-subject variability in motor imagery EEG classification by proposing a geometry-aware deep congruence network framework. The authors tackle the fundamental problem where covariance matrices from different subjects lie on different regions of the SPD manifold, making direct classification difficult. Their approach uses congruence transformations to align these covariance matrices while preserving their intrinsic geometry, enabling more effective transfer learning across subjects.

The framework introduces three models: Discriminative Congruence Transform (DCT), Deep Linear DCT (DLDCT), and Deep DCT-UNet (DDCT-UNet), which can either serve as pre-alignment modules for downstream classifiers or as end-to-end discriminative systems. Extensive experiments on motor imagery benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 2-3% in transductive cross-subject accuracy over baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of geometry-aware congruence learning in reducing subject-specific variability.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework operates on covariance matrices extracted from EEG signals, which naturally reside on the SPD manifold. The core innovation involves learning congruence transformations that align these covariance matrices across subjects while preserving their geometric properties. The DCT model applies a single congruence transform, while DLDCT extends this to a deep linear architecture with multiple layers. DDCT-UNet further incorporates spatial-spectral features through a UNet-like architecture.

The training process involves optimizing these transformations to maximize class separability while minimizing subject-specific variations. The framework can be used either as a preprocessing step for standard classifiers or trained end-to-end for direct classification. The geometric constraints ensure that the learned transformations respect the manifold structure of SPD matrices, avoiding the pitfalls of naive Euclidean operations on these non-Euclidean objects.

## Key Results
- Achieved 2-3% improvement in transductive cross-subject accuracy over baseline methods across multiple motor-imagery benchmarks
- Demonstrated effectiveness of geometry-aware congruence learning in reducing subject-specific variability
- Validated framework performance both as pre-alignment modules and as end-to-end discriminative systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the geometric structure of SPD manifolds to learn transformations that align covariance matrices across subjects. Traditional approaches often fail because they treat these matrices as Euclidean objects, ignoring their intrinsic geometry. By preserving the manifold structure through congruence transformations, the model can effectively learn subject-invariant features while maintaining the discriminative information necessary for classification.

## Foundational Learning

**Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) Manifolds**: Why needed - Covariance matrices from EEG data naturally reside on SPD manifolds, not Euclidean space. Quick check - Verify that the learned transformations preserve positive definiteness throughout the network.

**Congruence Transformations**: Why needed - These transformations can align SPD matrices while preserving their geometric properties. Quick check - Confirm that the transformations maintain the manifold structure and don't introduce numerical instability.

**Optimal Transport on Manifolds**: Why needed - Provides a principled way to measure distances and alignments between SPD matrices. Quick check - Validate that the transport costs correlate with classification performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw EEG -> Covariance Estimation -> Congruence Transformation Layers -> Feature Extraction -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The congruence transformation layers form the critical path, as they must preserve SPD structure while learning subject-invariant alignments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances geometric preservation with discriminative power. Deeper architectures (DLDCT, DDCT-UNet) can capture more complex alignments but risk overfitting with limited data.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when transformations fail to preserve SPD structure, leading to numerical instability. Also, poor alignment can result in minimal improvement over baseline methods.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate SPD structure preservation throughout transformation layers
2. Compare alignment quality with and without geometric constraints
3. Test sensitivity to covariance estimation parameters
