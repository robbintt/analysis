- This study evaluates machine learning models for mental health screening using a dataset of 553 real-world psychiatric interviews with ground-truth diagnoses for depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates machine learning models for mental health screening using a dataset of 553 real-world psychiatric interviews with ground-truth diagnoses for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Models tested include zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini and Meta-LLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models with LoRA. Results show overall accuracy above 80% across diagnostic categories, with strong performance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy, 98% recall). LoRA fine-tuning proves efficient and effective, with lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8, 16) maintaining competitive performance. Shorter, focused context segments improve recall, suggesting focused narrative cues enhance detection sensitivity. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based models to improve early diagnosis, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments.

## Method Summary
The study uses 553 real-world psychiatric interviews (~2,955 words average) with ground-truth diagnoses from SCID reports. Models tested include zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini and Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (chunked at 512/1024/2048 tokens), LoRA fine-tuned RoBERTa-base and all-roberta-large-v1 (ranks 8, 16, 32), and embedding-based classifiers (MLP, XGBoost heads). Training uses AdamW optimizer, batch size 8, learning rate 2×10⁻⁵ on NVIDIA A100 GPU. The 80/20 train/test split by user handles imbalanced labels (~20% positive cases).

## Key Results
- Overall accuracy above 80% across diagnostic categories
- PTSD detection achieved up to 89% accuracy and 98% recall
- LoRA fine-tuning with lower ranks (8, 16) maintains competitive performance
- Shorter, focused context segments (512 tokens) improve recall compared to longer segments
- Models show potential for early diagnosis in low-resource or high-stigma environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) adapts general language models to psychiatric semantics more effectively than zero-shot prompting for clinical screening.
- **Mechanism:** LoRA injects trainable rank-decomposition matrices into the transformer architecture. This allows the model to minimize cross-entropy loss against ground-truth SCID diagnoses by shifting decision boundaries for specific symptom language (e.g., "hypervigilance," "anhedonia") without updating the full pretrained weights, thereby preserving general linguistic capabilities while learning domain-specific patterns.
- **Core assumption:** The low-rank subspace captures sufficient variance in psychiatric language to adjust model behavior without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "LoRA fine-tuning proves efficient and effective, with lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8, 16) maintaining competitive performance."
  - [section] Page 6, Table 5 shows RoBERTa with LoRA Rank=8 achieving 0.857 recall on depression, significantly higher than non-fine-tuned baselines.
  - [corpus] 'multiMentalRoBERTa' validates fine-tuning for multiclass disorder classification; 'StressRoBERTa' demonstrates cross-condition transfer via similar adaptation.
- **Break condition:** If the training dataset is too small or imbalanced (as noted in Limitations, ~20% positive cases), LoRA may overfit to simple heuristics rather than learning robust symptom features.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Segmenting long clinical interviews into shorter, focused context windows increases diagnostic sensitivity (recall) by reducing attention dilution.
- **Mechanism:** Standard context windows often struggle with long-range dependencies or "dilute" key diagnostic signals among irrelevant conversational filler. By chunking inputs (e.g., 512 tokens) and aggregating predictions, the model applies higher attention weights to local "narrative cues" (symptom mentions) that might otherwise be smoothed out, resulting in higher probability scores for positive cases.
- **Core assumption:** Diagnostic signals are localized in specific utterances rather than distributed evenly across the interview.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Shorter, focused context segments improve recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection sensitivity."
  - [section] Page 5, Table 4 shows Meta-LLaMA recall dropping from 0.980 (512 tokens) to 0.850 (2048 tokens) for depression as context length increases.
  - [corpus] Specific mechanism for chunking vs. recall is weak in immediate neighbors, though standard in long-context NLP.
- **Break condition:** If chunks are too short (e.g., <100 tokens), the model loses semantic context (negations, qualifiers), causing a spike in false positives.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Zero-shot LLMs prioritize specificity (avoiding false positives) while embedding-based classifiers can be calibrated for sensitivity (recall), creating a trade-off dependent on deployment needs.
- **Mechanism:** Zero-shot models like GPT-4.1 rely on probabilistic priors from general pre-training, defaulting to conservative thresholds unless explicitly prompted otherwise. In contrast, encoder models (RoBERTa) trained on ground-truth labels optimize directly against the target distribution, allowing the classifier head to adjust decision thresholds to maximize metrics like F1 or Recall.
- **Core assumption:** The cost of a missed diagnosis (false negative) outweighs the cost of a false alarm (false positive) in the intended screening use case.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Models... achieve over 80% accuracy... with especially strong performance on PTSD (up to... 98% recall)."
  - [section] Page 5, Table 3 contrasts GPT-4.1 (High Acc, Low Rec) vs. RoBERTa+LoRA (Mod Acc, High Rec).
  - [corpus] 'Standardization of Psychiatric Diagnoses' highlights variability in LLM-based assessments, supporting the need for calibration.
- **Break condition:** In high-stigma environments, excessive false positives from high-recall models could cause alarm fatigue or unnecessary anxiety.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary method enabling the encoder models to perform well on domain-specific data without the cost of full fine-tuning. Understanding rank selection (8, 16, 32) is critical for the architecture onboarding.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a Rank=8 configuration outperform Rank=32 on a small dataset (~500 samples)?

- **Concept: The Precision-Recall Trade-off in Clinical AI**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly prioritizes recall (sensitivity) over accuracy for early screening. You must understand why high accuracy (e.g., GPT-4.1 at 86%) can be misleading if recall is poor (28%).
  - **Quick check question:** In a screening context, what is the clinical risk of a model with high Accuracy (0.90) but low Recall (0.20)?

- **Concept: Chunking and Aggregation Strategies**
  - **Why needed here:** The input data (interviews) exceeds the context window of the models. The paper's findings rely on a specific "Chunking -> Encode -> Pool" pipeline.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does Max Pooling or Mean Pooling over chunks change the model's sensitivity compared to processing the full text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Interview Transcript -> Text cleaning -> Segmentation into overlapping chunks (512, 1024, 2048 tokens) -> Encoder (RoBERTa-base/large) with LoRA Adapters (Rank 8-32) -> Aggregator: Mean/Max Pooling of [CLS] tokens across chunks -> Classifier Head: MLP or Logistic Regression layer -> Alternative Path: Full Transcript -> LLM (GPT-4.1/LLaMA) -> Zero-shot Prompt

- **Critical path:** The success of this system relies heavily on the Label Alignment (mapping SCID diagnoses to specific transcripts) and the LoRA Rank Selection. As shown in Table 5, choosing the wrong rank can drop recall by nearly 60% (Depression: 0.857 vs 0.286).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **GPT-4.1 vs. RoBERTa+LoRA:** GPT-4.1 offers high accuracy/interpretability (explainable prompts) but misses positive cases. RoBERTa+LoRA captures positive cases (high recall) but requires training data and offers less explainability.
  - **Chunk Size:** Small chunks (512) maximize recall but lower accuracy (noise). Large chunks (2048) improve accuracy but lower recall.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"The Optimist":** Model predicts "No Disorder" for everyone. (High Accuracy, Zero Recall). Common in uncalibrated zero-shot prompts or imbalanced training without upsampling.
  - **"The Alarmist":** Model predicts "Disorder" for everyone. (High Recall, Low Accuracy/F1). Observed in LLaMA-3 zero-shot (Table 4) or excessive context truncation.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Verification:** Reproduce Table 3 results for GPT-4.1 Mini vs. RoBERTa-Base (zero-shot) to validate the accuracy/recall trade-off in your environment.
  2. **LoRA Rank Ablation:** Fine-tune RoBERTa using LoRA ranks [4, 8, 16, 32] specifically on the Anxiety dataset to verify if lower ranks (8-16) indeed maximize F1 score as suggested.
  3. **Context Sensitivity Test:** Run inference on the PTSD dataset using chunk sizes [256, 512, 1024] to plot the curve between context window size and Recall (targeting the 98% peak).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do diagnostic prediction accuracies and recall rates vary significantly across demographic subgroups (e.g., race, sex, age), indicating potential algorithmic bias?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state in the "Looking ahead" section that "demographic subgroup analyses... could reveal important disparities in model sensitivity."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study reports aggregate performance metrics across the entire dataset (n=553) without stratifying results by the demographic categories listed in Table 1.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis reporting Accuracy, Recall, and F1 scores separately for distinct racial, gender, and age groups to identify performance gaps.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can hierarchical modeling or relevance-guided chunking strategies outperform fixed-size overlapping windows in maintaining diagnostic signal over long-form interviews?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that current chunking methods "risk discarding context" and suggest that "memory-augmented prompting, hierarchical modeling, or relevance-guided chunking—may improve performance."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology relies on segmenting long transcripts into fixed chunks (512, 1024, or 2048 tokens) to fit context windows, which may sever important narrative dependencies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments showing that hierarchical or relevance-guided architectures yield higher F1 scores or recall than the current averaging-based chunk aggregation method.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do reweighting strategies or synthetic oversampling effectively mitigate the training instability and low sensitivity caused by the dataset's label imbalance (approx. 20% positive cases)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors identify "imbalanced" diagnostic labels as a key limitation and suggest future work could incorporate "reweighting strategies or synthetic oversampling to better calibrate predictions."
- **Why unresolved:** The current models exhibit a trade-off where high aggregate accuracy often masks low sensitivity to the minority positive class (e.g., GPT-4.1 Mini had high accuracy but 0.284 recall for depression).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing baseline models against those trained with class-weighted losses or augmented data, showing improved Recall and F1 scores without significant loss in Accuracy.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (553 interviews) constrains model generalization and may contribute to observed overfitting
- Label imbalance (~20% positive cases) requires careful calibration but isn't fully addressed
- Study relies on SCID-ground-truth labels from structured interviews, which may not capture real-world diagnostic complexity
- Absence of explicit confidence intervals or statistical significance testing for comparative results between models

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** LoRA fine-tuning effectiveness (Rank 8-16) and chunking strategy for recall improvement
- **Medium Confidence:** Zero-shot LLM performance claims
- **Low Confidence:** Clinical impact claims (e.g., "particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments")

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical Significance Testing:** Conduct paired t-tests or McNemar's tests comparing LoRA-tuned RoBERTa vs. zero-shot GPT-4.1 across all three disorders to verify if observed accuracy/recall differences are statistically significant (p<0.05).
2. **Cross-Validation Stability:** Perform 5-fold cross-validation on the 553-interview dataset to assess variance in model performance and ensure results aren't artifacts of the 80/20 split.
3. **External Validation:** Test the best-performing LoRA model (Rank 8-16) on an independent clinical dataset of psychiatric interviews to evaluate generalization beyond the original 553-sample corpus.
