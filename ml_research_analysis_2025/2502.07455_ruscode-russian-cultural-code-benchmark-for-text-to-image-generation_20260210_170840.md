# RusCode: Russian Cultural Code Benchmark for Text-to-Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.07455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07455
- Reference count: 13
- 4 text-to-image models evaluated on Russian cultural concepts, with significant performance gaps identified

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RusCode, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate text-to-image models' cultural awareness of Russian visual concepts. The authors employ expert-driven analysis to identify 19 categories and 125 subcategories representing the Russian cultural code. They generate 1250 complex Russian prompts with English translations and corresponding reference images. Through human evaluation of four popular models (Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, Kandinsky 3.1, and YandexART 2), the study reveals substantial gaps in cultural understanding, with Kandinsky 3.1 and YandexART 2 demonstrating superior performance over their competitors.

## Method Summary
The RusCode benchmark is developed through a comprehensive expert-driven methodology that identifies Russian cultural concepts across 19 main categories and 125 subcategories. The authors create 1250 complex prompts in Russian, each paired with English translations and reference images. Four state-of-the-art text-to-image models are evaluated using human expert judgment, where evaluators assess how accurately each model's output represents the intended Russian cultural concepts. The evaluation process involves comparing generated images against reference images and expert expectations for cultural accuracy.

## Key Results
- Kandinsky 3.1 and YandexART 2 significantly outperformed Stable Diffusion 3 and DALL-E 3 on Russian cultural concept generation
- All evaluated models demonstrated measurable gaps in cultural awareness and understanding of Russian visual concepts
- The benchmark successfully identifies specific areas where text-to-image models struggle with culturally-specific imagery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by leveraging expert knowledge to define culturally specific concepts that are difficult for general-purpose models to capture. By using human evaluators familiar with Russian cultural imagery, the assessment can identify nuanced failures in cultural representation that automated metrics might miss. The expert-driven approach ensures that the benchmark captures authentic cultural knowledge that goes beyond surface-level visual patterns.

## Foundational Learning
The paper assumes that models trained primarily on Western datasets lack exposure to Russian cultural concepts, leading to systematic failures in generating culturally accurate imagery. This suggests that training data composition significantly impacts a model's ability to understand and represent culturally specific concepts. The benchmark reveals that cultural knowledge in text-to-image models is largely dependent on the diversity and representation of cultural concepts in their training data.

## Architecture Onboarding
The evaluation methodology is architecture-agnostic, as it focuses on the quality of generated images rather than model-specific implementations. However, the benchmark implicitly suggests that models with better handling of Russian language prompts and those trained on more diverse cultural datasets (like Kandinsky 3.1 and YandexART 2) perform better on culturally specific tasks. This indicates that both language understanding and cultural representation in training data contribute to performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can text-to-image models be systematically improved to better capture culturally specific concepts?
- What is the minimum representation of cultural concepts needed in training data to achieve reasonable cultural awareness?
- Can prompt engineering techniques bridge the cultural understanding gap, or is architectural modification necessary?

## Limitations
- Expert-driven methodology introduces potential subjectivity in defining the "Russian cultural code"
- Sample size of 1250 prompts may not provide comprehensive coverage of Russian cultural concepts
- Evaluation limited to four specific models without optimization through fine-tuning or prompt engineering
- The benchmark focuses exclusively on Russian culture, limiting generalizability to other cultural contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The benchmark successfully identifies measurable gaps in cultural awareness among popular text-to-image models
- Medium confidence: The relative performance ranking of the four evaluated models
- Low confidence: The generalizability of results to other cultural contexts or model architectures

## Next Checks
1. Expand the benchmark to include additional Russian cultural experts to validate the category and subcategory definitions, ensuring broader cultural representation
2. Conduct a statistical power analysis to determine the minimum sample size needed for reliable detection of cultural concept generation quality differences
3. Test the benchmark across additional text-to-image models, including those specifically trained on Russian or Slavic cultural data, to establish more robust performance baselines
