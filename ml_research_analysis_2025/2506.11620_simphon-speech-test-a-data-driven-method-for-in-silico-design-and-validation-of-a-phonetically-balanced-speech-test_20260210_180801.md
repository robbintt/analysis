- A data-driven computational pipeline uses ASR confusion patterns to design a phonetically balanced speech test for high-frequency hearing loss

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a six-phase computational pipeline that leverages Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to simulate human speech perception under controlled hearing loss. The approach identifies phoneme confusion patterns from degraded speech, uses these patterns to curate minimal word pairs from a linguistic corpus, and applies simulated diagnostic testing, expert curation, and sensitivity analysis to select an optimized test set. The resulting SimPhon Speech Test-25 comprises 25 phonetically balanced minimal pairs with high diagnostic potential, showing no significant correlation with the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), suggesting it captures supra-threshold perceptual deficits beyond simple audibility. The method offers a significant increase in efficiency for audiological test development and is ready for initial human trials.

## Method Summary
The SimPhon methodology is a six-phase pipeline in MATLAB: (1) generate ~8,800 confusions via HI-simulated ASR using wav2vec2.0; (2) extract ~55,000 minimal pairs from CMU Pronouncing Dictionary; (3) validate to ~140 pairs (NH correct, HI confused); (4) expert curation to 58 pairs; (5) run 50 trials/pair with closest-guess scoring; (6) select top 25 with diversity constraint (max 3 per confusion type). Speech is synthesized via macOS TTS, passed through hearing loss simulation (frequency-specific attenuation + noise), then transcribed by ASR. The difference between input and output reveals phoneme-level errors that correlate with perceptual deficits. Test items are ranked by Youden's J statistic and selected to maximize diagnostic sensitivity while ensuring phonetic diversity.

## Key Results
- SimPhon Speech Test-25 comprises 25 phonetically balanced minimal pairs with high diagnostic potential
- Test shows no significant correlation with Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), suggesting it captures supra-threshold perceptual deficits beyond simple audibility
- Pearson's R=-0.115, p=0.58 for mild simulation; R=0.097, p=0.6456 for moderate simulation
- Methodology offers significant efficiency increase for audiological test development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: ASR as a Perceptual Proxy Under Degradation
A wav2vec2.0 ASR system can serve as a computational proxy for human speech perception under simulated hearing loss, producing systematic phoneme confusion patterns. Speech is synthesized via TTS, passed through a hearing loss simulation (frequency-specific attenuation + noise), then transcribed by ASR. The difference between input and output reveals phoneme-level errors that correlate with perceptual deficits. Core assumption: ASR confusion patterns under acoustic degradation approximate human perceptual confusions for sensorineural hearing loss.

### Mechanism 2: Minimal Pair Selection via Data-Driven Confusion Mining
Mining phoneme confusion patterns from large-scale ASR experiments yields minimal word pairs with high diagnostic specificity for frequency-region deficits. Phase 1 identifies frequent phoneme substitutions (e.g., S→F, T→D). Phase 2 searches the CMU dictionary for real-word minimal pairs exemplifying these confusions. This links test items directly to empirically observed error patterns. Core assumption: High-frequency ASR confusions map to perceptually salient deficits in human listeners.

### Mechanism 3: SII-Uncorrelated Diagnostic Signal
The SimPhon Speech Test-25 captures perceptual information not predicted by the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), suggesting sensitivity to supra-threshold distortions. Test items are selected based on ASR confusion behavior rather than audibility metrics. The lack of correlation between diagnostic scores (Youden's J) and SII-predicted audibility changes indicates the test probes deficits beyond simple audibility. Core assumption: SII is incomplete for predicting speech perception in sensorineural hearing loss; ASR captures residual structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Phoneme Confusion Matrices**
  - Why needed here: Core data structure for analyzing which speech sounds are misperceived under degradation
  - Quick check question: Given a high-frequency hearing loss profile, which phoneme confusions would you expect to increase?

- **Concept: Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding what standard audibility-based models predict—and what they miss
  - Quick check question: Does SII account for supra-threshold distortions like reduced frequency selectivity?

- **Concept: Youden's J Statistic**
  - Why needed here: Used to rank test items by combined sensitivity and specificity
  - Quick check question: If a test item has J=0, what does that imply about its diagnostic utility?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  TTS Engine (macOS `say`) -> Hearing Loss Simulator -> ASR Engine (wav2vec2.0) -> Phoneme Analyzer -> Selection Algorithm

- **Critical path:**
  CMU dictionary -> TTS synthesis -> Hearing loss + noise injection -> ASR transcription -> Confusion extraction -> Minimal pair matching -> In silico validation -> Expert curation -> Final ranking -> Diversity-enforced selection

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  macOS TTS adopted over Python TTS for stability (pivoted during Phase 3)
  Human-in-the-loop curation trades full automation for clinical appropriateness
  Diversity constraint sacrifices some J-score optimality for broader phonetic coverage

- **Failure signatures:**
  HI substitution patterns show consonant→vowel confusions (e.g., T→OW): may indicate ASR artifacts under severe degradation
  Both NH and HI show high deletion rates for /S/: expected, but verify masking isn't overwhelming signal
  J=0 items retained for diversity: confirm they still serve diagnostic purpose

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Human validation study: Administer SimPhon Speech Test-25 to NH and HI subjects; compare empirical sensitivity/specificity to simulated predictions
  2. Profile variation: Run the pipeline with different audiogram configurations (e.g., low-frequency, flat) to generate profile-specific test sets
  3. ASR substitution audit: Manually analyze HI consonant→vowel substitutions (e.g., T→OW, D→OW) to determine if these are perceptually plausible or ASR-specific artifacts requiring filtering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the SimPhon Speech Test-25 demonstrate diagnostically significant results in human subjects that align with the in silico predictions?
The authors state: "The immediate future work is the clinical validation of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test set," noting the need to compare "computationally-predicted performance with real-world human performance." This is entirely computational; no human trials have been conducted yet to verify if the ASR-derived test items function effectively for actual clinical diagnosis.

### Open Question 2
Are the specific phoneme substitution patterns observed in the simulated hearing-impaired listener (e.g., consonant-to-vowel shifts) artifacts of the wav2vec2.0 architecture or accurate proxies for human perceptual distortion?
The paper asks: "A critical consideration is whether the observed HI-specific substitution patterns... truly mirror human perception under profound hearing loss or are artifacts of the ASR's internal architecture." The ASR's error patterns under severe degradation may reflect "hallucinations" or model fallback strategies rather than biological perception.

### Open Question 3
Which specific acoustic features (e.g., temporal dynamics, formant transitions) drive the diagnostic power of the test items?
The acoustic analysis yielded a "null result," finding no correlation between diagnostic power and global features like spectral centroid or skewness. The authors infer the power "likely resides in fine-grained phonetic details." While the test items work effectively in simulation, the precise underlying acoustic or phonetic mechanisms that make specific pairs diagnostically robust remain unidentified.

## Limitations
- Core assumption that ASR confusion patterns reliably predict human perceptual deficits remains unvalidated in human listeners
- Expert curation introduces subjectivity that could be standardized
- SII-uncorrelated diagnostic signal is a novel claim without corpus precedent, requiring empirical confirmation

## Confidence
- **ASR as Perceptual Proxy (Mechanism 1): Medium**
  Computationally coherent but critical assumption unvalidated in human listeners
- **Minimal Pair Selection via Confusion Mining (Mechanism 2): High**
  Well-specified data-driven approach with standard techniques
- **SII-Uncorrelated Diagnostic Signal (Mechanism 3): Low**
  Most speculative claim; awaits human trial confirmation and lacks corpus validation

## Next Checks
1. **Human Validation Study**: Administer SimPhon Speech Test-25 to both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects under controlled conditions. Compare empirical sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with SII against the in silico predictions.
2. **ASR Substitution Audit**: Manually analyze the most frequent consonant→vowel confusions in the HI simulation (e.g., T→OW, D→OW). Determine whether these substitutions are perceptually plausible under high-frequency hearing loss or artifacts of the ASR model's architecture.
3. **Profile Variation Testing**: Run the full six-phase pipeline with different audiogram configurations (e.g., low-frequency, flat, notched losses) to generate profile-specific test sets. Evaluate whether the method produces diagnostically distinct and clinically useful tests for various hearing loss types.
