# SPOT: An Annotated French Corpus and Benchmark for Detecting Critical Interventions in Online Conversations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07405
- Reference count: 17
- French Facebook corpus with 43,305 manually annotated comments detecting "stopping points" - critical interventions that pause or redirect online conversations

## Executive Summary
This study introduces SPOT, a large-scale French Facebook corpus designed to identify "stopping points" - critical interventions in online conversations that temporarily pause or redirect discussion through irony, doubt, or fragmentary arguments. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated comments with extensive contextual metadata including post, article, parent comment, page/group, and source information. Through rigorous annotation with Krippendorff's alpha ≈ 0.80 inter-annotator reliability, the dataset provides a benchmark for detecting nuanced social interventions in non-English social media contexts. Comparative experiments between fine-tuned CamemBERT models and instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate that supervised encoders outperform LLMs by over 10 F1 points, emphasizing the importance of context-aware approaches for this subtle classification task.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed SPOT by collecting French Facebook comments linked to user-flagged URLs, then applying a three-stage annotation process where annotators identified "stopping points" - comments that create critical interruptions through irony, doubt, or fragmentary arguments. The annotation framework included comprehensive contextual metadata (post, article, parent comment, page/group, source) for each comment. To evaluate detection performance, the researchers fine-tuned CamemBERT models and compared them against instruction-tuned LLMs using various prompting strategies. The supervised learning approach leveraged the full corpus for training, while LLMs were tested under different contextual input configurations to assess their ability to capture subtle social interventions without task-specific fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned CamemBERT models achieved over 10 F1 points higher performance than instruction-tuned LLMs for stopping point detection
- Including contextual metadata improved encoder performance from F1 0.75 to 0.78
- High inter-annotator reliability (Krippendorff's α≈0.80) validates annotation quality and consistency
- Error analysis revealed models over-rely on lexical cues and struggle with implicit criticism or irony

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of fine-tuned encoders stems from their ability to learn task-specific representations from supervised examples, capturing the nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual dependencies required for identifying stopping points. Unlike LLMs that rely on prompt engineering and few-shot learning, the supervised CamemBERT models develop specialized understanding of French social media discourse through direct exposure to labeled examples. The inclusion of rich contextual metadata (post, article, parent comment, page/group, source) provides additional semantic signals that help distinguish critical interventions from regular comments, particularly for cases where surface-level features are ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning
- **Krippendorff's alpha**: Statistical measure of inter-rater reliability that accounts for chance agreement; needed to validate annotation quality in multi-annotator settings, quick check: values above 0.80 indicate strong reliability
- **CamemBERT**: French language model based on BERT architecture; needed for capturing French linguistic nuances in social media contexts, quick check: compare with multilingual models for performance differences
- **Stopping points**: Critical interventions that pause or redirect conversations through irony, doubt, or fragmentary arguments; needed to operationalize the theoretical concept for computational detection, quick check: validate against alternative operational definitions
- **Contextual metadata enrichment**: Process of including surrounding conversation elements (parent comment, post, article) in model inputs; needed to capture the full discourse context for subtle intervention detection, quick check: measure performance degradation when removing individual metadata types

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw Facebook comments -> Annotation pipeline (human annotators) -> SPOT corpus -> Model training (CamemBERT fine-tuning) -> Evaluation (LLM comparison with prompting strategies) -> Error analysis
- **Critical path**: Annotation quality → Model fine-tuning → Contextual metadata integration → Performance evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Supervised learning vs. prompt-based LLM approaches; trade-off between annotation cost and model performance
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on lexical cues, difficulty with implicit criticism, sensitivity to annotation subjectivity
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing contextual metadata types, 2) Cross-validation with different French social media platforms, 3) Comparative analysis of prompt engineering strategies for LLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The stopping point definition relies on a specific theoretical framework that may not generalize to all online discourse contexts
- High inter-annotator reliability doesn't eliminate inherent subjectivity in identifying subtle critical interventions
- LLM underperformance might be partially due to suboptimal prompting strategies rather than fundamental limitations
- Evaluation focuses on detection performance without assessing real-world moderation impact or efficacy

## Confidence
- **High**: Corpus construction methodology, annotation process, and inter-annotator reliability metrics are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium**: Comparative model performance results are convincing within tested settings but may not hold across different French social media platforms or downstream tasks
- **Low**: Claims about broader theoretical implications for online discourse moderation and model generalizability require further validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-platform validation using French comments from Twitter/X or Reddit to assess model portability and definition robustness
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of different prompting strategies and few-shot examples on LLM performance for this task
3. Implement qualitative error analysis with domain experts to distinguish between model failures and ambiguous stopping point cases in the dataset
