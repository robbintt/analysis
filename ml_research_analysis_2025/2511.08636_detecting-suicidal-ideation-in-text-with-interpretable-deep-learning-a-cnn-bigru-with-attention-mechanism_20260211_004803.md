# Detecting Suicidal Ideation in Text with Interpretable Deep Learning: A CNN-BiGRU with Attention Mechanism

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08636
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08636
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** 93.97% accuracy, 93.69% precision, 94.24% recall, 93.96% F1 score, 98.29% AUC-ROC on Reddit suicidal ideation detection

## Executive Summary
This study presents a hybrid deep learning model combining CNN and BiGRU architectures with attention mechanisms to detect suicidal ideation in social media text. The model leverages CNN for local feature extraction and BiGRU for sequential context modeling, while the attention mechanism enhances interpretability by focusing on relevant textual segments. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is integrated to provide explainable predictions, enabling mental health professionals to understand model decisions. Trained on a Reddit dataset of 232,074 posts (116,037 suicidal and 116,037 non-suicidal), the model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The model employs a CNN-BiGRU-Attention architecture with 128-dimensional word embeddings, 1D-CNN with 128 filters (kernel size 5) for local pattern detection, and Bidirectional GRU with 128 units for context modeling. An attention layer focuses on relevant segments, followed by GlobalAveragePooling, 50% dropout, and sigmoid output. The model is trained with Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001) using binary cross-entropy loss, batch size 512, and early stopping (patience 4). Data preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, rule-based stemming, and zero-padding to 100 tokens with a 10,000-word vocabulary.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93.97% accuracy, 93.69% precision, 94.24% recall, 93.96% F1 score, and 98.29% AUC-ROC
- Outperformed state-of-the-art models including transformer-based approaches and ensemble learning techniques
- Demonstrated effective capture of both local patterns and long-range dependencies in text
- SHAP visualizations revealed clinically relevant linguistic indicators for model interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: CNN-Based Local Feature Extraction
- Claim: 1D convolutions capture clinically meaningful n-gram patterns that signal suicidal ideation
- Mechanism: 128 filters with kernel size 5 slide over embedded sequences, detecting localized phrase patterns (e.g., "want to die," "end it all"). Max-pooling (size 2) retains strongest activations while reducing sequence length
- Core assumption: Suicidal ideation manifests through identifiable local linguistic markers rather than only distributed semantic patterns
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "model leverages CNN for local feature extraction"; [section III.C.2] "one-dimensional CNN featuring 128 convolutional filters with kernel size 5 to identify localized textual patterns"; [corpus] Tadesse et al. achieved 93.8% using similar local feature strategy

### Mechanism 2: BiGRU Bidirectional Context Modeling
- Claim: Bidirectional GRU captures how word meanings shift based on surrounding context, reducing misclassification of negated statements
- Mechanism: Two GRU streams process sequences forward and backward; hidden states concatenate, allowing each position to access both preceding and following context before classification
- Core assumption: Semantic valence of potentially concerning phrases depends on bidirectional context (e.g., "I don't want to die" vs. "I want to die")
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "BiGRU for sequential context modeling"; [section III.C.3] "bidirectional architecture enables the model to incorporate contextual information from both preceding and following sequence positions"; [corpus] Related Bhuiyan et al. preprint uses CNN-BiLSTM

### Mechanism 3: Attention-Guided Interpretability via SHAP
- Claim: Attention weights combined with SHAP explanations reveal which words drive predictions, enabling clinical validation
- Mechanism: Attention layer assigns learned importance weights to BiGRU outputs; SHAP computes Shapley values per token, quantifying each word's marginal contribution to final probability
- Core assumption: Clinically relevant indicators (hopelessness, self-harm references) are both detectable and interpretable through feature attribution
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "attention mechanism enhances interpretability by focusing on relevant textual segments. SHAP...to provide explainable predictions"; [section III.E] "Words supporting suicidal classification are highlighted in red while opposing words appear in blue"; [corpus] Corpus lacks direct validation of SHAP's clinical utility

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Word Embeddings (dense vector representations)**
  - Why needed here: The embedding layer (128-dimensional) converts discrete tokens into continuous vectors where semantically similar words have similar representations
  - Quick check question: Why would "hopeless" and "worthless" likely have similar embedding vectors, and how might this affect false positive rates?

- **Concept: Bidirectional Recurrence (forward/backward hidden states)**
  - Why needed here: BiGRU processes text in both directions to capture context that affects meaning
  - Quick check question: In the sentence "I never said I wanted to die," how does backward processing help identify the negation's scope?

- **Concept: Shapley Values (feature attribution from game theory)**
  - Why needed here: SHAP explains predictions by computing each feature's marginal contribution across all possible feature coalitions
  - Quick check question: If SHAP assigns high positive value to "tired" in a prediction, what does that mean about how the model uses that word versus how attention might weight it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (100 tokens) → Embedding (128-dim) → Conv1D (128 filters, k=5) → MaxPool1D (size 2) → BiGRU (128 units) → Attention → GlobalAveragePooling1D → Dropout (0.5) → Dense (sigmoid)

- **Critical path:** The sequence-to-vector compression happens through: Conv1D feature extraction → BiGRU context integration → Attention weighting → GlobalAveragePooling. Any bottleneck here (undersized GRU units, excessive pooling) directly limits representational capacity.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Kernel size 5 captures 5-gram phrases; increasing loses fine-grained short patterns, decreasing misses compound expressions
  - 10,000 vocabulary cap may exclude domain-specific terminology; increasing raises embedding parameter count
  - Dropout 0.5 is aggressive for a 232K dataset; reduces overfitting but may slow convergence and require more epochs
  - 80:10:10 split with early stopping (patience 4) trades maximal training for regularization; may underfit on rare linguistic patterns

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overfitting: Training accuracy >> validation accuracy after epoch ~15; check if early stopping triggered
  - Attention collapse: Uniform attention weights across all positions; suggests attention layer not learning discriminative focus
  - Context bleeding: Similar predictions for negated vs. non-negated versions of same phrase; BiGRU may not be capturing negation scope
  - SHAP-attention mismatch: High attention on tokens with low SHAP values; investigate whether attention is attending to position rather than semantic content

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation study: Remove attention layer, retrain, compare F1 and AUC-ROC. Quantifies attention's marginal contribution
  2. Negation stress test: Create synthetic test set with negated suicidal phrases ("I do NOT want to hurt myself"). Measure false positive rate to validate BiGRU's bidirectional context utility
  3. Threshold calibration: Plot precision-recall curve across classification thresholds (0.1–0.9). Identify optimal threshold for clinical deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent does integrating multimodal data (e.g., audio or physiological signals) with the current text-based framework improve the detection of suicidal ideation compared to text analysis alone?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "Multimodal analysis presents another compelling avenue, where textual data could integrate with audio analysis or physiological monitoring to create comprehensive mental health assessment frameworks."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is restricted to textual analysis from Reddit, lacking the capability to capture non-verbal or biological indicators of distress
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) from a study that applies this hybrid architecture to a dataset containing paired text and physiological/audio data

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How effective is the SHAP-based explainability component in improving diagnostic confidence and decision-making speed for mental health professionals in a clinical setting?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper concludes that "Clinical validation remains paramount, requiring collaboration with mental health professionals to ensure practical applicability and effectiveness in therapeutic settings."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates that SHAP highlights clinically relevant keywords, it does not provide evidence that these visualizations actually aid clinicians or reduce false positives in practice
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Results from user studies or clinical trials where mental health practitioners use the tool to assess patient risk, specifically measuring the utility of the explanations provided

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the proposed CNN-BiGRU architecture maintain high accuracy (approx. 94%) when adapted for real-time monitoring or cross-linguistic analysis?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify "Real-time monitoring capabilities" and "Cross-linguistic adaptation" as necessary future directions for the technology
- **Why unresolved:** The model was trained and tested on static, historical Reddit data (2008–2021); its performance on live data streams or non-English text remains unverified
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks showing the model's latency and accuracy when processing live social media feeds, as well as performance metrics on non-English suicidal ideation datasets

## Limitations

- **Dataset Representativeness:** Reliance on Reddit posts from specific subreddits may not capture suicidal ideation expressions in other platforms or demographic groups
- **Attention Implementation Ambiguity:** Paper provides no equations or architectural details for the attention mechanism, creating uncertainty about implementation
- **Clinical Validation Gap:** No reported validation that mental health professionals agree with or can effectively use SHAP explanations for clinical decision-making

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The hybrid CNN-BiGRU architecture design and basic performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC) are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that attention mechanisms enhance interpretability is supported by SHAP integration but lacks detail on implementation and clinical validation
- **Low Confidence:** The exact attention mechanism implementation, hyperparameter optimization configuration, and clinical utility of explanations remain unspecified

## Next Checks

1. **Attention-SHAP Alignment Test:** Compare attention weights with SHAP values across 100 random test samples. Calculate correlation coefficients to determine if both methods identify the same clinically relevant features, addressing the interpretability verification gap.

2. **Negation Handling Validation:** Create a controlled test set with 200 negated suicidal statements ("I don't want to die," "not planning to hurt myself") and measure false positive rate. This directly tests the BiGRU's bidirectional context modeling capability for negation scope detection.

3. **Clinical Expert Review:** Conduct a blinded evaluation where 3 mental health professionals review SHAP explanations for 50 model predictions, marking agreement with clinical judgment. Calculate inter-rater reliability and compare against random baseline to validate practical interpretability.
