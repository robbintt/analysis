# PolyGen: Fully Synthetic Vision-Language Training via Multi-Generator Ensembles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.01370
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01370
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 19.0% improvement in Delta Multi-Task Learning over single-source baselines

## Executive Summary
PolyGen introduces a multi-generator ensemble approach to synthetic vision-language training, addressing the trade-off between diversity and recognizability in single-generator methods. The framework generates structured caption pairs and renders them through four architecturally distinct diffusion models (SD 1.5, SD 2, SANA, SDXL-Turbo) to maximize manifold coverage. PolyGen achieves a 19.0% improvement in Delta Multi-Task Learning over single-source baselines and 9.1% gains on compositionality benchmarks. The method employs a curriculum scheduler to gradually introduce hard negatives, improving fine-grained semantic understanding. Results demonstrate that structural diversity in generators is more data-efficient than simply scaling dataset size, enabling robust open-world generalization while narrowing the performance gap with real-data models.

## Method Summary
PolyGen trains CLIP models from scratch using fully synthetic vision-language data generated through a multi-stage pipeline. First, a metaCLIP concept bank provides semantic anchors, which Mistral-V0.2-7B uses to generate base captions with controlled semantic attributes. Llama-3.1-8B then creates hard negative captions by modifying specific semantic axes while preserving syntactic structure. Four architecturally distinct diffusion models (SD 1.5, SD 2, SANA-1.6B, SDXL-Turbo) render each caption, creating a polylithic ensemble where each generator contributes different recognizability-diversity profiles. The training employs multi-positive contrastive loss with image-to-image regularization and TripletCLIP for hard negatives, using a curriculum scheduler that gradually increases hard negative proportion from 0 to 0.5 over 40 epochs.

## Key Results
- 19.0% improvement in Delta Multi-Task Learning over single-source synthetic baselines
- 9.1% gains on compositionality benchmarks (SugarCrepe/SugarCrepe++)
- Achieves 83.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy, narrowing the gap with real-data models to 3.6%
- Successfully balances recognizability-expert and diversity-expert generators to cover the visual-semantic manifold

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training on architecturally diverse generators marginalizes generator-specific spectral artifacts, forcing models to learn invariant semantic representations.
- Mechanism: Each diffusion model has distinct frequency-domain signatures and compression artifacts. When the VLM receives the same caption rendered through multiple generators, the only consistent signal is the semantic content—generator-specific features become noise that the contrastive objective learns to suppress.
- Core assumption: The semantic content is preserved across generators while low-level artifacts differ.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Polylithic approach to train on the intersection of architecturally distinct generators, effectively marginalizing out model-specific artifacts" [section 3.2] "SDXL-Turbo... low-frequency bias... SD 1.5... compression artifacts"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Programmatic hard negatives with curriculum scheduling improve compositional reasoning by forcing explicit attribute-binding rather than bag-of-words matching.
- Mechanism: Standard InfoNCE treats hard negatives identically to random negatives. TripletCLIP explicitly contrasts (I⁺, T⁺) against (I⁺, T⁻) and (I⁻, T⁻) against (I⁺, T⁺), removing noisy T→I comparisons where generated images fail to reflect subtle caption changes.
- Core assumption: LLM can generate controlled semantic perturbations that preserve syntactic structure while modifying only specified axes.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "+9.1% gains on compositionality benchmarks" [section 4.4] "full PolyGen configuration... achieves a ΔMTL of +12.5%, surpassing both the Scheduler-only and Loss-only configurations"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Balancing diversity-expert and recognizability-expert generators achieves superior manifold coverage than scaling single-generator volume.
- Mechanism: SD 1.5/SD 2 provide high intra-concept variance (high diversity, lower CLIPScore), while SANA/SDXL-Turbo provide high prompt adherence (low diversity, high CLIPScore). Joint training pushes the training distribution toward upper-right quadrant of Recognizability-Diversity space.
- Core assumption: Neither generator type alone approximates real data distribution; their union better covers the visual-semantic manifold.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2, Figure 4] "ensemble moves the training distribution toward the upper-right quadrant" [section 4.3] "combination of both factors is multiplicative: full PolyGen configuration (n⁺=4, m=4) reaches peak ΔMTL of +19.0%"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**
  - Why needed here: PolyGen modifies standard InfoNCE with multi-positive and hard negative objectives; understanding baseline is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given embeddings for image I and texts T⁺, T⁻, T_rand, how does InfoNCE compute the loss differently from TripletCLIP?

- **Concept: Spectral/Frequency Analysis of Generated Images**
  - Why needed here: The paper claims different generators have distinct frequency signatures (Figure 11); understanding FFT helps diagnose artifact-overfitting.
  - Quick check question: If training images have attenuated high-frequency components vs real images, what visual features might a model fail to learn?

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning**
  - Why needed here: Hard negative proportion increases linearly from 0→0.5; understanding why early exposure harms training is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why might early hard negative exposure disrupt "coarse semantic structure" formation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  MetaCLIP Concept Bank → Mistral-V0.2-7B (base captions T⁺) → Llama-3.1-8B (hard negatives T⁻) → 4 diffusion models (SD 1.5, SD 2, SANA, SDXL-Turbo) generate images → Multi-positive contrastive loss + Image-to-Image regularization + Hard Negative NCE with curriculum scheduler

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify LLM hard negative generation quality (Table 3: Llama-3.1 achieves 74% accuracy)
  2. Confirm diffusion model selection covers Recognizability-Diversity tradeoff (Figure 4)
  3. Ensure curriculum scheduler integrates with leftover queue for data efficiency

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **n⁺ vs m:** Increasing positive density (n⁺) improves linear probing; increasing ensemble size (m) improves zero-shot generalization (Table 1)
  - **L_I2I inclusion:** Improves zero-shot (+1.1% with n⁺=4, m=4) but degrades linear probing (-6.9%) by stripping texture shortcuts
  - **Hard negative ratio:** Peak compositional performance at m=3, not m=4—excessive diversity introduces noise for fine-grained tasks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Linear probing degrades while zero-shot improves → model learned abstract semantics but lost texture shortcuts (expected, not failure)
  - SugarCrepe++ performance plateaus despite increased m → check hard negative image quality (Table 10: SDXLT ~37% accuracy)
  - Training instability in early epochs → verify curriculum scheduler starts at p=0, not p>0

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate single generator:** Train with each generator alone (SD 1.5, SD 2, SANA, SDXL-Turbo), report Recognizability-Diversity coordinates and ΔMTL to reproduce Figure 4 baseline.
  2. **Hard negative quality audit:** Sample 200 T⁺/T⁻ pairs, manually verify Llama correctly modifies only specified semantic axis; measure correlation between accuracy and downstream SugarCrepe++ performance.
  3. **Curriculum warmup sensitivity:** Train with hard negative schedules (p: 0→0.5, 0.1→0.5, 0→0.3) and fixed ratio (p=0.25 throughout); compare early-epoch gradient variance and final ΔMTL.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does increasing ensemble size (m > 4) with additional architecturally diverse generators continue to yield monotonic improvements in downstream performance, or does the Heterogeneity Gain saturate?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will extend the strategy along three dimensions: (1) increasing ensemble size, thus increasing both m and n+, with architectures showing diverse Recognizability and Diversity properties"
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated ensembles up to m=4 and observed that compositional reasoning peaked at m=3, suggesting potential saturation effects that remain uncharacterized at larger scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of PolyGen with m ∈ {5, 6, 8, 12} using generators with varied Recognizability-Diversity profiles (e.g., FLUX, SD 3.5), reporting both ∆MTL and SugarCrepe++ scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between ensemble heterogeneity and dataset scale at larger budget regimes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "(2) scaling the data budget to evaluate the breadth-depth Pareto frontier at larger-scale regimes"
- Why unresolved: The study used a fixed 500k caption budget; whether structural diversity remains more data-efficient than volume scaling at 10M+ sample regimes is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments scaling both unique caption count and ensemble size factorially (e.g., 500k/1M/5M captions × m ∈ {1, 2, 4}), measuring sample-efficiency curves.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do frequency-domain characteristics of generators causally influence the recognizability-diversity trade-off and downstream VL performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "This analysis suggests that the frequency characteristics of generated images could be a contributing factor to the recognizability-diversity tradeoff observed earlier, and consequently to the downstream performance of models trained on such data. Further investigation is although needed to fully understand these relationships."
- Why unresolved: Spectral analysis (Appendix F) showed generator-specific frequency profiles correlating with FID, but causal links to training dynamics remain correlational.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments where images are preprocessed to match spectral profiles across generators, or where synthetic data is augmented with specific frequency bands, measuring impact on ∆MTL.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can programmatic hard negatives be extended to complex compositional axes (multi-concept relationships, counting, causality) while maintaining semantic coherence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "(3) expanding programmatic hard negatives to cover complex axes such as multi-concept relationships, counting, and causality, ultimately obtaining a synthetic curriculum capable of fully grounding open-world reasoning"
- Why unresolved: Current semantic axes (background, color, position, etc.) involve single-attribute perturbations; multi-attribute and relational modifications require more sophisticated LLM control and verification protocols.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the semantic axis set to include counting (e.g., "three cats" → "two cats"), spatial relations ("left of" → "right of"), and causal modifications, then evaluating on benchmarks requiring such reasoning (e.g., ARO spatial tasks).

## Limitations
- The claimed superiority of architectural diversity over dataset scaling remains empirically under-validated against direct scaling comparisons
- Hard negative image quality varies substantially across generators, with SDXL-Turbo achieving only ~37% accuracy in reflecting caption perturbations
- The method's success critically depends on maintaining architectural diversity across generators to prevent artifact overfitting

## Confidence
- **Confidence: Low** on the claimed superiority of architectural diversity over dataset scaling. While the paper demonstrates 19.0% ΔMTL improvements over single-generator baselines, it does not directly compare against simply increasing dataset size with a single high-quality generator.
- **Confidence: Medium** on the TripletCLIP mechanism's effectiveness. The paper shows compositionality gains (+9.1%) but Table 10 reveals significant hard negative image quality issues—SDXL-Turbo achieves only ~37% accuracy in reflecting caption perturbations.
- **Confidence: High** on the fundamental insight that generator-specific artifacts can be marginalized through architectural diversity. The core observation that different diffusion models have distinct spectral signatures (SDXL-Turbo's low-frequency bias vs SD 1.5's compression artifacts) is well-supported and represents the paper's most robust contribution.

## Next Checks
1. **Direct scaling comparison:** Train CLIP with 4× the dataset size using only the highest-quality single generator (e.g., SDXL-Turbo) and compare ΔMTL against PolyGen's ensemble approach to validate the data-efficiency claim.
2. **Artifact correlation analysis:** Perform spectral analysis of PolyGen-trained vs single-generator-trained models to quantify reduction in generator-specific frequency signatures, directly testing the invariance learning mechanism.
3. **Hard negative ablation study:** Train with curriculum scheduler disabled to quantify its necessity given the observed hard negative image quality issues, and test whether early hard negative exposure (p>0) indeed disrupts coarse semantic structure formation.
