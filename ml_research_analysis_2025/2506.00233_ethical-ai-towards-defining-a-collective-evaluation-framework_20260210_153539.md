# Ethical AI: Towards Defining a Collective Evaluation Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00233
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Modular framework using ontological blocks for ethical AI assessment with demonstrated application in investor profiling

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a modular ethical assessment framework for AI systems that uses ontological blocks of meaning - discrete, interpretable units encoding ethical principles like fairness, accountability, and ownership. The framework integrates these blocks with FAIR principles to support scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations, including EU AI Act compliance. A real-world use case in AI-powered investor profiling demonstrates how the framework enables dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. While the approach shows strong foundations for explainable and auditable AI ethics, challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines ontological blocks with FAIR principles to create a modular ethical assessment system for AI. Ontological blocks serve as discrete units encoding ethical principles that can be dynamically assembled based on context. The framework integrates these with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to ensure scalable and transparent evaluations. A case study in AI-powered investor profiling demonstrates practical application, where the framework enables dynamic risk classification based on behavior patterns. The method emphasizes explainability and auditability but acknowledges limitations in fully automated assessments and probabilistic reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Framework demonstrates strong foundations for explainable and auditable AI ethics through ontological blocks
- Real-world application in investor profiling shows dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification capabilities
- Integration with FAIR principles provides scalable and transparent ethical evaluation framework
- EU AI Act compliance potential identified, though requiring further validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing complex ethical principles into discrete, interpretable ontological blocks that can be dynamically assembled based on context. This modular approach allows for flexible application across different AI systems while maintaining interpretability. By integrating with FAIR principles, the framework ensures that ethical assessments are not only principled but also practical for real-world implementation. The ontological blocks encode specific ethical dimensions (fairness, accountability, ownership) that can be evaluated independently yet contribute to a holistic assessment. This architecture enables both granular analysis and comprehensive evaluation, supporting transparency and auditability in ethical AI assessments.

## Foundational Learning
- Ontological blocks: Discrete units encoding ethical principles; needed for modular, interpretable ethical assessment; quick check: can blocks be independently validated?
- FAIR principles integration: Ensures scalability and transparency; needed for practical implementation of ethical assessments; quick check: does integration maintain FAIR compliance?
- Dynamic assembly: Context-aware combination of ontological blocks; needed for flexible application across domains; quick check: does assembly adapt to different use cases?
- Behavior-informed classification: Risk assessment based on system behavior patterns; needed for practical ethical evaluation; quick check: are behavior patterns accurately captured?
- EU AI Act alignment: Regulatory compliance framework; needed for legal validity of ethical assessments; quick check: does framework meet specific Act requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Ontological blocks -> FAIR integration -> Dynamic assembly -> Behavior analysis -> Risk classification -> Compliance checking

Critical path: Ontological block definition → Context-specific assembly → Behavioral data integration → Risk assessment → Compliance validation

Design tradeoffs: Modularity vs. integration complexity, interpretability vs. assessment depth, flexibility vs. standardization

Failure signatures: Inconsistent block definitions, incomplete FAIR integration, assembly context mismatches, behavioral data gaps, compliance assessment errors

First experiments:
1. Validate ontological block definitions across multiple ethical principles
2. Test FAIR integration with sample AI systems
3. Evaluate dynamic assembly performance in controlled scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Automation challenges remain unsolved, particularly for real-time AI system assessments
- Probabilistic reasoning component is not adequately addressed in the proposed solution
- Limited evidence of practical application beyond the investor profiling case study

## Confidence
High confidence in conceptual architecture and modularity approach
Medium confidence in FAIR principles integration and practical applicability
Low confidence in automation capabilities and probabilistic reasoning implementation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain pilot studies (healthcare, finance, autonomous systems) to test framework adaptability and identify domain-specific limitations
2. Perform a formal audit simulation using EU AI Act criteria to evaluate compliance assessment capabilities and identify gaps
3. Develop and test a prototype automated assessment tool that demonstrates the framework's ability to process real-time AI system behaviors and generate interpretable ethical evaluations
