# AMBIT: Augmenting Mobility Baselines with Interpretable Trees

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22466
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: AMBIT residuals approach XGBoost accuracy (MAE 1.104 vs 1.103, R² 0.656 vs 0.659) while maintaining interpretable SHAP explanations

## Executive Summary
AMBIT augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree-based residuals to balance accuracy and interpretability in origin-destination flow prediction. The method uses a physics-grounded baseline (e.g., PPML gravity) as an explicit backbone and learns structured residuals with gradient-boosted trees, preserving interpretability while improving prediction. Evaluated on a year-long hourly NYC taxi OD dataset (7,415 OD pairs, 15.7M observations), PPML gravity variants outperformed other physical models; AMBIT residuals approached the accuracy of a strong black-box XGBoost model (MAE 1.104 vs 1.103, R² 0.656 vs 0.659) while maintaining interpretable SHAP explanations. POI-anchored residuals were most robust under spatial generalization, and diagnostics revealed interpretable feature contributions and spatial error patterns suitable for urban decision-making.

## Method Summary
AMBIT predicts OD flows by combining a physics-grounded baseline (PPML gravity) with learned residuals via gradient-boosted trees. The baseline models flows using log(origin mass), log(destination mass), and log(distance) with Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood. Residuals are computed in log space (r = log(1+T) - log(1+T_base)) and modeled with XGBoost using spatial, POI, temporal, and baseline prediction features. Predictions are reconstructed as exp(log(1+T_base) + r̂) - 1 to preserve non-negativity. The method is evaluated on NYC taxi data with time-based splits and spatial holdout validation.

## Key Results
- PPML gravity variants outperformed other physical baselines on hourly OD data
- AMBIT residuals achieved near-XGBoost accuracy (MAE 1.104 vs 1.103, R² 0.656 vs 0.659)
- POI-anchored residuals showed best spatial generalization under holdout conditions
- SHAP explanations provided interpretable feature contributions for residual predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structuring prediction as a physical baseline plus a learned residual preserves interpretability while approaching black-box accuracy.
- Mechanism: The PPML gravity baseline encodes distance decay and mass attraction explicitly. Gradient-boosted trees then learn structured deviations in log-space, capturing local urban structure and temporal effects that the physics model misses. SHAP explanations attribute residual contributions to interpretable features (POI density, hour-of-day).
- Core assumption: The physical baseline captures the dominant signal, so residuals are smaller and more structured than raw flows, making them easier to learn and interpret.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AMBIT residuals approached the accuracy of a strong black-box XGBoost model (MAE 1.104 vs 1.103, R² 0.656 vs 0.659) while maintaining interpretable SHAP explanations."
  - [Section 5.2] "This reconstruction preserves non-negativity while keeping residuals interpretable; we provide SHAP explanations for feature contributions."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers on interpretable mobility modeling (e.g., "Downscaling human mobility data...using interpretable machine learning methods") support the value of hybrid interpretable approaches, though no direct comparison to AMBIT exists.
- Break condition: If the physical baseline is misspecified (e.g., wrong distance metric, inappropriate mass definition), residuals may become large and unstructured, negating interpretability gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PPML gravity outperforms other physical baselines on hourly OD data because it models counts directly and is robust to heteroskedasticity.
- Mechanism: PPML uses Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood, avoiding log-transform bias on skewed count data. It regresses flows on log origin mass, log destination mass, and log distance. Fixed-effects variants (PPML+FE) further control for unobserved heterogeneity at origin/destination/time levels.
- Core assumption: OD flows follow a count distribution where variance scales with mean, making Poisson-type estimators appropriate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 7.1] "PPML gravity variants are the strongest physical baselines; PPML+FE is consistently best...Radiation and IO/OPS remain weak."
  - [Section 5.1] "PPML gravity, which models flows as Poisson counts and is more robust for skewed
