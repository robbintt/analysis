# When is the Computation of a Feature Attribution Method Tractable?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.02356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02356
- Authors: P. Barceló; R. Cominetti; M. Morgado
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Analyzes computational complexity of feature attribution methods beyond SHAP values

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the computational tractability of feature attribution methods, specifically power indices from cooperative game theory such as Shapley and Banzhaf values. The authors establish conditions under which these indices can be computed efficiently, showing that many simple power indices can be evaluated via polynomial interpolation over expected values. A key contribution is the introduction of Bernoulli power indices, which can be computed with just two expected value evaluations. The work also examines interaction power indices for feature subsets, demonstrating that their computational complexity mirrors that of individual features. The paper establishes polynomial equivalence between computing these indices and evaluating expected values for certain model classes.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the computational complexity of feature attribution methods by connecting power indices to polynomial interpolation and expected value computation. They introduce Bernoulli power indices as a new class that simplifies computation through reduction to two expected value evaluations. The analysis leverages properties of specific model classes (Independent, Markov, Exchangeable) to establish polynomial-time algorithms. The work employs cooperative game theory concepts and computational complexity theory to characterize when attribution computation is tractable versus intractable.

## Key Results
- Simple power indices can be computed via polynomial interpolation over expected values
- Bernoulli power indices reduce computation to just two expected value evaluations
- Computational complexity of interaction power indices mirrors that of individual feature indices
- Polynomial equivalence established between power indices and expected value evaluation for certain model classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The computational tractability of feature attribution methods depends on the mathematical structure of the underlying model class and the specific power index being computed. When models belong to classes like Independent, Markov, or Exchangeable, the expected value computations have special structure that enables efficient polynomial interpolation. Bernoulli power indices exploit this by reducing to evaluations at only two points, leveraging the polynomial nature of the expected value function. The interaction indices inherit computational properties from individual feature indices through recursive decomposition of the polynomial structure.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Expected Value Computation -> Power Index Evaluation -> Attribution Output

**Critical Path**: The computation proceeds from model evaluation (expected values) through interpolation or reduction steps to final attribution scores. For Bernoulli indices, this reduces to two model evaluations followed by simple arithmetic.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for mathematical generality. While establishing polynomial-time algorithms for certain model classes, the constants hidden in big-O notation may be significant. The reduction to expected value computation simplifies analysis but requires careful numerical implementation.

**Failure Signatures**: Numerical precision issues when implementing polynomial interpolation for high-degree polynomials. Exponential blowup when extending analysis beyond the specific model classes considered. Inaccuracies in Monte Carlo approximations of expected values.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement polynomial interpolation algorithm for Bernoulli power indices across different model architectures
2. Benchmark runtime performance comparing power index computation vs direct expected value evaluation
3. Test numerical stability of interpolation methods for high-dimensional feature spaces
