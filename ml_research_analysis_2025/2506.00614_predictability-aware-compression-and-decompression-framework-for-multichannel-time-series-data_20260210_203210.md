# Predictability-Aware Compression and Decompression Framework for Multichannel Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00614
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00614
- Authors: Ziqi Liu; Pei Zeng; Yi Ding

- Primary result: Proposes predictability-aware compression-decompression framework for multichannel time series prediction with computational superiority over naive predictors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework designed to address efficiency challenges in edge-cloud environments for multichannel time series prediction. The method employs circular seasonality keys with orthogonality constraints to preserve predictive information during compression while mitigating reconstruction errors during decompression. The framework demonstrates theoretical computational advantages over naive multichannel predictors and achieves superior performance across six diverse datasets when evaluated using a Cobb-Douglas index combining mean squared error and runtime metrics.

## Method Summary
The framework leverages circular seasonality keys with orthogonality properties to compress multichannel time series data while preserving predictive information. The orthogonality requirement ensures that seasonality components remain independent, allowing for more accurate reconstruction during decompression. The theoretical analysis establishes computational superiority over naive multichannel predictors when the number of channels exceeds one, based on the assumption that seasonal patterns can be effectively modeled through circular keys. The approach maintains compatibility with various prediction backbones, making it adaptable to different forecasting scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves lower runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets
- Demonstrates superior overall performance measured via Cobb-Douglas-based index combining MSE and runtime
- Maintains strong compatibility with various prediction backbones while preserving predictive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to exploit circular seasonality patterns while maintaining orthogonality between seasonal components. This orthogonality preserves the independence of different seasonal frequencies, preventing information loss during compression that would typically degrade predictive performance. By focusing on predictability rather than just data reconstruction, the method ensures that compressed representations retain the essential temporal dependencies needed for accurate forecasting.

## Foundational Learning

**Circular seasonality keys** - Periodic patterns that repeat in circular fashion over time. *Why needed*: Enables modeling of recurring temporal patterns that are common in time series data. *Quick check*: Verify that the dataset exhibits clear periodic behavior before applying the framework.

**Orthogonality constraints** - Mathematical property ensuring independence between different seasonal components. *Why needed*: Prevents information loss by maintaining separation between different frequency components during compression. *Quick check*: Confirm that seasonality keys satisfy orthogonality conditions through dot product calculations.

**Predictability preservation** - Focus on maintaining information relevant to forecasting rather than exact data reconstruction. *Why needed*: Ensures compressed data retains predictive power for downstream tasks. *Quick check*: Compare prediction accuracy before and after compression to verify information retention.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Raw time series data -> Circular seasonality key extraction -> Orthogonality enforcement -> Compression -> Decompression -> Prediction backbone

**Critical path**: The framework's core functionality depends on successful extraction of circular seasonality patterns followed by orthogonal decomposition. Any failure in identifying appropriate seasonality keys or enforcing orthogonality will cascade through the entire pipeline, degrading both compression efficiency and prediction accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades perfect data reconstruction for predictability preservation, accepting some reconstruction error to maintain forecasting capability. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional compression approaches that prioritize bit-perfect reconstruction over task-specific performance.

**Failure signatures**: Poor seasonality identification manifests as degraded prediction accuracy despite successful compression, while orthogonality violations lead to reconstruction artifacts that confuse prediction models. Both scenarios result in performance worse than naive approaches.

**First experiments**: 1) Test seasonality detection on datasets with known periodic patterns to validate key extraction accuracy. 2) Measure orthogonality violation impact by gradually relaxing orthogonality constraints and monitoring performance degradation. 3) Compare prediction accuracy across varying compression ratios to establish practical limits of the framework.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes perfect knowledge of seasonal patterns, but real-world applications often involve non-circular or irregular seasonality
- Orthogonality requirement may be difficult to satisfy in datasets with complex temporal dependencies and overlapping seasonal patterns
- Limited experimental validation with only six datasets, potentially missing edge cases or failure modes

## Confidence
- Computational superiority claims: High (theoretical proof provided, limited empirical validation)
- Performance improvements on benchmark datasets: Medium (strong results but limited sample size)
- Framework compatibility with prediction backbones: Low (asserted but not comprehensively validated)

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional real-world datasets with irregular seasonality patterns to assess robustness beyond the six benchmark datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the orthogonality constraint to understand its practical necessity versus theoretical optimality
3. Evaluate performance degradation under various compression ratios to establish practical limits of the predictability preservation mechanism
