# Enhancing Explainability in Solar Energetic Particle Event Prediction: A Global Feature Mapping Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09475
- Reference count: 40
- Most machine learning models for SEP prediction operate as black boxes, making interpretation difficult

## Executive Summary
This study tackles the challenge of enhancing explainability in Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event prediction using machine learning. Most existing models function as black boxes, hindering solar physicists' ability to interpret predictions and understand underlying physical causes. The authors propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping using a sliding-window multivariate time series forest classifier (Slim-TSF) to improve model transparency and provide deeper insights into decision-making processes.

The framework was validated using a dataset of 341 SEP events spanning solar cycles 22-24, with experimental results showing that predictive accuracy decreases as lead time increases. Performance metrics consistently indicated that shorter lead times yielded higher scores. The global explainability analysis revealed that proton flux measurements at the 10 MeV threshold (P3 channel) were the most influential predictive features across all scenarios, highlighting their critical importance in forecasting SEP occurrences.

## Method Summary
The study employs a novel framework combining global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping using a sliding-window multivariate time series forest classifier (Slim-TSF). The framework processes multivariate time series data to predict SEP events at various lead times. Global explainability techniques are integrated to identify the most influential predictive features across different scenarios. The approach uses a comprehensive dataset of 341 SEP events spanning solar cycles 22-24, enabling the analysis of feature importance and temporal patterns in SEP forecasting.

## Key Results
- Predictive accuracy decreases consistently as lead time increases from 1 to 12 hours
- Performance metrics (TSS, HSS, GSS) show higher scores for shorter lead times
- Proton flux measurements at the 10 MeV threshold (P3 channel) are the most influential predictive features across all scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its integration of global explainability methods with the Slim-TSF classifier, which captures temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. The sliding-window approach allows the model to adapt to changing solar conditions over time, while the global explanation component identifies consistently important features across all prediction scenarios. This combination enables both accurate predictions and interpretable results that align with physical understanding of SEP events.

## Foundational Learning
- Multivariate time series analysis - Needed for processing complex solar data patterns; Quick check: Verify data preprocessing handles temporal dependencies correctly
- Sliding-window classification - Essential for capturing temporal dynamics in SEP events; Quick check: Confirm window size optimization balances computational efficiency with prediction accuracy
- Global explainability methods - Required for identifying consistently important features; Quick check: Validate feature importance rankings remain stable across different lead times
- TSS/HSS/GSS metrics - Necessary for comprehensive performance evaluation; Quick check: Ensure metric calculations account for class imbalance in SEP data
- Proton flux measurement interpretation - Critical for understanding physical significance of predictions; Quick check: Cross-reference feature importance with established solar physics literature

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data preprocessing -> Slim-TSF classifier -> Global explainability module -> Performance evaluation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path follows: multivariate time series input → sliding-window transformation → Slim-TSF prediction → global feature importance extraction → performance metric calculation. Each component must function correctly for interpretable predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity for enhanced explainability and interpretability. The Slim-TSF classifier offers better handling of temporal dependencies compared to traditional classifiers but requires more computational resources. The global explanation integration adds transparency at the cost of additional processing time.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation with increasing lead times indicates temporal prediction challenges
- Inconsistent feature importance rankings suggest model instability
- Low explainability scores may indicate inadequate global explanation integration

**First Experiments:**
1. Test Slim-TSF with varying window sizes to optimize temporal capture
2. Compare global vs local explainability methods for feature importance consistency
3. Validate feature importance rankings using permutation importance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to a specific dataset spanning solar cycles 22-24
- Potential bias from focusing on single 10 MeV threshold
- No external validation on independent datasets from different time periods or instruments

## Confidence
High: Importance of proton flux measurements (P3 channel) as predictive features
Medium: Generalizability of Slim-TSF framework to other solar phenomena

## Next Checks
1. Test Slim-TSF framework on broader range of solar phenomena to assess adaptability
2. Validate model performance on independent datasets from solar cycles 25 and beyond
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate impact of different proton flux thresholds and feature combinations on predictive accuracy
