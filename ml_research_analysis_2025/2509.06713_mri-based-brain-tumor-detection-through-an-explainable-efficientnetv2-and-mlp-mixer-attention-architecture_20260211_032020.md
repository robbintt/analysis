# MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection through an Explainable EfficientNetV2 and MLP-Mixer-Attention Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06713
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06713
- Authors: Mustafa Yurdakul; Şakir Taşdemir
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Achieves 99.50% accuracy on 3-class brain tumor classification using EfficientNetV2 with MLP-Mixer-Attention

## Executive Summary
This study presents a deep learning model for brain tumor classification using MRI images, combining EfficientNetV2 as a backbone with an attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture to improve classification performance and interpretability. The model was trained and evaluated on a publicly available Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images of three tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1-score. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that the model focuses on clinically relevant tumor regions, enhancing interpretability and supporting its use in clinical decision-making.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines EfficientNetV2-S as a pretrained backbone for feature extraction with a custom MLP-Mixer Attention block. The architecture processes T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI slices through EfficientNetV2-S, applies a 1×1 convolution to project features into the MLP-Mixer space, then processes through N layers of MLP-Mixer Attention blocks using Linear Attention with kernel φ(x)=elu(x)+1. The model uses global average pooling followed by softmax for 3-class classification (glioma, meningioma, pituitary). Training employed 5-fold cross-validation on the Figshare dataset with class-balanced sampling.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1-score on 3-class brain tumor classification
- Outperforms 9 baseline models including standard CNNs, vision transformers, and pure MLP-Mixers
- Grad-CAM visualizations confirm model focuses on clinically relevant tumor regions rather than spurious features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** EfficientNetV2 provides superior feature extraction for this specific MRI dataset
- **Mechanism:** Uses Fused-MBConv blocks combining 3×3 convolutions and squeeze-excitation modules early in the network for stronger feature extraction
- **Core assumption:** EfficientNetV2's scaling strategy aligns well with spatial features of T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images
- **Evidence anchors:** EfficientNetV2 demonstrated best performance with 97.54% accuracy; enables effective learning of both low-level and high-level spatial relationships
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades with significantly different input resolutions or if training data lacks textures the Fused-MBConv blocks are designed to capture

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Linear Attention integration improves classification by capturing long-range dependencies
- **Mechanism:** Attention module inserted before Token-Mixing and Channel-Mixing MLPs allows global weighting of spatial relationships and channel correlations
- **Core assumption:** Computational overhead of attention is justified by accuracy gains over standard MLP-Mixer
- **Evidence anchors:** Attention-based MLP-Mixer enhances classification capability; combines MLP-based mixing with long-range relationship capture
- **Break condition:** May fail or underperform if sequence length becomes excessively large without aggressive downsampling

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** High accuracy correlates with focus on clinically relevant tumor regions
- **Mechanism:** Grad-CAM visualizes gradient flow into final convolutional layer, showing model attends to tumor mass rather than surrounding tissue
- **Core assumption:** High class activation overlap with tumor mask implies diagnostically correct features are being used
- **Evidence anchors:** Grad-CAM confirms model focuses on clinically relevant tumor regions; areas of focus largely match real tumor regions
- **Break condition:** If dataset contains biases (e.g., specific scanner types for specific tumor types), Grad-CAM might highlight "scanner style" rather than "tumor style"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: MLP-Mixer Architecture**
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed model replaces or augments the standard classifier head with an MLP-Mixer
  - **Quick check question:** If you remove the Token-Mixing MLP, what specific type of information is the model losing the ability to aggregate?

- **Concept: Linear Attention**
  - **Why needed here:** Linear Attention reduces complexity from O(N²) to make attention feasible for high-res images
  - **Quick check question:** How does Linear Attention change computational complexity compared to standard dot-product attention, and what is the trade-off in terms of precision?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** EfficientNetV2 is pretrained (likely on ImageNet)
  - **Quick check question:** Should the learning rate for the EfficientNetV2 backbone be the same as the MLP-Mixer head during initial training phase? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MRI Slice (T1-weighted) -> EfficientNetV2-S (Pretrained) -> 1×1 Conv + Reshape -> MLP-Mixer Attention Block (N layers) -> Global Average Pooling -> Softmax (3 classes)

- **Critical path:** The connection between Backbone output and MLP-Mixer input, where H × W × d becomes R^(n×d). Mismatched tensor shapes will cause initialization failure.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tested configurations: (64, 256), (128, 512), and (256, 1024)
  - Medium configuration (128, 512) was optimal
  - Larger dimensions led to performance drops, suggesting overfitting due to small dataset size (3,064 images)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Meningioma vs. Glioma confusion: Hardest classes to separate (8 misclassifications in baseline)
  - Input sensitivity: Relies on "contrast-enhanced" images; non-contrast T1 images may result in false negatives

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run 9 baseline models on Figshare dataset to confirm EfficientNetV2 is strongest backbone
  2. Ablation Study: Disable "Attention" to quantify exact performance gain from Linear Attention mechanism
  3. Hyperparameter Sweep: Train using three dimension configurations to verify (Token=128, Channel=512) is optimal

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the proposed architecture maintain high classification performance when applied to multi-center datasets containing broader diversity of tumor types and rare pathologies?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors explicitly state Figshare dataset "does not cover different tumor types that may be encountered in real clinical conditions" and list collecting "more comprehensive and diverse datasets" as future goal
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation restricted to only three specific tumor types from single dataset source
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance metrics from training and validating on multi-institutional datasets with wider spectrum of brain lesion histologies

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the model's performance and attention mechanism respond when applied to different MRI modalities like T2-weighted, FLAIR, or non-contrast images?
- **Basis in paper:** Discussion identifies reliance on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images as limitation, noting model "has not been tested in different imaging modalities limits model's generalization ability"
- **Why unresolved:** Methodology and experimental setup exclusively designed for and tested on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI scans
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study evaluating model's classification accuracy and Grad-CAM robustness across various standard MRI sequences without retraining

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the 2D slice-based classification approach effectively capture spatial continuity required for robust 3D volumetric brain tumor diagnosis?
- **Basis in paper:** Paper utilizes dataset of 2D MRI slices and treats them as independent inputs, while clinical diagnosis typically relies on spatial context of entire 3D volume
- **Why unresolved:** Methodology analyzes slices in isolation, potentially ignoring inter-slice dependencies or volumetric features
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Extension that aggregates slice-level predictions or modifies architecture to process 3D volumes, compared against radiologist diagnoses

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (3,064 images) raises concerns about potential overfitting despite 5-fold cross-validation
- Specific input image resolution for EfficientNetV2-S is not disclosed, making exact reproduction challenging
- Architecture assumes "contrast-enhanced" T1-weighted MRI images, limiting applicability to non-contrast protocols

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** General architectural approach (EfficientNetV2 backbone + attention-based MLP-Mixer) well-supported by experimental comparisons and ablation study
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific claim that (Token=128, Channel=512) is optimal based on limited testing of three configurations
- **Low Confidence:** Assumption that Grad-CAM visualization directly translates to clinically valid feature detection is qualitative and potentially vulnerable to dataset-specific biases

## Next Checks

1. **External Dataset Validation:** Evaluate trained model on independent brain tumor MRI dataset (e.g., BraTS) to verify 99.50% accuracy generalizes beyond Figshare dataset

2. **Ablation Study on Attention Mechanism:** Systematically disable Linear Attention component while keeping all other parameters constant to quantify exact contribution to performance improvement

3. **Bias and Artifact Analysis:** Conduct controlled experiments using images with varying scanner parameters, contrast levels, and synthetic artifacts to determine whether model learns tumor-specific features or dataset-specific correlations
