# Detecting Domain Shifts in Myoelectric Activations: Challenges and Opportunities in Stream Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21278
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Stream learning methods for EMG domain shift detection achieve F1 scores of 0.02-0.41 with FPR >90%, highlighting fundamental limitations

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the challenge of detecting domain shifts in electromyography (EMG) signals for real-time intention decoding in prosthetic applications. The authors identify that EMG signals are inherently non-stationary due to factors like electrode displacement, skin condition changes, and muscle fatigue, causing performance degradation in decoding models. They propose a pipeline combining Kernel PCA with cosine kernel for feature extraction and multiple drift detection methods (CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, ADWIN, HDDMA, HDDMW, SEED, ABCD) to identify domain boundaries in streaming EMG data from the NinaPro DB6 database. Despite testing various approaches, the best-performing detector (HDDMA) achieved only an F1 score of 0.409, with most detectors performing significantly worse. The study reveals the limitations of current stream learning techniques for EMG applications and identifies this as a critical area for future research.

## Method Summary
The authors define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different subjects and recording sessions. They apply Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process EMG signals and highlight domain shifts, then evaluate multiple drift detection methods including CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, ADWIN, and Hoeffding-based detectors (HDDMA, HDDMW) for real-time detection. The preprocessing pipeline extracts RMS features from EMG windows, computes regression slopes, and uses Mahalanobis distance scoring. All detectors were implemented using the CapyMOA library, with experiments conducted on the NinaPro DB6 database containing 36 intact subjects performing various hand movements.

## Key Results
- HDDMA achieved the highest F1 score of 0.409, while most detectors performed significantly worse (0.02-0.378)
- False Positive Rate exceeded 90% across all detection methods
- Detection delays ranged from 5-30 seconds depending on the method
- Signal fluctuations within individual subjects often exceeded variation between different subjects, confounding detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Kernel PCA with cosine kernel can separate EMG signals from different domains (subjects/time periods) in feature space
- Mechanism: The cosine kernel k(x,y) = x·y / (‖x‖‖y‖) emphasizes angular relationships between signal instances rather than absolute magnitudes. This creates separable clusters in the induced feature space when domain shifts exist.
- Core assumption: Domain shifts manifest as directional differences in the feature space that survive dimensionality reduction to 3 principal components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts"
  - [Section 3.2] "The fact that the samples lie on two distinct hemispheres... the cosine kernel captures the angular difference that shows clean separation in the kernel-induced feature space"
  - [corpus] Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation paper addresses similar EMG drift but via model adaptation rather than detection

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hoeffding's bound-based detectors (HDDMA, HDDMW) detect domain shifts by monitoring deviation from historical mean with statistical guarantees
- Mechanism: These detectors maintain running statistics and use Hoeffding's inequality to establish confidence bounds. When observations consistently exceed these bounds, drift is signaled.
- Core assumption: Domain shifts produce sustained statistical deviations distinguishable from transient noise; observations are i.i.d. within each domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The best-performing detector, HDDMA, achieved an F1 score of 0.409, which is far from satisfactory"
  - [Section 4] "HDDMA and HDDMW demonstrate relatively higher F1 scores compared to others, with maximum values of 0.409 and 0.378, respectively"
  - [corpus] No directly comparable drift detection approaches in neighbor corpus

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reference-based KL divergence quantifies distributional drift by comparing sliding windows to an initial Gaussian reference
- Mechanism: A reference window models initial signal distribution as multivariate Gaussian N(μ₀, Σ₀). Subsequent windows are compared using closed-form KL divergence, with peaks indicating potential domain boundaries.
- Core assumption: EMG segments approximately follow Gaussian distributions; reference window is representative of "stable" conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3] "sudden shifts that are aligned with the period changes can be clearly observed during the transition from one period to another"
  - [Section 3.3] "different people activate muscle in relatively different manners even when they are doing similar movements"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for this specific technique

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Concept Drift vs. Domain Shift**
  - Why needed here: The paper conflates these terms. Concept drift refers to P(y|X) changing over time; domain shift refers to P(X) differing between source and target. EMG experiences both simultaneously (signal distribution changes + decoding relationship may change).
  - Quick check question: If EMG amplitude patterns change but the gesture-to-label mapping stays constant, is this concept drift or domain shift?

- Concept: **Streaming Learning Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Stream algorithms assume single-pass, bounded memory, and real-time operation. This conflicts with non-linear feature extraction (KPCA) which requires batch processing.
  - Quick check question: Why can't you simply recompute KPCA incrementally as new EMG samples arrive?

- Concept: **False Positive Rate vs. Detection Delay Trade-off**
  - Why needed here: Paper reports high FPR (>90%) but acceptable detection delay (~5 seconds). In prosthetics, false alarms trigger unnecessary recalibration, annoying users. Understanding this trade-off is critical for deployment.
  - Quick check question: If a detector flags drift every 10 seconds incorrectly, how does this compare to missing a true drift event that occurs once per hour?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Raw EMG -> RMS extraction (200ms window, 20ms stride) -> Windowed slope extraction (1500 samples, 500 stride) -> Mahalanobis distance scoring -> Drift detector monitoring

- Critical path:
  1. Raw EMG streams in real-time
  2. RMS feature extraction (streaming-compatible)
  3. Windowed regression slope computation (streaming-compatible)
  4. Mahalanobis distance to rolling reference (requires covariance maintenance)
  5. Drift detector monitors distance scores
  6. Detection triggers recalibration pipeline (future work)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Batch KPCA vs. streaming IPCA**: Paper tested Incremental PCA and Fair Streaming PCA with "no noticeable improvements" — non-linear structure may not survive linear streaming approximations
  - **Detector sensitivity**: Tuning reduces FPR but increases detection delay; current methods cannot achieve both low FPR and timely detection
  - **Unsupervised vs. supervised detection**: Paper uses unsupervised (no labels) to match real-world constraints, but this limits ability to ground detections in actual performance degradation

- Failure signatures:
  - F1 scores 0.02-0.41 across all detectors indicate fundamental limitation
  - FPR >90% suggests detectors cannot distinguish intra-subject variability from true domain boundaries
  - Figure 5 shows signal fluctuations within one subject exceed cross-subject variation — violates drift detector assumptions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Implement the preprocessing pipeline (RMS → slope → Mahalanobis) on NinaPro DB6 with HDDMA detector; verify F1 ≈ 0.35-0.41
  2. **Multi-modal fusion**: Add accelerometer/grasp force data (per paper's future work suggestion); test whether complementary sensors reduce false positives
  3. **Detector ensemble**: Combine HDDMA (best precision) with ADWIN (best theoretical guarantees) using voting; evaluate if ensemble reduces FPR while maintaining detection delay

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can incorporating additional modalities (accelerometer, grasp force) improve detection accuracy?
- How can the trade-off between false positive rate and detection delay be optimized for practical prosthetic applications?
- Would supervised or semi-supervised approaches outperform the current unsupervised methods?
- Can model adaptation techniques be integrated with detection to enable seamless recalibration?

## Limitations
- High false positive rate (>90%) across all detectors prevents practical deployment
- Poor performance (F1 0.02-0.41) suggests fundamental limitations in current stream learning approaches for EMG
- Within-subject variability exceeds between-subject differences, violating core assumptions of drift detection

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
The paper's claim that cosine kernel KPCA effectively separates domains is limited by the assumption that angular differences dominate EMG domain shifts. The very low F1 scores (0.02-0.41) across all detectors suggest fundamental limitations in the approach, not just detector tuning. The high FPR (>90%) indicates detectors cannot distinguish within-subject variability from true domain boundaries, a critical failure for real-world deployment.

**Confidence Labels:**
- **Medium confidence** in the preprocessing pipeline (RMS + slope features) as standard EMG feature extraction, though Mahalanobis distance may not be optimal for streaming
- **Low confidence** in KPCA with cosine kernel for domain separation given the poor downstream detection performance
- **Medium confidence** in the overall conclusion that current stream learning methods are insufficient for EMG domain shift detection

## Next Checks

1. Implement the preprocessing pipeline (RMS → slope → Mahalanobis) on NinaPro DB6 with HDDMA detector to verify baseline F1 ≈ 0.35-0.41
2. Test multi-modal fusion by adding accelerometer/grasp force data to evaluate whether complementary sensors reduce false positives
3. Create detector ensemble combining HDDMA (best precision) with ADWIN (best theoretical guarantees) to assess if ensemble improves FPR while maintaining detection delay
