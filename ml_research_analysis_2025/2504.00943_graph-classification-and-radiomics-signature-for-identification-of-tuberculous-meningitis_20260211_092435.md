# Graph Classification and Radiomics Signature for Identification of Tuberculous Meningitis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00943
- Reference count: 34
- One-line primary result: PAG-Classifier achieves 85.71% F1 on TBM vs healthy classification using T1w MRI cistern regions; radiomics improves to 92.85% F1.

## Executive Summary
This study develops a non-invasive diagnostic method for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) using T1-weighted MRI scans. The authors propose a novel Pixel-array Graphs (PAG) Classifier that transforms 3D MRI image patches into graph structures, extracting features through eigen decomposition for machine learning classification. They validate their approach using radiomics features. Using an internal dataset of 52 scans (32 TBM patients confirmed by CSF analysis, 20 healthy controls), they achieved a 5-fold cross-validated F1 score of 85.71% with PAG-Classifier and 92.85% with radiomics features for the interpeduncular cistern region, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks by 15-22%. The bone and corpus callosum regions showed poor classification effectiveness (F1 scores below 50%). The study demonstrates that non-invasive T1w MRI analysis can effectively identify TBM patients, particularly targeting the interpeduncular cistern region.

## Method Summary
The study employs two complementary approaches for TBM classification: PAG-Classifier and radiomics features. The PAG-Classifier converts 3D MRI patches into graph structures where nodes represent pixel-arrays in the z-dimension, edges are weighted by normalized mutual information, and eigen decomposition extracts the top 8 eigenvectors as features. The radiomics pipeline extracts 1713 features across multiple families (shape, first-order, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, GLDM, NGTDM) from filtered and original images, then reduces features via correlation filtering and LightGBM importance selection. Both methods use 5-fold stratified cross-validation on three manually annotated ROIs: interpeduncular cistern, bone, and corpus callosum. Classification models include random forest, SVM, and LightGBM, with the latter showing best performance.

## Key Results
- PAG-Classifier achieved 85.71% F1 score for interpeduncular cistern region on 5-fold cross-validation.
- Radiomics features classifier achieved 92.85% F1 score for interpeduncular cistern region.
- Bone and corpus callosum regions showed poor classification effectiveness with F1 scores below 50%.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting 3D MRI patches into graph structures preserves spatial relationships that distinguish TBM patients from controls in the interpeduncular cistern region.
- Mechanism: Each pixel-array in the z-dimension becomes a graph node. Edges connect arrays based on normalized mutual information scores (threshold ≥0.5). Eigen decomposition of the resulting adjacency matrix yields the top 8 eigenvectors as classification features, capturing graph connectivity and cluster structure.
- Core assumption: TBM-induced tissue changes alter mutual information relationships between spatially adjacent pixel columns in the interpeduncular cistern but not in bone or corpus callosum.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Pixel-array Graphs Classifier (PAG-Classifier) leverages spatial relationships between neighbouring 3D pixels in a graph-based framework to extract significant features through eigen decomposition."
  - [section] Pages 6–7 detail graph construction, mutual information edge weighting (Eq. 1–2), adjacency matrix formation, and eigenvector selection.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus papers validate this specific graph mechanism for TBM; it is a methodological contribution.
- Break condition: If mutual information between pixel-arrays does not differ systematically between patients and controls, or if graph structure is insensitive to TBM pathology, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Radiomics features extracted from T1-weighted MRI capture texture and intensity patterns that classify TBM patients more accurately than graph-based features.
- Mechanism: Z-score normalized 3D patches undergo resampling, then 1713 features are extracted (shape, first-order, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, GLDM, NGTDM) across original and filtered images (wavelet, LBP, LoG, etc.). Correlation-based reduction and LightGBM feature importance select ~197 features for final classification.
- Core assumption: Subtle TBM-related changes in the interpeduncular cistern manifest as measurable alterations in texture and intensity distributions visible on non-contrast T1w MRI.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "achieved 5-fold cross-validated average F1 score of 85.71% for cistern regions with our PAG-Classifier and 92.85% with the radiomics features classifier."
  - [section] Pages 9–10 describe feature extraction pipeline, filter types, and reduction strategy; Table 2 reports per-region metrics.
  - [corpus] Radiomics mechanisms are well-established in oncology (see related papers on CT radiomics for tumor classification); application to TBM is novel but mechanism is analogous.
- Break condition: If TBM pathology does not produce radiomics-detectable texture changes, or if features are overfit to the small dataset (n=52), generalization fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The interpeduncular cistern region is uniquely informative for TBM classification, while bone and corpus callosum lack discriminative patterns.
- Mechanism: TBM pathology involves inflammatory exudation prominent in basal cisternal regions, altering local tissue properties. The interpeduncular cistern shows higher between-group variance in graph and radiomics features; bone and corpus callosum do not.
- Core assumption: TBM-driven inflammation preferentially affects basal cisterns in ways detectable on T1w MRI; other tested regions are pathologically uninvolved or changes are below detection threshold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "bone and corpus callosum regions showed poor classification effectiveness, with average F1 scores below 50%."
  - [section] Pages 11–13 report cistern F1 of 85.71% (PAG) and 92.85% (radiomics) vs <60% for bone/corpus callosum; boxplots (Fig. 5) show feature distribution differences.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers specifically address region selection for TBM radiomics; this is a study-specific finding requiring external validation.
- Break condition: If discriminative patterns exist in other untested regions, or if cistern findings do not replicate in larger/external cohorts, the region-specific mechanism is incomplete.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph Representation of Images**
  - Why needed here: The PAG-Classifier converts voxel arrays into graphs where nodes are pixel-columns and edges encode mutual information. Understanding graph construction, adjacency matrices, and eigen decomposition is essential to debug and extend this method.
  - Quick check question: Given a 10×10×20 3D patch, how many nodes would the PAG graph have, and what does an edge weight of 0.7 signify?

- Concept: **Radiomics Feature Families (GLCM, GLRLM, etc.)**
  - Why needed here: The radiomics pipeline extracts 1713 features across texture and intensity families. Knowing what each family captures (e.g., GLCM = gray-level co-occurrence, spatial dependencies) aids feature interpretation and debugging.
  - Quick check question: Which radiomics feature family quantifies run-length statistics, and what tissue property might it reflect in TBM?

- Concept: **Small-Sample High-Dimensional Learning**
  - Why needed here: With 52 scans and 1713 features, overfitting risk is high. The study uses correlation filtering and feature importance to reduce dimensionality; understanding regularization and cross-validation is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use 5-fold cross-validation with stratification, and what failure mode does this guard against?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Data Ingestion: 3T Siemens T1w MPRAGE scans (1mm³ isotropic), 32 TBM + 20 controls
  2. ROI Annotation: Manual segmentation of bone, corpus callosum, left/right interpeduncular cisterns via 3DSlicer
  3. PAG Pipeline: Normalize → graph construction (mutual information edges, threshold 0.5) → adjacency matrix → eigen decomposition → top 8 eigenvectors → classifier (RF, SVM, LightGBM)
  4. Radiomics Pipeline: Z-score normalize → resample → extract 1713 features (PyRadiomics-style) → correlation + importance reduction → LightGBM classifier
  5. Evaluation: 5-fold stratified CV; metrics = accuracy, F1, AUROC; SHAP for explainability

- Critical path: ROI quality → feature extraction fidelity → dimensionality reduction → classifier training → cross-validated evaluation. If ROI annotation is inconsistent, downstream features are noisy.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - PAG vs. Radiomics: PAG is novel and interpretable (graph structure) but underperforms radiomics (85.71% vs. 92.85% F1). Radiomics is higher-capacity but risks overfitting.
  - T1w vs. T2w/FLAIR: Paper argues T1w avoids CSF flow artifacts; tradeoff is potentially lower lesion contrast.
  - Region Selection: Focusing on cistern maximizes performance but ignores potentially informative regions not tested.

- Failure signatures:
  - Bone/Corpus Callosum F1 < 50%: Indicates features from these regions are non-discriminative; do not deploy classifiers trained on them.
  - High variance in CV folds: Would suggest overfitting or data leakage; monitor fold-level metrics.
  - SHAP features with overlapping distributions: Would indicate weak discriminative power; revisit feature selection.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate PAG-Classifier on cistern ROI: Reconstruct graphs from raw patches, verify mutual information edge weights and eigen decomposition produce 8-feature vectors achieving ~85% F1 on 5-fold CV.
  2. Ablate graph parameters: Test edge weight thresholds (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and number of eigenvectors (4, 8, 16) to quantify sensitivity.
  3. Region generalization test: Train radiomics model on cistern, evaluate on held-out bone/corpus callosum patches to confirm region-specific discriminability (expect near-chance performance).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the PAG-Classifier and radiomics signature maintain high diagnostic performance when validated on larger, multi-center cohorts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the study's "major limitation is its non-blinded nature and small sample size, necessitating further research with larger cohort."
- Why unresolved: The current results are derived from a single-center internal dataset of only 52 scans (32 patients, 20 controls), which risks overfitting and limits statistical power.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful validation of the model on a significantly larger, independent external dataset to confirm generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective is the proposed method at differentiating TBM from other neurological conditions like pyogenic or viral meningitis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "Inclusion of other non-tubercular meningitis, such as pyogenic meningitis, could have helped in improving the diagnostic system."
- Why unresolved: The study only classifies binary TBM vs. Healthy Control, whereas the primary clinical challenge is distinguishing TBM from other forms of meningitis with similar presentations.
- What evidence to resolve it: A comparative study including patients with viral and bacterial meningitis to test the specificity of the identified radiomic signatures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the bone and corpus callosum regions truly lack distinct TBM markers, or does the PAG-Classifier fail to capture their relevant features?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study concludes these regions "lack distinctive patterns" after achieving F1 scores below 50%, but this may be a limitation of the specific feature extraction method (eigen decomposition of pixel arrays) rather than the biology.
- Why unresolved: The failure to classify based on these regions contrasts with the hypothesis that they contain visual markers; the small sample size makes it difficult to distinguish between a lack of signal and a failure of the algorithm.
- What evidence to resolve it: Analysis of these regions using alternative, potentially non-linear feature extraction methods (e.g., deep learning) to determine if discriminative information is present but inaccessible to the current graph-based method.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=52) limits generalizability and increases overfitting risk despite feature reduction.
- Single-center dataset with no external validation; performance may not transfer to other populations or scanners.
- ROI annotation protocol lacks detail; reproducibility depends on precise manual delineation which may vary across raters.

## Confidence
- **High**: T1w MRI analysis can distinguish TBM patients from healthy controls in the interpeduncular cistern region; radiomics features outperform PAG-Classifier on this task.
- **Medium**: PAG-Classifier graph construction and eigen decomposition logic is sound; region-specific performance differences (cistern vs bone/corpus callosum) are reproducible within dataset.
- **Low**: Claims about T1w being superior to T2/FLAIR for TBM detection lack comparative validation; generalizability to other TBM subtypes or stages is untested.

## Next Checks
1. **External Validation**: Test PAG-Classifier and radiomics models on an independent TBM dataset from a different center or scanner manufacturer to assess robustness.
2. **Ablation Studies**: Remove or permute graph construction steps (e.g., edge weight threshold, number of eigenvectors) and radiomics features to quantify contribution of each component.
3. **Clinical Feature Integration**: Compare classification performance with and without clinical features (e.g., CSF findings, symptoms) to assess incremental value of MRI-based methods.
