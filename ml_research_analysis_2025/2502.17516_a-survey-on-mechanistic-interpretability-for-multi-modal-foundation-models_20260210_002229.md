# A Survey on Mechanistic Interpretability for Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.17516
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17516
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of mechanistic interpretability methods for multimodal foundation models, introducing a three-dimensional taxonomy and identifying key research gaps

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines mechanistic interpretability approaches for multimodal foundation models (MMFMs), including vision-language models and text-to-image diffusion models. The authors propose a three-dimensional taxonomy categorizing research by model family, interpretability techniques, and applications. They find that while LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with moderate modifications, multimodal models present unique challenges such as interpreting visual embeddings in human-understandable terms. The survey identifies that interpretability applications like hallucination mitigation and model editing remain underdeveloped in multimodal models compared to language models, highlighting critical research gaps and future directions.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review of mechanistic interpretability research for multimodal foundation models, systematically categorizing existing work using a three-dimensional framework. They analyzed contrastive and generative vision-language models, as well as text-to-image diffusion models, examining how interpretability techniques from the LLM domain transfer to multimodal settings. The survey involved synthesizing findings from 40+ references to identify patterns, challenges, and research gaps across different model families and interpretability approaches.

## Key Results
- LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with moderate modifications
- MMFMs present novel challenges like interpreting visual embeddings in human-understandable terms
- While interpretability aids downstream tasks, applications like hallucination mitigation and model editing remain underdeveloped in multimodal models compared to language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a systematic framework for understanding mechanistic interpretability in multimodal settings, bridging the gap between established LLM interpretability techniques and emerging multimodal architectures. The three-dimensional taxonomy enables researchers to identify relationships between different approaches and their applications, while the comprehensive literature review reveals both transferable insights and domain-specific challenges. This structured approach helps clarify which interpretability methods are most promising for multimodal contexts and where novel techniques are needed.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mechanistic interpretability**: Understanding how neural networks compute outputs through component analysis; needed to establish baseline knowledge for interpreting model behavior, quick check: review circuit analysis methods
- **Multimodal foundation models**: Models handling multiple input/output modalities (text, image, etc.); essential for understanding the unique challenges in cross-modal interpretability, quick check: examine CLIP architecture
- **Cross-modal alignment**: Mapping representations between different modalities; critical for understanding how visual and textual information interact in multimodal models, quick check: analyze attention patterns in vision-language models
- **Visual embedding interpretability**: Making visual representations understandable to humans; necessary for bridging the gap between abstract visual features and human concepts, quick check: study feature visualization techniques
- **Contrastive learning in multimodal models**: Training models to associate related pairs across modalities; important for understanding how multimodal models learn semantic relationships, quick check: examine loss functions in CLIP-like models

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Vision encoder (CNN/transformer) -> Cross-modal projection -> Language model (decoder/transformer) -> Output generation, where cross-modal projection includes attention mechanisms and alignment layers.

**Critical path**: Input processing -> Feature extraction (vision/text) -> Cross-modal attention and alignment -> Representation fusion -> Output generation, with interpretability applied at each stage to understand information flow.

**Design tradeoffs**: Depth vs. interpretability (deeper models harder to interpret), resolution vs. abstraction (fine-grained features vs. high-level concepts), computational cost vs. insight quality, and generalization of interpretability methods across model architectures.

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistent cross-modal attention patterns, misaligned feature representations, hallucinated visual concepts, and poor feature attribution to specific input regions or tokens.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Apply activation patching to identify critical components in cross-modal attention layers
2. Use feature visualization to map visual embeddings to human-understandable concepts
3. Perform ablation studies on cross-modal alignment layers to measure impact on interpretability quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in multimodal mechanistic interpretability, including: how to effectively interpret visual embeddings in human-understandable terms, what specialized techniques are needed beyond adapted LLM methods, how to scale interpretability approaches to larger multimodal models, and how to develop applications like hallucination mitigation and model editing that are currently underdeveloped in multimodal contexts.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy structure may have overlapping classifications requiring further clarification
- Limited empirical comparisons between adapted LLM methods and specialized multimodal approaches
- The survey acknowledges the field is nascent, potentially limiting generalizability of findings
- Does not fully explore technical barriers in adapting interpretability methods to multimodal architectures

## Confidence

**Medium confidence**:
- LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with moderate modifications
- Interpretability applications like hallucination mitigation remain underdeveloped in multimodal models
- Claims about research gaps reflect actual technical limitations vs. lack of exploration

**High confidence**:
- Interpreting visual embeddings in human-understandable terms presents novel challenges
- Cross-modal alignment difficulties are well-supported by literature

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of adapted LLM interpretability methods versus specialized multimodal approaches on benchmark tasks

2. Perform ablation studies to determine which components of multimodal interpretability methods contribute most to understanding model behavior

3. Develop and evaluate new metrics specifically designed to assess the quality of multimodal interpretability results, particularly for cross-modal feature attribution and alignment visualization
