# YRC-Bench: A Benchmark for Learning to Coordinate with Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09583
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09583
- Authors: Mohamad H. Danesh; Nguyen X. Khanh; Tu Trinh; Benjamin Plaut
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces YRC-Bench, a benchmark for training agents to know when to request help from experts in novel environments without expert interaction during training

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces YRC-Bench, a benchmark for training agents to know when to request help from experts in novel environments without expert interaction during training. The authors propose a simulated validation approach that creates a weakened novice policy and uses the original novice as a simulated expert to predict test performance. They evaluate 10 learning methods across 19 diverse environments, finding that no single method consistently outperforms others, and the performance gap between current methods and an oracle remains substantial. The analysis reveals that improving the policy proposer (which generates candidate coordination policies) offers more potential for performance gains than improving the validator.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a simulated validation approach that addresses the challenge of evaluating expert-leveraging agents without requiring expert interaction during training. The method creates a weakened novice policy and uses the original novice as a simulated expert to predict test performance. This approach allows for evaluating coordination policies in novel environments while avoiding the need for real expert interactions during training. The benchmark evaluates 10 learning methods across 19 diverse environments, including tasks with different characteristics such as discrete/continuous action spaces, varying numbers of agents, and different reward structures.

## Key Results
- No single learning method consistently outperforms others across all 19 benchmark environments
- Substantial performance gap remains between current methods and an oracle baseline
- Improving the policy proposer offers more potential for performance gains than improving the validator

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The simulated validation approach works by creating a proxy environment where the original novice policy serves as a stand-in for the expert. This allows evaluation of coordination strategies without requiring actual expert interaction during training, which is crucial for real-world deployment where expert time is limited. The weakened novice policy serves as a controlled test environment that captures the essential challenges of novel environments while remaining tractable for evaluation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Expert-Novice Coordination**: Understanding when and how novices should request help is fundamental to human-AI collaboration. Quick check: Can the system identify coordination opportunities in novel environments without prior expert interaction?
- **Policy Evaluation without Expert Feedback**: The ability to evaluate coordination policies without real expert interaction is crucial for scalable deployment. Quick check: Does the simulated validation approach accurately predict real-world performance?
- **Multi-agent Learning**: The benchmark spans environments with varying numbers of agents, testing the ability to coordinate in complex multi-agent scenarios. Quick check: Can methods generalize across different team sizes and compositions?
- **Novel Environment Adaptation**: The core challenge is adapting to environments not seen during training. Quick check: How well do methods transfer to completely unseen task configurations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> Novice Policy -> Weakened Novice -> Simulated Expert -> Validation Framework -> Policy Proposer -> Coordination Policy

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from environment specification through novice policy generation to validation. The weakest link is typically the policy proposer, as identified in the analysis. The validation framework must accurately simulate expert behavior to provide meaningful feedback to the policy proposer.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark trades complete realism for experimental tractability. Using simulated experts instead of real ones enables large-scale evaluation but may miss subtle expert behaviors. The 19 environments balance diversity with computational feasibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include over-reliance on novice policy (failing to recognize when expert help is needed), poor policy generation (weak proposer), and inaccurate validation predictions (weak validator). The benchmark can identify which component is failing based on performance patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run all 10 methods on a simple environment (e.g., MountainCar) to establish baseline performance
2. Test the simulated validation approach by comparing predictions against oracle performance in a controlled setting
3. Evaluate policy proposer vs. validator performance separately by disabling one component at a time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Expert assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios where experts have limited capabilities or incomplete knowledge
- Simulation-based validation may not accurately predict performance of stronger novice policies in novel environments
- Benchmark is limited to simulated environments, potentially missing real-world complexities

## Confidence

**High confidence in experimental methodology**: The extensive evaluation across 19 environments using 10 methods provides robust empirical evidence for the findings.

**Medium confidence in simulated validation approach**: While theoretically justified, the assumption that weakened novices can simulate expert behavior may not generalize to all real-world scenarios.

**Medium confidence in policy proposer vs. validator analysis**: The conclusion that improving the policy proposer offers greater gains is compelling but based on limited analysis of specific methods.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world expert evaluation**: Conduct experiments with human experts to validate whether the simulated validation approach accurately predicts performance in real-world scenarios.

2. **Generalization to novel domains**: Evaluate the benchmark and learning methods on a wider range of domains, including those with different characteristics (e.g., continuous action spaces, partial observability, or non-stationary environments).

3. **Scalability analysis**: Investigate the scalability of the benchmark and learning methods to larger, more complex environments with increased state and action spaces.
