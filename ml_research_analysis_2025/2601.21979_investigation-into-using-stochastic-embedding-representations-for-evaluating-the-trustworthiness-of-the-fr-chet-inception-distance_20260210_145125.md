# Investigation into using stochastic embedding representations for evaluating the trustworthiness of the Fréchet Inception Distance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21979
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21979
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Monte Carlo dropout can provide uncertainty estimates that correlate with FID reliability

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification techniques can help assess the trustworthiness of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), a metric used to evaluate synthetic image quality. The authors use Monte Carlo dropout to compute predictive variance in both FID values and feature embedding representations from an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K. They find that predictive variance in FID generally correlates with the extent to which test data is out-of-distribution relative to the training set, suggesting it may indicate when FID is less effective. The predictive variance in embeddings did not show consistent correlation. The study provides insights into how uncertainty quantification can be used to evaluate generative models and establish trust in high-stakes applications.

## Method Summary
The authors investigate using Monte Carlo dropout to compute predictive variance as a measure of uncertainty in FID calculations. They apply dropout at inference time on an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K to generate multiple stochastic embeddings for both real and generated images. From these stochastic embeddings, they calculate both the standard FID score and the variance across Monte Carlo samples. The key insight is that if predictive variance correlates with how out-of-distribution the test data is, it could serve as a diagnostic tool for when FID may be unreliable. The authors evaluate this approach across multiple test distributions with varying degrees of similarity to the training data, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases.

## Key Results
- Predictive variance in FID values correlates with the extent to which test data is out-of-distribution relative to training data
- This correlation suggests predictive variance may indicate when FID is less effective as an evaluation metric
- Predictive variance in feature embeddings did not show consistent correlation with OOD detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

## Foundational Learning

**Monte Carlo dropout**: A Bayesian approximation method that uses dropout at inference time to generate multiple stochastic predictions, providing uncertainty estimates. Needed to create stochastic embeddings for variance calculation. Quick check: Verify dropout rate and number of Monte Carlo samples used.

**Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: A metric that compares the statistics of feature embeddings from real and generated images using a pre-trained Inception network. Needed as the target metric whose trustworthiness is being evaluated. Quick check: Confirm the feature layer used for FID calculation.

**Predictive variance**: The variance across multiple stochastic predictions, used here as a proxy for uncertainty. Needed to quantify reliability of both FID scores and individual embeddings. Quick check: Verify variance calculation method across Monte Carlo samples.

**Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection**: The task of identifying data that differs significantly from training distribution. Needed as ground truth for evaluating whether predictive variance correlates with FID reliability. Quick check: Confirm OOD datasets and similarity metrics used.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Real images -> InceptionV3 with MC dropout -> Stochastic embeddings -> FID calculation; Generated images -> InceptionV3 with MC dropout -> Stochastic embeddings -> FID calculation

Critical path: Image input → InceptionV3 feature extraction with MC dropout → Embedding variance calculation → FID score calculation → Variance correlation analysis

Design tradeoffs: Using a fixed pre-trained InceptionV3 provides consistency but may limit adaptability to different domains; MC dropout provides uncertainty estimates but increases computational cost

Failure signatures: High predictive variance without corresponding poor FID performance suggests the uncertainty measure may not be capturing relevant aspects of distribution shift

First experiments:
1. Calculate baseline FID and predictive variance on in-distribution test set
2. Compare predictive variance across multiple OOD test distributions
3. Evaluate correlation between predictive variance and known distribution similarity metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Monte Carlo dropout's effectiveness for assessing FID reliability specifically remains uncertain
- Limited set of test distributions used, generalizability to other domains unclear
- Relationship between predictive variance and FID effectiveness may be more complex than simple correlation

## Confidence

High confidence: The observation that predictive variance in FID correlates with OOD extent for the tested datasets

Medium confidence: The claim that this correlation suggests predictive variance can indicate when FID is less effective

Low confidence: The assertion that predictive variance in embeddings did not show consistent correlation, given the limited exploration of different embedding layers or alternative UQ methods

## Next Checks

1. Test the correlation between predictive variance and FID reliability across a broader range of image distributions and generative models, including non-medical domains

2. Compare Monte Carlo dropout with alternative uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., ensembling, deep ensembles) for assessing FID trustworthiness

3. Investigate whether the relationship between predictive variance and FID effectiveness holds when using different feature extraction networks beyond InceptionV3, such as EfficientNet or ResNet variants
