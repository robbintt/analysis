# MATP-BENCH: Can MLLM Be a Good Automated Theorem Prover for Multimodal Problems?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.06034
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06034
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Current MLLMs struggle with symbolic reasoning and formal proof construction in multimodal theorem proving

## Executive Summary
MATP-BENCH introduces a novel multimodal automated theorem proving benchmark to evaluate whether Multimodal Large Language Models can serve as effective automated theorem provers. The benchmark contains 1056 multimodal theorems from high school to competition-level mathematics, formalized in three major proof assistants (Lean 4, Coq, Isabelle). Experiments with six advanced MLLMs reveal that while these models show promise in handling visual-mathematical integration, they struggle significantly with symbolic reasoning and constructing correct formal proofs, indicating substantial room for improvement in this domain.

## Method Summary
The MATP-BENCH benchmark was constructed by collecting multimodal mathematical problems across three difficulty levels (high school, university, competition) and formalizing them in three major proof assistants. The evaluation methodology involves providing MLLMs with both the problem statement and any necessary visual components, then assessing their ability to generate valid formal proofs in the target system. The benchmark evaluates three key capabilities: visual perception of mathematical diagrams, mathematical reasoning to identify proof strategies, and symbolic manipulation to construct rigorous formal proofs. Six state-of-the-art multimodal language models were tested across this benchmark to establish baseline performance.

## Key Results
- MLLMs achieved limited success in solving multimodal theorem proving problems, with performance varying significantly across mathematical domains
- Visual perception and basic mathematical reasoning showed moderate success, but symbolic manipulation for formal proof construction emerged as the primary bottleneck
- Performance degraded substantially on university and competition-level problems compared to high school problems, indicating difficulty scaling with problem complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MATP-BENCH works by creating a standardized evaluation framework that isolates the three critical components of multimodal theorem proving: visual perception, mathematical reasoning, and symbolic manipulation. By formalizing problems in multiple proof assistants and controlling for problem difficulty levels, the benchmark enables systematic assessment of MLLMs' capabilities across different aspects of automated theorem proving. The multimodal nature of the problems requires models to integrate information from both visual and textual sources, mimicking real-world mathematical problem-solving scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Integration**: Combining visual and textual information for problem understanding
*Why needed*: Mathematical theorems often contain diagrams, geometric figures, or other visual elements essential for proof construction
*Quick check*: Ability to correctly interpret mathematical diagrams and extract relevant information

**Formal Proof Construction**: Generating rigorous, verifiable proofs in formal systems
*Why needed*: Automated theorem proving requires precise, machine-checkable proofs rather than informal reasoning
*Quick check*: Producing syntactically correct and logically valid proofs in Lean 4, Coq, or Isabelle

**Mathematical Reasoning**: Identifying proof strategies and logical connections
*Why needed*: Understanding problem structure and selecting appropriate proof techniques
*Quick check*: Correctly identifying relevant theorems, axioms, and proof strategies for given problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Problem Statement + Visual Components → MLLM → Formal Proof Output
**Critical Path**: Visual Perception → Mathematical Reasoning → Symbolic Manipulation → Proof Generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: General-purpose MLLMs vs. specialized theorem-proving architectures; trade-off between model flexibility and proof correctness guarantees
**Failure Signatures**: 
- Visual perception failures manifest as incorrect diagram interpretation
- Reasoning failures appear as inappropriate proof strategy selection
- Symbolic manipulation failures result in syntactically incorrect or logically invalid proofs
- Integration failures occur when models cannot combine visual and textual information effectively

**First Experiments**:
1. Test MLLMs on purely textual mathematical problems to isolate visual perception component
2. Evaluate model performance on simplified proofs with step-by-step guidance
3. Compare performance across different proof assistants to identify system-specific challenges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small scale with only 1056 problems may not capture full diversity of real-world theorem proving
- Evaluation focuses on three formal systems (Lean 4, Coq, Isabelle), potentially limiting generalizability
- Uses general-purpose MLLMs without architectural modifications specifically designed for theorem proving

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Current MLLMs struggle with symbolic reasoning and formal proof construction
**Medium confidence**: Benchmark representativeness and difficulty calibration across mathematical domains
**Medium confidence**: Identified bottlenecks, though relative contribution of perception, reasoning, and symbolic manipulation remains unclear

## Next Checks

1. Expand benchmark diversity by including additional formal systems and more varied problem types, particularly from applied mathematics domains
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate relative contribution of perception, reasoning, and symbolic manipulation failures by testing MLLMs on subsets requiring different skill combinations
3. Evaluate specialized architectures or fine-tuned models designed specifically for theorem proving to establish baseline performance improvements over general-purpose MLLMs
