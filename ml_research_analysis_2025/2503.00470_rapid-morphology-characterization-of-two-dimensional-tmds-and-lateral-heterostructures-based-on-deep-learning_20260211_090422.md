# Rapid morphology characterization of two-dimensional TMDs and lateral heterostructures based on deep learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.00470
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00470
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Deep learning-based YOLO models achieve >94.67% accuracy for rapid optical characterization of 2D TMDs and lateral heterostructures.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a deep learning approach for rapid morphological characterization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and lateral heterostructures using optical microscopy. The method employs YOLO models for instance segmentation and object detection, achieving high accuracy in identifying materials, shapes, and thickness variations. A key innovation is the use of transfer learning to enhance model performance across related characterization tasks within the same material system. The approach demonstrates strong generalization across different magnifications and environmental conditions, with potential applications in autonomous material screening and synthesis optimization.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models with instance segmentation capabilities to identify and characterize 2D materials from optical microscopy images. The system uses transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights from heterostructure segmentation tasks when training on related characterization tasks (e.g., thickness classification). Models are trained on datasets of 180 heterostructure images, 50 shape images, and 50 thickness images, with data augmentation techniques expanding the training sets. The approach includes a real-time inference pipeline using MSS screen capture and OpenCV display, enabling rapid analysis of optical microscopy images at 20×-100× magnification.

## Key Results
- YOLO models achieve over 94.67% accuracy in identifying materials and morphological features
- Transfer learning improves performance by 2.08% in detection mAP50-90 and 3.90% in mask segmentation mAP50-90 for MoS2 thickness classification
- Increasing model complexity (YOLOv8n→s→m) improves mask segmentation mAP50-90 by 21.37% with larger models
- Real-time inference system processes optical microscopy images with strong anti-interference capabilities across different magnifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Transfer learning improves model performance for related characterization tasks within the same material system, but provides limited benefit across different materials.
- **Mechanism:** Pre-trained weights from heterostructure segmentation encode low-level visual features (edge detection, contrast patterns) that transfer to thickness classification tasks on MoS2. This reduces early training loss and accelerates convergence. However, material-specific optical signatures (color, interference fringes) do not transfer across chemically distinct systems like MoS2→WTe₂.
- **Core assumption:** Visual features in optical microscopy images share common structures across tasks involving the same base material.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Results] "After 600 epochs, the transfer learning model led by 2.08% in detection boundary box mAP50-90 and 3.90% in mask segmentation mAP50-90."
  - [Results] "Transfer learning was also conducted on the WTe2 thickness dataset... where it did not significantly improve performance compared to the original model."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on autonomous microscopy and LLM extraction, not transfer learning specifically.
- **Break condition:** Transfer learning benefits degrade when source and target materials have fundamentally different optical signatures or synthesis-induced morphologies.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Instance segmentation (vs. classification-only) enables simultaneous material identification, shape quantification, and area measurement from single optical images.
- **Mechanism:** YOLO-seg models output both bounding boxes and pixel-wise masks, allowing downstream computation of geometric properties (area ratios, shape classification). The mask head learns to delineate material boundaries at pixel level while the detection head provides class labels.
- **Core assumption:** Material boundaries in optical images correspond to physically meaningful morphological features detectable at the resolution of the microscope.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Results] "By analyzing the recognized boundary boxes, the area proportions of each shape can be calculated. For example... triangles account for 17.60% of the image area, while hexagons cover 4.86%."
  - [Figure 4] Shows simultaneous detection of multiple shapes with confidence scores and instance-level segmentation.
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration; neighbor papers do not address instance segmentation for morphology quantification.
- **Break condition:** Fails when material boundaries are below optical resolution, or when contrast between regions is insufficient for segmentation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Increasing model complexity (depth/width) improves segmentation accuracy, particularly for higher IoU thresholds (mAP50-90), at the cost of inference speed.
- **Mechanism:** Larger YOLO variants (n→s→m) have more parameters and feature maps, enabling finer-grained feature extraction. This primarily benefits mask segmentation precision at high overlap thresholds, where small boundary errors are penalized heavily.
- **Core assumption:** The training dataset contains sufficient examples to avoid overfitting as model capacity increases.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Results] "YOLOv8s-seg shows a 21.37% improvement compared to YOLOv8n-seg" in mAP50-90 for mask segmentation.
  - [Results] "The average improvement in mAP50-90 is 17.46% with larger model sizes."
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Symbolic regression for defect interactions" notes neural networks yield high accuracy but have drawbacks—consistent with tradeoff observation.
- **Break condition:** Diminishing returns or overfitting when model capacity exceeds dataset diversity or annotation quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Instance Segmentation vs. Semantic Segmentation**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses YOLO-seg which outputs per-instance masks, not just per-class pixel labels. Critical for counting and measuring individual flakes.
  - **Quick check question:** If two MoS₂ triangles overlap partially in an image, would semantic segmentation give you the count? (Answer: No—it would label all MoS₂ pixels identically.)

- **Concept: Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** The core contribution leverages pre-trained heterostructure models to bootstrap thickness classification. Understanding what transfers (low-level features) vs. what doesn't (material-specific signatures) is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model pre-trained on MoS₂ heterostructures help with MoS₂ thickness but not WTe₂ thickness? (Answer: Optical signatures differ; shared features are material-specific.)

- **Concept: mAP at Different IoU Thresholds (mAP50 vs. mAP50-90)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper reports both; mAP50-90 is stricter and more sensitive to boundary precision, which is why larger models show greater improvements on this metric.
  - **Quick check question:** If a predicted mask has 55% overlap with ground truth, would it contribute to mAP50? To mAP75? (Answer: Yes to mAP50; no to mAP75.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Optical Microscope → MSS Screen Capture → YOLOv8/v11-seg Model → [Detection Head] → Bounding boxes + class labels → [Segmentation Head] → Instance masks → Post-processing → Area/shape quantification → OpenCV Display (real-time)

- **Critical path:**
1. Data annotation (Roboflow, YOLO format with masks)
2. Data augmentation (mosaic, flip, brightness—see Figure S12)
3. Model selection (n/s/m tradeoff)
4. Training with class-aware loss (box + mask + classification)
5. Validation on held-out test set
6. Deployment via MSS + OpenCV pipeline

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Model size:** n-model = fastest (50 FPS possible), m-model = highest accuracy but slower
  - **Transfer learning source:** Same material = beneficial; different material = marginal gain
  - **Magnification:** Model generalizes across 200×–1000× but requires diverse training data

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low mAP50-90 with high mAP50 → masks too coarse, increase model size
  - Good validation but poor real-time inference → lighting/magnification mismatch; augment training data
  - Transfer learning shows no improvement → source material too different; train from scratch

- **First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline replication:** Train YOLOv11n-seg and YOLOv11m-seg on the heterostructure dataset; compare mAP50-90. Confirm ~17% improvement with larger model as reported.
2. **Transfer learning ablation:** Fine-tune heterostructure-pretrained model on MoS₂ thickness (thin/thick/bulk) vs. training from scratch. Measure epochs to convergence and final mAP.
3. **Noise robustness test:** Add Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise (20%) to validation images; verify detection accuracy remains stable (per Figure 7). If degradation >5%, augment training with noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can transfer learning methodologies be adapted to improve performance when transferring knowledge between significantly different material systems (e.g., MoS2 to WTe2)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly note that while transfer learning enhanced performance within the same material system (MoS2 heterostructures to MoS2 thickness), it "did not significantly improve performance" when applied across different materials (MoS2 to WTe2).
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the limitation but does not propose or test architectural changes to overcome the feature discrepancy between disparate material classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of a domain-adaptation technique that shows statistically significant accuracy improvements when transferring weights from MoS2 datasets to WTe2 or other dissimilar 2D materials.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can deep learning models trained on optical microscopy data accurately predict quantitative physical properties (e.g., exact bandgap, carrier mobility) rather than just morphological classifications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on classifying "thin, thick, and bulk" or identifying shapes, but the conclusion suggests the method opens new avenues for characterizing "other physical properties" without demonstrating quantitative regression of continuous physical variables.
- Why unresolved: Current results are limited to categorical instance segmentation and object detection; the correlation between optical features and precise quantitative electronic properties remains unproven in this framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training a regression model that outputs continuous numerical values for properties like conductivity or bandgap and validating these predictions against standard metrology techniques like Hall measurements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the YOLO-based instance segmentation approach effective for characterizing vertical heterostructures, or is it limited to lateral configurations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly focuses on "MoS2-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures" and identifies vertical heterostructures as a distinct class in the introduction, but the experimental results and model validation are restricted exclusively to lateral systems.
- Why unresolved: Vertical stacking involves different optical interference patterns and contrast dependencies compared to lateral interfaces, and it is unverified if the current training set or model logic applies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the trained model or a transfer-learned variant to a dataset of CVD-grown vertical heterostructures and evaluating the detection accuracy against cross-sectional TEM or Raman depth profiling.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (180 heterostructure images, 50 shape images, 50 thickness images) raises overfitting concerns
- Transfer learning benefits limited to same material system; cross-material applicability unproven
- Real-time inference requires specific optical setups (20×-100× magnification range) and lighting conditions
- Performance on lower contrast or noisy images lacks systematic evaluation across diverse noise profiles

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** YOLO-seg performance metrics and real-time inference capability (well-validated with controlled datasets)
- **Medium confidence:** Transfer learning benefits (limited to MoS₂ system, single material pair tested)
- **Medium confidence:** Anti-interference claims (based on limited noise simulations, no real-world environmental testing)

## Next Checks
1. Test transfer learning across chemically distinct materials (e.g., MoS₂→WSe₂) to quantify generalization limits
2. Evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution microscopy conditions (different magnifications, lighting, contrast levels)
3. Assess computational efficiency and memory requirements for deployment on edge devices or lower-spec GPUs
