# Generative AI for Industrial Contour Detection: A Language-Guided Vision System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00284
- Reference count: 37
- Achieves CAD-level precision for contour detection in industrial remnant materials using language-guided generative vision system

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate contour detection in industrial remnant materials, where traditional computer vision methods struggle due to noise, variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions. The authors propose a three-phase language-guided generative vision system designed to achieve CAD-level precision for contour detection. The system combines preprocessing and augmentation, contour generation using a fine-tuned pix2pix conditional GAN, and refinement via multimodal vision-language modeling with standardized natural language prompts. GPT-image-1 is integrated within a VLM-guided workflow and human-in-the-loop chatbot interface for iterative refinement. Experimental results on proprietary FabTrack datasets show significant improvements in edge continuity and geometric alignment.

## Method Summary
The proposed system implements a three-phase approach: preprocessing and augmentation of industrial images, contour generation using a fine-tuned pix2pix conditional GAN architecture, and refinement through multimodal vision-language modeling. The system employs standardized natural language prompts for guidance and integrates GPT-image-1 within a VLM-guided workflow. A human-in-the-loop chatbot interface enables iterative refinement of generated contours. The method is evaluated on proprietary FabTrack datasets containing industrial remnant material images under various imaging conditions.

## Key Results
- GPT-image-1 achieved SSIM of 0.9044 versus 0.6525 for Gemini 2.0 Flash in structural accuracy
- Lower LPIPS values demonstrated superior perceptual quality for GPT-image-1
- Significant improvements in edge continuity and geometric alignment compared to traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages the complementary strengths of generative adversarial networks and vision-language models to overcome limitations of traditional computer vision approaches in industrial settings. The pix2pix conditional GAN effectively learns to generate precise contours from noisy, variable input images by mapping them to clean edge representations. The integration of language guidance through standardized prompts enables fine-grained control over the generation process, while the VLM-guided workflow ensures semantic consistency with industrial requirements. The human-in-the-loop interface provides iterative refinement capability that addresses edge cases and maintains quality standards.

## Foundational Learning
- Pix2pix conditional GANs: Essential for learning image-to-image translation from noisy industrial inputs to clean contour outputs; quick check involves verifying the generator-discriminator architecture and loss functions
- Vision-language models: Required for integrating natural language guidance with visual processing; quick check includes validating prompt standardization and multimodal alignment
- SSIM and LPIPS metrics: Standard for evaluating structural similarity and perceptual quality in image generation; quick check involves confirming proper implementation and comparison methodology
- Human-in-the-loop systems: Critical for industrial applications requiring iterative refinement; quick check includes assessing interface design and iteration tracking
- CAD-level precision requirements: Defines the accuracy standards for industrial contour detection; quick check involves understanding tolerance specifications and measurement protocols

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Image Preprocessing -> pix2pix GAN -> VLM Refinement -> Human-in-the-loop Chatbot -> Final Contour Output

**Critical Path:** The most critical path runs through the pix2pix GAN generation and VLM refinement stages, as these directly determine contour quality and accuracy. The preprocessing stage must effectively normalize and augment industrial images to enable robust GAN performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system trades computational efficiency for precision by incorporating iterative human refinement, which may limit real-time deployment but ensures quality. The choice of GPT-image-1 over other VLMs prioritizes structural accuracy over raw generation speed.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include GAN collapse on highly irregular contours, VLM misinterpretation of complex natural language prompts, and human operator inconsistency during iterative refinement. These manifest as geometric distortions, semantic misalignment, or variable output quality.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate pix2pix GAN performance on synthetic industrial contour datasets with known ground truth
2. Test VLM refinement accuracy using standardized prompts across diverse industrial material types
3. Evaluate human-in-the-loop iteration consistency with multiple operators on identical input images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on proprietary FabTrack datasets, limiting external validation and reproducibility
- Only compares GPT-image-1 against a single baseline (Gemini 2.0 Flash) without broader benchmarking
- Claims of "CAD-level precision" remain unverified against actual CAD models or physical ground truth measurements

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The technical feasibility of combining generative models with language guidance for contour detection

**Medium confidence:** The superiority of GPT-image-1 over Gemini 2.0 Flash based on limited comparison

**Low confidence:** Claims about practical industrial deployment readiness and CAD-level precision without external validation

## Next Checks

1. External validation using publicly available industrial datasets or third-party testing to verify performance claims beyond proprietary FabTrack data

2. Comparative evaluation against traditional edge detection algorithms and other generative models to establish relative advantages in industrial contexts

3. Real-world deployment testing measuring processing time, resource requirements, and consistency of human-in-the-loop refinement across multiple operators
