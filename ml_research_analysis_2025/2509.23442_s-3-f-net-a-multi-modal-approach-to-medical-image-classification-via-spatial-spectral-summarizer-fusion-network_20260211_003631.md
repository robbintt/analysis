# S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.23442
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23442
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** S$^3$F-Net consistently outperforms spatial-only baselines and achieves state-of-the-art competitive results on four medical imaging datasets.

## Executive Summary
S$^3$F-Net is a dual-domain deep learning framework designed for multi-class medical image classification. It simultaneously learns spatial and spectral features by integrating a novel SpectralFilter layer that applies learnable filters directly to the Fourier spectrum via efficient element-wise multiplication. Evaluated across diverse modalities (dermoscopy, MRI, radiography, ultrasound), S$^3$F-Net consistently outperforms strong spatial-only baselines, with accuracy improvements up to 5.13%. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on BRISC2025 (98.76%) and Chest X-Ray Pneumonia (93.11%), even surpassing pre-trained models in some cases.

## Method Summary
S$^3$F-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture where the spatial branch uses a VGG-style CNN and the spectral branch employs a SpectralFilter layer to process the full Fourier spectrum. The SpectralFilter applies learnable complex weights via element-wise multiplication after FFT, then reconstructs via IFFT, achieving a global receptive field instantaneously. The SpectraNet branch summarizes these global frequency-domain features through depthwise separable convolutions and a dense bottleneck. Fusion is performed via concatenation or bilinear pooling, with the optimal strategy being task-dependent—bilinear for complex datasets like BRISC and HAM10000, concatenation for texture-dominant tasks like Chest X-Ray and BUSI. The model is trained using TensorFlow with Adam optimizer, balanced class weights, and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling.

## Key Results
- S$^3$F-Net achieves accuracy improvements up to 5.13% over spatial-only baselines across four medical imaging datasets.
- The framework attains state-of-the-art competitive results: 98.76% accuracy on BRISC2025 and 93.11% on Chest X-Ray Pneumonia.
- Optimal fusion strategy is task-dependent: Bilinear Fusion excels on complex datasets (BRISC, HAM10000), while Concatenation Fusion is superior for texture-dominant tasks (Chest X-Ray, BUSI).
- Explainability analysis reveals the model dynamically adjusts reliance on each branch based on pathology.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SpectralFilter layer's ability to apply learnable filters directly to the full Fourier spectrum via efficient element-wise multiplication allows the model to capture global frequency-domain features instantaneously. This global receptive field complements the local spatial features learned by the CNN, providing a more comprehensive representation of the input. The task-dependent fusion strategy further optimizes performance by selecting the most appropriate method for combining these complementary features based on dataset characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fourier Transform in Deep Learning:** Essential for understanding how the SpectralFilter layer processes frequency-domain information. *Why needed:* Core to the paper's innovation. *Quick check:* Verify FFT/IFFT operations are correctly implemented in the custom layer.
- **Complex Weight Parameterization:** Required for implementing learnable complex filters. *Why needed:* The SpectralFilter uses complex multiplication. *Quick check:* Ensure real and imaginary parts are parameterized independently and combined correctly.
- **Bilinear Fusion vs. Concatenation:** Understanding these fusion strategies is crucial for optimal model configuration. *Why needed:* The paper shows task-dependent performance differences. *Quick check:* Compare validation metrics when switching between fusion types on a given dataset.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Input -> Spatial Branch (VGG-style CNN) -> Features A; Input -> SpectralFilter -> SpectraNet (Depthwise Separable Conv + Dense Funnel) -> Features B; Features A + B -> Fusion Layer (Concatenation/Bilinear) -> Classification Head.
- **Critical Path:** SpectralFilter Layer (FFT → Complex Weight Multiplication → IFFT) → SpectraNet Summarizer → Fusion → Classification.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** The SpectralFilter provides global context but adds computational overhead; the 4-dimensional bottleneck in SpectraNet prevents overfitting but may limit representational capacity.
- **Failure Signatures:** Spectral branch overfitting on small datasets (e.g., BUSI); complex gradient issues if real/imag parts aren't handled correctly by the optimizer.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Implement and test SpectralFilter layer with synthetic data. 2) Train spatial-only baseline for comparison. 3) Compare Bilinear vs. Concatenation Fusion on a single dataset to validate task-dependency claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Dynamic Fusion Strategy Selection:** Can an architectural mechanism be developed to dynamically select the optimal fusion strategy (Concatenation vs. Bilinear) during training or inference? The current work determines the optimal fusion strategy via separate experimental trials rather than a unified, adaptive model.
- **Adaptation to Dense Prediction Tasks:** Is the S$^3$F-Net architecture effective as a backbone for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation? The paper only evaluates the framework on classification tasks and it's unclear if global spectral features aid or hinder pixel-level localization required for segmentation.
- **Predictive Dataset Characteristics:** Can specific dataset characteristics quantitatively predict the optimal fusion strategy a priori? The paper concludes that the optimal fusion strategy is "task-dependent" but this distinction is currently based on post-hoc empirical observation rather than a predictive theory.

## Limitations
- The absence of batch size specification and exact ReduceLROnPlateau hyperparameters introduces minor variability in reproduction.
- The optimal fusion strategy is currently determined empirically through separate trials rather than being learned adaptively within the model.
- The explainability analysis relies on visualization techniques that are not detailed in the methodology section.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core architectural innovation (SpectralFilter layer, SpectraNet branch, dual-branch fusion) and overall training framework are clearly described.
- **Medium Confidence:** Task-dependent fusion strategy is supported by results but could benefit from more theoretical grounding.
- **Medium Confidence:** Explainability analysis is compelling but methodology details are limited.

## Next Checks
1. **SpectralFilter Implementation Verification:** Rigorously test the custom SpectralFilter layer with synthetic data to confirm correct FFT, learnable complex weight application, and IFFT operations. Validate gradient flow through the complex parameters.
2. **Architectural Scaling Analysis:** Re-evaluate the model's performance when varying the bottleneck dimension in SpectraNet (e.g., 4, 8, 16). This will quantify the sensitivity to the claimed 4-dimensional output and its role in preventing overfitting.
3. **Cross-Modal Ablation Study:** Conduct a systematic ablation study isolating the contribution of the spectral branch across all four datasets. This will provide stronger empirical support for the task-dependent fusion strategy and clarify the marginal gains from spectral features on texture-dominant tasks.
