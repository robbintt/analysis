# CyberCScope: Mining Skewed Tensor Streams and Online Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.00871
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00871
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: CyberCScope achieves higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable summaries of intrusions.

## Executive Summary
CyberCScope addresses real-time anomaly detection in cybersecurity systems that generate high-order tensor streams containing both categorical and skewed continuous attributes. The core innovation is OP-SiFi decomposition, which performs hybrid decomposition over skewed infinite and finite dimensional spaces by modeling skewed continuous attributes with Gamma distributions while maintaining categorical attribute relationships. The method identifies distinct time-evolving patterns called regimes to detect multiple types of intrusions and characterize their behaviors. Experiments on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that CyberCScope achieves higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines (MemStream and CubeScope) while providing interpretable summaries of intrusions.

## Method Summary
CyberCScope processes cybersecurity tensor streams by performing OP-SiFi decomposition using collapsed Gibbs sampling. The method models continuous attributes with Gamma distributions and categorical attributes with Multinomial distributions, then uses MDL-based compression to identify regime patterns over time. Each tensor is evaluated against existing regimes, and when encoding cost exceeds a threshold, a new regime is created. Anomaly scores are computed as negative log-likelihood under the majority regime, enabling real-time detection of intrusions like FTP-BruteForce and DoS attacks. The approach scales linearly with event volume and processes each tensor in real-time windows.

## Key Results
- CyberCScope achieves higher ROC-AUC and PR-AUC than CubeScope and MemStream on CI'17 and CCI'18 datasets
- Successfully detects various intrusion types including FTP-BruteForce and DoS attacks with characteristic behavioral patterns
- Scales linearly with event volume and processes each tensor within real-time window τ

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modeling continuous attributes with Gamma distributions captures right-skewed cybersecurity data better than Gaussian assumptions or discretization.
- Mechanism: The OP-SiFi decomposition models each continuous attribute with a Gamma distribution parameterized by shape and rate, while categorical attributes use Multinomial distributions. This hybrid approach preserves the continuous nature of attributes like flow duration rather than forcing discretization.
- Core assumption: Cybersecurity continuous attributes (flow duration, packet sizes, inter-arrival times) exhibit right skewness that is structurally meaningful for distinguishing attack patterns from normal traffic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "modeling skewed continuous attributes with Gamma distributions while maintaining categorical attribute relationships"
  - [section 2.1.1] "The gamma distribution is right-skewed when the shape parameter is small, whereas it becomes more symmetrical as the shape parameter increases"
  - [corpus] Related tensor anomaly work (Robust Spatiotemporally Contiguous Anomaly Detection) uses tensor decomposition but does not specifically address skewed continuous attributes—weak direct corpus validation for the Gamma choice specifically.
- Break condition: If continuous attributes follow approximately Gaussian distributions or have complex multimodal shapes not captured by single Gamma parameters, the skewness modeling advantage degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Regime-based temporal segmentation identifies distinct attack types by detecting when tensor patterns shift to configurations not explainable by existing regimes.
- Mechanism: The MDL-based compression evaluates whether new tensors fit existing regimes or require regime creation/switching. When encoding cost using existing regimes exceeds the cost of introducing a new regime, the method identifies a pattern shift, enabling multi-type anomaly detection.
- Core assumption: Different attack types (FTP-BruteForce, DoS variants) produce statistically distinct tensor patterns that persist over time segments rather than appearing as isolated outliers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifies distinct time-evolving patterns called regimes to detect multiple types of intrusions and characterize their behaviors"
  - [section 2.1.3] "we choose a regime from Θ ∪ {θc} so that the additional encoding cost is minimized"
  - [section 3, Q1] "Regime #2 and Regime #5 correspond to FTP-BruteForce. Regime #8 coincided with Dos Hulk"
  - [corpus] Adaptive-GraphSketch uses temporal decay for evolving patterns but does not use regime-based segmentation—limited corpus validation.
- Break condition: If attacks produce transient, non-persistent patterns or if normal traffic is highly multimodal, regime boundaries become noisy and false positives increase.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using the majority regime as the "normal" baseline provides adaptive anomaly scoring that adjusts to concept drift without labeled data.
- Mechanism: Anomaly score is computed as negative log-likelihood under the regime with maximum total segment length (|S⁻¹_r|). This allows the baseline to shift as stream characteristics evolve, rather than comparing to a fixed historical model.
- Core assumption: The majority of streaming data represents normal behavior, and anomalies are minority patterns—a standard but potentially fragile assumption in adversarial settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1.4] "we employ the majority regime in the entire tensor stream X as a baseline. This approach can adaptively adjust the baseline to reflect the changes in the nature of the data streams"
  - [section 3, Figure 5] CyberCScope achieves higher ROC-AUC and PR-AUC than CubeScope and MemStream on both CI'17 and CCI'18 datasets
  - [corpus] CALM framework addresses concept drift in anomaly detection through LLM mediation—corroborates drift adaptation importance but not the majority-regime mechanism specifically.
- Break condition: If adversaries can gradually poison the stream or if attacks become the dominant pattern, the majority baseline shifts to include anomalous behavior.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probabilistic Tensor Decomposition
  - Why needed here: OP-SiFi decomposes tensors into component matrices (A, B) representing latent factors across categorical and continuous dimensions; understanding factor interpretation is essential for explaining detected anomalies.
  - Quick check question: Given a 3rd-order tensor with dimensions (time, port, flow duration), what would each component's A and B matrices represent?

- Concept: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle
  - Why needed here: Regime identification and model complexity control rely on MDL—understanding encoding cost tradeoffs (model cost vs. data cost) explains when new regimes are created.
  - Quick check question: If a new tensor Xc can be encoded using an existing regime with data cost 100 bits, or a new regime with model cost 80 bits plus data cost 10 bits, which would MDL select?

- Concept: Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for Latent Variable Models
  - Why needed here: Component inference uses collapsed Gibbs sampling to estimate latent component assignments z_{t,j}; understanding convergence and mixing is critical for production tuning.
  - Quick check question: In collapsed Gibbs sampling, what variables are "collapsed out" versus explicitly sampled, and how does this affect computational complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - OP-SiFi Decomposition Module -> Regime Management -> MDL Compression Evaluator -> Anomaly Scorer

- Critical path:
  1. Receive tensor Xc (window τ of events)
  2. Run OP-SiFi decomposition → θc (dominant computation)
  3. Evaluate encoding cost against existing regimes
  4. Update/assign regime, compute anomaly score
  5. Return score and updated compact description C'

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Component count K: Higher K captures finer patterns but increases decomposition cost and risk of overfitting
  - Window size τ: Larger windows provide more stable estimates but increase detection latency
  - Assumption: Paper uses τ = 4 minutes (CI'17) or 30 seconds (CCI'18)—domain-specific tuning required

- Failure signatures:
  - Score stuck at high values: Majority regime assumption violated; normal behavior shifted but regime hasn't adapted
  - Excessive regime creation: MDL threshold too permissive; may indicate hyperparameter issues or concept drift not matching regime structure
  - Slow processing: Gibbs sampling not converging within τ; may need fewer samples or smaller K

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce accuracy comparison: Run CyberCScope, CubeScope, and MemStream on CI'17 dataset; verify ROC-AUC and PR-AUC gaps match paper
  2. Ablation on distribution choice: Replace Gamma with Gaussian for continuous attributes; measure accuracy degradation to validate skewness modeling contribution
  3. Latency stress test: Feed tensors at increasing rates; identify throughput ceiling where processing time exceeds τ window

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the OP-SiFi decomposition maintain high accuracy when continuous attributes exhibit distributions incompatible with the Gamma assumption, such as left-skew, heavy zero-inflation, or multimodality?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 2.1.1 explicitly models continuous attributes using Gamma distributions, justifying this choice solely by the prevalence of right-skewness in the data (Figure 1).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the method's robustness against continuous data that violates the Gamma assumption or compare it against more flexible distribution models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on synthetic or real-world data containing non-Gamma continuous distributions, or an ablation study using alternative distributions (e.g., log-normal, mixtures).

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the manual selection of the number of components ($K$) impact detection performance, and could a non-parametric approach improve adaptability?
- Basis: [inferred] In Section 3, the number of components is manually fixed to $K=48$ for all experiments without providing a sensitivity analysis or automatic selection mechanism.
- Why unresolved: A fixed $K$ may fail to capture the complexity of evolving attack landscapes where the optimal number of latent trends is unknown and variable.
- What evidence would resolve it: A parameter sensitivity analysis showing performance variance across different $K$ values, or an extension of the model that infers $K$ dynamically from the stream.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model dynamically adapt its finite dimensional space to incorporate previously unseen categorical values (e.g., new ports or protocols) without retraining?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 2 defines the input tensor using a discrete finite dimensional space $U_m$, implying a static set of categorical units.
- Why unresolved: Real-world cybersecurity streams are dynamic; the paper does not explain how the method handles out-of-vocabulary categorical attributes that emerge during streaming.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on a dataset with concept drift introducing new categorical labels, demonstrating the model's ability to update the compact description $C$ to include new dimensions.

## Limitations
- Distribution assumption sensitivity: The Gamma distribution assumption for continuous attributes may not hold for all cybersecurity datasets
- Regime stability assumption: The method assumes persistent attack patterns rather than isolated events
- Majority baseline fragility: In adversarial environments where attacks dominate the stream, the majority regime assumption breaks down

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Linear scalability claims, real-time processing capability, and superior ROC-AUC/PR-AUC performance over baselines on specified datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of Gamma distribution modeling for skewed attributes, MDL-based regime detection accuracy, and interpretability of detected patterns
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to datasets with different attribute distributions, performance under concept drift beyond observed attack types, and robustness to adversarial stream manipulation

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution robustness test**: Systematically replace Gamma distributions with alternative skewed distributions (Weibull, log-normal) and measure accuracy degradation across multiple datasets
2. **Adversarial majority baseline stress test**: Generate synthetic streams where attack events gradually outnumber normal traffic; evaluate how quickly anomaly detection degrades and whether regime switching can recover
3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Vary K (component count), τ (window size), and Gibbs sampling iterations to identify stability bounds and optimal configurations for different data volumes
