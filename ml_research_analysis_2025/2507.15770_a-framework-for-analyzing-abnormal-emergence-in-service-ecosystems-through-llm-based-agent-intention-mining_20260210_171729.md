# A Framework for Analyzing Abnormal Emergence in Service Ecosystems Through LLM-based Agent Intention Mining

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15770
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15770
- Reference count: 28
- Introduces EAMI framework for analyzing abnormal emergence in service ecosystems using LLM-based agent intention mining

## Executive Summary
This paper presents EAMI, a novel framework that analyzes abnormal emergence in service ecosystems through LLM-based agent intention mining. The method employs dual-perspective thought tracking (bounded and perfect rationality) to capture agent intentions, then applies clustering and temporal analysis to reveal emergent phenomena. Experiments on a multi-agent O2O delivery system and Stanford AI Town demonstrate EAMI's effectiveness in explaining emergence through intention dynamics. The framework successfully identified involution patterns in delivery riders and election dynamics in AI Town, with ablation studies confirming the value of its dual-perspective approach.

## Method Summary
EAMI bridges microscopic agent behaviors to macroscopic system emergence through a multi-stage process. The framework first employs LLM-based intention mining to extract agent intentions using dual-perspective thought tracking that captures both bounded and perfect rationality perspectives. These intentions are then processed through clustering algorithms to identify behavioral patterns and groups. Temporal analysis is applied to track how these patterns evolve over time, revealing emergent phenomena. The approach integrates qualitative reasoning about agent motivations with quantitative pattern analysis to provide interpretable explanations for complex system behaviors.

## Key Results
- Successfully identified involution patterns in delivery riders through intention dynamics analysis
- Revealed election dynamics in Stanford AI Town using temporal clustering of agent intentions
- Ablation studies confirmed the dual-perspective approach adds significant explanatory value to emergence detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to interpret agent decision-making processes, which are often opaque in multi-agent systems. By tracking intentions through dual rationality perspectives, EAMI captures both realistic constrained decision-making and theoretical optimal behaviors, creating a rich representation of agent motivations. The clustering component groups similar intention patterns, while temporal analysis reveals how these groups form, dissolve, or evolve, providing mechanistic insight into emergence formation.

## Foundational Learning
- Agent intention modeling: Understanding how agents make decisions in service ecosystems is crucial for predicting emergent behaviors. Quick check: Can the model accurately predict agent choices in novel scenarios?
- Bounded rationality concepts: Real agents operate under constraints, making this perspective essential for realistic modeling. Quick check: Does the framework account for information asymmetry and cognitive limitations?
- Temporal pattern recognition: Emergence unfolds over time, requiring methods to track dynamic changes. Quick check: Can the system identify phase transitions or tipping points in emergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Collection -> LLM Intention Mining -> Dual Rationality Extraction -> Clustering -> Temporal Analysis -> Emergence Visualization

Critical Path: The LLM intention mining stage is the bottleneck, as it requires significant computational resources for each agent interaction. The clustering and temporal analysis stages follow in parallel, feeding into the emergence visualization component.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes interpretability over raw computational efficiency. Using LLMs for intention mining provides rich semantic understanding but at higher computational cost compared to rule-based approaches. The dual-perspective approach increases accuracy but doubles the processing requirements.

Failure Signatures: The system may fail when LLM interpretation is inconsistent across agent types, when clustering algorithms cannot distinguish subtle intention differences, or when temporal analysis misses non-linear emergence patterns.

First Experiments:
1. Test LLM intention extraction consistency across multiple runs with identical inputs
2. Validate clustering results against known agent groupings in synthetic datasets
3. Measure emergence detection accuracy on controlled environments with ground truth emergence patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation relies on synthetic multi-agent environments rather than real-world service ecosystems
- Computational scalability challenges when applied to large-scale service ecosystems with thousands of agents
- Limited discussion of potential biases introduced by LLM-based intention extraction

## Confidence
- Effectively explaining emergence through intention dynamics: Medium
- Robustness of intention mining component across diverse ecosystem configurations: Low
- Computational scalability for real-world deployment: Low

## Next Checks
1. Deploy EAMI on a real-world service platform (e.g., food delivery or ride-sharing service) to validate findings against ground truth operational data
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying LLM model parameters and prompt engineering to assess robustness of intention extraction
3. Evaluate computational performance and memory requirements on progressively larger agent populations to establish scalability bounds
