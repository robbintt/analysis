# DisorientLiDAR: Physical Attacks on LiDAR-based Localization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12595
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel adversarial attack framework that physically removes critical LiDAR keypoints using NIR-absorbing materials to degrade autonomous vehicle localization accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DisorientLiDAR, a physical adversarial attack framework targeting LiDAR-based localization in autonomous vehicles. The attack identifies critical keypoints in point cloud registration models and strategically removes them using near-infrared absorbing materials, creating "voids" in the LiDAR data that degrade pose estimation. The framework was evaluated on three state-of-the-art registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) using KITTI dataset, showing significant degradation in registration accuracy when removing top-K keypoints. In real-world scenarios, the attack induces noticeable localization drift in the Autoware autonomous driving platform. Physical attacks using near-infrared absorptive materials successfully replicated the observed effects in KITTI data, demonstrating the attack's practicality and effectiveness across different LiDAR configurations.

## Method Summary
DisorientLiDAR operates by first analyzing LiDAR registration models to identify high-contribution keypoints through confidence score extraction. The attack then simulates the removal of these keypoints by zeroing out points within spherical regions around them, evaluating the impact on registration accuracy metrics (RRE, RTE, RR). For physical attacks, the framework uses VL Flock Sheet material that absorbs near-infrared light (905 nm wavelength) to create actual voids in the point cloud. The attack targets the top-K most confident keypoints identified through model-specific saliency analysis, with K ranging from 1-10 positions and cloth sizes of 0.3-3 meters. The method was tested on KITTI odometry sequences 08-10 and validated in real-world scenarios using Velodyne VLP-16 and VLS-128 LiDAR sensors.

## Key Results
- Top-K removal strategy degrades registration accuracy across all three tested models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) with K=1-10 positions
- Physical NIR-absorbing materials successfully create voids in point clouds that replicate digital attack effects
- Attack effectiveness varies with LiDAR configuration: 64-line and 128-line sensors show significant degradation, while 16-line sensors exhibit baseline performance issues
- Real-world deployment in Autoware platform demonstrates induced localization drift when victim vehicle passes through attack zones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: High-Contribution Keypoint Denial
- **Claim:** If deep learning-based registration models assign disproportionate weight to specific geometric correspondences (keypoints), then removing these high-contribution points may force the model to rely on sub-optimal or outlier matches, degrading pose estimation.
- **Mechanism:** The attack identifies the Top-K points with the highest confidence scores (saliency) in the feature extraction network. By physically occluding these specific regions, the input distribution shifts, leaving the registration algorithm (e.g., RANSAC or SVD solvers) with low-confidence or inconsistent correspondences to calculate the transformation matrix.
- **Core assumption:** The victim model relies on a sparse set of discriminative keypoints for rigid transformation alignment rather than dense global matching.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...reverse-engineering localization models... identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them..." [section 4.1] "...removal of the K most confident points... can degrade the quality of keypoints used for RANSAC."
- **Break condition:** If the registration model utilizes a dense, global matching strategy where thousands of weak features contribute equally.

### Mechanism 2: Near-Infrared (NIR) Signal Attenuation
- **Claim:** If a material absorbs the specific wavelength of light emitted by the LiDAR sensor (typically 905 nm), the sensor will fail to generate point cloud data for the covered region, effectively creating a "blind spot" or digital void.
- **Mechanism:** The physical attack uses "VL Flock Sheet," a material with high absorption rates in the NIR-SWIR spectrum. When placed over a target object, it prevents the reflection of laser pulses back to the LiDAR receiver, causing the point cloud to lack data in that specific geometric region.
- **Core assumption:** The LiDAR operates on a specific frequency (905 nm) and lacks robustness against non-reflective or absorptive surfaces in its detection pipeline.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.3] "...capable of absorbing the infrared light (905 nm)... achieves > 95% light absorption..." [fig 5] Shows the resulting "void" in the point cloud when the object is covered.
- **Break condition:** If the vehicle employs multi-spectral sensors (e.g., thermal or radar) to cross-verify geometry, or if the LiDAR uses a wavelength outside the material's absorption range (e.g., 1550 nm).

### Mechanism 3: Angular Robustness of Occlusion
- **Claim:** If the occluding material is deployed with a wide field of absorption or a planar geometry that catches the beam at various angles, the attack remains effective even if the physical placement is not perfectly aligned with the sensor's line of sight.
- **Mechanism:** The attack does not require precise perpendicular alignment. The material creates a persistent void in the scan as long as it intercepts the LiDAR beams, which is critical for moving vehicles where the relative angle changes rapidly.
- **Core assumption:** The physical ambush tool (cloth) is sufficiently large and oriented such that it intercepts the LiDAR beams within a reasonable angular deviation (tested up to ±30°).
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 6.1] "...attack remains effective even with a ±30° angular misalignment..."
- **Break condition:** If the vehicle's trajectory deviates significantly from the predicted path, moving the "key region" out of the occluder's shadow entirely.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Point Cloud Registration (Scan Matching)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core function being attacked. You must understand how algorithms (like ICP, NDT, or HRegNet) align two 3D point clouds to compute a vehicle's movement (pose).
  - **Quick check question:** How does a "keypoint-based" registration method differ from a "keypoint-free" (dense) method in terms of robustness to point removal?

- **Concept:** Adversarial Saliency / Gradient-based Attribution
  - **Why needed here:** The attacker needs a strategy to pick *which* points to hide. Understanding how to identify "high-contribution" points via reverse-engineering (saliency maps) is central to the "Top-K" strategy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would removing the "Top-K" points be more effective than removing random points (Rand-K) or the least important points (Min-K)?

- **Concept:** LiDAR Physics (Time-of-Flight & Reflectivity)
  - **Why needed here:** To understand the physical defense limitations. You need to know why a black cloth "disappears" to a LiDAR (no return signal) but is visible to a camera.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does absorbing the laser pulse result in a void rather than a "black" point in the data structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Attacker Intelligence -> Saliency Oracle -> Physical Layer (VL Flock Sheet) -> Victim Stack (LiDAR Sensor -> Preprocessing -> Registration Network -> Pose Graph)
- **Critical path:** The attack succeeds only if the physical occlusion covers the *predicted* high-saliency region *and* the victim's registration algorithm fails to find sufficient alternative correspondences in the remaining scan.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Cloth Size (L):** Larger cloth increases hit probability (robustness to trajectory variance) but increases visual detectability (stealth trade-off)
  - **K (Number of Regions):** Higher K degrades localization faster but requires more physical setup effort
  - **Model Specificity:** Keypoints differ between models (HRegNet vs D3Feat); a universal attack requires finding "common" keypoints, which is currently a manual limitation
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Sudden Void:** A rectangular region of zero points appearing in an area where the HD map expects geometry
  - **Pose Jumps:** A sudden discontinuity or "drift" in the estimated trajectory relative to the HD map, specifically when the vehicle enters the ambush zone
  - **Multi-modal Disagreement:** A divergence between LiDAR-based localization and GPS/IMU readings
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Digital Simulation (KITTI):** Implement the Top-K removal logic in software to determine the sensitivity of your specific registration model to keypoint loss before attempting physical deployment
  2. **Material Validation:** Verify the NIR absorption rate of the ambush material against your specific LiDAR wavelength (e.g., 905 nm vs 1550 nm) to ensure it generates a true "void" and not just noise
  3. **Angular Tolerance Test:** Place the material at various angles (0°, 15°, 30°) to the sensor to verify the physical robustness of the occlusion, ensuring the attack survives slight positioning errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can a universal keypoint selection model effectively target diverse registration architectures without requiring model-specific extraction?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state in Section 6.3 that "obtaining keypoints for each point cloud registration model, respectively is quite demanding" and propose future work to "propose a model that can select universally high-contribution keypoints."
- **Why unresolved:** Currently, the DisorientLiDAR framework requires extracting high-contribution points separately for HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer, making real-world deployment labor-intensive.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A cross-model attack strategy that uses a single set of identified keypoints to significantly degrade registration accuracy across all tested architectures.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How robust are multi-sensor fusion defenses against adaptive attackers utilizing multi-spectrum adversarial camouflage?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] Section 6.3.2 proposes a defense detecting "suspicious objects" (black fabric) via vision-LiDAR consistency, but assumes the attacker will not adapt the visual appearance of the occlusion.
- **Why unresolved:** An adaptive adversary could utilize materials that maintain LiDAR absorption properties while mimicking the visual texture of the background (e.g., adversarial patches), thereby bypassing the proposed consistency checks.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of defense performance against physical attacks using materials optimized to evade both LiDAR sensors and visual semantic segmentation simultaneously.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does temporal environmental dynamics impact the stability of high-contribution keypoints over time?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] Section 3.4 describes a scenario where attackers deploy materials and wait, and Section 6.3 notes the constraint of inaccessible keypoints, but the paper assumes static geometric features.
- **Why unresolved:** In real-world dynamic environments, "key regions" (e.g., foliage, parked cars) may change or move between the attacker's reconnaissance phase and the victim's arrival, rendering the pre-selected ambush locations ineffective.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal experiments measuring the decay in attack success rates as the time interval between keypoint identification and physical deployment increases.

## Limitations
- Attack effectiveness is limited by the victim model's reliance on discriminative keypoints; dense matching strategies may be more resilient
- Physical attack requires precise knowledge of high-contribution regions and their spatial relationship to the attack deployment location
- The occlusion material creates visible voids in point clouds that could be detected by anomaly detection systems

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The fundamental mechanism of NIR signal attenuation by absorptive materials is well-established physics and the digital simulation results showing Top-K removal degradation are methodologically sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** The transferability of the attack across different registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) suggests the vulnerability is architectural rather than model-specific, but the exact conditions for cross-model effectiveness require further validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The practical stealth of the attack in real-world deployment scenarios, given that the occlusion material creates a visible "void" in the point cloud that could be detected by anomaly detection systems.

## Next Checks

1. **Dense Matching Robustness:** Test the attack against registration models that use dense global matching (e.g., NDT-based methods) to determine if the Top-K vulnerability extends beyond keypoint-based approaches.

2. **Multi-Sensor Fusion Resilience:** Evaluate how sensor fusion systems that combine LiDAR with camera, radar, or IMU data respond to the occlusion attack—does the localization drift persist when multiple modalities are fused?

3. **Real-World Anomaly Detection:** Deploy the attack in a controlled environment with a detection system monitoring for sudden voids or discontinuities in the point cloud to measure false positive rates and determine if the attack can evade such safeguards.
