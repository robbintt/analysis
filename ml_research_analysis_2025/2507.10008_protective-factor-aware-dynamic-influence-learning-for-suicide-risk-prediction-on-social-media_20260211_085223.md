# Protective Factor-Aware Dynamic Influence Learning for Suicide Risk Prediction on Social Media

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.10008
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10008
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposed model achieves up to 0.8911 F-Score on CSSRS-Suicide dataset and 0.6617 F-Score on protective factor-aware dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses suicide risk prediction on social media by developing a novel framework that incorporates both risk and protective factors. The authors recognize that most prior work focuses exclusively on risk factors while ignoring protective factors that could buffer against suicide risk. They introduce a Protective Factor-Aware Dataset and a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures how these factors exert varying influence on risk transitions over time. The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a comprehensive framework for suicide risk prediction that integrates both risk and protective factors through dynamic influence learning. The approach involves constructing a protective factor-aware dataset with annotated posts and subsequent risk levels, then applying a model that learns the fluid relationships between factors and risk transitions. The framework captures temporal dynamics by analyzing how protective and risk factors influence users' suicide risk over time, providing interpretable weights that help clinicians understand suicidal patterns for targeted interventions.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 0.8911 F-Score on CSSRS-Suicide dataset
- Achieves 0.6617 F-Score on the newly constructed protective factor-aware dataset
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models across three datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the dynamic interplay between protective and risk factors rather than treating suicide risk as static. By learning how these factors influence risk transitions over time, the model captures the fluid nature of suicide risk. The incorporation of protective factors provides a more complete picture of a user's mental state, while the interpretable weights enable clinicians to identify meaningful patterns for intervention.

## Foundational Learning
- **Protective factor identification**: Recognizing factors that buffer against suicide risk is essential for comprehensive risk assessment. Quick check: Can the model distinguish between protective and risk factors in annotated data?
- **Dynamic risk transitions**: Suicide risk changes over time based on various influences. Quick check: Does the model capture temporal patterns in risk level changes?
- **Social media behavior analysis**: User posts on platforms like Reddit contain signals about mental state. Quick check: Can the model extract meaningful features from social media text?
- **Interpretability in clinical applications**: Providing weights and patterns that clinicians can understand and act upon. Quick check: Are the model's outputs actionable for mental health professionals?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset Construction -> Dynamic Factor Learning -> Risk Prediction -> Interpretability

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves collecting and annotating social media data, learning dynamic influences of factors on risk transitions, predicting subsequent risk levels, and providing interpretable outputs for clinical use.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades computational complexity for improved accuracy and interpretability. The focus on protective factors adds complexity but provides more comprehensive risk assessment. The interpretability features may slightly reduce predictive power compared to black-box approaches but enable clinical utility.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include overfitting to Reddit-specific patterns, sensitivity to annotation quality for protective factors, and inability to capture long-term risk trajectories beyond available posting history. The model may also struggle with users who don't post frequently enough to establish reliable patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison without protective factors to quantify their contribution, 2) Cross-dataset validation to test generalizability, 3) Ablation study on temporal modeling components to assess their impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small protective factor-aware dataset size may limit generalizability
- Annotation process for protective factors lacks full detail, raising concerns about subjectivity
- Focus on Reddit data may not represent all social media contexts or demographic groups
- Temporal dynamics are limited to available posting history, potentially missing long-term patterns
- Interpretability benefits for clinicians remain to be validated in clinical settings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical framework and methodological approach are well-described and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The performance improvements over baselines are robust, but dependent on dataset characteristics
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretability claims, while promising, lack clinical validation

## Next Checks

1. External validation on independent datasets from different platforms and populations to test generalizability
2. Clinical validation study with mental health professionals to assess the practical utility of interpretable risk factors
3. Ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of protective factors versus risk factors to overall performance
