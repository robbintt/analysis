# Identifying attributions of causality in political text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03214
- Authors: Paulina Garcia-Corral
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: A BERT-based causal language model framework extracts cause-effect pairs from political headlines with >90% F1-score, revealing systematic differences in how actors are framed across conflicts.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a causal language model (CLM) framework for extracting structured cause-effect pairs from political text, specifically news headlines about armed conflicts. The method combines sequence classification and token-level span detection to identify when actors are framed as causal agents versus affected parties. Applied to coverage of the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine wars across three global news outlets, the framework reveals systematic framing differences: Russia is consistently framed as a cause across outlets in Ukraine coverage, while Hamas is framed as an attacker in CNN and Israel as an attacker in Al Jazeera in the Middle East context. The approach achieves high accuracy (F1-scores above 90% for span detection) and offers a scalable, generalizable method for studying causal framing in political discourse.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a two-stage BERT-based pipeline: (1) sequence classification predicts if a headline contains a causal claim, and (2) token-level span detection with IOB2 labels identifies cause and effect spans. The model is fine-tuned on 1,238 human-annotated headlines from three news outlets covering two conflicts, using a semantic definition of causality. For framing analysis, the method extends log-odds ratio calculations to incorporate model probabilities (soft counts) with a Dirichlet prior to stabilize estimates for rare tokens. The framework outputs structured cause-effect pairs that can be aggregated to measure systematic differences in how political actors are framed across sources and conflicts.

## Key Results
- BERT-based causal language model achieves >90% F1-score for span detection of cause and effect spans in political headlines
- Systematic framing differences identified: Russia consistently framed as cause in Ukraine coverage; Hamas framed as attacker in CNN while Israel framed as attacker in Al Jazeera
- Framework successfully extracts structured causal attributions that reveal media bias patterns across three global news outlets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Causal Extraction via BERT Fine-tuning
Fine-tuned BERT models reliably extract structured cause-effect pairs from political headlines through sequence classification and token-level span detection. The two-stage pipeline learns contextual embeddings that capture semantic relationships between cause and effect, even with implicit causal verbs. Performance metrics show 83% accuracy for sequence classification and F1-scores of 92% for Cause and 94% for Effect in span detection.

### Mechanism 2: Log-Odds Ratio with Probabilistic Smoothing for Framing Analysis
Soft counts derived from model probabilities, incorporated into a log-odds ratio framework with an informative Dirichlet prior, quantify systematic causal framing of political actors. This method sums predicted probabilities for each token appearing in cause or effect spans, providing nuanced signals beyond binary predictions. The approach reveals systematic differences in how actors are framed as causal agents versus affected parties.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Anchoring for Discursive Analysis
Grounding statistical analysis in a clear semantic definition of causality enables the method to move beyond keyword counting and capture relational meaning in political discourse. The formal semantic definition guides annotation and training, producing structured outputs that represent specific linguistic relationships rather than just text spans.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer-based Token Classification (NER)**
  - Why needed here: The core technical task of extracting cause and effect spans is a form of Named Entity Recognition (NER). Understanding how models like BERT assign labels to each token is essential for grasping how the CLM works.
  - Quick check question: If a model outputs the token labels `['B-C', 'I-C', 'O', 'B-E', 'I-E']` for the sentence "Sanctions hurt the economy", what are the extracted cause and effect spans?

- **Concept: Log-Odds Ratio with Dirichlet Prior**
  - Why needed here: The paper's primary analytical method for quantifying framing relies on this statistical technique. The prior is critical for handling rare tokens, and understanding it is key to interpreting the results and confidence intervals.
  - Quick check question: Why is a "prior" necessary when calculating log-odds ratios from text data, and what happens to the estimate for a word that appears very few times in the corpus?

- **Concept: Semantic vs. Syntactic Annotation**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly chooses a semantic annotation framework (focusing on meaning) over a syntactic one. This choice fundamentally shapes what the model learns to detect.
  - Quick check question: In the sentence "The policy, due to its harshness, failed," a syntactic analysis might focus on grammatical structure. How would a *semantic* analysis identify the cause and effect?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion & Annotation -> Model Fine-Tuning (Training) -> Inference Pipeline -> Analytical Engine
- **Critical path:** The data annotation phase is most critical. The entire system's validity rests on the quality, consistency, and domain-relevance of human-annotated cause-effect pairs used for fine-tuning.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Encoder vs. Decoder (LLM) Architecture:** BERT (encoder-only) chosen for efficiency and performance on NLP benchmarks, while larger generative models could handle more implicit causality but would be more computationally expensive.
  - **Semantic vs. Syntactic Annotation:** Semantic framework allows capturing meaning-based causality but may be less precise than strict syntactic schemes for certain formal linguistic analyses.
- **Failure signatures:** Systematic bias if span detection shows consistently higher confidence than sequence classification; zero-count artifacts in log-odds analysis indicating sparse data issues rather than absence of framing.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Annotation Size:** Train CLM on progressively smaller subsets (100, 500, 1000 headlines) and evaluate performance to test "modest annotation requirements" claim.
  2. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Fine-tune on one conflict corpus (e.g., Russia-Ukraine) and evaluate zero-shot performance on the other (e.g., Israel-Palestine) to test generalizability.
  3. **Calibration Analysis:** Implement temperature scaling on sequence classification model, then re-run Bland-Altman analysis to see if systematic bias against span model's probabilities can be reduced.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effectively does a causal language model fine-tuned on news headlines generalize to other text genres, such as social media or legislative transcripts?
- Basis in paper: The limitations section states that "the semantics of causal expressions are domain-specific," and explicitly notes that "a model trained on headlines may not generalize well to other text genres."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the framework exclusively on news headlines from three specific outlets, leaving the model's robustness across different rhetorical styles and document lengths untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-domain evaluation where the model trained on headline corpus is applied to different genres (e.g., parliamentary debates or Twitter posts) to compare extraction accuracy against human annotations in those new domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do causal attributions for specific political actors evolve temporally throughout the different stages of an armed conflict?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that "the analysis does not account for temporal variation" and states that systematic differences in media coverage "are likely to emerge due to different stages of each conflict."
- Why unresolved: The presented analysis aggregates data over a 10-month period, obscuring any dynamic shifts in framing that may have occurred as the conflicts progressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Time-series analysis of extracted cause-effect pairs segmented by specific conflict phases to observe variations in log-odds ratios of actor framing over time.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do absolute topic frequencies influence observed causal framing patterns when not controlling for baseline actor prevalence?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that "topic frequency is not controlled for," meaning "comparisons across events are based on absolute frequencies rather than normalized measures."
- Why unresolved: It's unclear if an actor is framed as a "cause" more often simply because they are mentioned more frequently overall, or if the causal attribution is a distinct rhetorical choice relative to their presence in the text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-analysis of log-odds ratios that normalizes causal attribution counts by total token frequency of each actor within each media source to isolate causal framing intensity from mere salience.

## Limitations
- Headline-level annotations may miss nuanced causal relationships that span multiple sentences or require broader context
- Model's calibration shows systematic bias with span detection consistently showing higher confidence than sequence classification
- Framework's ability to capture implicit causal relationships and handle cross-linguistic or cross-cultural variations remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Technical implementation of BERT-based causal extraction pipeline is well-specified and reproducible with clear performance metrics (accuracy >83%, F1 >90% for spans)
- **Medium Confidence:** Log-odds framing analysis using soft counts and Dirichlet priors represents novel contribution but lacks external validation
- **Medium-Low Confidence:** Generalizability claims across different conflict contexts and media outlets are supported by observed patterns but not rigorously tested

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Zero-Shot Transfer:** Fine-tune model on headlines from one conflict and evaluate zero-shot performance on the other conflict to empirically test domain generalizability claims.
2. **Calibration Correction Impact:** Apply temperature scaling to sequence classification model to correct systematic calibration bias, then re-run framing analysis to assess impact on conclusions.
3. **Full-Article vs. Headline Validation:** Select subset of articles with high-confidence causal attributions from headlines and manually verify whether causal relationships identified in headline are supported by full article text.
