## Executive Summary
PLANTOR presents a framework that integrates LLMs with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning for multi-robot tasks. It employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final plan is converted into a Behavior Tree for direct use in ROS2. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible, scalable, and human-understandable planning.

## Method Summary
PLANTOR integrates large language models with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning for multi-robot systems. The framework follows a two-phase knowledge base generation process: first, LLMs parse user requirements into generic knowledge representations; second, these are refined into robot-specific knowledge including action models and resource constraints. A three-step planning procedure then uses this knowledge: temporal sequencing via Prolog depth-first search, MILP optimization for parallel execution and resource allocation, and final conversion to ROS2-compatible Behavior Trees. The approach emphasizes reusability through generic action models and ensures formal correctness through Prolog validation, while maintaining human interpretability throughout the planning process.

## Key Results
- LLMs successfully generate accurate robot-oriented knowledge bases from natural language requirements with only modest human feedback required
- Prolog validation ensures formal correctness of knowledge bases while maintaining explainability of planning decisions
- MILP-based optimization enables efficient parallel task execution and resource allocation across multi-robot systems
- The framework produces executable Behavior Trees directly compatible with ROS2 for real-world deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with the formal rigor of Prolog and the optimization power of MILP solvers. LLMs translate natural language requirements into structured knowledge representations, capturing the semantic understanding needed for complex task specification. Prolog provides a formal foundation for knowledge validation and temporal sequencing, ensuring logical consistency and correctness of the planning problem. MILP optimization then finds efficient execution schedules that respect resource constraints and enable parallel execution. The Behavior Tree conversion bridges high-level planning with low-level robotic execution, creating a complete pipeline from requirements to implementation.

## Foundational Learning

**Prolog for Knowledge Validation**
Why needed: Ensures logical consistency and formal correctness of the knowledge base, preventing planning errors
Quick check: Verify that all facts and rules in the knowledge base pass Prolog syntax and consistency checks

**Mixed-Integer Linear Programming**
Why needed: Optimizes resource allocation and parallel execution while respecting temporal constraints
Quick check: Confirm that the MILP formulation correctly represents the planning problem and produces feasible solutions

**Behavior Trees for Execution**
Why needed: Provides a modular, hierarchical
