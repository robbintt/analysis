# Rao Differential Privacy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17135
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Introduces Rao DP with tighter sequential composition (√(Σθ_i²) vs. Σθ_i) using Rao distance metric from information geometry

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Rao Differential Privacy (Rao DP), a novel privacy definition based on the Rao distance metric rather than divergence measures used in previous definitions. The Rao distance quantifies the dissimilarity between probability densities through a proper metric on the parameter space of statistical models, leveraging information geometry and Riemannian manifolds. The key contribution is showing that Rao DP provides tighter sequential composition than existing definitions, with total budget computed as the square root of the sum of squared individual budgets.

## Method Summary
The method defines privacy through the Rao distance d_R(f_D, f_D') ≤ θ between mechanism outputs on adjacent datasets, where the Rao distance is computed using the Fisher information matrix as a Riemannian metric on the parameter space. For univariate distributions with fixed scale parameters, the Rao distance simplifies to |μ₁ - μ₂|/σ. Sequential composition leverages the Pythagorean theorem on product manifolds, while post-processing immunity follows from the spherical embedding of densities under the square root transformation. The paper demonstrates that standard mechanisms (Laplace, Gaussian, and Generalized Gaussian) satisfy Rao DP with specific calibration requirements.

## Key Results
- Sequential composition under Rao DP follows √(θ₁² + θ₂²) rather than θ₁ + θ₂
- Laplace mechanism satisfies both pure DP (ε) and Rao DP (θ = ε)
- Gaussian mechanism satisfies approximate DP ((ε, δ)) and Rao DP (θ = ε/√(2 log(1.25/δ)))
- Rao DP maintains essential privacy properties like post-processing immunity
- The framework provides a geometric interpretation of privacy guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rao Distance as Privacy Metric
Using a proper Riemannian distance metric instead of divergences yields tighter sequential composition while preserving privacy semantics. The Rao distance treats the parameter space Θ of probability densities as a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information matrix g_ij(θ) = E[∂ln p/∂θ_i · ∂ln p/∂θ_j | θ] as the metric tensor. Privacy is bounded by the geodesic distance d_R(f_D, f_D') ≤ θ between mechanism outputs on adjacent datasets.

Core assumption: The mechanism family admits a closed-form or computable Rao distance; for multivariate Gaussians this is non-trivial (no closed form exists generally).

### Mechanism 2: Pythagorean Composition on Product Manifolds
Sequential composition under Rao DP follows √(θ₁² + θ₂²) rather than θ₁ + θ₂, providing tighter budget accounting for multiple queries. When composing mechanisms f₁,D and f₂,D, the joint density lives on the product manifold P₁ × P₂ with block-diagonal metric [g₁ 0; 0 g₂]. The geodesic distance between product densities is the Euclidean norm of individual distances.

Core assumption: Mechanisms are applied to the same dataset (sequential composition); the Pythagorean structure holds for product manifolds (assumes independence of mechanism outputs conditioned on D).

### Mechanism 3: Post-Processing via Spherical Embedding
Arbitrary deterministic or random transformations of a Rao-DP output do not increase the privacy budget θ. Using the square root transformation p(x) → √p(x), the Rao distance becomes d_R(p₁, p₂) = 2cos⁻¹⟨√p₁, √p₂⟩, embedding densities onto the positive orthant of a sphere. Post-processing functions are contractions in this L² geometry.

Core assumption: The post-processing function φ is measurable and the transformation preserves the spherical embedding structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Differential Privacy Definitions (Pure, Approximate, Rényi)**
  - Why needed here: Rao DP is positioned against divergence-based definitions; understanding the landscape clarifies what "tighter composition" means and why δ-parameters matter.
  - Quick check question: Given a mechanism satisfying (ε, δ)-DP and another satisfying θ-Rao DP with θ = ε/√(2log(1.25/δ)), which has cleaner composition semantics when combining 3 queries?

- **Concept: Riemannian Manifolds and Geodesics**
  - Why needed here: The entire Rao distance framework relies on treating probability densities as points on a manifold with Fisher information as the metric; computing distances requires solving geodesic equations.
  - Quick check question: For a one-parameter exponential family with Fisher information g(θ), what is the Rao distance between θ₁ and θ₂? (Answer: ∫_{θ₁}^{θ₂} √g(θ) dθ along the geodesic.)

- **Concept: Fisher Information Matrix**
  - Why needed here: This is the Riemannian metric tensor; its structure determines the geometry of the parameter space and whether closed-form distances exist.
  - Quick check question: Why does the Laplace distribution with scale σ have Fisher information 1/σ² for the location parameter, and what does this imply for Rao distance scaling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Sensitivity calculator -> Rao distance oracle -> Budget accumulator -> Noise calibrator -> Post-processing wrapper

- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify statistic h and compute its sensitivity Δ
  2. Select mechanism family; verify closed-form Rao distance exists
  3. Calibrate σ given θ and Δ per Theorem 4.4 (Laplace), 4.8 (Gaussian), or 4.12 (Generalized Gaussian)
  4. If multiple queries, accumulate budget via √(Σθ_i²)
  5. Release mechanism output; post-processing is free

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Laplace vs. Gaussian under Rao DP: Laplace satisfies both pure ε-DP and θ-Rao DP with θ=ε; Gaussian satisfies (ε,δ)-DP and θ-Rao DP with θ=ε/√(2log(1.25/δ)). Gaussian avoids δ under Rao DP but requires larger σ for equivalent θ.
  - Closed-form vs. numerical distance: Only one-parameter exponential families and special cases (e.g., univariate Gaussian with fixed σ) have tractable Rao distances. Multivariate settings require approximations.
  - Compatibility: Corollary 4.9 shows equivalence between μ-GDP and θ-Rao DP (θ=μ) for Gaussian mechanisms; this bridges to hypothesis-testing interpretations but is mechanism-specific.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Sensitivity underestimation: If Δ is computed incorrectly, σ is too small, and d_R(f_D, f_D') > θ for some adjacent pair—privacy breach.
  - Wrong distance formula: Using |μ₁-μ₂|/σ for a mechanism where σ varies between D and D' (violates fixed-σ assumption in Theorems 4.2, 4.6, 4.10).
  - Composition across mechanism families: Combining Laplace (θ₁) and Gaussian (θ₂) budgets via √(θ₁²+θ₂²) is valid only if each satisfies Rao DP individually—verify each mechanism's calibration.
  - Support mismatch: If f_D and f_D' have different supports, Rao distance is undefined (page 7 notes this violates standard DP assumptions anyway).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement Laplace Rao-DP with composition: Query the same dataset twice with h₁ (count query, Δ₁=1) and h₂ (sum query, Δ₂=max_value). Set θ₁=θ₂=1, verify total budget = √2 < 2 (pure DP would be 2). Check that released values satisfy the bound.
  2. Compare Gaussian (ε,δ)-DP vs. θ-Rao DP: For a fixed sensitivity Δ and target privacy, compute σ required for (ε=1, δ=10⁻⁵)-DP and for θ-Rao DP with θ derived from the same semantic privacy. Compare utility (variance of noise) and verify Corollary 4.9 holds numerically.
  3. Test post-processing invariance: Apply nonlinear transformations (clipping, normalization, rounding) to Rao-DP outputs; verify d_R(φ(f_D), φ(f_D')) ≤ θ via Monte Carlo estimation when analytical distance is unavailable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper presents a theoretical framework without experimental validation or code implementation.
- Rao distance formulas are provided only for univariate distributions with fixed scale parameters, leaving multivariate and correlated query cases unexplored.
- The relationship between Rao DP and GDP for Gaussian mechanisms is stated but not formally proven beyond special cases.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mathematical framework (Riemannian geometry, Fisher information, product manifold composition) is well-established and correctly applied in the univariate fixed-scale cases.
- **Medium Confidence**: The composition theorem and post-processing immunity follow logically from the geometric interpretation, but verification for complex mechanisms requires computational implementation.
- **Low Confidence**: The utility claims comparing Rao DP to other definitions cannot be validated without empirical studies, particularly for multivariate settings.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the univariate case: Create a simulation comparing noise scales for Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms under Rao DP versus pure/approximate DP for fixed utility targets.
2. Test composition empirically: For k queries with equal budgets, verify that total privacy loss under Rao DP equals √(k × θ²) and is strictly less than k × θ (pure DP).
3. Validate post-processing: Apply nonlinear transformations to Rao-DP outputs and measure the actual Rao distance between transformed distributions on adjacent datasets to confirm it remains bounded by θ.
