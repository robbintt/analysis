# A-MapReduce: Executing Wide Search via Agentic MapReduce

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.01331
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01331
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A-MapReduce achieves 5.11% to 17.50% average Item F1 improvements and 45.8% faster running time versus strong baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of wide search tasks in multi-agent systems, where existing frameworks struggle with large-scale, breadth-oriented retrieval. The authors propose A-MapReduce, a framework inspired by the MapReduce paradigm that reframes wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. By leveraging parallel processing, task-adaptive decomposition, and structured result aggregation, A-MapReduce significantly outperforms existing approaches on five benchmark datasets.

The key innovation lies in treating wide search as a map-reduce problem, where tasks are decomposed into parallel subtasks and results are aggregated intelligently. The framework also incorporates experiential memory to improve query-conditioned task allocation over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A-MapReduce achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing baselines.

## Method Summary
A-MapReduce reframes wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem using a MapReduce-inspired approach. The framework decomposes search tasks into parallel subtasks, distributes them across multiple agents, and aggregates results through a structured process. A key innovation is the experiential memory system that learns from past searches to improve future query-conditioned task allocation. The framework operates in three phases: task decomposition into parallel subtasks, distributed execution across agents, and result aggregation with recomposition. This architecture enables efficient handling of large-scale, breadth-oriented search tasks while maintaining accuracy through intelligent result combination.

## Key Results
- Achieved 5.11% to 17.50% average improvements in Item F1 score across five benchmarks
- Reduced running time by 45.8% compared to strong baseline methods
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on wide search tasks compared to existing multi-agent frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
A-MapReduce works by treating wide search as a parallel processing problem rather than a sequential one. The MapReduce-inspired architecture enables efficient distribution of search subtasks across multiple agents, while the structured aggregation mechanism ensures comprehensive result coverage. The experiential memory component allows the system to learn from past searches, improving task allocation efficiency over time. This combination of parallelization, intelligent decomposition, and learning from experience addresses the fundamental scalability challenges of wide search tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **MapReduce paradigm** - Understanding distributed computing principles for parallel processing of large-scale tasks
- **Multi-agent systems** - Knowledge of agent coordination, communication protocols, and task distribution mechanisms
- **Experiential memory systems** - Understanding how systems learn from past interactions to improve future performance
- **Task decomposition strategies** - Ability to break down complex searches into parallelizable subtasks
- **Result aggregation techniques** - Methods for combining outputs from multiple parallel processes effectively
- **Performance benchmarking** - Skills in designing and executing experiments to compare different approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Task Input -> Decomposition Module -> Agent Pool -> Result Aggregation -> Output

**Critical Path:** The critical path flows from task input through decomposition, where the task is broken into parallel subtasks, distributed to the agent pool for execution, then results are aggregated and recomposed into final output. The experiential memory system operates alongside this path, learning from completed searches to improve future task allocation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades some complexity in task decomposition and coordination for significant gains in parallel execution efficiency. Memory overhead for experiential learning is balanced against improved task allocation over time. The structured aggregation approach may introduce some latency compared to simpler methods but provides more comprehensive results.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur when task decomposition is suboptimal, leading to uneven agent workloads. Memory system errors or corruption could impact task allocation quality. Communication bottlenecks between agents may reduce parallelization benefits. Poor aggregation strategies could result in incomplete or redundant results.

**First Experiments:**
1. Benchmark decomposition efficiency on synthetic wide search tasks with varying complexity
2. Test agent pool scalability with increasing numbers of parallel subtasks
3. Evaluate experiential memory learning rate and impact on task allocation accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness heavily dependent on quality of experiential memory system, which lacks detailed explanation of indexing and maintenance
- Experimental evaluation limited to five specific benchmarks, potentially not representing full diversity of real-world scenarios
- Performance improvements appear context-dependent with variability across different benchmark types

## Confidence
- **High:** MapReduce-inspired decomposition and aggregation mechanisms
- **Medium:** Task-adaptive allocation strategy effectiveness
- **Low:** Long-term memory system scalability and efficiency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contribution of experiential memory versus core MapReduce architecture
2. Test A-MapReduce on additional benchmark datasets representing different wide search task types
3. Evaluate system performance and memory efficiency over extended periods with continuous operation
