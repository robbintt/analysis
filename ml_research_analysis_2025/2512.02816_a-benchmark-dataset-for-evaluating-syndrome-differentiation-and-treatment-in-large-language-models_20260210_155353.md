# A benchmark dataset for evaluating Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment in large language models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02816
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Introduces TCM-BEST4SDT, a 600-question benchmark dataset evaluating LLMs in Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome differentiation and treatment across four tasks

## Executive Summary
The study presents TCM-BEST4SDT, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Large Language Models' capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine's Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment (SDT). The benchmark addresses a critical gap in comprehensive evaluation tools for LLMs in real-world clinical scenarios by providing a 600-question dataset covering four distinct tasks. A specialized reward model quantifies prescription-syndrome congruence, and the evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms to assess model performance objectively. Expert-led data annotation ensures high quality and annotation consistency throughout the benchmark development process.

## Method Summary
The study introduces TCM-BEST4SDT, a clinical case-based benchmark dataset with 600 questions designed to evaluate LLMs in Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome differentiation and treatment. The benchmark covers four tasks: TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. A specialized reward model quantifies prescription-syndrome congruence, and the evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms: selected-response, judge model, and reward model evaluation. Expert-led data annotation ensures high quality and annotation consistency. Experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs (both general and TCM domains) demonstrate TCM-BEST4SDT's effectiveness in objectively reflecting model performance differences.

## Key Results
- TCM-BEST4SDT successfully distinguishes performance differences between 15 tested LLMs
- TCM domain LLMs often lag behind general models due to smaller parameter scales and limited clinical scenario corpora
- The three-mechanism evaluation framework (selected-response, judge model, and reward model) provides comprehensive assessment capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of four evaluation tasks and the integration of multiple assessment mechanisms. The reward model specifically addresses the unique challenge of evaluating prescription-syndrome congruence in TCM, while the judge model and selected-response mechanisms provide complementary evaluation perspectives. Expert-led annotation ensures the dataset reflects real clinical complexity and maintains high quality standards.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment (SDT)** - Why needed: Forms the core domain knowledge being evaluated; Quick check: Understanding of pattern identification and treatment principle formulation in TCM

2. **Clinical case-based evaluation methodology** - Why needed: Enables realistic assessment of LLM performance in practical medical scenarios; Quick check: Familiarity with case-based reasoning and clinical decision support systems

3. **Reward model design for prescription-syndrome congruence** - Why needed: Provides quantitative metric for evaluating TCM treatment recommendations; Quick check: Understanding of alignment metrics and reward modeling in LLM evaluation

4. **Expert annotation quality control** - Why needed: Ensures benchmark reliability and clinical validity; Quick check: Knowledge of inter-annotator agreement metrics and annotation consistency measures

5. **Multi-task evaluation framework** - Why needed: Captures comprehensive LLM capabilities beyond single-domain expertise; Quick check: Understanding of multi-task learning and evaluation methodologies

6. **Comparative analysis of general vs. domain-specific LLMs** - Why needed: Reveals performance gaps and informs model development strategies; Quick check: Familiarity with transfer learning and domain adaptation in NLP

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Collection -> Expert Annotation -> Reward Model Development -> Evaluation Framework -> Performance Analysis

Critical path: The essential sequence involves collecting diverse clinical cases, annotating them with expert consensus, developing the prescription-syndrome congruence reward model, and then using the integrated evaluation framework to assess LLM performance across all four tasks.

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes clinical realism and expert validation over scale, resulting in 600 carefully curated questions rather than a larger but potentially less reliable dataset. The three-mechanism evaluation framework adds complexity but provides more comprehensive assessment compared to single-method approaches.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include selection bias in the 600-question subset from 1000 candidates, over-reliance on expert judgment without quantitative inter-annotator agreement metrics, and the possibility that the reward model may not capture all nuances of TCM clinical reasoning.

First experiments to run:
1. Inter-annotator agreement analysis on 100 random questions to quantify annotation consistency
2. Correlation analysis between reward model scores and independent expert evaluations on held-out test cases
3. Ablation study varying parameter scales while controlling for fine-tuning data quality in TCM domain LLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The 600-question dataset was selected from 1000 candidates based on "high-quality and difficulty," potentially introducing selection bias
- Limited detail on inter-annotator agreement metrics beyond stating "annotation consistency" was ensured
- The study does not control for factors beyond parameter count when comparing general and TCM domain LLMs, such as fine-tuning quality or inference optimization

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dataset's comprehensive coverage of four evaluation tasks and the general methodology for benchmark construction
- **Medium confidence**: The comparative performance results between general and TCM domain LLMs
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the three-mechanism evaluation framework (selected-response, judge model, and reward model)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement analysis on a random subset of 100 questions to quantify annotation consistency and identify potential biases in the expert evaluation process.

2. Test the reward model's reliability by comparing its prescription-syndrome congruence scores against independent expert evaluations on a held-out test set of 50 cases not used in the original dataset.

3. Perform ablation studies on the TCM domain LLMs by controlling for parameter scale while varying fine-tuning data quality and quantity to isolate whether performance gaps are due to model size or training data limitations.
