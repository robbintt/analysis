# ENTRA: Entropy-Based Redundancy Avoidance in Large Language Model Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07123
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Reduces reasoning output length by 37-53% while maintaining or improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ENTRA, a training framework that reduces redundant reasoning in large reasoning models by suppressing overthinking behaviors. The method uses a bidirectional importance estimation (BIE) to identify critical tokens, then applies entropy-based rewards over low-importance tokens to guide reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating effective compression of reasoning chains without sacrificing performance.

## Method Summary
ENTRA combines bidirectional importance estimation with entropy-based reinforcement learning to reduce redundant reasoning in large language models. The method first identifies token-level importance using BIE, which combines prediction confidence with forward influence through attention patterns. It then computes normalized entropy over low-importance tokens as a redundancy reward, optimized via GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). The framework specifically targets overthinking behaviors in chain-of-thought reasoning while preserving critical reasoning steps.

## Key Results
- Achieves 37-53% reduction in reasoning output length across mathematical benchmarks
- Maintains or improves accuracy on Qwen3-8B, with +0.46% English and +0.44% Chinese accuracy gains
- Outperforms baseline models on compression effectiveness metric (Ce)
- Successfully compresses reasoning chains without losing essential steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) Identifies Critical Tokens
- The BIE method approximates token importance by combining backward predictability with forward influence, allowing selective penalization of non-critical tokens. The importance score I(x_i) = logP(x_i|x_{<i}) + λμ_i combines self-information from left-to-right prediction confidence with average attention received from future tokens as a proxy for forward influence.

### Mechanism 2: Normalized Entropy Over Low-Importance Tokens Quantifies Redundancy
- Computing entropy only over tokens below the importance threshold provides a redundancy signal that, when normalized by its theoretical upper bound, creates a stable reward for reinforcement learning. The reward r_i = -Σ p(t_i)log(p(t_i)) / log(|T_i| - k) bounds between 0-1.

### Mechanism 3: GRPO Optimization with Entropy Reward Suppresses Overthinking
- Optimizing the normalized entropy reward via GRPO reduces redundant reasoning while maintaining accuracy, as the method preserves high-importance reasoning steps. GRPO samples G outputs per query, computes advantages via intra-group normalization, and optimizes with a clipped objective plus KL penalty.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning and Overthinking**
  - Why needed here: ENTRA specifically targets "overthinking" in Large Reasoning Models—excessive verification, repetitive reflection, and redundant exploration paths that extend CoT beyond what's necessary for correctness.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between "necessary multi-step reasoning" and "redundant verification loops" in a sample model output?

- Concept: **Entropy as a Diversity Measure**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation uses entropy over token distributions to quantify redundancy. Lower entropy = more skewed/repetitive = more redundant.
  - Quick check question: Given a sequence with tokens ["verify", "verify", "verify", "check", "verify"], would entropy be high or low? What does this indicate about redundancy?

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning from Reward Signals (GRPO/PPO basics)**
  - Why needed here: ENTRA uses GRPO to optimize the entropy-based reward. Understanding advantage computation, clipping, and KL penalties is essential for debugging training.
  - Quick check question: What happens to training stability if all samples in a group receive similar rewards (low variance in advantages)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Layer (Prompt X, sampled response sequences Y) -> BIE Module (computes I(x_i) = logP(x_i|x_{<i}) + λμ_i) -> Importance Filter (threshold τ) -> Entropy Calculator (normalized entropy over filtered tokens) -> GRPO Trainer (samples G outputs, computes group-normalized advantages, applies clipped objective with KL penalty)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate G samples per query → 2. Extract attention + log-probs → 3. Compute BIE scores → 4. Filter by threshold τ → 5. Calculate normalized entropy rewards → 6. GRPO update with advantages

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **λ scaling coefficient**: Higher λ emphasizes forward influence; paper uses λ=2 for MATH, λ=10^-4 for other experiments. Tradeoff: higher λ may over-weight early tokens (question stems), potentially under-weighting mid-sequence critical steps.
  - **Threshold τ**: Paper uses 20% (top 20% important tokens excluded). Tradeoff: lower τ = more aggressive compression but risk of penalizing essential reasoning; higher τ = more conservative but less compression.
  - **Group size G in GRPO**: Larger G provides more stable advantage estimates but increases compute. Paper doesn't specify G; you'll need to tune.

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy collapse with compression: Threshold τ too low, λ misconfigured, or KL penalty β too small—model over-compresses essential reasoning.
  - No compression despite training: Reward signal too weak, learning rate too low, or GRPO not converging—check advantage variance.
  - High variance in rewards across samples: Normalization failing due to highly variable sequence lengths; consider length-based reward scaling.
  - Attention extraction errors: BIE requires accessing attention matrices from the final decoder layer; verify your model exposes these correctly.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run BIE on a held-out validation set and manually inspect top-20% vs. bottom-80% tokens. Confirm that high-scoring tokens correspond to semantically critical reasoning steps (formulas, key deductions) and low-scoring tokens include verification/repetition.
  2. **Ablation on threshold τ**: Train with τ ∈ {10%, 20%, 30%} on a small dataset split. Plot accuracy vs. compression ratio to find the stable operating range before accuracy degradation.
  3. **λ sensitivity test**: With fixed τ=20%, test λ ∈ {0.5, 2, 5, 10} to verify paper's claim that λ=2 appropriately upweights question-stem tokens without over-emphasizing early positions. Visualize importance score distributions across sequence positions for each λ.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a provably unbiased bidirectional importance estimator be developed to replace the current approximation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "this approximate calculation method still cannot completely eliminate bias, which may affect the accuracy of the bidirectional token importance estimation results to a certain extent."
- Why unresolved: The λ hyperparameter requires manual tuning per dataset, and the approximation lacks theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of an importance estimator with proven unbiasedness properties, or empirical demonstration that bias does not affect downstream performance across diverse tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does ENTRA perform on non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical deduction, code generation, or commonsense reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note "the core application scenario of the current research is limited to the reasoning compression task of mathematical reasoning problems" and that the BIE design is "more suitable for the semantic correlation and importance distribution characteristics of tokens in mathematical problems."
- Why unresolved: The token importance patterns in mathematical reasoning (e.g., intermediate values, equation steps) may differ substantially from other reasoning domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on benchmarks like BB (logical reasoning), HumanEval (code), or StrategyQA (commonsense) showing comparable compression-to-accuracy tradeoffs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for setting the importance threshold τ, and how sensitive is performance to this hyperparameter?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses τ = 20% ("the top 20% important tokens do not participate in the calculation of text information entropy") without systematic analysis of alternative values.
- Why unresolved: The threshold controls which tokens are protected from redundancy penalties, but the paper provides no ablation or sensitivity analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study showing accuracy and compression across τ ∈ {10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%} on multiple benchmarks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does ENTRA's compression preserve the transferability of reasoning patterns to related tasks or out-of-distribution problems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates only in-domain accuracy but does not examine whether compressed reasoning chains maintain generalization properties—compressed models may overfit to seen problem structures.
- Why unresolved: Removing "redundant" verification steps might also remove exploration that aids transfer learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Few-shot or zero-shot evaluation on held-out reasoning tasks (e.g., training on GSM8K, testing on MATH) to assess whether compression degrades generalization.

## Limitations

- The bidirectional importance estimation relies on attention weights as a proxy for token influence, which may not generalize to models with sparse attention patterns or alternative architectures.
- The entropy-based redundancy signal may incorrectly suppress necessary repetitive patterns in non-mathematical domains where repetition serves different purposes.
- The method depends on several critical hyperparameters (λ, τ, GRPO settings) that require manual tuning and lack systematic sensitivity analysis.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical results showing 37-53% length reduction with maintained/improved accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks are well-supported by the experimental methodology and ablation studies. The GRPO implementation details are clearly specified.

**Medium Confidence**: The core mechanism of entropy-based redundancy detection works as described for mathematical domains, but the generalization to other domains remains unproven. The importance threshold selection process (τ=20%) is based on limited ablation and may not be optimal.

**Low Confidence**: The bidirectional importance estimation's approximation quality across different model architectures, the universality of entropy as a redundancy metric across domains, and the computational overhead claims lack sufficient validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Apply ENTRA to non-mathematical domains (code generation, logical reasoning, common sense QA) with the same hyperparameters (λ=10^-4, τ=20%) and measure whether the entropy-based redundancy signal still correlates with actual redundancy. Compare performance against baseline models to assess cross-domain applicability.

2. **Attention Proxy Validation**: Design an experiment where human annotators mark critical tokens in sample reasoning chains, then compare these annotations against BIE scores across different attention mechanisms (self-attention vs. sparse attention). Calculate correlation metrics to quantify how well attention approximates true token importance.

3. **Computational Overhead Measurement**: Instrument the training pipeline to measure wall-clock time per training step with and without BIE computation. Compare the overhead percentage against the claimed "lightweight" characterization, and analyze whether the accuracy gains justify the additional computational cost.
