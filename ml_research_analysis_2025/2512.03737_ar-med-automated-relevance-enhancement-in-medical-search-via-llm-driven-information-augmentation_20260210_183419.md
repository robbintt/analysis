# AR-Med: Automated Relevance Enhancement in Medical Search via LLM-Driven Information Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.03737
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03737
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AR-Med achieves >93% offline accuracy, a 24% absolute improvement over previous systems, with substantial online relevance gains

## Executive Summary
AR-Med addresses the challenge of accurate pharmaceutical search and recommendation in healthcare contexts where traditional methods struggle with complex queries and rapidly evolving information. The framework integrates large language models with verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented generation approach, ensuring professional accuracy while reducing hallucinations. A knowledge distillation scheme enables efficient deployment by compressing large teacher models into compact student models. The system achieves significant performance gains: 24% absolute improvement in offline accuracy over previous systems and substantial improvements in online relevance metrics when deployed at scale.

## Method Summary
AR-Med is a three-component framework for pharmaceutical search relevance judgment. First, it uses retrieval-augmented generation with query augmentation via Qwen3-0.6B for category tagging and consistency filtering, internet search filtering, and Qwen3-32B for named entity recognition. Second, it implements cross-modal SPU verification using Qwen2.5-7B-vl to extract attributes from product images and detect merchant manipulation through text-image consistency checks. Third, it employs knowledge distillation from Qwen3-32B teacher to Qwen3-0.6B student using multi-prompt voting on high-confidence online samples. The system operates through hierarchical rule-based decision logic and is evaluated on the LocalQSMed benchmark of 4,400 query-SPU pairs across pharmaceutical categories.

## Key Results
- Achieves >93% offline accuracy, representing a 24% absolute improvement over the previous 69% baseline system
- Demonstrates 10.95% improvement in highly relevant recall, 4.74% in less relevant recall, and 4.27% in irrelevant recall
- Shows 4.17% improvement in CTR, 9.14% in CVR, and 4.54% in CXR in online A/B testing compared to baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Retrieval-augmented grounding reduces hallucinations by anchoring LLM outputs to verified medical knowledge.
- **Mechanism**: The RAG framework retrieves context from trusted medical knowledge bases before LLM reasoning, making decisions traceable to source documents rather than relying on parametric knowledge alone.
- **Core assumption**: External knowledge bases are more accurate and up-to-date than the LLM's pre-trained weights for medical domain content.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract states AR-Med "grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability." Section 2.2 describes the framework operating "end-to-end, optimizing inputs from both query and SPU sides via precise knowledge retrieval."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Knowledge distillation preserves teacher-model performance while achieving deployment efficiency.
- **Mechanism**: Qwen3-32B generates diverse inferences via multi-prompt voting; Qwen3-0.6B student mimics outputs through supervised fine-tuning on high-confidence online samples.
- **Core assumption**: The student model's capacity is sufficient to approximate teacher decision boundaries for the medical relevance task distribution.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions "a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models." Section 2.3 states this "yields performance comparable to 70B-scale models in a fraction of the size."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Cross-modal verification prevents merchant manipulation by detecting text-image inconsistencies.
- **Mechanism**: Multimodal models extract attributes from product images; these are cross-matched against textual SPU names to flag discrepancies (e.g., false brand claims).
- **Core assumption**: Images are harder for merchants to manipulate than text titles, and vision models can reliably extract key attributes.
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 2.2.3 describes extracting key attributes from images via multimodal models, cross-matching against textual SPUs. Figure 3 shows joint text+image expansion achieves precision 0.7759 vs. text-only 0.5973.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Core architecture for reducing hallucinations in medical relevance judgment.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RAG helps more than fine-tuning alone for domain-specific accuracy?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation**
  - Why needed here: Essential for deploying LLM capabilities under latency constraints (k×10 ms level).
  - Quick check question: What is the trade-off between student model size and preserved teacher performance?

- **Concept: Multimodal Consistency Verification**
  - Why needed here: Detects merchant manipulation that text-only systems miss.
  - Quick check question: How would you handle cases where images are ambiguous or missing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Query Side: Qwen3-0.6B-emb (similarity) → Qwen3-0.6B-SFT (consistency) → Qwen3-32B (NER/expansion)
  - SPU Side: Qwen2.5-7B-vl (cheating detection) → Qwen3-32B (standardization + attribute extension)
  - Orchestration: Algorithm 1 hierarchical decision logic (brand → efficacy → category matching)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Query rewrite + category tagging
  2. Internet search augmentation + two-filter noise removal
  3. Entity extraction + expert rule recall
  4. Cross-modal SPU validation
  5. Hierarchical relevance classification (Highly/Moderately/Weakly/Irrelevant)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Larger models (32B+) improve accuracy but increase latency; distillation is mandatory for online serving.
  - Aggressive filtering reduces noise but may drop valid expansions; current system uses 0.6B models for pre-filtering.
  - Expert rules add precision but require maintenance; the paper notes dynamic rule updates based on bad cases.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - "Overthinking" in large models (Table 2): excessive reasoning inflates latency and introduces errors.
  - Loss rate issues: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B shows 17.59% sample loss; smaller models may fail to generate valid outputs.
  - Category imbalance: "Less Relevant" recall remains low (30-40%) across models.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run original BERT system on LocalQSMed benchmark; confirm ~69% accuracy as starting point.
  2. **Ablation by module**: Add QI, SI, IS, ISPI, TF sequentially; measure accuracy delta per Table 5 (base→TF: +6.59%).
  3. **Distillation sanity check**: Compare Qwen3-0.6B-Distill vs. Llama-3.3-70B on consistency judgment (Table 8); verify student outperforms larger baselines in domain-specific tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can precision for "less relevant" and "irrelevant" relevance categories be improved without sacrificing "highly relevant" accuracy?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion states: "In the future, our work will focus on further improving the precision of 'less relevant' and 'irrelevant' categories across different product types."
- **Why unresolved**: Current F1 scores for "less relevant" (0.27–0.48) and "irrelevant" (0.43–0.69) lag significantly behind "highly relevant" (0.94–0.97), indicating fundamental difficulty in fine-grained discrimination.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstrated improvement in F1 scores for these categories on the HARD subset while maintaining >90% accuracy on "highly relevant."

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What causes the high loss rates (inference failures) in certain distilled models, and can they be mitigated?
- **Basis in paper**: Table 4 shows DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B has 17.59% loss rate and Llama-3.2-1B has 63.67%, yet this phenomenon is not analyzed or addressed.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not investigate why some models produce unusable outputs at scale, which is critical for production deployment.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic analysis of failure modes and architectural or prompting modifications that reduce loss rates below 1%.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How should the benchmark evolve across multiple iterations to maintain alignment with emerging medical products and regulations?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion mentions "building benchmarks for multiple iterations" as future work.
- **Why unresolved**: LocalQSMed contains 4,400 static samples; rapidly evolving pharmaceutical knowledge (new drugs, regulations) may cause distribution shift over time.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A methodology for continuous benchmark updating that maintains correlation between offline metrics and online A/B test improvements.

## Limitations

- **Knowledge base dependency**: The RAG mechanism assumes external medical knowledge bases remain current and comprehensive, with no validation provided that these sources contain accurate information for all query types tested.
- **Student model capacity constraints**: The knowledge distillation approach claims compression from 32B to 0.6B parameters while maintaining performance, but the student model architecture may lack capacity for complex multi-hop reasoning required in edge cases.
- **Cross-modal verification reliability**: The cross-modal cheating detection depends on vision models reliably extracting product attributes from potentially low-quality or stock images, which could fail silently without detection.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The RAG framework's basic operation - retrieving from external sources before LLM reasoning - is well-established in the literature and demonstrated in the paper's performance gains over baseline systems.

**Medium Confidence**: The knowledge distillation claims show student models outperforming larger baselines, but without ablation studies isolating the distillation contribution from other system components, it's unclear how much credit belongs to this specific mechanism.

**Low Confidence**: The cross-modal cheating detection effectiveness is demonstrated only through benchmark precision/recall metrics, without real-world merchant manipulation case studies or false positive analysis in production deployment.

## Next Checks

1. **Retrieval source quality audit**: Test AR-Med's RAG component using intentionally corrupted or outdated medical knowledge sources to measure hallucination rate changes compared to no-retrieval baseline. This validates whether grounding truly reduces errors or merely shifts error sources.

2. **Student model capacity stress test**: Create synthetic queries requiring multi-hop medical reasoning (e.g., "contraindications for diabetes patients with heart conditions taking drug X") and compare 0.6B student vs. 32B teacher outputs. Measure where student performance degrades to establish practical limits.

3. **Cross-modal robustness evaluation**: Construct SPU entries with progressively degraded image quality (blurry, stock photos, missing images) and measure detection accuracy for known cheating cases. This determines if the vision component fails gracefully or creates false negatives under real-world conditions.
