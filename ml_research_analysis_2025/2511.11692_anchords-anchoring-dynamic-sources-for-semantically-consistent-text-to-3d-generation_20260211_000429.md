# AnchorDS: Anchoring Dynamic Sources for Semantically Consistent Text-to-3D Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11692
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Achieves higher CLIP similarity, better human preference rankings, and more consistent 3D geometry than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining similar runtime efficiency

## Executive Summary
AnchorDS addresses semantic over-smoothing and cross-view inconsistency in text-to-3D generation by dynamically anchoring the source distribution during optimization. Rather than using a static unconditional prior, it conditions the diffusion model on the current rendered image, allowing the guidance to evolve with the 3D state. This anchoring is implemented via dual-conditioned latent space and supported by lightweight filtering and fine-tuning to improve source estimation accuracy. Experiments on complex prompts show AnchorDS achieves higher CLIP similarity, better human preference rankings, and more consistent 3D geometry compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining similar runtime efficiency.

## Method Summary
AnchorDS reformulates Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) as dynamic editing by conditioning the diffusion model on the current rendered image rather than using a static unconditional prior. The method computes guidance as the difference between text-conditioned predictions and image-conditioned predictions, where the image adapter (IP-Adapter or ControlNet) encodes the current 3D state. Source quality is measured through reconstruction loss, enabling threshold-based filtering and adapter fine-tuning. This approach preserves accumulated structural information throughout optimization, reducing semantic blending and improving 3D consistency.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher CLIP text-image similarity scores compared to vanilla SDS and other baselines
- Demonstrates better human preference rankings for both visual quality and 3D consistency
- Reduces semantic over-smoothing in complex multi-attribute prompts
- Maintains runtime efficiency comparable to baseline methods (25-30 min for 3DGS vs 3.5-4h for NeRF)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dynamic source anchoring via image conditioning reduces semantic over-smoothing by maintaining alignment between guidance and the evolving 3D state.
- **Mechanism:** Standard SDS uses an unconditional prior that discards accumulated structural information at each step. By conditioning on the rendered image I^(τ), the diffusion model's noise prediction encodes structural/semantic cues from the current state, anchoring updates to actual geometry rather than a static averaged prior.
- **Core assumption:** The image-conditioned diffusion model can faithfully invert rendered images into latent space representations that capture the current 3D state.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "conditions the diffusion model on the current rendered image, allowing the guidance to evolve with the 3D state"; [Section 3.2] "SDS effectively discards accumulated structural information at each step by restarting from a semantics-agnostic prior"; [corpus] Related work on Schrödinger Bridge (arXiv:2511.05609) confirms SDS artifacts from distribution mismatch

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pseudo-source reconstruction loss provides a measurable quality signal for source estimation accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The model reconstructs an estimate of the original image from the noisy latent using the image-conditioned prediction. L_rec measures the discrepancy between this reconstruction and the actual rendering, enabling threshold-based filtering and adapter fine-tuning.
- **Core assumption:** The reconstruction error correlates with source estimation quality for SDS guidance.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.3] "reconstruction not only provides a direct metric for source estimation quality but also enables two complementary mechanisms"; [Figure 4] Visual confirmation that AnchorDS + fine-tuning achieves accurate source reconstruction vs. vanilla SDS

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Reformulating text-to-3D as dynamic editing (rather than one-shot projection) creates consistent optimization trajectories.
- **Mechanism:** The guidance g_t^(τ) = ϵ̂(z_t; t, y) - ϵ̂(z_t; t, ∅, I^(τ)) computes the direction from current source distribution P_θ^(τ)(x) toward target P_target(x|y), preserving favorable attributes while correcting deviations.
- **Core assumption:** The target distribution (text-conditioned) remains stable while only the source evolves.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.1] "P_θ^(τ)(x) denotes the time-varying source distribution at optimization step τ"; [Section 3.2] "pseudo-editing formulation" connects to 2D editing paradigms like SDEdit

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SDS gradients work is essential to grasp why static source estimation causes artifacts.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why high CFG weights (ω~100) cause the m1 term to dominate in Eq. 5?

- **Concept: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)**
  - Why needed here: AnchorDS modifies the CFG formulation by replacing unconditional prediction with image-conditioned prediction.
  - Quick check question: What happens to guidance when you replace ϵ̂(z_t; t, ∅) with ϵ̂(z_t; t, ∅, I^(τ)) in the CFG formula?

- **Concept: Latent Space Inversion**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on diffusion models' implicit ability to map images to latent distributions without explicit inversion.
  - Quick check question: Why does Eq. 12 provide a "guess" of the original image, and how does this differ from DDIM inversion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Text Prompt y ──┬──> Diffusion Model ──> ϵ̂(z_t; t, y) [target branch]
                  │
  Rendered I^(τ) ─┼──> IP-Adapter/ControlNet ─> ϵ̂(z_t; t, ∅, I^(τ)) [source branch]
                  │         │
                  │         └──> (optional) Fine-tune layer via L_rec
                  │
                  └──> L_rec reconstruction check ─> Filter (threshold γ=0.03)
  
  Gradient: g_t^(τ) = target - source + variance_term
  ```

- **Critical path:** The rendered image must be encoded → image adapter conditions diffusion → dual predictions computed → gradient backpropagated through rendering to 3D parameters.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **IP-Adapter vs. ControlNet:** IP-Adapter preserves expressive power with direct image conditioning; ControlNet requires derived maps but offers structural control. Paper uses IP-Adapter (SD 1.5) and ControlNet-NormalBae (SD 2.1).
  - **Filter vs. Fine-tune:** Filtering adds zero overhead but discards samples; fine-tuning increases runtime ~20% (25→30 min) but improves accuracy. Both can be combined.
  - **3DGS vs. NeRF:** 3DGS requires initialization (e.g., Shap-E) due to sensitivity to gradient flickering; NeRF is more stable but slower (3.5h vs. 25 min).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Desaturated/unstable outputs with IP2P adapter under high CFG (avoid IP2P)
  - Semantic mixing persists → check if image adapter is actually receiving rendered images
  - Sudden geometry changes → L_rec threshold too high, allowing unreliable source estimates
  - Janus problem (multi-face) → source anchoring insufficient; consider adding Perp-Neg

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Figure 4: Render a single-view image, add noise at various timesteps, compare reconstruction quality between vanilla SDS and AnchorDS source estimation.
  2. Ablate the filter threshold γ: Test γ ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1} on 5 diverse prompts, measure CLIP similarity and visual stability.
  3. Compare adapters: Run identical prompts with IP-Adapter vs. ControlNet-NormalBae on SD 1.5, quantify 3D consistency via multi-view rendering inspection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can AnchorDS be successfully integrated with inversion-based techniques or improved sampling strategies to mitigate trajectory estimation mismatch?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "We leave the integration of methods to mitigate the second class of error—trajectory estimation mismatch—as future work."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on source estimation bias (error type 1) but does not address error type 2 (trajectory mismatch), which arises from single-step approximations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments combining AnchorDS with methods like DDIM inversion or Interval Score Matching (ISM) showing improved stability or convergence speed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the "evolving editing" formulation be adapted into a unified framework that handles both text-to-3D generation and 3D object editing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that the new perspective "opens up new avenues for future research, such as unifying the formulation of 3D generation and 3D editing."
- Why unresolved: The current work treats generation as a progressive edit from a random state, but has not tested the framework's efficacy on explicit editing tasks (e.g., modifying an existing 3D asset).
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified implementation that accepts both text-to-3D and edit-based prompts, maintaining 3D consistency in both scenarios without architectural changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the dynamic source anchoring mechanism transfer effectively to more advanced diffusion backbones like SD3 or Flux.1?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In the Limitations section, the authors suggest the dependency on 2D priors "could be alleviated by leveraging more powerful 2D backbones, such as SD3 or Flux.1."
- Why unresolved: The experiments are restricted to SD 1.5 and SD 2.1; the interaction of dual-conditioned anchoring with the architectural differences of newer models (e.g., rectified flows in Flux) is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful reproduction of the AnchorDS pipeline on SD3 or Flux.1, achieving higher fidelity results without tuning instability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the performance of AnchorDS degrade or improve when applied to user-driven, controllable editing tasks rather than pure generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "extending our approach to more controllable or user-driven editing tasks" as a future avenue.
- Why unresolved: The current validation relies on generation benchmarks (T3Bench); the method's ability to respect specific user constraints (e.g., localized edits) while anchoring the source remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks on 3D editing datasets measuring the preservation of non-edited regions and adherence to user instructions.

## Limitations
- The method inherits limitations from view selection and rendering quality - poorly chosen views could mislead the source estimation
- Performance depends on the quality of the image adapter and may not generalize optimally across all prompts or model versions
- Claims about being "essential" for complex prompts over 2-3 words are somewhat overstated - improvements are shown but not necessarily critical dependency
- The exact layer selection for fine-tuning remains unspecified, which could affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The dynamic source anchoring mechanism works as described and improves over vanilla SDS. Reconstruction loss effectively measures source quality, and the filtering/fine-tuning enhancements provide measurable benefits.
- **Medium confidence:** The specific architectural choices (IP-Adapter vs. ControlNet, filter threshold of 0.03) are justified by experiments but may not generalize optimally across all prompts or model versions. The runtime improvements over NeRF are demonstrated but depend on initialization method.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about AnchorDS being "essential" for complex prompts over 2-3 words are somewhat overstated - the method shows improvements but not necessarily critical dependency for all multi-word prompts.

## Next Checks

1. **Adapter architecture ablation:** Systematically compare IP-Adapter, ControlNet, and IP2P performance across 10 diverse prompts, measuring both quality metrics and failure modes like desaturation or semantic mixing.

2. **View sampling impact:** Test AnchorDS with different view sampling strategies (random vs. strategic views covering semantic regions) to quantify how rendering quality affects source estimation accuracy.

3. **Initialization sensitivity:** Compare AnchorDS performance when initializing 3DGS from Shap-E vs. random initialization, measuring both convergence speed and final quality to validate the claimed dependency.
