# Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12412
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CD2-TSI achieves up to 5.46% improvement in MAE and 4.41% in RMSE on Air Quality dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain time series imputation, where a target domain with high missing rates and domain shifts needs to leverage knowledge from a source domain. Existing approaches struggle due to data incompleteness, inability to distinguish domain-shared and specific knowledge, and difficulties in capturing cross-domain temporal dependencies. The authors propose CD2-TSI, a diffusion-based framework that tackles these challenges through: (1) frequency-based time series interpolation (FMixup) that integrates shared spectral components while preserving domain-specific structures, (2) a conditional diffusion model with domain-shared and domain-specific denoising networks, and (3) cross-domain consistency alignment that selectively regularizes output-level discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (Air Quality, Hydrology, Electricity) show CD2-TSI outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5.46% improvement in MAE and 4.41% in RMSE on the Air Quality dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in cross-domain imputation.

## Method Summary
CD2-TSI addresses cross-domain time series imputation through a three-component framework. First, FMixup performs frequency-based interpolation by blending low-frequency amplitude spectra from source and target domains using FFT while preserving target phase information, with interpolation parameter α=0.003 and blending factor λ∈[0.0,1.0]. Second, a conditional diffusion model incorporates both shared and domain-specific knowledge through a shared input convolution layer followed by domain-specific attention mechanisms (4 residual layers, 64 channels, 8 heads). Third, cross-domain consistency alignment (CDCA) selectively regularizes discrepancies between source and target domain predictions using thresholds τ_l and τ_h. The model is trained with Adam optimizer, learning rate schedule 1e-3→1e-4→1e-5 at 75%/90% epochs, batch size 16, and 200 total epochs using a quadratic noise schedule (β_1=0.0001, β_T=0.5).

## Key Results
- CD2-TSI achieves up to 5.46% improvement in MAE and 4.41% in RMSE on Air Quality dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Outperforms baseline models across all three datasets (Air Quality, Hydrology, Electricity) under both point and block missing patterns
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of individual components: FMixup reduces block missing error by 0.5 RMSE on Electricity dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing three fundamental challenges in cross-domain imputation: (1) incomplete data is handled through FMixup's frequency interpolation that creates synthetic samples with controlled domain knowledge transfer; (2) domain-shared versus specific knowledge is separated via the conditional diffusion model architecture with shared input processing and domain-specific attention; (3) cross-domain temporal dependencies are captured through CDCA's selective alignment that only regularizes consistent predictions while preserving domain-specific temporal patterns. The frequency-based approach is particularly effective because related domains typically share low-frequency components (trends/seasonality) while maintaining distinct high-frequency characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

### Cross-domain imputation
- Why needed: Standard imputation fails when source and target domains have temporal dynamics shifts
- Quick check: Compare imputation performance when source/target are from same vs. different distributions

### Frequency-based data synthesis
- Why needed: Direct temporal interpolation fails with high missing rates; frequency domain preserves structural patterns
- Quick check: Verify FFT preserves inverse transform accuracy before/after amplitude blending

### Diffusion models for time series
- Why needed: Sequential denoising captures complex temporal dependencies better than regression-based methods
- Quick check: Monitor denoising loss convergence across T diffusion steps

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Data preprocessing -> FMixup (FFT interpolation) -> Conditional diffusion model (shared conv + domain-specific attention) -> CDCA alignment -> Imputation output

### Critical path
FMixup synthesis → diffusion denoising (source/target) → CDCA regularization → final prediction

### Design tradeoffs
- Shared vs. domain-specific layers: Balances knowledge transfer with preserving unique temporal patterns
- Frequency vs. time domain interpolation: Frequency preserves global structure but may miss local dependencies
- Selective vs. full alignment: CDCA avoids over-regularization of domain-specific features

### Failure signatures
- Poor performance on block missing if FMixup phase preservation fails
- Overfitting to source if CDCA thresholds too restrictive
- Degraded temporal coherence if attention mechanism misconfigured

### First experiments
1. Verify FFT-based FMixup preserves target phase while blending source amplitudes
2. Test diffusion model with only source or only target data to establish baseline
3. Evaluate CDCA alignment sensitivity by varying τ_l/τ_h thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CD2-TSI perform under conditions characterized by extreme missing rates or significantly more complex domain shifts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future work will explore more challenging real-world conditions with extreme missing rates and complex domain shifts."
- Why unresolved: The current experimental evaluation is limited to missing rates between 10-50% and specific real-world datasets (Air Quality, Hydrology, Electricity).
- Evidence: Evaluation results on datasets with >80% missingness or domain pairs with highly divergent temporal dynamics compared to the current baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the assumption that shared knowledge resides primarily in low-frequency components valid for all cross-domain pairs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.3 posits that related domains "typically share low-frequency components," forming the basis of the FMixup strategy.
- Why unresolved: If domains share high-frequency features (e.g., transient noise patterns) but differ in long-term trends, the current strategy might filter out useful shared information or introduce irrelevant trends.
- Evidence: Ablation studies on synthetic data where trend/seasonality correlations are inverted, measuring the degradation of FMixup versus standard interpolation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Cross-Domain Consistency Alignment (CDCA) thresholds be adapted dynamically rather than manually tuned?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Hyperparameter Study (Fig. 3) demonstrates performance sensitivity to fixed thresholds (τ_l, τ_h), which were empirically selected.
- Why unresolved: Fixed thresholds require dataset-specific tuning; a static configuration may fail to generalize to new domain pairs where the optimal discrepancy boundary differs.
- Evidence: Implementation of a learnable or adaptive thresholding mechanism that outperforms the fixed hyperparameter settings across diverse cross-domain benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Missing exact values for CDCA thresholds (τ_l, τ_h) and weighting factor μ_align, limiting precise reproduction
- Diffusion step count T not explicitly specified in methodology
- Performance improvements shown relative to baselines without absolute comparison metrics for practical significance assessment

## Confidence
- Diffusion framework methodology: High confidence - follows established patterns in literature
- FMixup frequency interpolation: High confidence - technically sound FFT-based approach
- CDCA alignment mechanism: Medium confidence - implementation details unclear due to unspecified thresholds
- Overall performance claims: Medium confidence - consistent improvements shown but absolute values would strengthen interpretation

## Next Checks
1. Verify FFT-based FMixup implementation by checking that target phase spectrum is preserved while blending low-frequency amplitude components between domains
2. Test diffusion model sensitivity to CDCA alignment thresholds by running with different τ_l/τ_h values to observe impact on target domain imputation quality
3. Implement the complete pipeline on a simpler dataset (e.g., synthetic time series) to validate the end-to-end training dynamics and ensure proper gradient flow between source and target domains
