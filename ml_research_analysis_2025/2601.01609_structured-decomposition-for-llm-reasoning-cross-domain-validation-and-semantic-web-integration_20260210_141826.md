# Structured Decomposition for LLM Reasoning: Cross-Domain Validation and Semantic Web Integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01609
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01609
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Structured decomposition achieved statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate (F1: 79.8% vs 75.2%)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents structured decomposition, a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with OWL/SWRL reasoning for rule-based tasks over natural language. The approach uses LLMs as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach, showing significant improvements over few-shot prompting when tasks possess rule-expressible decision boundaries.

## Method Summary
The framework executes a three-stage pipeline: (1) Entity Identification—the LLM extracts text spans matching ontology-defined classes; (2) Assertion Extraction—the LLM evaluates properties for each entity, producing ABox assertions with justifications; (3) Symbolic Verification—a SWRL reasoner applies deterministic rules to infer final classifications. The approach is evaluated across three rule-governed domains using 94 test instances per domain, comparing six conditions: Few-Shot, CoT, SD, SD-Comp, SD-Direct, and SD-Direct-Comp. The method requires tasks with rule-expressible decision boundaries and formalizable predicate structures, implemented using owlready2, LangChain, and Pellet reasoner.

## Key Results
- Structured decomposition achieved 79.8% F1 score versus 75.2% for few-shot prompting across eleven models and three domains
- An ablation study confirmed symbolic verification provides substantial benefit, with SD-Direct underperforming SD by 9.7 percentage points
- The approach is strictly limited to tasks with deterministic, rule-expressible decision boundaries—failed catastrophically on URTI classification (0.145 F1 vs 0.979 few-shot)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating interpretation (LLM) from inference (symbolic reasoner) isolates error sources and improves accuracy on rule-governed tasks.
- Mechanism: The pipeline executes three sequential stages: (1) Entity Identification—the LLM extracts text spans matching ontology-defined classes; (2) Assertion Extraction—the LLM evaluates properties for each entity, producing ABox assertions with justifications; (3) Symbolic Verification—a SWRL reasoner applies deterministic rules to infer final classifications. The LLM is constrained to extraction; logical combination is delegated to the reasoner.
- Core assumption: The task possesses a rule-expressible decision boundary—a logical formula over extractable predicates fully determines the outcome.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions... while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees."
  - [Section 6.2] "SD outperformed SD-Direct by 9.7 percentage points... confirming that the symbolic verification component provides substantial benefit beyond the structured predicate definitions alone."
  - [corpus] Corpus papers address multi-agent coordination and cross-domain transfer but do not directly validate this neural-symbolic decomposition pattern.
- Break condition: Task lacks a deterministic rule-expressible boundary. Section 4.1 reports SD achieved 0.145 F1 on URTI classification (vs. 0.979 for few-shot) because the decision boundary is statistical, not rule-based.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grounding prompts in expert-authored OWL ontologies provides stable, auditable specifications that guide LLM extraction more reliably than ad-hoc prompts.
- Mechanism: Domain experts encode rules and entity definitions in the TBox (class hierarchies, property domains/ranges, SWRL rules). LLM prompts are derived from ontology annotations—entity descriptions, assertion specifications—ensuring a single source of truth. The populated ABox is directly consumable by the reasoner and inspectable via SPARQL.
- Core assumption: Experts can accurately encode domain logic into OWL. Vague or incorrect definitions produce systematic extraction errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.4] "Task definitions are formalised as OWL 2 ontologies... Task specifications become editable in tools such as Protégé."
  - [Section 4.5] "Entity and assertion specifications require particular care, as they constitute the natural language interface between the ontology and the LLM, vague descriptions yield inconsistent extractions."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on ontology-driven prompting; corpus focuses on multi-agent and cross-domain methods.
- Break condition: Ontology definitions are ambiguous or incomplete. The LLM extracts consistently but incorrectly, and iterative refinement is required (Section 7.7).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Symbolic verification via SWRL reasoners compensates for LLM reasoning inconsistencies, eliminating rule-application errors even for simple logical rules.
- Mechanism: Once the ABox is populated, Pellet executes SWRL rules deterministically. Classification is a logical consequence of asserted facts, removing LLM susceptibility to surface-level phrasing or compounding errors in multi-step inference. The ablation (SD vs. SD-Direct) isolates this contribution.
- Core assumption: Extracted assertions are sufficiently accurate; the reasoner cannot correct upstream extraction errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 6.2] "Providing structured assertion specifications without symbolic verification actually degrades performance compared to few-shot prompting (70.1% vs. 75.2% F1)."
  - [Section 7.1] "When extraction difficulty dominates, verification cannot compensate for upstream errors."
  - [corpus] Corpus does not provide evidence on SWRL-based verification; focus is on LLM planning guarantees.
- Break condition: Extraction quality is poor. Section 7.5 notes larger models benefit more, suggesting extraction is the bottleneck.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **OWL Ontologies (TBox/ABox)**
  - Why needed here: The framework's core is "LLM populates ABox according to TBox." Understanding the TBox/ABox distinction is essential for reading ontologies and debugging extraction failures.
  - Quick check question: For a "loan approval" domain, sketch the TBox classes (e.g., Applicant, Loan) and properties (e.g., hasIncome, hasCreditScore) needed to represent a decision rule.

- Concept: **SWRL Rules**
  - Why needed here: SWRL encodes the classification logic. You must read rules like `Statement(?s) ∧ OutOfCourtStatement(?s) → Hearsay(?s)` to understand what the reasoner enforces.
  - Quick check question: Translate "If age > 65 AND income < 30k, then eligible for subsidy" into SWRL syntax using appropriate atoms.

- Concept: **Neural-Symbolic Integration Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: This paper instantiates a broader pattern. Understanding *when* to split neural vs. symbolic work is critical for architectural decisions.
  - Quick check question: Argue whether sentiment classification fits this pattern. Consider: is there a rule-expressible decision boundary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task Ontology (TBox + SWRL) -> Prompt Generator -> Entity ID (LLM) -> Assertion Extraction (LLM) -> ABox Populator -> Symbolic Reasoner -> Result Aggregator
- Critical path: Input Text -> Prompt Generator -> Entity ID (LLM) -> Assertion Extraction (LLM) -> ABox Populator -> Symbolic Reasoner -> Result. LLM calls dominate latency and cost; reasoner is fast and deterministic.
- Design tradeoffs:
  1. **Predicate granularity**: More predicates enable finer inspection but increase LLM confusion. Complementary predicates degraded performance (-5.0pp F1, Section 6.3).
  2. **Model size**: Larger models extract more accurately; smaller models may degrade with SD (Section 7.5).
  3. **Task suitability**: Only applies when rule-expressible boundaries exist. Statistical tasks fail (Section 4.1).
- Failure signatures:
  1. **SD F1 < few-shot baseline**: Extraction quality poor. Review entity/assertion specs; consider larger model.
  2. **No classification from reasoner**: ABox incomplete. Debug Assertion Extraction step.
  3. **Systematic false positives/negatives**: SWRL rule mis-specified or assertion prompts biased.
  4. **High cross-model variance**: Extraction is bottleneck. Focus prompt engineering.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce hearsay task**: Load provided ontology, run SD pipeline on sample inputs, inspect populated ABox.
  2. **Ablate reasoner**: Run SD-Direct on same inputs. Observe F1 drop to quantify symbolic verification contribution.
  3. **Pilot new domain**: Define simple rule (e.g., "email urgent if sender VIP AND subject contains 'ASAP'"). Build minimal ontology (2 classes, 2 properties, 1 SWRL rule). Test on synthetic emails; analyze extraction failures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Does structured decomposition benefit tasks requiring complex logical structures with disjunctions, negations, or nested quantifiers?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Whether benefits extend to more complex logical structures involving disjunctions, negation, or nested quantifiers is unknown."
  - Why unresolved: All three evaluation tasks used simple conjunctive rules; more expressive logical forms were not tested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on tasks formalised with SWRL rules containing disjunction, negation-as-failure, or existential quantifiers.

- **Question**: Why did complementary predicates degrade performance in this evaluation when prior work found benefits?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the contrary finding and hypothesise "the benefit appears highly model-specific rather than universal, and confirmation bias may be less prevalent in current-generation LLMs."
  - Why unresolved: The mechanism underlying this reversal remains unclear; it could reflect model capabilities, task properties, or ontology design.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying model generation, task type, and predicate structure to isolate the contributing factors.

- **Question**: How does framework effectiveness change across LLM capability levels and generations?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Longitudinal evaluation across model generations would help characterise this relationship."
  - Why unresolved: Larger models showed greater improvements, but whether this pattern persists or inverts with future models is unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Repeating the evaluation protocol across successive model releases from multiple providers.

## Limitations

- The approach is strictly limited to tasks with deterministic, rule-expressible decision boundaries. The paper explicitly notes failure on URTI classification where the boundary is statistical, not logical (Section 4.1).
- Performance gains depend critically on extraction quality from the LLM. When extraction fails, the symbolic reasoner cannot compensate (Section 7.1).
- The paper reports significant performance improvements over few-shot prompting (aggregate F1: 79.8% vs 75.2%), but the absolute performance varies substantially across domains and model sizes.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of separating LLM extraction from symbolic verification is well-demonstrated through ablation studies (SD vs SD-Direct showing 9.7pp F1 improvement).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that grounding prompts in expert-authored ontologies provides more stable specifications than ad-hoc prompts is supported by design principles but lacks direct comparative evidence.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that complementary predicates universally degrades performance contradicts some prior work and may be model- or task-specific.

## Next Checks

1. **Boundary Condition Test**: Apply the framework to a task with a clear statistical decision boundary (e.g., sentiment classification or spam detection) to confirm the stated limitation and quantify the performance degradation.

2. **Ontology Quality Impact**: Systematically vary the quality and specificity of OWL ontology specifications (using the same underlying task) to measure the sensitivity of LLM extraction accuracy to specification clarity and completeness.

3. **Model Size Scaling**: Conduct a controlled experiment varying only model size (holding all other factors constant) to precisely quantify the relationship between model capability and the relative benefit of structured decomposition versus few-shot prompting.
