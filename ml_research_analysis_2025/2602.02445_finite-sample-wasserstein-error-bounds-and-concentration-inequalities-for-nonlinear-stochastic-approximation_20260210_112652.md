# Finite-Sample Wasserstein Error Bounds and Concentration Inequalities for Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.02445
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02445
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** Establishes non-asymptotic Wasserstein-p error bounds for nonlinear SA, bridging asymptotic distributional results and finite-sample moment bounds.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental gap in stochastic approximation theory by providing non-asymptotic Wasserstein-p error bounds for nonlinear algorithms. The authors develop a coupling argument that compares discrete-time recursions to limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, enabling explicit finite-sample guarantees. The framework captures both transient heavy-tailed behavior and asymptotic Gaussian limits, with rates of $O(\gamma_n^{1/6})$ for last iterates and $O(n^{-1/6})$ for Polyak-Ruppert averages.

The work significantly advances beyond traditional asymptotic analysis by quantifying the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior in linear stochastic approximation. High-probability concentration inequalities improve upon standard moment bounds, making the results practically useful for algorithm design and analysis under general noise conditions including martingale differences and ergodic Markov chains.

## Method Summary
The core method employs a coupling argument between the discrete-time stochastic approximation recursion and a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The recursion $x_{k+1} = x_k - \gamma_k(f(x_k, \xi_k) + W_k)$ is analyzed by comparing it to a continuous-time diffusion approximation. This coupling enables the derivation of Wasserstein-p error bounds by quantifying the difference between the actual algorithm trajectory and its limiting distribution. The approach leverages non-asymptotic central limit theorems for the driving noise and applies under general noise conditions including martingale differences and ergodic Markov chains.

## Key Results
- Convergence rates of order $\gamma_n^{1/6}$ in $W_p$ for last iterates and $n^{-1/6}$ for Polyak-Ruppert averages
- High-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon moment bounds and Markov's inequality
- Quantification of the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior in linear stochastic approximation
- Analysis applicable under general noise conditions including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The coupling argument is the key mechanism that enables finite-sample guarantees. By comparing the discrete-time recursion to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the authors can bound the Wasserstein distance between the algorithm's distribution and its asymptotic limit. This approach bridges the gap between asymptotic distributional results (which require infinite samples) and finite-sample moment bounds (which don't capture distributional properties). The coupling argument allows explicit quantification of how the algorithm's distribution converges to its limiting Gaussian form.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes:** Why needed - These continuous-time diffusions serve as the limiting processes for the discrete-time recursions. Quick check - Verify the Lyapunov equation (4) has a solution for the given noise structure.
- **Wasserstein distance:** Why needed - Provides a metric on probability distributions that captures both location and scale differences. Quick check - Ensure the optimal transport solver correctly computes $W_p$ between empirical samples and theoretical Gaussian.
- **Coupling arguments:** Why needed - Enables comparison between discrete and continuous processes by constructing dependent versions. Quick check - Verify the coupling satisfies the contraction conditions (6) for the chosen step size.
- **Martingale difference sequences:** Why needed - General noise structure that includes both independent and Markov-dependent noise. Quick check - Confirm the noise satisfies Assumption 5 or 3 for the specific experiment.
- **Lyapunov equations:** Why needed - Determine the limiting Gaussian covariance for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Quick check - Solve equation (4) analytically to obtain $\Sigma_a$ for the linear SA example.
- **Concentration inequalities:** Why needed - Provide high-probability bounds that improve upon standard moment bounds. Quick check - Verify Corollary 1 holds for the empirical error distribution.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Stochastic Approximation Recursion -> Coupling with OU Process -> Wasserstein Error Bound -> Concentration Inequality

**Critical Path:** The core analysis path follows: (1) establish recursion properties under Assumptions 2-5, (2) construct coupling with limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, (3) derive Wasserstein-p bounds using the coupling, (4) apply concentration inequalities for high-probability results.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The analysis trades generality for precision - requiring uniform Lipschitz conditions on $f$ and $\nabla f$ enables explicit finite-sample bounds but limits applicability to non-smooth problems. The choice between martingale differences and ergodic Markov chains affects the tightness of the bounds.

**Failure Signatures:** Divergence or heavy-tailed behavior dominating indicates violation of the "burn-in" condition or step size requirements. Incorrect rate verification suggests either wrong step size exponent ($a=1$ vs $a=2/3$) or noise conditions not matching the theoretical assumptions.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement Linear SA with multiplicative i.i.d. noise, verify $W_p$ convergence rate of $O(n^{-1/6})$ for PR averaging with $a=2/3$.
2. Test sensitivity of convergence rate to burn-in period $n_0$ and initial step size $\gamma_1$, document minimum requirements.
3. Extend to non-martingale noise (e.g., bounded dependent noise) and compare empirical rates to theoretical predictions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Constant prefactors in error bounds are not numerically specified, limiting verification of bound tightness beyond rates
- Strong assumptions like uniform Lipschitz continuity may not hold in practical applications
- Qualitative requirements for "sufficiently large" burn-in period and "sufficiently small" initial step size require manual tuning

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Theoretical derivation of convergence rates $O(\gamma_n^{1/6})$ for last iterates and $O(n^{-1/6})$ for PR averages is mathematically rigorous under stated conditions.

**Medium Confidence:** Empirical verification of rates through synthetic experiments is feasible, but inability to validate constant prefactors and need for manual parameter tuning reduce confidence in practical bound tightness.

**Low Confidence:** Extension to more general noise processes or non-Lipschitz functions is not addressed, leaving gaps in applicability beyond the theoretical framework.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the linear SA example (Section 4.1) with multiplicative i.i.d. noise. Use step size exponent $a=1$ for last iterate and $a=2/3$ for PR averaging. Collect $M$ independent trials to estimate the error distribution $y_n = \gamma_n^{-1/2}(x_n - x^*)$ and compute the empirical $W_p$ distance to the theoretical Gaussian limit $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_a)$. Verify the slope of $\log(W_p)$ vs. $\log(n)$ matches the theoretical rate (e.g., $\approx 1/6$).

2. Test sensitivity of convergence rate to variations in the burn-in period $n_0$ and initial step size $\gamma_1$. Document the minimum $n$ and $\gamma_1$ required to observe the theoretical rate, providing practical guidance for implementation.

3. Extend the synthetic experiment to non-martingale noise (e.g., bounded dependent noise) to test the robustness of the bounds beyond the theoretical assumptions. Compare empirical rates to theoretical predictions and identify potential gaps or extensions needed.
