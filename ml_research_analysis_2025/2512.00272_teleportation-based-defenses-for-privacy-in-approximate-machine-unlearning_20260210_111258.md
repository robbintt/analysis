# Teleportation-Based Defenses for Privacy in Approximate Machine Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00272
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: WARP defense improves privacy in machine unlearning by reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces WARP, a novel teleportation-based defense mechanism designed to enhance privacy in approximate machine unlearning. The defense addresses two critical privacy vulnerabilities: large gradient norms from forget-set samples and close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. By leveraging neural network symmetries, WARP redistributes forget-set gradient energy and increases parameter dispersion while maintaining prediction accuracy on retained data.

## Method Summary
WARP operates as a plug-and-play defense that can be integrated with existing unlearning algorithms. The mechanism exploits neural network symmetries to modify the gradient landscape during the unlearning process, effectively teleporting parameters away from vulnerable configurations. This approach simultaneously reduces the energy of gradients from forget-set samples and increases the distance between unlearned and original model parameters, thereby strengthening privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance on retained data.

## Key Results
- WARP reduces adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box settings
- WARP reduces adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 92% in white-box settings
- Maintains accuracy on retained data across six unlearning algorithms and three image datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WARP exploits the inherent symmetries in neural network parameter spaces to create a defensive teleportation effect. By strategically modifying gradient updates during unlearning, it redirects parameter trajectories away from privacy-sensitive regions while preserving the functional relationships needed for accurate predictions on retained data. This dual action of reducing forget-set gradient energy and increasing parameter dispersion directly addresses the two primary privacy vulnerabilities in approximate unlearning.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Neural Network Symmetries** - Why needed: Understanding parameter space redundancies that allow functionally equivalent models; Quick check: Verify that rotated weight matrices produce identical outputs

2. **Approximate Machine Unlearning** - Why needed: Background on current unlearning approaches and their privacy limitations; Quick check: Confirm understanding of how unlearning differs from full retraining

3. **Gradient-based Privacy Attacks** - Why needed: Knowledge of how adversaries exploit unlearning artifacts; Quick check: Understand membership inference attack methodology

4. **Parameter Dispersion Metrics** - Why needed: Ability to quantify the distance between original and unlearned models; Quick check: Verify that L2 distance between parameters increases after WARP application

5. **Adversarial Advantage Measurement** - Why needed: Framework for evaluating privacy improvements; Quick check: Confirm that AUC reduction corresponds to decreased attack success

6. **Black-box vs White-box Threat Models** - Why needed: Understanding different attack scenarios; Quick check: Distinguish between access levels in each threat model

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** WARP -> Unlearning Algorithm -> Model Parameters -> Privacy Metrics -> Accuracy Metrics

**Critical Path:** Input forget-set samples → Gradient computation → WARP teleportation transformation → Parameter update → Privacy assessment → Performance validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Privacy improvement vs computational overhead; Parameter dispersion vs model stability; Defense strength vs compatibility with existing unlearning algorithms

**Failure Signatures:** Minimal reduction in adversarial advantage; Significant accuracy degradation on retained data; Convergence issues during unlearning; Incompatibility with specific model architectures

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply WARP to a simple linear model undergoing unlearning to observe teleportation effects
2. Compare gradient norms of forget-set samples before and after WARP application
3. Measure parameter dispersion between original and unlearned models with and without WARP

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on non-image datasets (NLP, tabular, multimodal) remains unexplored
- Effectiveness against adaptive adversaries specifically targeting WARP is not investigated
- Computational overhead and scalability to larger models/datasets not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Claims about reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) in both black-box and white-box settings are well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about maintaining accuracy on retained data while improving privacy are supported but require further validation across diverse scenarios.

**Low Confidence:** Generalizability to non-image tasks and performance against adaptive adversaries lack sufficient evidence.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate WARP on non-image datasets such as text or tabular data to assess generalizability
2. Test WARP against adaptive adversaries who design attacks specifically targeting its teleportation mechanism
3. Analyze computational overhead and scalability when applied to larger models or datasets
