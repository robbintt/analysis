# Aug3D: Augmenting large scale outdoor datasets for Generalizable Novel View Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.06431
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06431
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Aug3D framework improves PSNR by 10% on large-scale outdoor NVS by combining SfM-based clustering with semantic-guided synthetic view augmentation

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of applying generalizable novel view synthesis (GNVS) models to large-scale outdoor datasets, where sparse view overlap and unconstrained capture trajectories hinder performance. The authors introduce Aug3D, an augmentation framework that reconstructs scenes using Structure-from-Motion (SfM), then generates synthetic viewpoints through grid-based and semantic sampling. Experiments on the UrbanScene3D Campus scene demonstrate that reducing cluster size from 20 to 10 views improves PSNR by 10%, and that integrating Aug3D-synthesized views with real data further boosts performance, with semantic sampling achieving the highest PSNR of 21.80.

## Method Summary
The method clusters images using SfM shared points to improve feature correlation within training groups, then reconstructs scenes to generate synthetic viewpoints through grid-based and semantic sampling. The pipeline involves: (1) running SfM on aerial imagery to obtain sparse point clouds and camera poses, (2) computing pairwise shared 3D points to build a similarity matrix, (3) clustering images using uniform cluster center selection with top-K views assigned by similarity scores, (4) reconstructing meshes from SfM data, (5) generating synthetic views via Multiscale Grid Sampling or Semantic Plane Fitting that targets underrepresented urban regions, and (6) training PixelNeRF on combined real and synthetic data. The approach specifically targets large-scale outdoor datasets where traditional indoor NVS methods fail due to sparse view overlap and unconstrained drone capture trajectories.

## Key Results
- Reducing cluster size from 20 to 10 views improves PSNR by 10% on UrbanScene3D Campus scene
- Semantic sampling augmentation achieves highest PSNR of 21.80, outperforming grid sampling (21.67) and real-only baseline (20.03)
- Combining real and synthetic data provides better generalization than synthetic-only training, despite synthetic-only achieving higher PSNR (28-29)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: SfM-based clustering improves feature correlation
- Clustering images by SfM shared points ensures cameras within a cluster observe the same physical structures, improving feature correlation necessary for GNVS interpolation learning
- Core assumption: High 3D point correspondence between images indicates overlapping scene content and correlated features
- Evidence: SfM shared grouping achieves Best PSNR 20.03 vs Grid-Based 12.2

### Mechanism 2: Smaller cluster sizes improve reconstruction fidelity
- Reducing cluster size concentrates on images with stronger mutual overlap, reducing conflicting gradients from minimally-related views during training
- Core assumption: GNVS models rely on local feature matching between input views; excessive view diversity introduces optimization conflicts
- Evidence: Reducing cluster size from 20 to 10 improves PSNR to 22.94

### Mechanism 3: Semantic-guided augmentation corrects dataset bias
- Semantic plane fitting identifies buildings via height-percentile thresholding to target underrepresented urban regions, improving dataset diversity
- Core assumption: Reconstruction-based synthetic views from sufficiently accurate meshes can substitute for real captures
- Evidence: Semantic augmentation (21.80 PSNR) outperforms grid sampling (21.67) and real-only baseline (20.03)

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Structure-from-Motion (SfM)**
  - Why needed: Foundation for both clustering (similarity via shared points) and augmentation (mesh reconstruction for synthetic view rendering)
  - Quick check: Given two aerial images with 150 shared SfM points vs. 15 shared points, which pair should be clustered together for training?

- **Concept: Feed-forward vs. Optimization-based NVS**
  - Why needed: This work targets generalizable feed-forward models (PixelNeRF) that learn priors across scenes
  - Quick check: Why can't a feed-forward NVS model trained only on indoor DTU scenes directly generalize to kilometer-scale outdoor drone captures?

- **Concept: View Overlap and Feature Correlation**
  - Why needed: GNVS models interpolate between input views by matching features; low overlap forces extrapolation
  - Quick check: In a drone grid-scan with 50m horizontal spacing at 100m altitude, would consecutive images or images separated by 3 captures exhibit higher feature correlation for a building-rich scene?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw aerial imagery → SfM reconstruction → Similarity matrix → SfM clustering → Training groups → Mesh + point cloud → Semantic building detection → Virtual camera sampling → Synthetic renders → Augmented dataset (real + synthetic) → PixelNeRF training → Novel view inference

- **Critical path**: SfM reconstruction quality determines both clustering accuracy and synthetic view fidelity. Errors propagate through the entire pipeline.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Cluster size: Smaller = higher overlap but less context per sample
  - Grid vs. semantic sampling: Grid is uniform but over-samples uninteresting terrain; semantic focuses computation but requires reliable building detection
  - Synthetic-only vs. combined training: Synthetic achieves higher PSNR (28-29) but may not transfer; combined (21.80) generalizes better to real data
  - Assumption: Synthetic render quality from SfM mesh is sufficient for training without introducing domain gap artifacts

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Clustering produces temporally-adjacent but spatially-disparate views (capture sequence grouping artifact)
  - Synthetic views show mesh reconstruction artifacts (floating geometry, texture holes)
  - PSNR plateaus or degrades with more input views (noise/redundancy overwhelm signal)
  - SAM-based semantic detection mislabels shadows as buildings

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce SfM clustering on a 100-image subset of UrbanScene3D; visualize cluster assignments to verify spatial coherence vs. capture sequence grouping.
  2. Generate 500 synthetic views using grid sampling; compare reconstruction PSNR against semantic sampling on a held-out region to quantify augmentation strategy impact.
  3. Train PixelNeRF with cluster sizes [5, 10, 15, 20] on the SfM-clustered data; plot PSNR vs. cluster size to identify the inflection point where overlap benefits diminish.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Adaptive clustering strategies
- Question: Can adaptive clustering strategies be developed to replace the current fixed-size groupings?
- Basis: The Discussion section identifies "adaptive clustering" as a specific future direction to pursue
- Why unresolved: The authors manually tuned the cluster size (finding 10 views superior to 20), but did not propose a method to automate this selection based on scene geometry or view density
- Evidence needed: An algorithm that dynamically determines optimal cluster sizes per scene region, demonstrating consistent improvements over the fixed heuristic

### Open Question 2: Scalability to diverse datasets and models
- Question: How does Aug3D performance scale to diverse datasets and alternative generalizable architectures?
- Basis: The Discussion section highlights "ensuring scalability to diverse datasets and models" as a remaining challenge
- Why unresolved: Experiments were restricted to the UrbanScene3D Campus scene and the PixelNeRF architecture
- Evidence needed: Successful application of Aug3D on the Mill-19 dataset or improved metrics when training alternative models like IBRNet or MVSNeRF

### Open Question 3: Mitigating noise from imperfect reconstructions
- Question: How can the pipeline be improved to effectively mitigate noise introduced by imperfect synthetic reconstructions?
- Basis: The Discussion cites "mitigating noise from additional input views" as a key remaining challenge
- Why unresolved: While combining real and synthetic data boosts performance, the augmentation relies on SfM reconstruction quality, which inevitably introduces artifacts
- Evidence needed: A filtering mechanism or uncertainty-aware loss function that increases the Real+Aug3D PSNR beyond the current best of 21.80

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details remain underspecified, including exact SfM pipeline parameters, clustering algorithm specifics, grid sampling auto-adjustment formulas, and training hyperparameters
- Semantic detection failure mode (SAM mislabeling shadows as buildings) suggests robustness concerns not fully addressed
- The modest improvement of semantic sampling (21.80) over grid sampling (21.67) questions whether the added complexity provides sufficient benefit

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core insight that SfM-based clustering improves view overlap for GNVS training compared to naive temporal or grid grouping (10% PSNR improvement from 12.2 to 20.03)
- **Medium Confidence**: The cluster size optimization finding (10 views optimal vs 20), though qualitative differences are marginal
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic augmentation superiority (21.80 PSNR), but improvement over grid sampling is modest and robustness concerns exist

## Next Checks
1. **Cluster size sensitivity analysis**: Systematically train PixelNeRF with cluster sizes ranging from 3 to 25 views on the same dataset, plotting PSNR against cluster size to identify the true optimum and verify the claimed inflection point.

2. **Synthetic-only generalization test**: Train PixelNeRF exclusively on Aug3D-synthetic views (both grid and semantic variants) and evaluate on real held-out views to quantify domain gap and verify the claim that combined training improves real-data generalization.

3. **Ablation of SfM quality**: Deliberately degrade SfM reconstruction quality (e.g., by reducing input image resolution or keypoint density) and measure the downstream impact on clustering quality and final PSNR to establish the dependency chain from reconstruction to performance.
