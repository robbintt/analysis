# SenseRay-3D: Generalizable and Physics-Informed Framework for End-to-End Indoor Propagation Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12092
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 4.27 dB MAE on unseen indoor propagation environments with real-time inference

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SenseRay-3D, a generalizable and physics-informed framework for end-to-end indoor propagation modeling. The framework directly predicts 3D path-loss heatmaps from RGB-D scans, eliminating the need for manual geometry reconstruction or material annotation. SenseRay-3D uses a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation that encodes occupancy, electromagnetic material characteristics, and transmitter-receiver geometry, which is processed by a SwinUNETR-based neural network to infer environmental path-loss relative to free-space path-loss.

The authors developed a comprehensive synthetic indoor propagation dataset to validate the framework and serve as a standardized benchmark for future research. Experimental results show that SenseRay-3D achieves a mean absolute error of 4.27 dB on unseen environments and supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample. The framework demonstrates scalability, efficiency, and physical consistency, marking a major leap beyond previous work in indoor propagation modeling.

## Method Summary
SenseRay-3D is a deep learning framework that predicts 3D indoor path-loss heatmaps directly from RGB-D scans without requiring explicit 3D geometry reconstruction or material annotation. The method uses a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation encoding occupancy, electromagnetic material properties (reflection/transmission coefficients), and transmitter-receiver geometry. A SwinUNETR neural network processes this representation to predict environmental path-loss residuals relative to free-space path-loss, which are then combined with analytically computed FSPL to produce final predictions. The framework is trained on a synthetic dataset of 56 apartments generated using the 3D-FRONT dataset and Sionna ray tracing at 3.5 GHz.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.27 dB MAE on unseen indoor environments
- Supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample
- Eliminates need for manual geometry reconstruction and material annotation
- Demonstrates strong scalability to novel indoor settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual Path-Loss Decomposition
The framework predicts environmental path-loss as a residual relative to free-space baseline. This decomposition improves training stability by relieving the network from learning trivial distance-dependent decay, allowing it to focus on complex multipath interactions caused by obstacles.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic-to-Electromagnetic Feature Embedding
The system explicitly encodes electromagnetic material properties into the voxel grid by mapping semantic labels to ITU-R standard material parameters and calculating Fresnel coefficients. This transforms the problem from inferring material properties from appearance to computing propagation from known EM properties.

### Mechanism 3: Long-Range Dependency Modeling via Transformers
The SwinUNETR architecture captures global context required for multi-hop reflections through its shifted window attention mechanism. This addresses the non-local nature of indoor propagation where signal reception depends on distant walls and partitions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Friis Transmission Equation & FSPL**: The paper decomposes total loss into FSPL + Environmental Loss. Understanding how $20 \log_{10}(d)$ works is essential to comprehend what the network is not learning (the baseline) versus what it is learning (the residual).
  - Quick check: If distance doubles, how much does FSPL increase in dB?

- **Fresnel Coefficients (Reflection/Transmission)**: The framework converts semantic labels into physical coefficients ($\Gamma, T$) to serve as input channels. Different materials reflect vs. transmit different amounts of energy, which is key to understanding the physics-informed input representation.
  - Quick check: Why would a metal object result in a different input feature vector than a plasterboard wall in this system?

- **Voxelization & 3D Data Structures**: The paper uses a "sensing-driven voxelized scene representation" as the bridge between 2D RGB-D scans and the 3D neural network.
  - Quick check: How does the system handle the trade-off between memory usage and spatial resolution when converting a sparse point cloud to a dense voxel grid?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RGB-D Scans + Semantic Maps -> Back-projection to Point Cloud -> Voxelization (0.1m grid) -> 4-Channel Voxel Tensor -> SwinUNETR -> 1x1 Conv -> Residual $\hat{L}_{env}$ -> Add FSPL

- **Critical path**: The Feature Engineering step (IV-A) is the most fragile link. If semantic segmentation fails or the material lookup table is inaccurate for the specific frequency (3.5 GHz), the network receives corrupted physics priors.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Resolution vs. Memory - A 0.1m voxel size captures furniture but inflates grid size ($D \times H \times W$). The paper pads to $224 \times 224 \times 64$, implying a maximum physical range of ~22.4m × 22.4m × 6.4m. Synthetic vs. Real - The model is trained purely on Sionna data, relying entirely on the fidelity of the ray tracer and 3D-FRONT furniture models.

- **Failure signatures**: High error in distant NLoS regions (expected behavior noted in Section VI); Boundary Artifacts - prediction errors may concentrate on material boundaries where voxel occupancy changes discretely.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check - FSPL Ablation: Train the network to predict *total* path loss (disable residual learning). Compare convergence speed against the proposed residual method to verify the stability claim.
  2. Material Ablation: Replace the calculated reflection/transmission channels with binary occupancy (1/0) only. Measure MAE degradation to quantify the value of the physics-informed input features.
  3. Resolution Sensitivity: Inference on a scene voxelized at 0.2m instead of 0.1m. Observe if performance collapses due to loss of fine geometric details or if SwinUNETR is robust to downsampling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but implies several through its methodology and limitations. The authors mention that future research will "explore the integration of SenseRay-3D to validate its engineering applicability," suggesting that real-world validation is an acknowledged gap.

## Limitations

- Generalization beyond synthetic environments: The model is trained solely on Sionna-generated data, with validation on unseen synthetic apartments. Its performance on real-world sensor noise, furniture variability, and measurement uncertainty remains untested.
- Semantic segmentation dependency: Model performance critically depends on accurate material labeling from 2D segmentation. No ablation or error analysis for segmentation failures is provided.
- Material lookup table constraints: The framework assumes ITU-R material parameters perfectly represent 3.5 GHz behavior in diverse indoor settings. This may not hold for mixed or anomalous materials.

## Confidence

- Residual path-loss decomposition effectiveness: High
- Semantic-to-EM feature encoding value: Medium
- SwinUNETR architecture superiority for propagation: Medium
- Real-time inference claims (217 ms): High
- Scalability to unseen environments: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Real-world validation: Test SenseRay-3D on an indoor propagation dataset with actual RF measurements to assess synthetic-to-real generalization.
2. Segmentation robustness: Create corrupted semantic inputs and measure degradation in MAE to quantify dependency on segmentation accuracy.
3. Material lookup stress test: Substitute ITU-R parameters with randomized or adversarial material coefficients and observe if model predictions degrade systematically.
