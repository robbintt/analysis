- This paper unveils the landscape of clinical depression assessment through a novel multimodal dataset and analysis. C-MIND, a clinically validated dataset, contains 169 participants completing three psychiatric tasks with audio, video, transcript, and fNIRS recordings, plus expert DSM-5 diagnoses. The study analyzes behavioral signatures across tasks and modalities, finding that audio and video are most informative, with picture description eliciting the strongest depressive markers. Modality and task fusion improve diagnostic performance. The paper also examines LLM psychiatric reasoning, finding clear limitations but showing that structured clinical expertise guidance improves performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. This work establishes critical infrastructure for developing clinically-grounded computational depression assessment systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents C-MIND, a clinically validated multimodal dataset for depression assessment, and conducts comprehensive analysis of behavioral signatures across three psychiatric tasks and four modalities. The study finds that audio and video capture the strongest depressive markers, with picture description tasks outperforming other task types. It demonstrates that modality and task fusion improves diagnostic performance and stability. The paper also evaluates seven LLMs on psychiatric reasoning tasks, showing that structured clinical expertise guidance can improve performance by up to 10% Macro-F1, though general multimodal LLMs struggle with fine-grained non-verbal cue interpretation.

## Method Summary
The study uses C-MIND, a dataset of 169 participants (86 MDD, 83 HC) completing three psychiatric tasks: Interview, Picture Description, and Verbal Fluency Task. Each task is recorded in four modalities: audio (44.1kHz), video (640x480, 30fps), transcripts (Chinese), and fNIRS (45 channels). Features are extracted using classical methods (OpenSmile, OpenFace, DeBERTa, fNIRS statistics) and foundation models (Qwen2-Audio, Qwen2.5-VL, Qwen3). Six classical models (LSTM, CNN, MLP, k-NN, RF, SVM) and seven LLMs are evaluated. The primary metric is Macro-F1, with 6:2:2 train/val/test split and 5 random seeds.

## Key Results
- Picture Description Task elicits the strongest depressive markers, achieving 94.10% Macro-F1 with audio features
- Audio and video modalities provide stronger signals than transcripts, with modality fusion improving performance and reducing variance
- Structured clinical expertise guidance improves LLM psychiatric reasoning by up to 10% Macro-F1 in zero-shot settings
- General multimodal LLMs underperform text-only models on depression assessment tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Picture Description Task (PDT) elicits the strongest depressive markers across modalities.
- Mechanism: PDT probes emotional and attentional biases by requiring participants to interpret visual stimuli. Depressed individuals exhibit negative interpretation bias, provide less detailed descriptions, show flat vocal tone (audio), and display blunted affect (video). These multi-channel manifestations create richer diagnostic signal than tasks probing single cognitive domains.
- Core assumption: The visual interpretation demands of PDT activate cognitive-affective pathways where depressive biases are most consistently observable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "The Picture Description Task (PDT)... proving to be the most effective probe in our analysis... evidenced by the top-performing model, which achieved a 94.10% Macro-F1 score using audio features from the PDT."
  - [section 3.2] "Picture description tasks assess imagination, semantic flow, and emotional valence... Depressed individuals may show negative bias or limited detail"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for PDT superiority; related work focuses on interview tasks.
- Break condition: If depressed populations show preserved visual interpretation (e.g., due to comorbidities or cultural factors), PDT advantage diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modality and task fusion improve diagnostic robustness by reducing performance variance.
- Mechanism: Aggregating evidence from multiple modalities (Audio+Video) or tasks (INT+PDT) provides complementary signals that compensate for individual channel noise. Audio captures prosodic features, video captures facial dynamics, and transcripts capture semantic content. Fusion averages out modality-specific artifacts and captures depression's multi-faceted presentation.
- Core assumption: Different modalities provide non-redundant information about depressive states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Modality and task fusion improve diagnostic performance."
  - [section 4.2] "Fusing evidence from multiple sources enhances diagnostic performance... leads to higher Macro-F1 scores and, critically, more stable and reliable predictions by reducing variance."
  - [corpus] Latent space fusion work (arxiv 2507.14175) supports advanced fusion strategies for multimodal psychiatric data.
- Break condition: If modalities are highly correlated (redundant), fusion gains plateau and computational cost increases without benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structured clinical expertise guidance improves LLM diagnostic reasoning by up to 10% Macro-F1.
- Mechanism: Clinical expertise guidance provides task-specific diagnostic expectations (e.g., what healthy vs. depressed responses look like in each task type). This structured prompt helps LLMs attend to clinically relevant patterns—distinguishing fleeting complaints from pervasive negativity, recognizing protective factors like emotional expressiveness—and prevents over-weighting isolated signals.
- Core assumption: LLMs possess latent clinical reasoning capacity that can be activated through structured prompts rather than requiring fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "structured clinical expertise guidance improves performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score."
  - [section 4.3] "Psychiatric Reasoning consistently improves zero-shot performance... the structured psychiatric prompt yields stable gains (e.g., +7.01% for GPT-4o)"
  - [corpus] MAGI (arxiv 2504.18260) similarly uses structured interview protocols to guide LLM-based psychiatric assessment.
- Break condition: Models with strong built-in reasoning (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) showed performance degradation when external reasoning guidance conflicted with internal protocols.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Behavioral signatures
  - Why needed here: The paper defines these as "observable patterns in speech, facial expression, and neural activity indicative of depressive states." Understanding this concept is essential before interpreting task/modality analysis results.
  - Quick check question: Can you name three types of behavioral signatures captured in C-MIND and which modality each comes from?

- Concept: Psychiatric task design (INT, PDT, VFT)
  - Why needed here: Each task probes different cognitive-affective domains. INT probes emotional tone and autobiographical specificity; PDT probes emotional valence and attentional bias; VFT probes executive function and semantic memory. Task selection directly affects what signals are available.
  - Quick check question: Why might VFT show weaker transcript-only performance than PDT, despite both involving verbal output?

- Concept: Clinical grounding vs. self-report labels
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes DSM-5 diagnoses by senior psychiatrists as gold-standard labels, contrasting with self-report questionnaires (PHQ-8, etc.) used in prior datasets. This affects label reliability and model generalization.
  - Quick check question: What are two limitations of self-report questionnaires that clinical diagnosis addresses?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Collection Pipeline: 169 participants → 3 psychiatric tasks (10 tests total) → 4 synchronized modalities (audio 44.1kHz, video 640x480 30fps, transcript via ASR+manual proofread, fNIRS 45 channels) → DSM-5 clinical diagnosis + 8 questionnaires
  - Feature Extraction: Two parallel pathways—(1) Classical features (OpenSmile 88-dim audio, OpenFace 4,963-dim video, DeBERTa 768-dim text, fNIRS 630-dim statistics), (2) Foundation model embeddings (Qwen2-Audio 4096-dim, Qwen2.5-VL 8192-dim, Qwen3 text 4096-dim)
  - Modeling Layer: Six classical backbones (LSTM, CNN, MLP, k-NN, RF, SVM) with fusion mechanisms; separate LLM evaluation track
  - LLM Reasoning Module: Three strategies (Direct Prediction, Vanilla Reasoning, Psychiatric Reasoning) across 7 models, zero-shot and few-shot conditions

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure synchronized multimodal recording with precise timestamps (video and fNIRS require segmentation by task timestamps)
  2. Extract features per task-modality pair before any fusion
  3. For classical models: normalize per modality, apply batch normalization before dimension reduction
  4. For LLM evaluation: concatenate all 10 task transcripts into single prompt; clinical guidance prompt must include task-specific diagnostic expectations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Classical vs. foundation model features: Classical features (e.g., eGeMAPS) are interpretable and lower-dimensional; foundation embeddings capture semantic richness but are opaque and require more compute
  - Early fusion (concatenation) vs. weighted gating fusion: Paper uses both—concatenation for task/modality fusion experiments, gated fusion in LSTM architecture for multimodal integration
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot LLM prompting: Zero-shot benefits most from psychiatric reasoning guidance; few-shot can conflict with structured prompts for some models (DeepSeek-R1 degradation)

- Failure signatures:
  - Multimodal LLM underperformance: Qwen2.5-Omni achieved only 46.36% Macro-F1 with psychiatric reasoning, worse than transcript-only models—general multimodal LLMs lack fine-grained clinical non-verbal cue processing
  - Thinking-model interference: Models with internal reasoning protocols (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3 thinking mode) showed degradation when external reasoning guidance was applied (-22.5% in worst case)
  - fNIRS feature weakness: Statistical fNIRS features showed high variance across models (45.36-73.30 Macro-F1 in PDT), likely due to absence of pretrained encoders

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate single task-modality baseline: Train SVM on OpenSmile audio features from PDT only. Expected result: ~88-94% Macro-F1. If significantly lower, check data preprocessing pipeline.
  2. Test modality fusion with ablation: Compare Audio-only vs. Audio+Video vs. Audio+Video+Transcript using RF backbone on PDT task. Monitor both Macro-F1 and variance across 5 runs.
  3. Evaluate Psychiatric Reasoning prompt on held-out LLM: Apply the paper's psychiatric reasoning prompt structure to GPT-4o with INT+VFT task combination. Compare Direct vs. Vanilla vs. Psychiatric reasoning strategies in zero-shot setting. Expected: ~7-10% improvement from Direct to Psychiatric.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the battery of eight psychometric questionnaires be integrated with behavioral signatures to enhance diagnostic performance or symptom severity regression?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.2.1 states that "questionnaire data are reserved for future work," as the current study relies solely on clinical diagnosis labels.
- Why unresolved: The dataset contains rich psychometric scores (HAMD, HAMA, etc.) that are currently unused, leaving their potential to augment behavioral signals untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Future experiments modeling multi-task learning objectives that combine behavioral classification with questionnaire-based severity prediction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific adaptations are required for general-purpose multimodal LLMs to effectively utilize clinical non-verbal cues?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.3 notes that the multimodal model Qwen2.5-Omni "consistently underperforms" and lacks "fine-grained capability to utilize clinical non-verbal cues effectively without task-specific tuning."
- Why unresolved: Simply adding video/audio inputs to LLMs degrades performance, suggesting a fundamental misalignment between general pre-training objectives and fine-grained clinical signal interpretation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating that specialized instruction tuning or architectural modifications allow multimodal LLMs to surpass text-only baselines on the C-MIND dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can pre-trained encoders for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals improve diagnostic utility over classical statistical features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.1 explains that fNIRS features are limited to statistics "due to the absence of public pretrained encoders" for this modality.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on handcrafted statistical vectors (63 dimensions) which may fail to capture complex temporal brain activity patterns that a foundation model could extract.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and benchmarking a pre-trained fNIRS encoder on C-MIND to determine if it yields higher Macro-F1 scores than the statistical baseline.

## Limitations
- Dataset accessibility: C-MIND is not publicly available, preventing independent validation
- Language/cultural specificity: Findings based on Mandarin Chinese clinical populations may not generalize
- fNIRS feature limitations: Statistical features used due to absence of pretrained encoders, potentially missing complex neural patterns

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Task superiority hierarchy (PDT > INT > VFT), audio/video superiority over transcripts, modality fusion reducing variance, clinical guidance improving LLM reasoning
- Medium Confidence: Quantitative performance improvement magnitudes, cross-cultural generalizability, LLM strategy stability
- Low Confidence: fNIRS feature effectiveness, real-world clinical deployment feasibility

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Accessibility Verification**: Attempt to obtain C-MIND dataset through the contact channels provided, or identify equivalent clinically-grounded depression datasets in other languages for cross-validation of the task-modality performance hierarchy.

2. **Prompt Structure Completeness**: Contact authors to obtain the complete psychiatric reasoning prompt text used in Table 5, ensuring faithful reproduction of the LLM evaluation protocol across different model families.

3. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Replicate the core analysis pipeline (task-modality selection, feature extraction, fusion strategies) on a depression dataset from a different linguistic/cultural background (e.g., English-speaking populations) to test generalizability of the observed behavioral signature patterns.
