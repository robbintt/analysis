# Explainable Reinforcement Learning via Temporal Policy Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03902
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03902
- Reference count: 16
- Introduces Temporal Policy Decomposition (TPD) for explaining RL policies through temporal decomposition of value functions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Temporal Policy Decomposition (TPD), a novel approach for explaining Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies by decomposing value functions along the temporal dimension. TPD generates explanations in terms of Expected Future Outcomes (EFOs) - predictions of what will happen at each future time step when following a policy. The method uses Fixed-Horizon Temporal Difference learning to train off-policy models that can predict EFOs for any state-action pair, enabling contrastive explanations comparing different actions. Evaluated in a modified Taxi environment with fuel consumption and traffic dynamics, TPD successfully generated intuitive explanations that clarified the policy's strategy and demonstrated high prediction accuracy with mean squared errors below 10^-4 for most outcomes.

## Method Summary
TPD leverages Fixed-Horizon Temporal Difference learning to train off-policy models that predict Expected Future Outcomes (EFOs) for any state-action pair, not just those chosen by the target policy. This enables the generation of contrastive explanations comparing different actions by decomposing the value function along the temporal dimension. The approach allows users to understand when specific outcomes are expected to occur and supports fine-tuning of reward functions to better align with human expectations.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated intuitive explanations in modified Taxi environment that clarified policy strategy
- Demonstrated high prediction accuracy with mean squared errors below 10^-4 for most outcomes
- Enabled contrastive explanations comparing different actions through off-policy EFO predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TPD works by decomposing value functions temporally, allowing the model to predict Expected Future Outcomes (EFOs) for any state-action pair. This temporal decomposition enables the creation of interpretable explanations that show users what will happen at each future time step when following a policy. The use of Fixed-Horizon Temporal Difference learning allows training off-policy models, which is crucial for generating contrastive explanations between different actions.

## Foundational Learning
1. Temporal Difference Learning - needed for learning value function predictions over time; quick check: verify TD error converges during training
2. Fixed-Horizon Learning - needed to limit prediction horizon and manage computational complexity; quick check: confirm horizon parameter affects prediction accuracy
3. Off-Policy Learning - needed to generate explanations for actions not taken by the target policy; quick check: verify model can predict EFOs for arbitrary state-action pairs
4. Value Function Decomposition - needed to break down complex policies into interpretable temporal components; quick check: ensure decomposed components sum to original value function
5. Contrastive Explanation Generation - needed to compare outcomes between different actions; quick check: verify explanation differences align with action differences
6. Expected Future Outcomes Prediction - needed to create interpretable, time-granular explanations; quick check: validate predictions match actual outcomes in test environment

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: State-Action Pair -> Fixed-Horizon TD Learner -> EFO Predictor -> Explanation Generator

Critical Path: The core pipeline involves taking a state-action pair, processing it through the Fixed-Horizon TD learner to predict Expected Future Outcomes at each time step, then generating human-readable explanations from these temporal predictions.

Design Tradeoffs: Fixed-horizon approach balances computational efficiency with explanation granularity, while off-policy learning enables contrastive explanations at the cost of additional model complexity.

Failure Signatures: Poor prediction accuracy (high MSE) indicates learning issues; inability to generate meaningful contrastive explanations suggests problems with off-policy generalization.

First Experiments:
1. Verify TD error converges during Fixed-Horizon TD training
2. Test EFO predictions on held-out state-action pairs
3. Generate and qualitatively assess explanations in simple grid-world environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions: how TPD generalizes to more complex domains beyond the Taxi environment, whether the generated explanations actually improve human understanding and decision-making, and how TPD compares to existing explanation methods. The authors also note the need for more rigorous theoretical grounding of the policy decomposition claims and sparse implementation details for the Fixed-Horizon TD learning approach.

## Limitations
- Only tested in a single, modified Taxi environment, raising generalization concerns
- Lacks user studies to validate whether explanations actually improve human understanding
- No comparison to existing explanation methods beyond superficial mentions
- Theoretical claims lack rigorous mathematical proofs
- Sparse implementation details limit reproducibility

## Confidence
- Technical Approach: High confidence - well-defined mathematical formulation
- Empirical Results: Medium confidence - limited to single environment
- Practical Effectiveness: Low confidence - no user validation studies

## Next Checks
1. Implement TPD in at least two additional RL domains (e.g., Atari games and continuous control tasks) to assess generalization
2. Conduct user studies comparing TPD explanations against baseline methods (feature importance, attention visualization) to measure actual human understanding
3. Perform ablation studies removing the contrastive explanation capability to quantify its contribution to explanation quality
