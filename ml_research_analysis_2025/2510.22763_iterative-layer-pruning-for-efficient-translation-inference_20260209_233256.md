# Iterative Layer Pruning for Efficient Translation Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.22763
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22763
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** Iterative layer pruning achieves 4x inference speedup while maintaining translation quality on large language models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an iterative layer pruning approach to compress large language models for efficient translation inference. The method identifies and removes the least critical layers from the Aya-Expanse-8B model using layer importance evaluation, followed by fine-tuning on medium-sized datasets. The approach successfully reduces model size and inference time while preserving translation quality, with the English-to-Egyptian Arabic direction even showing performance improvements over the baseline. The work addresses the practical challenge of deploying large translation models in resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an iterative layer pruning methodology that begins with layer importance evaluation to identify the least critical components of the Aya-Expanse-8B model. Layers are incrementally removed in order of importance, creating progressively smaller model variants. Each pruned model undergoes fine-tuning on medium-sized translation datasets to recover any lost performance. The approach leverages vLLM as the inference engine to measure speed improvements. By systematically evaluating translation quality across different pruning levels, the method identifies optimal compression points where significant size reduction and speedup can be achieved with minimal quality degradation.

## Key Results
- Czech-to-German translation: 8-layer pruning retains 98% of baseline quality
- English-to-Egyptian Arabic: Models pruned up to 16 layers outperform baseline after fine-tuning
- vLLM inference engine delivers more than 4x speedup for pruned models
- Fine-tuning successfully recovers performance after layer removal

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Layer pruning works by identifying and removing redundant or less critical components while preserving the essential architecture needed for translation tasks. The iterative approach ensures that each removal step is followed by fine-tuning, which allows the remaining layers to adapt and compensate for the missing information. The Aya-Expanse-8B model likely contains layers that contribute more to general language understanding than to specific translation capabilities, making them candidates for removal. Fine-tuning on task-specific data helps the compressed model maintain or even improve performance by focusing the remaining capacity on the most relevant patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Transformer Architecture**: Why needed - Understanding self-attention mechanisms and layer interactions; Quick check - Can you explain how residual connections preserve information flow during pruning?

**Layer Importance Evaluation**: Why needed - Identifying which layers contribute most to translation quality; Quick check - What metrics would you use to quantify layer importance?

**Knowledge Distillation**: Why needed - Understanding how smaller models can match larger ones' performance; Quick check - How does fine-tuning compensate for information loss from pruning?

**Inference Optimization**: Why needed - Measuring practical deployment benefits; Quick check - What factors besides model size affect inference speed?

## Architecture Onboarding

The Aya-Expanse-8B model follows a standard decoder-only transformer architecture where each layer consists of self-attention and feed-forward networks connected by residual connections. The component map is: Input Embedding -> Layer Stack (N layers) -> Output Projection. The critical path involves the layer stack where translation knowledge is encoded. Design tradeoffs include balancing compression ratio against quality retention, with the iterative approach allowing for fine-grained control. Failure signatures include quality degradation when too many layers are removed or when fine-tuning is insufficient. Three first experiments: 1) Run layer importance evaluation to identify pruning candidates, 2) Perform incremental pruning with fine-tuning at each step, 3) Measure quality and speed trade-offs across pruning levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

The evaluation is limited to only two translation directions with medium-sized datasets, restricting generalizability. The surprising quality improvements for English-to-Egyptian Arabic may indicate dataset-specific effects rather than genuine capability enhancement. The 4x speedup claim needs verification across different inference engines and hardware configurations beyond vLLM.

## Confidence

- Layer importance evaluation methodology: **High**
- Iterative pruning approach: **High**
- Fine-tuning effectiveness: **Medium**
- Speed improvement claims: **Medium**
- Generalization across language pairs: **Low**

## Next Checks

1. Test the pruning approach on additional language pairs and domains to verify generalizability beyond the current evaluation set.

2. Conduct ablation studies removing different layer ranges (not just the least important) to understand the relationship between layer position and translation quality.

3. Evaluate the pruned models using different inference engines (beyond vLLM) and hardware configurations to confirm the claimed speed improvements are consistent across deployment scenarios.
