# Denoising and Baseline Correction of Low-Scan FTIR Spectra: A Benchmark of Deep Learning Models Against Traditional Signal Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20905
- Reference count: 0
- The cascade U-Net architecture achieved a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, outperforming both a standard single U-Net (40.2% reduction) and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow (33.7% reduction).

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of high-quality Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging for clinical applications, which typically requires extensive signal averaging, severely limiting imaging speed. The authors propose a physics-informed cascade U-Net architecture that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture enforces spectroscopic constraints using an embedded SNIP layer, enabling the model to focus on high-frequency denoising and fine-scale artifact refinement. The cascade model achieved a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, outperforming both a standard single U-Net (40.2% reduction) and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow (33.7% reduction).

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage U-Net architecture with a deterministic Physics Bridge containing an embedded SNIP layer. The pipeline processes raw low-quality (1-8 scan) FTIR spectra through Otsu masking, water vapor subtraction, spectral trimming, SNV normalization, and min-max scaling. Unet 1 performs denoising while preserving baseline, the Physics Bridge removes baseline using SNIP, and Unet 2 refines residual artifacts. Training uses deep supervision with MSE loss at both stages, optimized with Adadelta (lr=0.05, batch=32, patience=30, max 5000 epochs). The evaluation uses Leave-One-Sample-Out cross-validation on FaDu cell FTIR hyperspectral images.

## Key Results
- Cascade U-Net achieved 51.3% RMSE reduction versus raw single-scan inputs
- Outperformed standard single U-Net (40.2% reduction) and traditional SG+SNIP workflow (33.7% reduction)
- Demonstrated superior peak fidelity with 51.3% RMSE reduction versus 40.2% for single U-Net
- Showed 32× faster imaging speeds compared to current methods
- Achieved lowest bias (-0.6%) with highest precision (IQR of 0.024) in peak intensity estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Task decomposition via the Physics Bridge reduces learning ambiguity that causes spectral hallucinations. The single U-Net must learn a coupled mapping (noise suppression + baseline estimation + removal) from statistical correlations alone. This ill-posed inverse problem forces the network to approximate whether low-frequency content is drift or signal. The cascade architecture separates these: Unet 1 targets baseline-preserved spectra (denoising only), the deterministic Physics Bridge handles baseline removal, and Unet 2 refines residual artifacts.

### Mechanism 2
Embedding a deterministic SNIP layer enforces spectroscopic constraints that immunize the model against out-of-distribution environmental drift. SNIP operates via iterative geometric peak clipping based on absolute intensity ratios—a fixed mathematical transformation rather than learned weights. Because it does not rely on training distribution statistics, it processes novel baseline curvatures identically. The inverse normalization step restores physical absorbance units before SNIP, ensuring the algorithm operates in its intended domain.

### Mechanism 3
Two-stage residual refinement preserves peak fidelity better than end-to-end or purely traditional approaches. Unet 2 learns only a residual correction function to repair SNIP artifacts (attenuated broad peak bases, residual curvature). This is a narrower learning objective than full baseline removal, allowing higher-capacity allocation to fine-scale feature preservation. The deep supervision strategy ensures gradient signals reach both stages appropriately.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ill-posed inverse problems in signal processing
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly frames simultaneous noise/baseline separation as ill-posed without ground truth. Understanding why multiple solutions exist clarifies why the Physics Bridge is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Given a noisy spectrum with unknown baseline, can you uniquely determine the true signal? Why does adding a physical constraint help?

- Concept: SNIP (Sensitive Nonlinear Iterative Peak) algorithm
  - Why needed here: The Physics Bridge embeds SNIP as its core operation. Understanding its geometric peak-clipping mechanism explains why it generalizes where learned approaches fail.
  - Quick check question: Why does SNIP require physical (non-normalized) intensity values to function correctly?

- Concept: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
  - Why needed here: The cascade architecture exemplifies embedding domain knowledge as non-learnable layers rather than relying on learned approximations.
  - Quick check question: What is the tradeoff between embedding physics as a fixed layer versus learning it from data with regularization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input pipeline -> Unet 1 (denoising) -> Physics Bridge (baseline removal) -> Unet 2 (artifact refinement) -> Output

- Critical path: Input → Unet 1 (denoising) → Physics Bridge (baseline removal) → Unet 2 (artifact refinement) → Output. The Physics Bridge remains active during inference.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Inference latency: Cascade = 2.29 ms/spectrum vs single U-Net = 0.28 ms (Physics Bridge requires CPU-GPU data transfer for SNIP)
  - Parameter count: Cascade = ~43M vs single U-Net = ~21.5M
  - Stability vs speed: The deterministic bridge guarantees generalization to drift but adds computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Single U-Net on drift data: Wide error distribution, spectral hallucinations, high outlier rate
  - Traditional SG+SNIP: Systematic peak broadening, -1.6% median intensity bias, large peak position errors
  - Cascade (potential): If normalization statistics are misapplied, SNIP operates on distorted ratios producing incorrect baselines

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the LOSO-CV baseline: Train single U-Net and cascade U-Net on three FaDu samples, test on the held-out fourth. Verify RMSE reduction hierarchy (cascade > single U-Net > SG+SNIP).
  2. Ablation study on Physics Bridge: Replace the deterministic SNIP layer with a learned baseline removal network and measure: (a) performance on drift-affected FaDu3, (b) peak intensity bias variance. Expect degraded stability.
  3. Domain shift test: Apply trained models to a different cell line or tissue type with distinct spectral characteristics. Quantify whether the cascade maintains its stability advantage when biological features shift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the cascade U-Net generalize to heterogeneous clinical tissue sections while maintaining the reported peak fidelity? The authors conclude the method "paves the way for... routine histopathology of large tissue sections," yet the validation was restricted to the monoclonal FaDu cell line. The tested dataset contains "realistic biochemical heterogeneity" of a single cell line, but clinical tissue sections involve complex, varying structural matrices and diverse pathologies not present in the training data.

### Open Question 2
Can the "Physics Bridge" latency be eliminated to achieve single-network inference speeds? The results section notes the cascade model is significantly slower (2.29 ms) than the single U-Net (0.28 ms) due to the "Physics Bridge bottleneck," where data moves from GPU to CPU for the SNIP calculation. The reliance on a non-differentiable, CPU-bound SNIP algorithm creates a computational bottleneck that hinders real-time processing despite the superior spectral reconstruction.

### Open Question 3
Is the model's performance limited by the definition of 32-scan spectra as the ground truth? The introduction acknowledges that standard protocols often require 128 scans for high quality, while the methodology defines 32 scans as the High Quality (HQ) ground truth. The network learns to minimize error relative to a 32-scan target; it is unclear if the model can recover signal features beyond the noise floor of this specific ground truth.

## Limitations
- U-Net architecture specifics (depth, filter sizes, ResNet block configuration) are not fully specified
- SNIP algorithm hyperparameters (window size, iteration count) remain unspecified
- Limited evaluation to single cell line (FaDu) raises questions about generalizability
- Only four training samples used in LOSO-CV, which may not adequately test model robustness

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Cascade architecture achieves 51.3% RMSE reduction vs raw single-scan inputs; Physics Bridge stabilizes performance against environmental drift
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority over traditional SG+SNIP workflow (33.7% reduction); peak fidelity preservation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: 32× imaging speed improvement claim; requires verification under real clinical workflow conditions

## Next Checks
1. **Domain shift evaluation**: Apply trained models to FTIR spectra from different cell lines/tissue types to quantify generalization beyond FaDu data
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary SNIP window size and iteration count to determine robustness of Physics Bridge performance
3. **Clinical workflow integration**: Benchmark actual imaging throughput (not just per-spectrum latency) in a simulated clinical setting with full preprocessing pipeline
