# Atomic Thinking of LLMs: Decoupling and Exploring Mathematical Reasoning Abilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25725
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Decoupling mathematical reasoning into atomic field-specific and logical capabilities enables targeted training, revealing positive transfer from algebra and highlighting challenges in geometry, topology, and counterexample reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for evaluating and analyzing the atomic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. By decoupling mathematical abilities into field-specific (algebra, geometry, analysis, topology) and logical reasoning (conceptual understanding, forward reasoning with formal language, backward reasoning with counterexamples) components, the authors construct targeted training and evaluation datasets. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform better in algebra and analysis but struggle in geometry and topology, with topology showing unusual performance patterns. Cross-field and cross-logic interactions are explored, showing that algebraic abilities positively influence other fields, and conceptual understanding supports higher-level reasoning. Commercial models outperform smaller open-source ones, especially in conceptual understanding and formal reasoning. However, even advanced models face challenges with counterexamples and abstract reasoning. These findings emphasize the need for fine-grained training strategies and suggest a shift from problem-drilling to atomic thinking in mathematical reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors construct isolated training and evaluation datasets for each atomic mathematical capability, covering four fields (algebra, geometry, analysis, topology) at two difficulty levels and three logical reasoning types (conceptual understanding, forward reasoning with formal language, backward reasoning with counterexamples). Data is curated from existing benchmarks (MATH, GSM8K, Gaokao-Bench, OlympiadBench, AIME, MMLU, DeepMath, NaturalProofs, LeanWorkbook, CounterMath) and classified by field and difficulty. Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-7B is fine-tuned with LoRA on each atomic subset separately. Models are evaluated using accuracy for field/conceptual/forward tasks and F-1 plus example-alignment metrics for counterexample backward reasoning. Cross-training experiments measure transfer effects between atomic capabilities.

## Key Results
- Models perform better in algebra and analysis than geometry and topology, with topology showing unusual performance inversion (better on hard than easy tasks).
- Training on algebraic capabilities yields positive transfer to other fields, often more than in-field training.
- Strengthening conceptual understanding enhances higher-level logical reasoning (forward and backward).
- Commercial models outperform open-source ones, especially in conceptual understanding and formal reasoning.
- Models struggle with counterexamples and abstract reasoning, even after targeted training.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decoupling mathematical reasoning into field-specific and logic-based atomic capabilities enables finer-grained capability assessment and targeted improvement.
- Mechanism: By constructing isolated training/evaluation datasets for each atomic capability (e.g., algebra-level1, conceptual-understanding-definition), the framework reduces conflated signals from end-to-end problem-solving. This allows training to stimulate specific atomic units and measure transfer effects, revealing dependencies that chain-of-thought approaches obscure.
- Core assumption: Atomic capabilities are sufficiently separable that training on one minimally contaminates evaluation of others, and performance on atomic tasks correlates with compositional reasoning ability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1) field-specific abilities... (2) logical abilities... We propose corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit."
  - [section 3.2] Describes data construction to decouple each atomic capability with balanced sampling and difficulty annotation.
  - [corpus] Related work on atomic step decomposition (e.g., "Can Atomic Step Decomposition Enhance...") supports the premise but does not validate this specific framework.
- Break condition: If atomic capabilities are highly entangled in model representations, training on one unit may not cleanly isolate effects; or if atomic performance does not generalize to complex compositional tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stimulating algebraic atomic capability yields positive transfer to other mathematical fields (geometry, analysis, topology), often more than in-field training.
- Mechanism: Algebraic reasoning emphasizes fundamental symbolic manipulation and structural reasoning patterns that are reused across fields. Training on algebraic tasks may activate general reasoning primitives that benefit other domains, whereas direct training in underrepresented fields (e.g., topology) may suffer from data scarcity or distribution mismatch.
- Core assumption: The observed transfer is causal (not due to dataset overlap or spurious correlation), and algebraic data quality/coverage is higher than other fields.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3.1/Table 3] Shows Qwen-train-Algebra improves geometry (+13.6 at low level) more than Qwen-train-Geometry (+5.2), and analysis (+8.1 low, +5.0 high) vs. in-field (+4.1, -1.6).
  - [abstract] "Cross-field and cross-logic interactions are explored, showing that algebraic abilities positively influence other fields."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; transfer claims are specific to this paper's experimental setup.
- Break condition: If test sets have leakage or if algebra training inadvertently includes multi-field problems; if the effect does not replicate across different base models or datasets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Strengthening conceptual understanding (definitions, attributes) enhances higher-level logical reasoning (forward reasoning with formal language, backward reasoning with counterexamples).
- Mechanism: Conceptual understanding provides a structured knowledge scaffold that improves symbol grounding and reduces ambiguity in multi-step reasoning. Fill-in-the-blank definition tasks may reinforce precise concept boundaries, which then supports more accurate formal language manipulation and counterexample construction.
- Core assumption: The observed improvements are not due to surface-level pattern matching but reflect deeper conceptual consolidation; the definition-completion tasks are sufficiently comprehensive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3.2/Table 5] Qwen-train-Concept improves forward reasoning accuracy from 34.4 to 53.5 (+19.1) and backward reasoning F-1 from 30.2 to 40.1 (+9.9).
  - [abstract] "Conceptual understanding enhances other reasoning abilities and field atomic abilities."
  - [corpus] Related work on knowledgeable RL and thinking-centric fine-tuning aligns with the importance of structured knowledge but does not specifically validate this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the definition tasks are narrow and improvements reflect memorization rather than generalization; if gains do not transfer to out-of-distribution concepts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Capability Decoupling vs. End-to-End Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core methodology; understanding that evaluating reasoning via final-answer accuracy conflates multiple skills. Decoupling enables targeted intervention.
  - Quick check question: Can you design an evaluation protocol that distinguishes between a student's understanding of geometric axioms versus their ability to construct a counterexample?

- Concept: **Transfer Learning and Negative Transfer in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The interaction experiments (cross-field, cross-logic) reveal both positive and negative transfer effects. Predicting when stimulating one capability hurts another is critical.
  - Quick check question: Given that training on topology low-difficulty data hurts algebra high-difficulty performance (Table 3), what factors might explain this negative transfer?

- Concept: **Formal Language as a Reasoning Tool in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Forward reasoning is evaluated using formal mathematical languages (e.g., Lean). Understanding why formal languages help (reduced ambiguity) and where models struggle is key.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model that performs well on natural language math problems fail on the same problem expressed in Lean4?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Layer: Field-atomic datasets (4 fields × 2 difficulty levels) + Logic-atomic datasets (conceptual, forward, backward)
  - Training Module: LoRA fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-7B for specific atomic units
  - Evaluation Suite: Accuracy for field/conceptual/forward tasks; F-1 + example-alignment metrics for backward reasoning
  - Analysis Framework: Cross-training experiments to measure transfer effects between atomic capabilities

- Critical path:
  1. Start by evaluating a base model on all atomic test sets to establish baselines
  2. Select one atomic capability (e.g., algebra low-difficulty) and fine-tune on its training set
  3. Re-evaluate on all atomic test sets to measure transfer
  4. Repeat for other atomic units to map the interaction graph

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Granularity vs. Complexity**: Four fields and three logic levels are manageable but may not capture all nuances (e.g., probability, number theory omitted). Finer granularity increases interaction complexity
  - **Data Quality vs. Scale**: Curating high-quality, difficulty-balanced data for each atomic unit is resource-intensive; small datasets may limit training effectiveness
  - **Isolation vs. Realism**: Atomic tasks are simplified; real math problems often require interleaving multiple capabilities. High atomic performance may not fully predict complex problem-solving

- Failure signatures:
  - **Negative Transfer**: Training on field X hurts performance on field Y (e.g., topology training hurting analysis)
  - **Conceptual Forgetting**: Training on high-level reasoning degrades definition-recognition accuracy
  - **Difficulty Inversion**: Models perform better on hard tasks than easy ones in topology, suggesting data/evaluation misalignment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate Cross-Field Transfer**: Train Qwen2.5-Math-7B on algebra data and evaluate on geometry/analysis/topology. Verify if positive transfer holds with different random seeds
  2. **Ablate Conceptual Understanding**: Train on definition-completion only vs. definition + attribute-description. Measure impact on forward reasoning to test if both sub-components are necessary
  3. **Test Difficulty Balance**: Train with varying proportions of low/high difficulty data within a field (e.g., algebra) and observe performance on both levels to validate the claimed need for difficulty balancing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can advanced training strategies like curriculum learning or reinforcement learning be specifically designed to elicit targeted mathematical atomic capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states, "we have not explored more advanced strategies to stimulate a specific atomic capability, such as curriculum learning or reinforcement learning."
- Why unresolved: The current study relied on supervised LoRA fine-tuning to explore interactions, leaving the potential of dynamic, reward-based, or ordered training paradigms untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments demonstrating that curriculum learning schedules or RL-based rewards yield higher accuracy and better cross-capability transfer than standard supervised fine-tuning.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why do models exhibit counterintuitive performance patterns in Topology, achieving higher accuracy on high-difficulty tasks than low-difficulty ones?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1 notes "an interesting anomaly arises in Topology, where models sometimes perform better on harder problems than on easier ones" and encourages "deeper exploration."
- Why unresolved: The authors hypothesize that high-difficulty problems may incidentally align with abstract pre-training patterns, but this mismatch between human-defined difficulty and model capability is not empirically verified.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis mapping model attention patterns or internal representations to specific topological axioms to determine why "harder" problems trigger correct latent knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific mechanisms drive the negative transfer observed when training on Topology tasks, which degrades performance in Algebra and Analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3.1 observes that "strengthening atomic abilities in Topology led to performance declines in Algebra and Analysis" and suggests this may be due to "substantial data distribution divergence."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the phenomenon and the correlation, but does not isolate whether the degradation stems from optimization interference, catastrophic forgetting, or representational conflicts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Gradient conflict analysis (e.g., cosine similarity of gradients) between Topology and Algebra tasks during training to quantify the interference.

## Limitations
- The framework's assumption that atomic capabilities are separable may not hold if capabilities are highly entangled in model representations.
- The unusual topology performance inversion suggests possible data imbalance or evaluation artifact rather than genuine model behavior.
- The study focuses on a single base model (Qwen2.5-Math-7B) and a specific training regime (LoRA), limiting generalizability.

## Confidence
- **High**: The framework for decoupling atomic capabilities is well-defined and the data construction pipeline is detailed. The general trend that algebra and analysis outperform geometry and topology is plausible and aligns with known difficulty patterns in math education.
- **Medium**: The claim that conceptual understanding enhances higher-level reasoning is supported by transfer results, but the mechanism (definition completion → improved formal reasoning) could also reflect memorization or surface pattern matching. The positive transfer from algebra to other fields is robust across difficulty levels but may not be causal.
- **Low**: The topology performance inversion and the extent to which atomic performance predicts complex problem-solving remain unresolved. The commercial model advantage in conceptual understanding is observed but not explained.

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate Cross-Field Transfer with Ablation**: Train on algebra with and without problems that also appear in other field datasets (if any) to confirm that positive transfer is not due to multi-field contamination.
2. **Generalize Topology Results**: Evaluate the same atomic framework on a different base model (e.g., Llama-3.1-Math) to determine if topology's difficulty inversion is model-specific or a dataset artifact.
3. **Test Conceptual Generalization**: After training on definition-completion, evaluate on out-of-distribution concepts (e.g., from different math curricula or advanced topics) to distinguish between memorization and genuine conceptual consolidation.
