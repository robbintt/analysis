# DermaVQA-DAS: Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) & Datasets for Closed-Ended Question Answering & Segmentation in Patient-Generated Dermatology Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24340
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24340
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Introduces DAS schema and dataset for structured dermatological assessment in patient images

## Executive Summary
DermaVQA-DAS introduces a new expert-developed Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) to support structured dermatological assessment in patient-generated images. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained questions with multilingual multiple-choice options. The dataset includes expert annotations for closed-ended QA and segmentation tasks. For segmentation, BiomedParse achieved Jaccard scores up to 0.395 and Dice scores up to 0.566, with performance varying by prompting strategy and evaluation aggregation method. For QA, o3 achieved the highest accuracy of 0.798, followed closely by GPT-4.1 (0.796). Gemini-1.5-Pro showed competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). The dataset is publicly released to advance research in patient-centered dermatological AI.

## Method Summary
The DermaVQA-DAS dataset comprises 300 training, 56 validation, and 100 test instances for closed-ended QA, along with 7,448 expert masks across 2,474 images for segmentation. The DAS schema contains 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. For segmentation, BiomedParse and MedSAM were evaluated with four prompting conditions and three aggregation schemes (Mean of Max, Mean of Mean, Majority Vote). Threshold optimization used grid search over 50 values on validation data. For QA, multimodal prompts combined patient queries with DAS questions, and multi-image aggregation handled questions requiring cross-image reasoning. Models evaluated included GPT-4.1, o3, Gemini variants, and Claude-3.7-Sonnet.

## Key Results
- BiomedParse with augmented prompts achieved best segmentation: Jaccard 0.395 and Dice 0.566 under majority-vote aggregation
- o3 achieved highest QA accuracy of 0.798, with GPT-4.1 at 0.796 and Gemini-1.5-Pro at 0.783
- Only 9 of 36 DAS categories met 51%+ population threshold for evaluation
- Prompting strategy significantly affected segmentation performance, but no single prompt dominated across all metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured clinical schemas enable more reliable dermatological VLM evaluation than open-ended assessment.
- Mechanism: The Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) constrains the output space to clinically meaningful, expert-defined categories (36 high-level and 27 fine-grained questions with multiple-choice options). This reduces ambiguity in ground truth annotation and enables systematic comparison across models by transforming unstructured dermatological reasoning into closed-ended, verifiable predictions.
- Core assumption: The predefined DAS categories capture the majority of clinically relevant dermatological features needed for patient-centered assessment. The paper acknowledges this may not capture "open-ended patient concerns or nuanced clinical reasoning."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice answer options."
  - [section 2] "DAS was created by two board-certified dermatologists and consists of 72 high-level questions, each associated with multiple-choice answer options."
  - [corpus] DermaBench similarly uses clinician-annotated benchmarks for dermatology VQA, suggesting convergence toward structured evaluation frameworks.
- Break condition: If deployed conditions or patient queries fall outside the DAS attribute set, the schema may fail to capture relevant features, requiring schema extension.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Context-augmented prompting improves segmentation performance when the model can jointly reason over text and image modalities.
- Mechanism: BiomedParse accepts textual prompts and leverages patient query context (title + content) to improve lesion localization. The augmented prompt (Prompt III) provides semantic guidance about what to segment, yielding higher majority-vote Jaccard (0.395) and Dice (0.566) scores compared to default prompts under that aggregation scheme.
- Core assumption: The segmentation model can meaningfully integrate textual context with visual features. This is model-dependent—MedSAM shows no response to textual prompting variations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "BiomedParse with an augmented prompt incorporating patient query title and content achieves the best performance under majority-vote-based evaluation."
  - [section 4, Table 1] BiomedParse (prompt III) achieves Jaccard 0.3948 and Dice 0.5661 under majority vote, outperforming default prompt under that aggregation.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for prompting mechanisms specifically; related papers focus on dataset creation rather than prompting strategies.
- Break condition: When textual context is irrelevant or misleading (e.g., patient query describes symptoms unrelated to visible lesions), augmented prompts may introduce noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Aggregation strategy selection materially affects segmentation evaluation outcomes and model ranking.
- Mechanism: The paper employs three aggregation schemes—Mean of Max, Mean of Mean, and Majority Vote—each capturing different aspects of segmentation quality. Mean of Max yields the highest absolute scores (likely capturing best-case annotator alignment), while Majority Vote enforces consensus across multiple gold-standard masks, producing lower but more conservative estimates.
- Core assumption: Multiple expert annotations per image capture meaningful variation in what constitutes the "correct" segmentation, and the aggregation choice reflects different valid definitions of correctness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Mean of Max aggregation yields the strongest performance, followed by Mean of Mean, while Majority Vote results in comparatively lower scores."
  - [section 3.1] "Each image was annotated with three masks provided by four different medical annotators."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on aggregation mechanisms; this appears to be a methodological contribution specific to this work.
- Break condition: If annotator disagreement reflects error rather than legitimate boundary ambiguity, majority vote may discard valid interpretations; conversely, Mean of Max may overestimate real-world performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Medical Image Segmentation Evaluation Metrics (Jaccard/IoU and Dice)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding these overlap-based metrics is essential for interpreting segmentation performance. Jaccard (Intersection over Union) penalizes false positives more heavily than Dice; both range 0-1 with higher being better.
  - Quick check question: If a segmentation mask covers the entire image but the lesion is small, would Jaccard or Dice be lower, and why?

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering for Vision-Language Models**
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that prompt design (default vs. augmented with patient context) materially affects segmentation and QA performance. Understanding how to structure prompts for multimodal models is critical for reproducing results.
  - Quick check question: Why might adding patient query content to a segmentation prompt improve results for some models but not others?

- Concept: **Majority Vote Aggregation for Multi-Annotator Ground Truth**
  - Why needed here: The segmentation dataset has three masks per image from multiple annotators. Understanding how to construct ground truth from multiple expert opinions is essential for fair evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What is the tradeoff between using per-pixel majority vote versus mean-of-max aggregation when annotators disagree on lesion boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DAS Schema: 36 high-level + 27 fine-grained multiple-choice questions (English/Chinese) defining the structured assessment space
  - Closed-Ended QA Dataset: 300 train / 56 validation / 100 test instances with majority-vote gold labels from 3 annotators each
  - Segmentation Dataset: 7,448 expert masks across 2,474 images (3 masks per image from 4 annotators)
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Three aggregation schemes (Mean of Max, Mean of Mean, Majority Vote) with threshold optimization via grid search on validation set

- Critical path:
  1. Load patient image and associated query (title + content) from DermaVQA-DAS
  2. For segmentation: construct prompt (default or context-augmented), run BiomedParse/MedSAM, apply optimized threshold
  3. For QA: format DAS question with image and patient context as multimodal prompt, invoke VLM, apply task-specific aggregation for multi-image cases
  4. Evaluate against majority-vote gold standard using appropriate aggregation scheme

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **BiomedParse vs. MedSAM**: BiomedParse supports text prompts and achieves higher performance; MedSAM is prompt-invariant but simpler to deploy
  - **Prompt complexity vs. evaluation scheme**: Default prompts optimize Mean of Max/Mean of Mean; augmented prompts optimize Majority Vote—no single prompt dominates across all metrics
  - **Schema comprehensiveness vs. annotation coverage**: DAS has 72 questions but only 9 categories met the 51%+ population threshold for evaluation

- Failure signatures:
  - **MedSAM prompt invariance**: If prompts appear to have no effect on segmentation output, verify correct model variant (MedSAM does not process text prompts)
  - **Multi-image aggregation errors**: For questions requiring cross-image reasoning (color, location), ensure union/highest-label aggregation is correctly implemented
  - **Threshold sensitivity**: Segmentation quality is threshold-dependent; always optimize on validation set before test evaluation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce segmentation baseline: Run BiomedParse with Prompt I (default) and Prompt III (title + content) on validation set, perform threshold grid search (50 values 0-1), compare Mean of Max vs. Majority Vote aggregation.
  2. Establish QA baseline: Evaluate GPT-4.1 or equivalent on closed-ended QA task with and without patient context in prompt, measure per-category accuracy (CQID010-CQID036) to identify high-difficulty categories (likely CQID034, CQID036).
  3. Ablate aggregation strategy: For segmentation, compare performance ranking of prompts across all three aggregation schemes to verify that optimal prompt choice depends on evaluation metric (as reported in Table 1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well do models trained on DermaVQA-DAS generalize to rare dermatological conditions, diverse skin tones, and varied real-world imaging settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 7 (Limitations): "the dataset size and clinical diversity remain constrained relative to real-world dermatology practice, which may limit generalization across rare conditions, skin tones, and imaging settings."
- Why unresolved: The dataset, while extending beyond dermatoscopic-only benchmarks, may not adequately represent the full spectrum of dermatological presentations encountered clinically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of model performance on held-out datasets specifically enriched for rare conditions, Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI, and images from varied capture devices and lighting conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the fixed-attribute Dermatology Assessment Schema be extended to capture open-ended patient concerns and nuanced clinical reasoning used by dermatologists?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Section 7 that DAS "reflects a fixed set of predefined attributes and may not fully capture open-ended patient concerns or nuanced clinical reasoning used by dermatologists."
- Why unresolved: DAS was designed as a structured framework with multiple-choice options, inherently limiting expressiveness for atypical presentations or patient-specific concerns that fall outside predefined categories.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies where clinicians identify gaps in DAS coverage during live consultations, followed by iterative schema expansion and validation against free-text clinical narratives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural modifications would enable text-promptable segmentation models like MedSAM to leverage clinical context for improved dermatological lesion segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 1 shows MedSAM exhibits identical performance (Jaccard 0.4097, Dice 0.5250) across no-prompt and all prompt variants, while BiomedParse shows prompt-dependent performance variation, suggesting architectural differences in prompt integration.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the limitation empirically but does not investigate whether MedSAM's architecture lacks the capacity to integrate textual prompts or whether different prompt encoding mechanisms are needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing prompt encoding mechanisms across architectures, or fine-tuning MedSAM with cross-modal attention layers trained on paired image-text dermatological data.

## Limitations
- DAS schema may not capture open-ended patient concerns or nuanced clinical reasoning used by dermatologists
- Segmentation performance remains relatively low (Jaccard 0.395, Dice 0.566) despite context-augmented prompting
- Only 9 of 36 DAS categories met 51%+ population threshold for evaluation, limiting schema coverage

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset construction methodology, expert annotation protocols, and proper dataset splits are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Relative performance ranking of VLMs for closed-ended QA is robust, though absolute accuracy levels may vary with evaluation parameters
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of DAS schema categories beyond evaluated population and stability of segmentation performance across aggregation strategies

## Next Checks
1. **Schema Coverage Validation**: Test DAS schema performance on an independent patient cohort to verify whether the 9 evaluated categories represent the full spectrum of patient concerns or if additional schema expansion is needed.
2. **Prompt Transferability Study**: Evaluate BiomedParse with context-augmented prompts across different dermatological conditions (not just those in the dataset) to determine if prompt effectiveness generalizes or is condition-specific.
3. **Aggregation Strategy Impact Analysis**: Conduct a formal ablation study comparing segmentation performance across all three aggregation schemes (Mean of Max, Mean of Mean, Majority Vote) on a subset of images with explicit boundary uncertainty annotation to determine which aggregation best captures clinically meaningful segmentation quality.
