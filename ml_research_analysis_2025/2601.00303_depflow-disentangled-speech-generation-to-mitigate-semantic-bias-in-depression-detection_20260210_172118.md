# DepFlow: Disentangled Speech Generation to Mitigate Semantic Bias in Depression Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.00303
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00303
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Generates acoustic embeddings that improve depression detection macro-F1 by 9-12% compared to conventional augmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses semantic bias in depression detection from speech, where models often rely on linguistic sentiment shortcuts instead of true acoustic depression markers. The authors propose DepFlow, a three-stage framework that learns depression-related acoustic embeddings through adversarial training, uses flow-matching text-to-speech synthesis with FiLM modulation to inject these embeddings into speech, and provides prototype-based severity control. DepFlow generates Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) datasets that pair depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral linguistic content, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in real data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9-12% compared to conventional augmentation strategies, consistently outperforming other approaches and reducing reliance on semantic shortcuts while preserving speaker identity and speech quality.

## Method Summary
DepFlow is a three-stage framework for generating synthetic speech that disentangles depression acoustic markers from linguistic content. First, a Depression Acoustic Extractor (DAE) learns 32-dimensional embeddings from WavLM features using adversarial training to remove speaker and content information while preserving depression-related acoustic patterns. Second, a flow-matching text-to-speech system (DepFlow) conditions Matcha-TTS synthesis on these embeddings via FiLM modulation to control severity levels. Third, severity mapping uses subject-level prototype averaging with SLERP interpolation for continuous control. The system generates CDoA datasets pairing depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral linguistic content, creating synthetic examples that address semantic bias in depression detection. The approach is evaluated across three depression detection architectures with substantial improvements in macro-F1 scores.

## Key Results
- CDoA augmentation improves macro-F1 by 9-12% across three depression detection architectures
- Severity controllability shows strong monotonic correlation (C-index ~0.9, Spearman ρ ~0.8)
- Generated speech preserves speaker identity with EER ~0.35 while maintaining quality (WER ~10%, SIM-o ~0.7)
- Effectively reduces reliance on semantic shortcuts compared to conventional augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DepFlow works by breaking the correlation between linguistic sentiment and acoustic depression markers that exists in real-world data. The adversarial disentanglement in the DAE forces the model to learn acoustic features that are predictive of depression severity independent of what is being said. The FiLM-based conditioning in the TTS system allows precise control over these acoustic features during synthesis, enabling the creation of "camouflaged" samples where depressed acoustic patterns are paired with positive or neutral text. This addresses the fundamental bias in training data where depressed speech tends to have depressed linguistic content, causing detectors to learn shortcuts rather than genuine acoustic markers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial disentanglement with gradient reversal layers**: Why needed - to force acoustic embeddings to be predictive of depression while being invariant to speaker and content; Quick check - verify EER remains high when GRL layers are active
- **Flow-matching text-to-speech synthesis**: Why needed - to generate high-quality speech with precise control over acoustic features; Quick check - monitor WER and SIM-o during finetuning
- **FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning**: Why needed - to inject depression severity information into multiple layers of the TTS decoder; Quick check - verify severity control monotonicity through synthesized samples
- **Ordinal regression for severity prediction**: Why needed - depression severity is naturally ordinal rather than categorical; Quick check - validate threshold calibration against clinical labels
- **Prototype-based severity mapping with SLERP interpolation**: Why needed - to enable continuous control over depression severity levels; Quick check - visualize embedding trajectories across interpolated severity values
- **HuBERT-based pseudo-labeling for content disentanglement**: Why needed - to provide robust content representations without manual annotation; Quick check - confirm majority voting aggregation across utterances

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: WavLM-Large -> DAE (Ordinal Regression + GRL Heads) -> 32-dim Depression Embeddings -> Matcha-TTS (FiLM Generator) -> HiFi-GAN Vocoder -> Synthesized Speech

**Critical Path**: The core innovation flows through the adversarial disentanglement in DAE to extract depression-specific embeddings, then through FiLM conditioning in Matcha-TTS to synthesize speech with controlled acoustic depression markers. The quality of embeddings directly determines the controllability and realism of generated speech.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades off computational complexity (three-stage pipeline with multiple models) for the ability to generate high-quality, controllable synthetic data that addresses semantic bias. The use of FiLM modulation provides fine-grained control but adds architectural complexity compared to simpler conditioning approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low EER in DAE indicates failure to preserve depression information while removing speaker/content
- Poor WER or SIM-o in generated speech indicates TTS quality issues or speaker identity drift
- Low C-index or Spearman ρ indicates weak severity control and ineffective FiLM conditioning
- Improved performance on downstream detection without semantic shortcut reduction suggests the approach may be adding noise rather than addressing bias

**First Experiments**:
1. Train DAE on DAIC-WOZ train+dev, verify ROC-AUC ~0.69 and high EER (~0.35) to confirm successful disentanglement
2. Generate severity-controlled samples across the full range using SLERP interpolation, verify monotonic embedding trajectories
3. Evaluate speaker verification on synthesized samples to confirm speaker identity preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the DepFlow-learned severity axis correspond to clinically meaningful depression gradations as judged by mental health professionals? (No human clinical validation conducted)
- Can the disentanglement approach generalize to linguistically and culturally diverse populations beyond English-speaking DAIC-WOZ participants? (Both datasets are English-only)
- What safeguards can effectively prevent misuse of depression-conditioned speech synthesis while preserving research utility? (No specific mitigation techniques implemented)
- Why does FiLM-based conditioning produce strong control over spectral-articulatory features but weak control over F0-related prosody? (Paper notes this finding but doesn't investigate causes)

## Limitations
- Technical details of Matcha-TTS architecture and FiLM generator are underspecified, limiting reproducibility
- No human clinical evaluation of synthesized speech severity judgments
- Limited demographic diversity in training datasets (DAIC-WOZ, VCTK are English-only)
- Potential for misuse in generating synthetic depressed speech without adequate safeguards

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core methodology of using adversarial disentanglement to extract depression-specific acoustic embeddings is well-established, and the experimental improvements in macro-F1 (9-12%) over conventional augmentation are substantial and consistently observed across three different depression detection architectures.

**Medium Confidence**: The severity controllability claims (C-index ~0.9, Spearman ρ ~0.8) appear strong, but the lack of detail on how continuous interpolation was validated and whether interpolated samples were perceptually meaningful creates some uncertainty about practical controllability.

**Low Confidence**: The paper claims that CDoA reduces reliance on semantic shortcuts, but this is inferred from performance improvements rather than direct analysis of model attention patterns or feature importance before/after augmentation. The mechanism by which acoustic-semantic mismatch actually improves generalization to unseen speaker/content combinations remains somewhat speculative.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce the adversarial disentanglement**: Train the DAE with the specified hyperparameters on DAIC-WOZ train+dev, verify the EER (~0.35) and ROC-AUC (~0.69) match reported values, and confirm that speaker classification accuracy on frozen embeddings drops significantly with GRL layers active.

2. **Validate severity control monotonicity**: Generate a grid of samples across severity levels using SLERP interpolation, compute subject-level embeddings for each, and verify that embedding distances correlate monotonically with intended severity values (C-index should approach 0.9).

3. **Test speaker identity preservation**: Synthesize CDoA samples using embeddings from multiple speakers reading the same text, then use a speaker verification system to confirm that generated samples cluster by original speaker identity rather than by depression severity.
