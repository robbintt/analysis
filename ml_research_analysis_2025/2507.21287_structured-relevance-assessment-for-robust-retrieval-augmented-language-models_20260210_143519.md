# Structured Relevance Assessment for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.21287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21287
- Authors: Aryan Raj; Astitva Veer Garg; Anitha D
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Framework achieves 100% source identification accuracy and 57.1% hallucination detection with small language models (1-2B parameters)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Structured Relevance Assessment Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) that addresses factual errors and hallucinations through a multi-dimensional scoring system. The framework combines semantic matching with source reliability heuristics and introduces a knowledge integration protocol that dynamically balances intrinsic model knowledge against external retrievals. A key innovation is the explicit "unknown" response capability that activates when confidence thresholds are not met, reducing hallucinations while maintaining comparable latency to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a composite relevance score combining semantic similarity (embedding-based cosine similarity) and source reliability ratings (A-E scale) to improve document selection. A thresholded decision protocol dynamically routes responses between intrinsic model knowledge, combined knowledge, retrieval-only, or "unknown" responses based on retrieval confidence and model confidence metrics. The system uses small language models (1-2B parameters) via Ollama and was evaluated on the MuskumPillerum/General-Knowledge Dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in source identification and hallucination detection while maintaining competitive response latency.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy in identifying training/RAG data sources
- Demonstrated 57.1% hallucination detection capability
- Reduced hallucinations by 40% compared to baseline models
- Maintained comparable response latency (4.76-7.37s) to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Composite relevance score combining semantic similarity and source reliability improves document selection over similarity-only retrieval.
- Mechanism: Each document receives score S_i = α·Sim(E_Q, E_di) + β·R(d_i), where Sim is embedding-based cosine similarity and R(d_i) is heuristic reliability rating.
- Core assumption: Source reliability heuristics generalize across domains and α/β weights are stable across query distributions.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions multi-dimensional scoring system; section 5.3-5.4 details reliability rating system and weighted scoring formula.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Thresholded decision protocol reduces over-reliance on low-quality retrievals by dynamically selecting between knowledge sources.
- Mechanism: Compare max(S_i) to T_R and intrinsic confidence C_M to T_M to route between intrinsic-only, combined, retrieval-only, or "unknown" responses.
- Core assumption: Intrinsic confidence C_M is calibrated and comparable across domains.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes knowledge integration protocol; section 6 formalizes decision rule and confidence thresholds.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit "unknown" responses when both retrieval and intrinsic confidence are low reduce hallucinations.
- Mechanism: Return "Unknown" if max(S_i) < T_R and C_M < T_M, with abstention probability modeled as P("Unknown") = 1 − P(S_max > T_R or C_M > T_M).
- Core assumption: Users treat "Unknown" as acceptable and thresholds balance coverage versus abstention appropriately.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions explicit "unknown" response capability; section 7 provides probabilistic formulation.

## Foundational Learning

Concept: Embedding-based semantic similarity
- Why needed here: Core to computing Sim(E_Q, E_di) for the multi-dimensional scorer.
- Quick check question: Given a query and a document, can you compute cosine similarity between their embeddings and interpret the score?

Concept: Calibration of model confidence scores
- Why needed here: Knowledge integration switch relies on well-calibrated C_M to route answers correctly.
- Quick check question: What does it mean for a confidence score to be calibrated, and how would you check calibration on a held-out set?

Concept: Threshold selection and abstention tradeoffs
- Why needed here: T_R/T_M control hallucinations vs. coverage; adaptive thresholds add complexity vs. robustness.
- Quick check question: If you lower T_R, what happens to retrieval inclusion and hallucination risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Embedding encoder → Vector DB (V) → Candidate documents (D_C) → Relevance Scorer → Confidence Estimator → Decision Router → Response Generator

Critical path: Query → EQ generation → retrieval → scoring → routing → response (or "Unknown")

Design tradeoffs:
- α vs. β: Higher β increases robustness to misleading content but may exclude relevant low-authority sources
- T_R/T_M thresholds: Higher thresholds reduce hallucinations but increase abstention
- Latency vs. thoroughness: More candidate documents improve recall but increase L_r

Failure signatures:
- Over-abstention: T_R/T_M set too high; system returns "Unknown" excessively
- Miscalibrated routing: C_M systematically over/underconfident → wrong knowledge source selected
- Noisy source labels: R(d_i) unreliable → composite scores become misleading

First 3 experiments:
1. Calibration audit: Measure C_M calibration on validation set across models
2. Threshold sweep: Grid-search T_R/T_M on held-out QA set; plot hallucination vs. abstention rates
3. α/β sensitivity: Vary α/β weights on mixed-quality document benchmark and measure retrieval precision and downstream accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework maintain computational efficiency and accuracy when scaled to Large Language Models (LLMs) exceeding 2 billion parameters?
- Basis in paper: Conclusion states "challenges persist, particularly in maintaining efficiency at scale" as experiments were limited to small language models.
- Why unresolved: Current validation covers only SLMs; computational overhead on larger architectures remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing latency and hallucination rates on 7B+ parameter models.

Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms can further improve the accuracy of distinguishing credible information from misleading sources?
- Basis in paper: Abstract notes that "challenges persist in accurately distinguishing credible information" despite proposed source reliability scoring.
- Why unresolved: Current method relies on NID-inspired heuristics that may struggle with adversarial documents or novel domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis on adversarial datasets against baseline trust metrics.

Open Question 3
- Question: How should weight parameters (α and β) be optimally tuned to balance semantic similarity against source reliability in domain-specific contexts?
- Basis in paper: Paper defines S_i = α·Sim(E_Q, E_di) + β·R(d_i) but doesn't specify how α and β are derived or adjusted.
- Why unresolved: Static weighting may fail in niche scenarios where semantic matches are high but source reliability is low.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study showing impact of dynamic versus static α, β weighting on hallucination rates across diverse knowledge domains.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to 1-2B parameter models, raising questions about performance on larger models or specialized domains
- Source reliability heuristics (A-E rating scale) lack empirical validation across diverse document sources
- Adaptive threshold mechanism's effectiveness depends on accurate query complexity estimation not fully specified

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Composite scoring mechanism combining semantic similarity and source reliability is technically sound and aligns with established retrieval literature; source identification accuracy (100%) is well-supported.
- Medium Confidence: Hallucination detection performance (57.1%) and reduction claims are supported but would benefit from additional validation on diverse datasets and larger model families.
- Low Confidence: Generalization of source reliability heuristics across domains remains unproven; optimal parameter settings may be dataset-dependent.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Evaluate framework on domain-specific datasets (medical, legal, technical) to assess whether A-E source reliability heuristics maintain effectiveness outside general knowledge domains.

2. **Model Scale Generalization**: Test framework with larger language models (8B+ parameters) to determine if performance gains observed with small models persist as model capacity increases.

3. **Threshold Calibration Robustness**: Conduct extensive sensitivity analysis on T_R and T_M thresholds across multiple datasets to establish whether adaptive threshold mechanism provides consistent improvements or introduces instability.
