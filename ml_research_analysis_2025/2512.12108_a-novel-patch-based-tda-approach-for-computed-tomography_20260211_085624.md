# A Novel Patch-Based TDA Approach for Computed Tomography

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12108
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12108
- Reference count: 40
- Method outperforms classical 3D cubical complex method in both classification performance and computational efficiency for CT imaging data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel patch-based persistent homology (PH) construction approach for 3D CT imaging data that transforms volumetric data into point clouds by summarizing 3D image patches into compact d-dimensional points using statistical encoding. The method then constructs PH using alpha complex filtration and demonstrates significant improvements over the classical 3D cubical complex method in both classification performance and computational efficiency across four diverse CT datasets.

## Method Summary
The patch-based TDA approach extracts cubic patches from 3D CT volumes and transforms them into point clouds through statistical encoding of patch intensities. Each patch is summarized into a d-dimensional point using methods like Morton code for spatial coordinates combined with statistical measures (mean, median, range) or PCA for intensity values. Persistent homology is then computed on these point clouds using alpha complex filtration, and topological features are extracted through persistent statistical features. The final feature vectors are used with classical machine learning classifiers including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others for classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Average improvements of 10.38% in accuracy, 6.94% in AUC, 2.06% in sensitivity, 11.58% in specificity, and 8.51% in F1 score across four CT datasets
- Computational efficiency gains: approximately 128 times faster than cubical complex on kidney tumor data and 73 times faster on pancreas tumor data
- Outperformed cubical complex baseline across all metrics on KiTS19, FLARE22, CRLM, and Pancreas datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The patch-based approach reduces the computational complexity of PH computation by transforming dense volumetric data into sparse point clouds while preserving essential topological features. By encoding local patch statistics into point representations, the method captures both spatial and intensity information in a more compact form suitable for efficient alpha complex filtration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Alpha complex filtration**: A method for computing persistent homology that provides a balance between computational efficiency and topological accuracy; needed because cubical complexes become computationally prohibitive for large volumes
- **Morton code encoding**: A space-filling curve technique for mapping multi-dimensional coordinates to single dimensions; needed to preserve spatial relationships when transforming patches to points
- **Persistent statistical features**: Summary statistics (mean, variance, maximum, minimum, etc.) computed on persistence diagrams; needed to convert topological information into machine learning-compatible feature vectors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CT Volume -> Patch Extraction -> Statistical Encoding -> Point Cloud -> Alpha Complex Filtration -> Persistence Diagrams -> Persistent Statistics -> Feature Vector -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The transformation from volumetric patches to point clouds via statistical encoding is the critical innovation that enables efficient PH computation while maintaining classification performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Patch size (3-10) balances local detail capture against computational cost; choice of statistical encoding (simple stats vs. PCA) trades interpretability against dimensionality reduction; alpha complex filtration trades some topological detail for computational efficiency versus cubical complexes.

**Failure Signatures**: Excessive memory usage with cubical complex baseline; high variance in cross-validation folds; degraded classification performance with overly small patch sizes that lose contextual information.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify point cloud size reduction: compare number of points from patch-based approach versus voxel count in cubical complex baseline
2. Test patch size sensitivity: run classification with patch sizes 3, 6, and 10 to identify optimal balance
3. Validate statistical encoding impact: compare performance using simple statistics versus PCA for patch representation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can reducing the number of points in the generated point clouds via clustering methods improve performance or efficiency?
- Is the proposed patch-based PH construction method generalizable to other volumetric medical imaging modalities beyond CT scans?
- Can the patch-based TDA method be effectively integrated into deep learning architectures like LSTM networks?

## Limitations
- Experiments restricted to four specific CT datasets; lack of inclusion of other medical imaging modalities like MRI or PET
- Unspecified classifier hyperparameters and random seeds limit exact reproducibility
- Performance gains depend on specific implementation details of PH computation and classification

## Confidence
High: Methodologically sound approach with well-supported empirical results across diverse datasets
Medium: Computational efficiency claims plausible but depend on implementation details
Low: Reproducibility limited by unspecified hyperparameters and random seed usage

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce results with proper hyperparameter control and specified random seeds for stratified 5-fold splits
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contribution of patch-based transformation versus alpha complex filtration
3. Test the method on non-CT volumetric datasets to validate cross-modality generalization
