# Exploiting Spatiotemporal Properties for Efficient Event-Driven Human Pose Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06306
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Proposed method achieves real-time inference with latencies under 4ms while outperforming baseline Point Transformer on DHP19 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient event-driven human pose estimation by leveraging the spatiotemporal properties of event streams. Existing methods typically convert event streams into dense frames, losing sparsity and temporal resolution. The authors propose a novel approach using event point clouds as input and incorporating two key innovations: Event Temporal Slicing Convolution (ETSC) for capturing short-term temporal dependencies across event slices, and Event Slice Sequencing (ES-Seq) for structured temporal modeling. Additionally, they introduce edge enhancement using Sobel convolution to improve spatial edge information in sparse event conditions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a novel framework for event-driven human pose estimation that operates directly on event point clouds rather than converting them to dense frames. The approach consists of three main components: ETSC, which captures short-term temporal dependencies by performing convolution across event slices; ES-Seq, which provides structured temporal modeling by organizing event slices in a sequential manner; and edge enhancement using Sobel convolution to improve spatial edge information in sparse event conditions. The method is evaluated using three different point cloud backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer) on the DHP19 dataset, demonstrating consistent improvements across all architectures while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.

## Key Results
- Enhanced DGCNN backbone outperforms baseline Point Transformer while being simpler and more computationally efficient
- Achieved real-time inference with latencies under 4ms on tested hardware
- Consistent performance improvements across all three point cloud backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, Point Transformer) on DHP19 dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by preserving the intrinsic spatiotemporal properties of event streams through direct processing of event point clouds. ETSC captures temporal dynamics by analyzing event distributions across time slices, while ES-Seq provides structured temporal modeling that maintains the sequential nature of events. Edge enhancement with Sobel convolution compensates for the sparsity of event data by strengthening spatial edge information. This approach avoids the information loss that occurs when converting events to dense frames, allowing the model to leverage the full temporal resolution and sparsity characteristics of event-based sensing.

## Foundational Learning
- Event-driven sensing: Why needed - captures asynchronous, sparse visual information with high temporal resolution; Quick check - understand event generation mechanism and temporal properties
- Point cloud processing: Why needed - direct handling of 3D spatial data without dense representation; Quick check - familiarity with point cloud backbones (PointNet, DGCNN)
- Spatiotemporal feature extraction: Why needed - combining spatial and temporal information for dynamic scenes; Quick check - understand convolution operations across temporal dimensions
- Edge enhancement techniques: Why needed - improving spatial information in sparse data conditions; Quick check - basic knowledge of Sobel operator and edge detection

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Event stream -> Event point cloud conversion -> Edge enhancement (Sobel) -> ETSC temporal slicing -> ES-Seq temporal modeling -> Point cloud backbone -> Pose estimation output

Critical path: The most performance-critical path is the combination of ETSC and ES-Seq operations, as these handle the temporal modeling that is central to the method's effectiveness. The edge enhancement step is also critical for maintaining spatial information quality.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between computational complexity and temporal resolution. Using event point clouds directly preserves information but requires efficient point cloud processing. The ETSC and ES-Seq components add temporal modeling capability at the cost of additional computation. Edge enhancement improves spatial quality but adds preprocessing overhead.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include temporal aliasing when event slice duration is too long, spatial information loss when edge enhancement is insufficient for very sparse events, and computational bottlenecks if the temporal modeling components are not optimized for real-time performance.

First experiments to run:
1. Baseline comparison without ETSC to isolate temporal modeling contribution
2. Baseline comparison without edge enhancement to assess spatial information impact
3. Ablation study varying event slice duration to find optimal temporal resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single benchmark (DHP19), limiting generalizability assessment
- Full system latency including preprocessing and post-processing not explicitly quantified
- Direct architectural comparisons with Point Transformer are challenging due to fundamental differences

## Confidence
High confidence in the technical implementation and experimental results on DHP19 dataset.
Medium confidence in the generalizability and real-world applicability of the proposed method.
Medium confidence in the computational efficiency claims without full system latency measurements.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed method on additional event-based human pose estimation datasets to assess generalizability beyond DHP19.
2. Conduct comprehensive benchmarking of end-to-end system latency, including data preprocessing and post-processing, to validate real-time performance claims.
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of ETSC, ES-Seq, and edge enhancement components to the overall performance.
