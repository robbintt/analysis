# OntoLogX: Ontology-Guided Knowledge Graph Extraction from Cybersecurity Logs with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01409
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01409
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Autonomous AI agent that converts raw cybersecurity logs into structured, ontology-grounded knowledge graphs using LLMs, validated on public and real-world honeypot datasets.

## Executive Summary
OntoLogX is an autonomous AI agent that transforms raw cybersecurity logs into structured, ontology-grounded knowledge graphs using large language models. It integrates retrieval-augmented generation with iterative correction steps to ensure semantic and syntactic validity, enabling traceability and interoperability. Beyond event-level extraction, OntoLogX aggregates graphs into sessions and predicts MITRE ATT&CK tactics to link low-level log evidence to adversarial objectives. Evaluated on both public and real-world honeypot datasets, OntoLogX demonstrates robust KG generation across multiple backends, high precision and recall, and effective tactic prediction. Code-oriented models like Qwen3 Coder performed particularly well, highlighting their suitability for structured log analysis in cyber threat intelligence.

## Method Summary
OntoLogX leverages a structured pipeline that begins with raw log ingestion and applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract structured knowledge aligned with a cybersecurity ontology. The process incorporates iterative correction mechanisms to ensure semantic and syntactic validity of the resulting knowledge graphs. OntoLogX aggregates individual event graphs into coherent sessions and leverages LLMs to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to high-level adversarial behaviors. The system is designed to be backend-agnostic, supporting multiple graph database integrations, and has been evaluated on diverse datasets, including real-world honeypot logs.

## Key Results
- Robust knowledge graph generation across multiple backends with high precision and recall.
- Effective prediction of MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to adversarial objectives.
- Code-oriented LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 Coder) showed superior performance in structured log analysis.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OntoLogX works by combining ontology-guided extraction with LLM-driven reasoning and iterative validation. The use of RAG ensures that extracted facts are grounded in domain knowledge, while iterative correction steps address both semantic and syntactic errors. By mapping low-level log events to high-level MITRE ATT&CK tactics, the system provides actionable threat intelligence that aligns with established cybersecurity frameworks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cybersecurity Log Structures**: Essential for understanding raw log formats and event semantics; verify by inspecting sample logs from diverse sources.
- **Knowledge Graph Ontologies**: Required for semantic structuring and interoperability; quick check by validating KG against ontology constraints.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enables context-aware extraction from logs; verify by testing retrieval accuracy on sample queries.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Provides the mapping from low-level events to adversary tactics; validate by checking tactic prediction accuracy.
- **Iterative Correction Mechanisms**: Ensures data quality and validity; quick check by running KG validation after each correction cycle.
- **Graph Database Backends**: Supports multiple storage solutions; verify by testing KG export/import across backends.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Raw Logs -> RAG Engine -> Iterative Corrector -> Ontology Validator -> KG Backend -> ATT&CK Tactic Predictor
- **Critical Path**: Log ingestion → RAG extraction → Iterative correction → Ontology validation → KG export → Tactic prediction
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Backend-agnosticism supports flexibility but may limit optimization; iterative correction ensures quality but adds latency; code-oriented LLMs boost performance but may not be universally available.
- **Failure Signatures**: Semantic mismatches with ontology, syntactic errors in KG, incorrect ATT&CK tactic predictions, scalability bottlenecks with large logs.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Validate KG generation from sample public logs with known ground truth.
  2. Test iterative correction effectiveness on noisy log datasets.
  3. Benchmark ATT&CK tactic prediction accuracy on a labeled dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization to heterogeneous, real-world enterprise log environments remains untested.
- Iterative correction mechanism may not scale effectively for very large or noisy log corpora.
- Reliance on code-oriented LLMs may limit applicability in contexts where such models are unavailable.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core methodology and ontology-guided KG extraction process, given thorough evaluation and explicit semantic/syntactic validation steps.
- Medium confidence in backend-agnostic KG generation, pending more extensive backend diversity testing.
- Medium confidence in MITRE ATT&CK tactic prediction utility, pending operational validation in live environments.

## Next Checks
1. Test OntoLogX on heterogeneous, real-world enterprise log data with varied formats and noise levels to assess generalization and scalability.
2. Evaluate performance across a wider range of graph database backends, including less common or proprietary systems, to confirm backend-agnostic robustness.
3. Conduct a field study measuring the operational impact and accuracy of MITRE ATT&CK tactic predictions in live cyber threat intelligence workflows.
