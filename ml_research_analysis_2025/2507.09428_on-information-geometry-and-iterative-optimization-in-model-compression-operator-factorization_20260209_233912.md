# On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09428
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Iterative compression during training is crucial for high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation; energy-based cutoff schedules significantly outperform existing criteria.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently deploying large-scale deep learning models on resource-constrained devices by exploring operator factorization as a model compression technique. The authors analyze existing compression methods through the lens of information geometry, demonstrating that many approaches implicitly approximate information divergences when projecting models onto lower-compute submanifolds. They prove convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural networks under soft rank constraints and show that trainability—rather than projection quality—dominates compressed model performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and GLUE benchmark tasks reveal that while information-based projections improve zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuned performance becomes nearly identical across methods. The key contribution is establishing that iterative compression during training is crucial for achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation, and that cutoff schedules based on total singular value energy significantly outperform existing criteria.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes iterative Fisher Hard Thresholding (IFHT) and Iterative Energy Hard Thresholding (IEHT) methods for operator factorization in model compression. These methods decompose weight matrices into low-rank forms (USV^T) and iteratively update them during training. IFHT incorporates Fisher Information weighting into the singular value decomposition to better preserve the model's output distribution, while IEHT uses energy-based cutoffs for rank reduction. The approach treats compression as a proximal gradient optimization problem, where the rank function acts as a regularization term. Both methods include a warm-up period before starting the iterative compression process, allowing the model to initially converge to a stable state before rank reduction begins.

## Key Results
- Iterative compression methods (IEHT/IFHT) achieve significantly better performance than one-shot projection methods at extreme compression ratios (4-7% of original parameters)
- Information-based projections (FWSVD) provide superior zero-shot accuracy compared to Euclidean projections, but this advantage diminishes after fine-tuning
- Energy-based cutoff schedules based on cumulative singular value energy outperform criteria based on relative singular value magnitude
- Trainability and optimization path quality dominate projection method choice when fine-tuning compressed models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Divergence for Zero-Shot Projection
If a pre-trained model is compressed without fine-tuning (zero-shot), projecting weights using KL-divergence (or Fisher Information) preserves functional behavior significantly better than Euclidean projection (standard SVD). Standard SVD minimizes the Euclidean distance between original and compressed weights ($||\theta - \tilde{\theta}||_2$). However, the "distance" relevant to model performance is the change in output distribution. By using a second-order approximation of the KL-divergence ($\frac{1}{2}\Delta\theta^T I(\theta) \Delta\theta$), the projection penalizes changes in "sensitive" weight directions (high Fisher information) more heavily, preserving the loss landscape geometry.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Proximal Gradient for Trainability
High compression ratios with minimal performance degradation are achievable primarily through iterative rank reduction during training ("sparsify-during-training") rather than post-hoc projection. This process is framed as a proximal gradient method solving $\min L(W) + \lambda \text{rank}(W)$. Instead of a hard constraint, the method iteratively projects the weights onto the low-rank manifold (via Singular Value Thresholding) while allowing gradient descent to adjust the model within that constrained subspace.

### Mechanism 3: Energy-Based Cutoff Schedules
Determining rank cutoffs based on the cumulative energy of singular values (sum of squares) outperforms criteria based on the relative magnitude of individual singular values. Previous methods (like OIALR) cut singular values smaller than $\beta \times \sigma_{max}$. This creates unstable, "non-smooth" rank reductions. The proposed IEHT/IFHT methods cut values only when they contribute negligibly to the total signal energy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Information Geometry & The Fisher Information Metric (FIM)**
  - Why needed here: The paper re-frames compression not as weight approximation, but as distribution approximation. You must understand why $KL(p||q) \approx \Delta\theta^T I(\theta) \Delta\theta$ to grasp why FWSVD works better than SVD for zero-shot tasks.
  - Quick check question: Why does minimizing Euclidean distance between weights fail to preserve zero-shot accuracy compared to Fisher-weighted distance?

- **Concept: Proximal Gradient Descent**
  - Why needed here: The core theoretical contribution is proving convergence of "Iterative Singular Value Thresholding" using proximal operators. Understanding $\text{prox}(x)$ is required to see why this isn't just "pruning" but a formal optimization step on the rank function.
  - Quick check question: How does the proximal operator for the rank function relate to Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?

- **Concept: Low-Rank Manifolds**
  - Why needed here: The paper treats compressed weights as residing on a "low-compute submanifold." Understanding the topology (e.g., the set of rank-$r$ matrices is not a vector space) explains why iterative "massaging" (optimization on the manifold) is harder but more effective than one-shot projection.
  - Quick check question: Why is the set of fixed-rank matrices considered a manifold, and why does this make optimization challenging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Base Model -> Decomposition Layer (USV^T representation) -> Fisher Estimator (IFHT) -> Thresholding Scheduler (Energy Cutoff) -> Proximal Step (SVD + Truncate)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize full rank
  2. Train for warm-up period (delay steps $d$)
  3. Convert to $USV^T$ representation
  4. Loop: Every $\nu$ steps:
      * Compute SVD (potentially weighted by Fisher info)
      * Apply Energy Cutoff (discard lowest energy singular values)
      * Update Architecture (shrink $U, V$)
      * Continue Gradient Descent on the shrunk weights

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **SVD vs. FWSVD (Euclidean vs. Info):** FWSVD requires computing/approximating Fisher info (expensive/complex) but yields better zero-shot results. If you plan to fine-tune extensively, standard SVD is likely sufficient and cheaper.
  - **One-Shot vs. Iterative:** One-shot is faster; Iterative (IEHT/IFHT) is required for extreme compression (e.g., <10% params).
  - **Rank Schedule:** "Increasing error tolerance with depth" (Section 5.1) tends to perform best but adds hyperparameters.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Catastrophic Collapse:** Using magnitude-based cutoffs (OIALR) instead of energy-based often cuts too much too soon, causing training divergence.
  - **Stagnation:** In BERT/GLUE tasks, if training is too short, iterative methods perform worse than one-shot FWSVD because they don't have time to recover from projection errors.
  - **Compute Bottleneck:** Calculating full SVD every step is prohibitive; check implementation frequency ($\nu$).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Zero-Shot Baseline: Compress a pre-trained ViT using standard SVD vs. FWSVD (Info-based) *without* fine-tuning. Verify FWSVD superiority. (Ref: Table 1).
  2. Schedule Ablation: Train ViT on CIFAR-10 using IEHT with three schedules: constant cutoff, increasing cutoff with depth, decreasing cutoff with depth. Verify that increasing/deepening tolerance wins. (Ref: Figure 4).
  3. Iterative vs. One-Shot: Compare final fine-tuned accuracy of a one-shot FWSVD against iterative IEHT at extreme compression (e.g., 4-7% params). Verify IEHT dominates. (Ref: Figure 2).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the Gaussian assumption for post-activations valid for defining projection metrics in model compression?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 explicitly asks "is such a gaussian assumption the right one?" noting that post-activations often possess significant outliers or cluster around multiple points.
- Why unresolved: Methods like ASVD minimize reconstruction error assuming Gaussian distributions, but real activations may be multimodal or heavy-tailed, potentially leading to suboptimal projections.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can iterative information-geometric compression methods scale to Large Language Models (LLMs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states that the paper focused on medium-sized models, leaving "approaches overcoming the problem of trainability" and "more complex structures" for future work.
- Why unresolved: The proposed iterative methods (IEHT/IFHT) require frequent singular value decompositions and Fisher information approximations, which are computationally expensive for massive parameter counts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does trainability dominate projection quality in fine-tuning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 1 and Section 5.1 show that while information projections (FWSVD) help zero-shot performance, fine-tuned performance is nearly identical to Euclidean projections (SVD).
- Why unresolved: The paper proves convergence of iterative thresholding but lacks a theoretical explanation for why the optimization path (trainability) renders the choice of initial projection distance (KL vs. Euclidean) negligible after fine-tuning.

## Limitations

- The theoretical convergence proof relies on the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property, which is difficult to verify in practice for deep networks and may not hold for all architectures or datasets
- Fisher Information Matrix estimation relies on diagonal approximations or column-sum heuristics that may not capture the full second-order geometry, particularly for non-linear activation functions
- The approach requires careful hyperparameter tuning, including warm-up periods and compression schedules, which may not generalize well across different model architectures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The empirical observation that iterative compression outperforms one-shot projection at extreme compression ratios (Section 5.2, Figure 2) is well-supported and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical convergence proof for iterative singular value thresholding is sound within its assumptions, but its practical implications for real-world neural network training remain uncertain due to the non-convex nature of the problem
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that information-based projections (FWSVD) significantly improve zero-shot accuracy is supported by the results, but the practical benefit diminishes when fine-tuning is applied, suggesting the advantage is situational

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence Verification:** Implement a version of IFHT with different KŁ exponent assumptions (e.g., squared vs. logarithmic) to test the sensitivity of convergence to this parameter
2. **Fisher Approximation Ablation:** Compare the performance of IFHT using different Fisher estimation methods (full diagonal, K-FAC approximation, column-sum heuristic) to quantify the impact of the approximation quality on zero-shot and fine-tuned accuracy
3. **Architecture Generalization:** Test the iterative compression framework on architectures beyond ViT and BERT (e.g., ResNets, ConvNeXt) to determine if the observed benefits generalize to non-transformer models and different types of layers
