# Automated Annotation of Evolving Corpora for Augmenting Longitudinal Network Data: A Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Expert Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.01672
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01672
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** EALA framework outperforms supervised models and matches human annotators on climate negotiation interaction extraction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EALA, a framework that combines LLMs with expert knowledge (codebooks and historical annotations) to automate the annotation of longitudinal network data. EALA addresses challenges in maintaining timely and consistent annotations for evolving political corpora by integrating deductive learning from rule-based codebooks and inductive learning from annotated examples. The framework was evaluated on a 30-year dataset of international climate negotiations, demonstrating that EALA outperforms traditional supervised models and achieves performance comparable to human annotators. Key components include task decomposition to reduce hallucinations and leveraging both codebooks and annotated data to improve accuracy. EALA holds promise for advancing research in political science and beyond by enabling scalable, automated annotation of complex relational datasets.

## Method Summary
EALA is a framework that combines LLMs with expert knowledge to automate annotation of longitudinal network data. It uses task decomposition to break down relation extraction into existence detection and triplet extraction, reducing hallucinations. The framework leverages both deductive learning from expert codebooks and inductive learning from annotated examples. For data-rich scenarios, it instruction-tunes LLMs like Llama-3-8B; for data-scarce scenarios, it uses in-context learning. The framework was evaluated on a 30-year climate negotiation dataset, comparing performance against supervised models and human annotators across relation extraction and attribute prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- EALA achieves higher precision and recall than supervised models (T5-base) on relation extraction tasks
- Performance on relation extraction is comparable to human annotators (8 coders on 50 paragraphs)
- EALA maintains consistent annotation quality across different time periods in the longitudinal dataset
- The framework successfully handles complex coding rules including bidirectionality, transitivity, and derivation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with structured expert knowledge through task decomposition. By breaking complex annotation tasks into smaller subtasks (existence check → extraction), it reduces hallucinations while maintaining accuracy. The dual approach of using both codebooks (for explicit rules) and annotated data (for implicit patterns) allows the system to capture both the explicit coding rules and the nuanced patterns that emerge in real data.

## Foundational Learning
**Relation Extraction**: Extracting structured interactions (sender, receiver, relation type, attributes) from text is crucial for building network data. Quick check: Verify that all five relation types (On behalf of, Support, Agreement, Delaying proposal, Opposition) are correctly identified in sample paragraphs.

**Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex annotation tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks reduces model hallucinations. Quick check: Compare hallucination rates between monolithic and decomposed approaches on a validation set.

**Deductive vs Inductive Learning**: Combining explicit rule-based knowledge (codebooks) with implicit pattern learning (annotated examples) provides complementary strengths. Quick check: Measure performance with codebook-only, annotated-data-only, and combined approaches.

**Dynamic Topic Space**: Creating a time-evolving set of topics using embeddings and clustering allows the framework to adapt to changing discourse over time. Quick check: Verify that topics cluster meaningfully using visualization tools like UMAP.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: ENB Reports → Preprocessing → Task Decomposition → Codebook Retrieval → LLM Processing → Post-processing → Structured Output

**Critical Path**: ENB Reports → Preprocessing → Task Decomposition → Codebook Retrieval → LLM Processing → Structured Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for accuracy by using task decomposition and multiple LLM calls. It prioritizes precision over recall in certain components to reduce noise in the final dataset.

**Failure Signatures**: Hallucinated interactions appear as entities not in the codebook or relations not supported by text. Over-detection manifests as irrelevant nouns being treated as entities. Format errors result in JSON parsing failures.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test codebook prompt effectiveness by running the relation existence check on 10 sample paragraphs
2. Evaluate the fuzzy matching procedure by mapping 5 Castro annotations to ENB paragraphs
3. Run the full pipeline on a small subset (10 paragraphs) to verify end-to-end functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can RAG frameworks or long-context LLMs effectively expand the annotation search window beyond a single paragraph without increasing hallucinations? The current framework limits context to paragraphs to maintain reasoning performance, missing cross-paragraph interactions on the same day.

**Open Question 2**: Can the retrieval of relevant codebook information be fully automated to remove the need for manual selection? Current implementation requires human effort to select relevant definitions and rules for prompts.

**Open Question 3**: How can LLMs be constrained to strictly adhere to a pre-defined entity label space while retaining the ability to detect emerging, valid entities? The framework struggles to balance rigid entity lists with the flexibility needed to identify new political actors.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends heavily on availability of quality codebooks and annotated examples, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation focuses on relatively clean paragraph-level summaries rather than raw text complexity
- Human baseline comparison uses a small sample (50 paragraphs, 8 coders) that may not capture full annotation variance
- Performance claims are specific to the climate negotiation domain and may not transfer to other domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework architecture and core components are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Performance comparisons to supervised models and human baselines are supported but domain-specific
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization claims are reasonable but remain theoretical without broader empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce exact prompt templates from Table 1 using the provided 23-page codebook to verify mapping between codebook rules and model instructions
2. Implement fuzzy matching procedure (>90% word overlap threshold) to map Castro annotations to ENB paragraphs and validate resulting splits
3. Run full EALA pipeline on the 256-test paragraph set and compare precision/recall metrics against published results to verify reproducibility
