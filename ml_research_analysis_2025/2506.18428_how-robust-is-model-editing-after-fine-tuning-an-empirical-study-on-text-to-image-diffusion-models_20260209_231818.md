- Text-to-image diffusion model edits fail to persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA causing strongest edit reversal

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the persistence of model edits after fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. The authors systematically evaluate two editing methods (UCE, ReFACT) and three fine-tuning approaches (DreamBooth, LoRA, DoRA) on Stable Diffusion and FLUX models across four editing tasks: concept appearance/role edits, gender debiasing, and unsafe content removal. The research reveals critical limitations in current editing methodologies and highlights the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control of deployed AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic experimental framework to evaluate edit persistence across different fine-tuning methods. Researchers apply model edits using UCE and ReFACT techniques, then fine-tune the edited models using DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA approaches. Four editing tasks are tested: concept appearance edits, concept role edits, gender debiasing, and unsafe content removal. Post-tuning efficacy is measured using quantitative metrics including LMD (Log Maximum Discrepancy) for comparing edit effectiveness before and after fine-tuning. The experiments are conducted on both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures to assess generalizability across different model families.

## Key Results
- Model edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA exhibiting the strongest edit reversal effect
- UCE demonstrates greater robustness than ReFACT, maintaining higher post-tuning efficacy across fine-tuning methods
- Full-size fine-tuning and DoRA are most effective at removing prior edits, while lightweight methods like DreamBooth better preserve editing effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Model edits in text-to-image diffusion models are implemented through targeted modifications to specific model parameters or embeddings that control particular concepts or behaviors. These edits work by altering the internal representations that map textual prompts to visual outputs. However, when fine-tuning occurs, the optimization process modifies the entire parameter space, potentially overwriting or disrupting the carefully tuned edit regions. The degree of edit reversal depends on the fine-tuning method's impact scope - full fine-tuning methods like DoRA affect larger portions of the model, leading to more complete removal of prior edits, while parameter-efficient methods like DreamBooth preserve more of the original edit structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Text-to-image diffusion models**: Generate images from text prompts through iterative denoising processes. Understanding the generation pipeline is essential for comprehending where and how edits operate within the model architecture.
- **Model editing techniques**: Methods that modify specific model parameters to change behavior without full retraining. These techniques are increasingly important for customization and safety alignment but their stability under further training was previously unexplored.
- **Fine-tuning methodologies**: Approaches ranging from full parameter updates to parameter-efficient methods that preserve most weights. The scope and intensity of fine-tuning directly impacts edit persistence.
- **Evaluation metrics for edit persistence**: Quantitative measures needed to assess how well edits survive subsequent training. The study uses LMD (Log Maximum Discrepancy) to compare edit effectiveness before and after fine-tuning.
- **Concept debiasing in diffusion models**: Techniques for removing unwanted associations (like gender stereotypes) from model behavior. This represents a critical safety application where edit persistence is essential for deployment.
- **Unsafe content removal**: Methods for ensuring models refuse to generate harmful content. The robustness of such safety edits after fine-tuning determines real-world deployment safety.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Encoder -> UNet Backbone -> Diffusion Process -> Output Image

**Critical Path**: Text encoding and conditioning -> Feature transformation through UNet -> Iterative denoising guided by text → Final image generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Full fine-tuning provides better adaptation to new data but destroys prior edits; parameter-efficient methods preserve edits but may limit adaptation quality; editing methods vary in their robustness to fine-tuning based on their implementation approach

**Failure Signatures**: Significant drop in edit efficacy post-fine-tuning (measured by LMD), generation of pre-edit content when prompted with edit-indicating text, regression to baseline behavior for edited concepts

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply a simple concept edit (e.g., changing "dog" to "cat" appearance) and verify edit effectiveness through qualitative generation comparison
2. Fine-tune the edited model with a small dataset and measure post-tuning edit efficacy using LMD metric
3. Compare edit persistence across different fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth vs LoRA vs DoRA) using identical edit and fine-tuning configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited to Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures, potentially limiting generalizability to other model families
- Evaluation covers a limited subset of possible editing operations and real-world usage patterns
- No investigation of multiple sequential edits or long-term behavior beyond immediate post-tuning evaluation

## Confidence
- **Empirical findings on edit persistence**: High
- **Methodological comparisons between editing techniques**: Medium
- **Generalizability across model architectures**: Low

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Replicate experiments across additional model families (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney-style architectures) to assess whether findings generalize beyond Stable Diffusion and FLUX.

2. **Longitudinal stability testing**: Evaluate edit persistence over extended fine-tuning schedules with varying data distributions and task complexities to identify degradation patterns over time.

3. **Sequential editing analysis**: Investigate scenarios involving multiple consecutive edits and fine-tuning cycles to understand cumulative effects and potential compounding degradation of editing efficacy.
