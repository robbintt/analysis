core_contribution: We propose spatiotemporal data augmentation using video diffusion
  models to generate synthetic views and dynamics for object detection in low-data
  regimes. Our method leverages video diffusion models to synthesize novel viewpoints
  and temporal variations from single images, expanding the training distribution
  along underexplored geometric and dynamic axes.

# Generative Spatiotemporal Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12508
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Generative spatiotemporal augmentation improves object detection in low-data regimes with +3.8 mAP on COCO5k, +2.8 mAP on VisDrone, and +5.9 mAP on Semantic Drone

## Executive Summary
This work proposes generative spatiotemporal data augmentation for object detection in low-data regimes using video diffusion models. The method synthesizes novel viewpoints and temporal variations from single images to expand training distribution along geometric and dynamic axes. An automated annotation pipeline propagates bounding boxes across generated frames using video segmentation models. Experiments show consistent improvements across multiple datasets, with spatial augmentation working best for object-centric datasets while temporal augmentation is more effective for aerial imagery.

## Method Summary
The approach leverages video diffusion models to generate synthetic views and dynamics for object detection. From single input images, the system synthesizes novel viewpoints and temporal variations, expanding the training distribution along underexplored geometric and dynamic axes. An automated annotation pipeline propagates bounding boxes across generated frames using video segmentation models, handling disocclusion through tracking-based masking or pseudo-labeling. The method is designed to complement existing appearance-based augmentations and shows particular effectiveness in low-data regimes where traditional augmentation strategies have been exhausted.

## Key Results
- +3.8 mAP improvement on COCO5k subset compared to baseline
- +2.8 mAP improvement on VisDrone dataset for aerial object detection
- +5.9 mAP improvement on Semantic Drone dataset
- Spatial augmentation shows diminishing returns at larger dataset sizes
- Method is complementary to existing appearance-based augmentations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by expanding the training distribution along axes that are typically underexplored in traditional data augmentation: geometric transformations (spatial augmentation) and temporal dynamics (temporal augmentation). Video diffusion models can generate realistic variations in viewpoint and motion that expose object detectors to diverse scenarios they might encounter in real-world deployment. The automated annotation pipeline ensures that generated frames retain ground truth labels without manual annotation overhead, making the approach scalable. The method's effectiveness varies by dataset type, with spatial augmentation benefiting object-centric datasets where viewpoint variation is limited, while temporal augmentation excels in aerial datasets where motion patterns are more predictable.

## Foundational Learning

**Video Diffusion Models** - Why needed: Core technology for generating realistic spatiotemporal variations from single images. Quick check: Can generate temporally consistent video sequences with realistic motion patterns.

**Video Segmentation Propagation** - Why needed: Enables automated bounding box annotation across generated frames without manual labeling. Quick check: Can accurately track objects across frames and handle occlusions.

**Object Detection Training** - Why needed: Framework for evaluating augmentation effectiveness and measuring mAP improvements. Quick check: Standard evaluation metrics (mAP) show consistent improvements across datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Single Image → Video Diffusion Model → Generated Frames → Segmentation Propagation → Annotated Dataset → Object Detector Training

**Critical Path:** The diffusion model generation step is the critical path as it determines the quality and diversity of synthetic data. Poor generation quality directly impacts downstream detection performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational cost (generating synthetic videos) for annotation savings and improved detection performance. The approach is dataset-dependent, requiring careful selection of augmentation type (spatial vs temporal) based on dataset characteristics.

**Failure Signatures:** Degradation in mask quality during segmentation propagation, particularly for small or occluded objects. Limited effectiveness on datasets where geometric variation is already well-covered by standard augmentations.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare spatial vs temporal augmentation effectiveness on a mixed dataset to determine optimal augmentation strategy
2. Evaluate annotation quality degradation by comparing propagated boxes against manually annotated frames
3. Test the method on a transformer-based detector to assess architectural dependencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on video diffusion models designed for natural scenes may limit generalization to specialized domains like aerial imagery
- Automated annotation pipeline introduces propagation errors that compound across generated frames
- Method effectiveness is strongly dataset-dependent with varying performance between object-centric and aerial datasets

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Complementary nature to existing methods and diminishing returns at larger dataset sizes
- Medium Confidence: Relative effectiveness of spatial vs temporal augmentation across dataset types
- Medium Confidence: Specific mAP improvements reported, as these are benchmark-specific

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on diverse aerial datasets with varying object scales and densities to establish generalizability
2. Implement an oracle study comparing propagated annotations against manually annotated frames to quantify annotation quality degradation
3. Evaluate the approach on object detection architectures beyond YOLOv7, including transformer-based detectors, to assess architectural dependencies
