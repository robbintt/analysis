# Towards Policy-Compliant Agents: Learning Efficient Guardrails For Policy Violation Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03485
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: 4B-parameter guardrail model achieves 90.1% accuracy with 22.5 ms/example inference time

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting policy violations in autonomous web agent trajectories. The authors introduce PolicyGuardBench, a 60k-scale benchmark for policy-trajectory violation detection, constructed through systematic policy synthesis, trajectory matching, and annotation. They train PolicyGuard-4B, a lightweight 4B-parameter guardrail model, which achieves strong accuracy (90.1%) and cross-domain generalization while maintaining efficient inference (22.5 ms/example). The model outperforms both large foundation models and existing safety-oriented guardrails, demonstrating that accurate and generalizable policy compliance detection is feasible at small scales.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a systematic approach to detect policy violations in autonomous web agent trajectories. They create PolicyGuardBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 60,000 trajectory-policy pairs through policy synthesis, trajectory matching, and manual annotation. The core contribution is PolicyGuard-4B, a 4B-parameter guardrail model trained specifically for policy violation detection. The model demonstrates strong performance across different domains while maintaining efficient inference speeds, achieving 90.1% accuracy with 22.5 ms processing time per example. The lightweight architecture outperforms both larger foundation models and existing safety-oriented guardrails.

## Key Results
- PolicyGuard-4B achieves 90.1% accuracy on policy violation detection
- Model processes examples in 22.5 ms with 4B parameters
- Outperforms both large foundation models and existing safety-oriented guardrails
- Demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging a specialized training regime on synthetic but systematically constructed policy-trajectory pairs. The 4B-parameter architecture is sufficient to capture the complex patterns of policy violations while remaining computationally efficient. The benchmark construction methodology ensures diverse coverage of policy scenarios, enabling the model to generalize across domains. The lightweight design avoids the computational overhead of larger models while maintaining accuracy through focused training on the specific task of policy violation detection.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Policy Violation Detection** - Understanding how autonomous agents can violate predefined rules during execution. Why needed: Core problem being solved. Quick check: Can the system identify when an agent deviates from allowed behaviors.

2. **Trajectory Matching** - Process of aligning agent actions with policy constraints. Why needed: Essential for determining compliance. Quick check: Does the system correctly map agent behavior to relevant policy rules.

3. **Benchmark Construction** - Methodology for creating representative datasets for evaluation. Why needed: Ensures reliable performance measurement. Quick check: Are the synthetic examples diverse enough to capture real-world scenarios.

4. **Guardrail Architecture** - Design principles for safety-critical detection systems. Why needed: Balances accuracy with computational efficiency. Quick check: Can the model maintain performance while scaling to different parameter sizes.

5. **Cross-Domain Generalization** - Ability to perform well across different policy domains. Why needed: Critical for practical deployment. Quick check: Does performance degrade when policies change domains.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: PolicyGuardBench -> PolicyGuard-4B -> Inference Engine -> Violation Output

**Critical Path**: Input trajectory and policy → Feature extraction → Violation classification → Output decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Smaller model size (4B) vs. accuracy (90.1%)
- Computational efficiency (22.5 ms) vs. detection capability
- Synthetic data generation vs. real-world representativeness

**Failure Signatures**:
- False positives on complex multi-step violations
- Performance degradation with highly nuanced policy language
- Edge case handling limitations in novel policy domains

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison with GPT-4 on the same benchmark
2. Cross-domain generalization test with unseen policy types
3. Ablation study on model size and inference speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic policy data may not capture real-world complexity
- Performance claims based on specific 60k-scale benchmark may not generalize
- 4B-parameter model may have blind spots in edge cases or highly complex scenarios
- Limited absolute performance comparisons to other guardrail systems

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core methodology and benchmark construction | High |
| Cross-domain generalization claims | Medium |
| Efficiency metrics relative to other guardrails | Medium |
| Real-world deployment effectiveness | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate PolicyGuard-4B on real-world agent trajectories from deployed systems to validate synthetic benchmark performance

2. Test the model's robustness against adversarial policy violations and edge cases not present in the training data

3. Conduct comprehensive comparison of inference efficiency and accuracy against existing guardrail systems using standardized metrics and diverse policy domains
