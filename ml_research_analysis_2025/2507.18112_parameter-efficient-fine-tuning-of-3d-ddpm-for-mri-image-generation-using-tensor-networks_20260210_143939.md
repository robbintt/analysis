# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of 3D DDPM for MRI Image Generation Using Tensor Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18112
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18112
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art MS-SSIM performance while requiring only 0.3% of trainable parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for 3D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in MRI image generation. The approach leverages tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, enabling complex spatial dependency capture during fine-tuning with minimal parameters. TenVOO is evaluated on three brain MRI datasets by fine-tuning a pretrained DDPM model on UK Biobank data, demonstrating superior MS-SSIM performance compared to existing methods while maintaining extreme parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
TenVOO addresses the computational challenges of fine-tuning 3D U-Net-based DDPMs for MRI generation by decomposing 3D convolution kernels into lower-dimensional tensor representations. This tensor network approach allows the model to capture complex spatial dependencies while requiring only a small fraction of the original parameters during fine-tuning. The method is applied to fine-tune a pretrained 3D DDPM model on brain MRI datasets from ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure while maintaining parameter efficiency.

## Key Results
- TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art MS-SSIM performance on three brain MRI datasets
- The method requires only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original 3D DDPM model
- Outperforms existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies during fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tensor network decomposition allows TenVOO to represent complex 3D convolution operations using significantly fewer parameters while preserving essential spatial relationships. By factorizing the high-dimensional convolution kernels into lower-rank tensor components, the method maintains the model's ability to capture volumetric dependencies in MRI data while dramatically reducing the parameter count during fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**: Generative models that learn to reverse a noising process by gradually denoising from random noise to generate realistic samples. Needed to understand the baseline architecture being fine-tuned. Quick check: Verify understanding of forward noising and reverse denoising processes.

**3D U-Net Architecture**: Convolutional neural network with skip connections designed for volumetric data processing, commonly used in medical imaging. Needed to understand the model structure being modified. Quick check: Confirm understanding of encoder-decoder structure with skip connections.

**Tensor Network Decomposition**: Mathematical framework for representing high-dimensional tensors as networks of lower-dimensional tensors. Needed to understand how TenVOO achieves parameter efficiency. Quick check: Verify understanding of tensor contraction and rank reduction concepts.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pretrained 3D DDPM -> TenVOO Fine-tuning Layer -> MRI Dataset (ADNI/PPMI/BraTS2021)

**Critical Path**: Data Input → Tensor-Decomposed Convolution → Feature Extraction → Upsampling → Generated MRI Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parameter efficiency vs. generation quality, computational complexity vs. model capacity, tensor rank vs. reconstruction accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: Numerical instabilities during tensor decomposition, loss of spatial detail in generated images, convergence issues during fine-tuning

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement tensor decomposition on a single 3D convolution layer and measure parameter reduction
2. Compare MS-SSIM performance between standard fine-tuning and TenVOO on a small subset of data
3. Test different tensor ranks to find the optimal balance between efficiency and quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on MS-SSIM with limited discussion of other clinically relevant metrics
- Assumes availability of a large pretrained model from UK Biobank, which may not be universally accessible
- Tensor network implementation requires careful handling to avoid numerical instabilities

## Confidence

**High confidence**: TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art MS-SSIM performance on brain MRI datasets
**Medium confidence**: TenVOO captures complex spatial dependencies more effectively than existing methods
**Medium confidence**: The 0.3% parameter requirement represents significant efficiency gains

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TenVOO across additional image quality metrics beyond MS-SSIM, including structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and Fréchet inception distance (FID)
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal balance between parameter efficiency and generation quality by testing TenVOO with varying levels of tensor decomposition
3. Validate the approach on non-brain MRI modalities (e.g., cardiac, abdominal) to assess generalizability beyond the current brain-focused evaluation
