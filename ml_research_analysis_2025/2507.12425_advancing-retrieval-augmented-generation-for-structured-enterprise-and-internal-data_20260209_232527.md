# Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.12425
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Advanced RAG framework improves Precision@5 from 75% to 90%, Recall@5 from 74% to 87%, and MRR from 0.69 to 0.85 on structured enterprise data

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of retrieving and generating answers from structured enterprise data, such as HR records and tabular documents, where traditional RAG frameworks often fail. The proposed system integrates hybrid retrieval (dense embeddings + BM25), metadata-aware filtering, and cross-encoder reranking, along with semantic chunking for text and row-level indexing for tables. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline RAG, with substantial gains in both quantitative retrieval metrics and qualitative answer quality. The framework is designed to preserve the semantic and structural integrity of enterprise data during retrieval and generation.

## Method Summary
The framework combines hybrid retrieval using dense embeddings and BM25, metadata-aware filtering, and cross-encoder reranking to improve retrieval accuracy. For structured data, it applies semantic chunking to text and preserves table structures via row-level indexing to maintain row-column relationships. The system is evaluated on enterprise HR and tabular datasets, showing robust performance gains over baseline RAG methods.

## Key Results
- Precision@5 increased from 75% to 90%
- Recall@5 increased from 74% to 87%
- MRR improved from 0.69 to 0.85
- Qualitative metrics (Faithfulness, Completeness, Relevance) improved on a 5-point Likert scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework improves retrieval by leveraging hybrid retrieval to combine the strengths of dense semantic matching and keyword-based BM25. Metadata-aware filtering narrows the search space, while cross-encoder reranking refines the top results. For structured data, preserving row-column relationships through row-level indexing ensures semantic fidelity, and semantic chunking prevents loss of context. These mechanisms collectively enhance both the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25):** Combines semantic and lexical matching to cover both exact and conceptual matches. Quick check: Test retrieval performance with and without hybrid approach on structured datasets.
- **Metadata-aware filtering:** Narrows retrieval scope by leveraging metadata, improving precision. Quick check: Measure precision gains when filtering is applied versus disabled.
- **Cross-encoder reranking:** Reorders top-k results using cross-attention, boosting relevance. Quick check: Compare retrieval metrics with and without reranking.
- **Semantic chunking:** Segments text to preserve context and meaning. Quick check: Evaluate chunk size impact on retrieval quality.
- **Row-level indexing for tables:** Maintains row-column relationships for structured data. Quick check: Test retrieval accuracy on tables with and without row-level indexing.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Query -> Hybrid Retriever (Dense + BM25) -> Metadata Filter -> Cross-Encoder Reranker -> Generator
- **Critical path:** Query flows through hybrid retrieval, metadata filtering, and cross-encoder reranking before generation.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Cross-encoder reranking improves accuracy but increases computational cost; metadata filtering improves precision but may exclude relevant results if metadata is incomplete.
- **Failure signatures:** Poor metadata may lead to over-filtering; dense embeddings may miss exact matches without BM25; reranking may introduce latency.
- **First experiments:**
  1. Benchmark retrieval metrics (Precision@5, Recall@5, MRR) on structured enterprise datasets.
  2. Compare qualitative answer quality (Faithfulness, Completeness, Relevance) with baseline RAG.
  3. Evaluate latency and cost of the full hybrid + reranking pipeline in a production-like environment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reproducibility is limited by lack of dataset details, baseline implementations, and hyperparameter configurations.
- Qualitative metrics rely on subjective Likert-scale evaluations without inter-rater reliability measures.
- Cross-encoder reranking is computationally expensive and may not scale efficiently in production.
- The framework is evaluated primarily on English-language HR and tabular data; cross-lingual or multimodal applicability is untested.

## Confidence
- Core retrieval improvements (Precision@5, Recall@5, MRR): **Medium** due to lack of reproducibility details.
- Qualitative metric claims (Faithfulness, Completeness, Relevance): **Low** due to absence of reliability and bias controls.
- Scalability and deployment claims: **Low** due to missing efficiency analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experimental setup using the same enterprise datasets (or publicly available analogs) to verify Precision@5, Recall@5, and MRR improvements under identical conditions.
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis (e.g., Cohen's kappa) for the qualitative Likert-scale evaluations to confirm the robustness of Faithfulness, Completeness, and Relevance scores.
3. Perform end-to-end latency and cost benchmarking of the full hybrid retrieval + cross-encoder reranking pipeline in a production-like environment to assess scalability for enterprise use.
