# When Simpler Wins: Facebooks Prophet vs LSTM for Air Pollution Forecasting in Data-Constrained Northern Nigeria

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.16244
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16244
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Key outcome**: Prophet often matched or outperformed LSTM for air pollution forecasting in 19 northern Nigerian states, especially for pollutants with strong seasonal patterns, challenging the assumption that complex deep learning models always perform better

## Executive Summary
This study compares Facebook Prophet and LSTM models for forecasting air pollutants (CO, SO₂, SO₄) across 19 northern Nigerian states using monthly data from 2018 to 2023. Contrary to expectations, Prophet frequently matched or exceeded LSTM's performance, particularly for pollutants with strong seasonal and trend patterns. The research highlights that model selection should prioritize alignment with data characteristics rather than complexity alone, especially in resource-constrained settings where Prophet's computational efficiency and robustness to irregular data offer practical advantages.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates Prophet and LSTM models on monthly air quality data (2018-2023) from 19 northern Nigerian states, including CO, SO₂, SO₄, and meteorological variables. Data undergoes preprocessing with linear interpolation for missing values and Min-Max normalization, then splits into 80/20 chronological train-test sets. LSTM employs 64-128 memory cells with dropout (0.2) and grid search hyperparameter tuning, while Prophet uses additive decomposition with weekly and yearly seasonality. Performance is assessed using RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and R² across pollutants and states.

## Key Results
- Prophet often matched or outperformed LSTM for pollutants with strong seasonal/trend patterns
- LSTM was superior at handling abrupt structural changes like the 2020-2021 SO₄ drop during COVID-19
- Results challenge the assumption that complex deep learning models always outperform simpler methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Prophet's additive decomposition architecture provides competitive or superior forecasting accuracy for pollutants exhibiting strong seasonal and trend patterns, under data-constrained conditions.
- **Mechanism**: Prophet decomposes time series into interpretable components—piecewise linear or logistic growth trend g(t), Fourier-series seasonal component s(t), and holiday/event effects h(t)—allowing each to be modeled independently rather than learned jointly through hidden representations. This separation reduces the learning burden when data is sparse or irregular, as trend and seasonality priors are explicitly encoded rather than discovered from scratch.
- **Core assumption**: The underlying pollutant time series is approximately decomposable into additive trend, seasonal, and residual components with identifiable changepoints.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Prophet often matched or outperformed LSTM, especially for pollutants with strong seasonal and trend patterns"
  - [section 3.3.2] Prophet formula: y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + εₜ; "Prophet automatically detects trend changepoints, handles missing data, and accommodates outliers through robust estimation"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for Prophet-specific decomposition advantage; related paper "Beyond the Hype" investigates lightweight vs. deep learning but does not isolate decomposition as mechanism
- **Break condition**: If the target pollutant exhibits non-additive interactions between trend and seasonality, or if structural breaks are frequent and unpredictable (not gradual changepoints), Prophet's assumption violated → expect degraded performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: LSTM networks capture abrupt structural changes in pollutant series more effectively than Prophet when sufficient training data exists.
- **Mechanism**: LSTM's gated memory architecture (cell state, hidden state, input/forget/output gates) allows selective retention and forgetting of information across arbitrary time lags. This enables the network to adapt internal representations to regime shifts—such as the SO₄ drop during 2020-2021 pandemic period and subsequent rebound—without relying on pre-specified changepoint detection.
- **Core assumption**: Sufficient sequential data exists for LSTM to learn temporal dependency patterns; the structural changes are learnable from past sequences rather than purely stochastic.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "LSTM was better at handling abrupt structural changes"
  - [section 4.2.3] "SO₄ concentrations dropped sharply between 2020 and 2021, likely reflecting pandemic-related emission reductions, followed by sharp rebounds... LSTM outperforming Prophet in Kaduna and Sokoto"
  - [section 3.3.1] LSTM architecture comprises "64–128 memory cells... dropout layer with rate of 0.2... trained using Adam optimiser"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of LSTM regime-shift advantage in air quality; corpus focuses on multimodal and hybrid approaches
- **Break condition**: If data is too sparse (<2–3 years of monthly observations), too noisy, or hyperparameter tuning is inadequate, LSTM's capacity to learn long-range dependencies collapses → overfitting or failure to converge.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Model-data alignment—matching model architecture to data characteristics—predicts relative performance better than model complexity alone.
- **Mechanism**: Prophet's inductive bias toward smooth trend + seasonality fits regular patterns but resists rapid phase transitions; LSTM's flexible sequence modeling fits irregular patterns but requires more data to avoid overfitting. The relative performance emerges from the interaction between data structure (variance decomposition across trend/seasonality/residual) and model bias, not model sophistication per se.
- **Core assumption**: The dominant source of variance in the target series (trend/seasonality vs. abrupt shifts) can be characterized a priori or through exploratory analysis.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Results challenge the assumption that complex deep learning models always outperform simpler methods, emphasizing the importance of model-data alignment"
  - [section 4.3] "Prophet's consistent performance, often matching or surpassing LSTM, particularly for pollutants exhibiting strong seasonal patterns and long-term trends, corroborates previous research emphasising its robustness in the face of irregular data"
  - [corpus] "Beyond the Hype: Comparing Lightweight and Deep Learning Models" explicitly examines this question; results pending review
- **Break condition**: If data exhibits mixed characteristics (e.g., strong seasonality with superimposed abrupt shocks), neither model dominates consistently → consider hybrid or ensemble approaches (noted as limitation in section 4.4).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Additive Time Series Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Prophet's entire architecture assumes y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + εₜ; understanding this decomposition is prerequisite to interpreting Prophet outputs and diagnosing failure modes.
  - Quick check question: Given a pollutant series with clear annual peaks but irregular spikes from industrial events, which component would capture each pattern?

- **Concept: LSTM Gating Mechanisms (Input, Forget, Output Gates)**
  - Why needed here: Paper attributes LSTM's regime-shift handling to its gated memory architecture; understanding gates explains why LSTM can selectively retain long-term context vs. reset on structural breaks.
  - Quick check question: If a pollutant series has a permanent level shift at month 30, how would the forget gate behavior differ before vs. after the shift during training?

- **Concept: Overfitting in Sequence Models with Small Data**
  - Why needed here: Paper explicitly warns LSTM "risk[s] overfitting small or erratic datasets" (section 1); this is the core failure mode in data-constrained settings.
  - Quick check question: With only 72 monthly observations and 128 LSTM cells, what regularization techniques would mitigate overfitting risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw pollutant + meteorological data → Missing value handling (linear interpolation, forward-fill) → Min-Max normalization → 80/20 chronological split → Prophet branch (trend + seasonal + effects decomposition) OR LSTM branch (sliding window sequences → LSTM layers → dropout → dense layer) → Forecast → Predictions vs. actual → MSE/RMSE/MAPE/R² evaluation

- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing quality (missing value handling, normalization) → Chronological split integrity → Model-specific hyperparameter tuning (Prophet: seasonality/changepoint settings; LSTM: cells, dropout, learning rate, epochs) → Metric comparison across pollutants and states

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Prophet: Lower computational cost, faster deployment, interpretable components, robust to missing data—but smoother forecasts, slower adaptation to abrupt changes
  - LSTM: Flexible sequence modeling, better regime-shift capture—but higher tuning burden, requires more data, longer training, less interpretable

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Prophet underperforms when: Series has non-additive structure, frequent unpredictable shocks, or changepoints outside Prophet's detection sensitivity
  - LSTM underperforms when: Data is sparse (<60 observations), highly irregular, or hyperparameters poorly tuned;表现为: validation loss diverges from training loss, predictions oscillate wildly, or converge to constant value

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Replicate the paper's Prophet vs. LSTM comparison on one pollutant (e.g., CO) for one state (e.g., Kaduna) using the described architecture. Verify RMSE values approximately match Table 1. This validates implementation correctness.
  2. **Ablation on sequence length**: For LSTM, test different lookback window sizes (3, 6, 12 months) to determine whether performance gains from longer context outweigh data scarcity costs. Report RMSE for each window.
  3. **Hybrid probe**: Fit Prophet on the same data, extract residuals, then train LSTM on residuals only. Compare combined forecast accuracy to either model alone. This tests whether Prophet can "explain away" trend/seasonality, leaving LSTM to focus on residual dynamics including structural breaks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would hybrid models combining Prophet's seasonal decomposition with LSTM's temporal flexibility outperform either model alone for Northern Nigerian air pollution forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should focus on... developing hybrid models that combine Prophet's interpretability with LSTM's flexibility"
- Why unresolved: The study only compared standalone models; no ensemble or hybrid approaches were tested despite explicitly acknowledging this gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implement and evaluate Prophet-LSTM hybrid architectures on the same dataset using standardized metrics (RMSE, MAPE, R²) against individual model baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does forecast accuracy change when using daily or hourly pollutant measurements instead of monthly averages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "limitations arise from the use of monthly averaged data, potentially obscuring critical short-term pollution spikes. Future work should focus on leveraging higher-resolution temporal data (daily or hourly)."
- Why unresolved: Monthly aggregation may smooth over important patterns; model behavior at finer temporal scales remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Collect high-frequency data for the same study region and compare LSTM vs. Prophet performance across multiple temporal resolutions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do meteorological regressors (wind speed, temperature, rainfall) materially improve forecast accuracy for these pollutants?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Meteorological data were collected alongside pollutant measurements, but Prophet included "no external regressors beyond pollutant observations" and LSTM's use of these features was not isolated through ablation.
- Why unresolved: The incremental predictive value of weather variables in this context is unknown despite their known influence on pollutant dispersion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct ablation studies with and without meteorological inputs for both models to quantify marginal accuracy gains.

## Limitations
- Restricted to six northern Nigerian states with monthly aggregated data spanning only 2018-2023
- Private dataset prevents independent verification and replication
- Did not explore hybrid approaches combining Prophet's decomposition with LSTM's regime-shift detection

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Prophet's competitive performance against LSTM in seasonal/trend-dominated series; LSTM's superior handling of abrupt structural changes; computational efficiency advantage of Prophet
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about model-data alignment being more important than model complexity; generalizability to other geographic regions or pollutants
- **Low confidence**: Absence of hybrid model exploration; potential data quality issues given acknowledged data constraints in developing regions

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal resolution test**: Replicate the analysis using daily instead of monthly data (if available) to determine whether LSTM's sequence modeling advantage scales with higher-frequency observations.

2. **Cross-regional validation**: Apply the Prophet vs. LSTM comparison to air quality data from another developing region with different seasonal patterns (e.g., Southeast Asia monsoon regions) to test geographic generalizability.

3. **Hybrid model benchmark**: Implement a hybrid approach where Prophet forecasts trend/seasonality and LSTM models residuals, comparing performance against either model alone to quantify potential gains from combining their complementary strengths.
