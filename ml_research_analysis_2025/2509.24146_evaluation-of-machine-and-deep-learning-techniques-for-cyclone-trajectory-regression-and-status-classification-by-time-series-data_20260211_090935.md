# Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24146
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two-stage ML pipeline (GBR regression + RF classification) achieves 93% accuracy in cyclone status prediction with low MAE for physical features

## Executive Summary
This study develops a two-stage machine learning pipeline to forecast tropical cyclone trajectory and status using NOAA's HURDAT2 database. The approach first predicts cyclone features (pressure, wind speed, trajectory length/direction) using gradient boosting regression, then classifies cyclone status using random forest, SVM, and MLP classifiers. The pipeline achieves high accuracy (93% for RF) in status classification while maintaining low prediction errors for physical parameters, offering a robust alternative to traditional forecasting methods for real-time cyclone prediction and decision support systems.

## Method Summary
The method employs a sliding window approach to transform time-series cyclone data into feature vectors. A Gradient Boosting Regression model first predicts four physical features (max wind, min pressure, trajectory length, directional change) from historical data. These predictions are then converted back to geographic coordinates and fed into three classification models (Random Forest, SVM, MLP) to predict cyclone status from nine categories. The pipeline uses normalization/standardization for different features, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and evaluates performance using MAE, R-squared for regression, and accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 for classification.

## Key Results
- Gradient Boosting Regression achieves MAE of 2.2 mb (pressure), 2.4 kt (wind), and 70 km (trajectory length) with R-squared scores of 96.3%, 96.1%, and 84.2% respectively
- Random Forest classifier outperforms SVM and MLP with 93% accuracy, particularly excelling at identifying minority cyclone statuses
- Directional prediction shows highest error (21.3° MAE, R-squared 60.0%), attributed to missing atmospheric factors
- Sliding window of 5 timesteps for regression and 4 for classification yields optimal results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Decomposing the forecasting problem into sequential regression then classification reduces learning complexity.
- **Mechanism:** GBR first learns continuous physical dynamics, providing high-confidence predictions that serve as engineered inputs for RF classification. This "synopsis" approach enables RF to map physical thresholds to categorical statuses more effectively than raw history alone.
- **Core assumption:** Regression errors are sufficiently low to not cascade into significant classification errors.
- **Evidence anchors:** Two-stage pipeline development with 96.3% R² for pressure supporting regression accuracy.
- **Break condition:** If regression MAE spikes (especially for direction), classifier receives noisy inputs causing misclassification of similar-status cyclones.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Random Forest outperforms deep learning because its ensemble architecture is robust to small data sizes and class imbalance when augmented with SMOTE.
- **Mechanism:** RF uses bagging to train multiple trees on random data subsets, reducing variance without requiring massive datasets. Combined with SMOTE for minority classes, RF defines decision boundaries for rare statuses without overfitting, whereas SVMs struggle with skewed classes.
- **Core assumption:** SMOTE synthetic samples accurately represent true minority class distributions.
- **Evidence anchors:** RF excels on small datasets and handles high-dimensional data well; class imbalance addressed with SMOTE.
- **Break condition:** If dataset were significantly larger or high-dimensional, MLPs or CNNs would likely outperform RF.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Sliding window transforms temporal dependency into static feature vector, enabling non-recursive models to capture time-series trends.
- **Mechanism:** Window of 4-5 previous observations flattened into single input vector allows GBR and RF to "see" velocity and acceleration trends without recurrent architectures.
- **Core assumption:** Relevant history for prediction is contained within fixed window size (4-5 steps).
- **Evidence anchors:** Sliding window creates data embedding historic data; window size of five for regression and four for classification yields lowest error.
- **Break condition:** If critical events occur outside 24-30 hour window, model fails to capture long-lead precursors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gradient Boosting vs. Random Forest**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper uses GBR for regression and RF for classification. GBR builds trees sequentially to correct errors (good for precise continuous values), while RF builds trees in parallel to reduce variance (good for robust classification).
  - **Quick check question:** Why would GBR potentially overfit more easily than RF on noisy cyclone data?

- **Concept: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**
  - **Why needed here:** Cyclone statuses are heavily imbalanced (e.g., 'Tropical Storm' common; 'Disturbance' rare). Standard models ignore rare classes. SMOTE interpolates new examples to force model to learn these boundaries.
  - **Quick check question:** How does SMOTE generate a new sample for a minority class? (Answer: Interpolating between a sample and its k-nearest neighbors).

- **Concept: Normalization vs. Standardization**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper treats coordinates (Normalization to [0,1]) differently from wind speed (Standardization/Z-score). This affects how model perceives "distance" in feature space.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is Standardization (Z-score) preferred over Normalization for Wind Speed in this context? (Hint: Outliers/Gaussian distribution assumptions).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** HURDAT2 dataset (Raw CSV) -> Preprocessing (Filter nulls, Calculate Vector/Direction, Normalize/Standardize) -> Sliding Window Generator -> Stage 1 (Regressor: GBR predicts Pressure, Wind, Dist, Dir) -> Stage 2 (Classifier: RF, SVM, MLP predicts Status) -> Evaluation (MAE/R² for Regression, Precision/Recall/F1 for Classification)

- **Critical path:** The conversion of regressed Length and Direction back into x/y coordinates. If Direction MAE (21°) is too high, geographic plot diverges significantly from ground truth, making status classification geographically irrelevant.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:** RF chosen over Deep Learning despite MLPs potential power, specifically for robustness on small data.
  - **Error Propagation:** Using predicted regression values as inputs for classification creates dependency chain. Direct multi-output model might be safer but harder to tune.
  - **Window Size:** Tuned to 4/5. Larger windows increase dimensionality without adding signal.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Confusion between TD and LO:** Paper notes model struggles here due to similar physical features. Monitor confusion matrix specifically for these two classes.
  - **Directional Drift:** If predicted trajectory spirals off, check Direction MAE; it is weakest link (R² = 60%).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Reproduction:** Implement pipeline using default scikit-learn parameters to verify 93% accuracy claim holds without extensive tuning.
  2. **Window Ablation:** Test window sizes of 2, 5, and 10 to observe shift in MAE and confirm paper's claim that 4/5 are optimal.
  3. **Direct Classification:** Bypass regression stage and feed historical data directly into classifier to measure performance delta from two-stage architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- High directional prediction error (21.3° MAE) attributed to missing atmospheric factors not included in dataset
- Error propagation risk from regression stage predictions feeding classification stage
- Limited ability to capture rapidly changing atmospheric conditions outside 24-30 hour sliding window

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** RF classifier's superior performance (93% accuracy) over SVM and MLP is well-supported by methodology and aligns with established ML literature on ensemble methods' robustness to small datasets
- **Medium Confidence:** Two-stage pipeline approach is mechanistically sound, but lack of direct comparison to end-to-end models leaves uncertainty about whether decomposition is optimal
- **Low Confidence:** R² of 96.3% for pressure and 96.1% for wind speed may be optimistic given potential for error propagation and relatively simple feature set

## Next Checks
1. **Error Propagation Analysis:** Isolate and quantify classification error attributable to regression stage's predictions, particularly for direction feature with high MAE
2. **Temporal Generalization Test:** Evaluate model performance on more recent cyclone data (post-2016) to assess temporal generalization and potential data drift
3. **Direct Comparison Benchmark:** Implement end-to-end deep learning model (LSTM or Transformer) using same features to compare against two-stage pipeline's performance
