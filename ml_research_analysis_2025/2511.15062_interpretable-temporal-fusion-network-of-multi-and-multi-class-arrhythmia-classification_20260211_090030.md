# Interpretable temporal fusion network of multi- and multi-class arrhythmia classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15062
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15062
- Reference count: 40
- This study introduces a novel clinical decision support system for detecting and classifying multiple arrhythmias from electrocardiograms.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel interpretable framework for multi- and multi-class arrhythmia classification using electrocardiograms. The approach combines temporal convolutional networks with multiscale temporal information fusion and multihead self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global patterns in arrhythmia signals. The model achieves superior performance on standard arrhythmia databases while maintaining clinical relevance through interpretable architecture design.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an encoder-decoder architecture with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) as the core feature extractor. The encoder uses multiscale temporal information fusion blocks with large convolution filters to capture global dependencies, while a multihead self-attention mechanism weights temporal context. The decoder reconstructs the segmentation map with skip connections and an adaptive postprocessing module. The model is trained using a combined loss function that addresses class imbalance through weighted Dice loss and Categorical Cross-Entropy.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-scores of 96.45% for duration, 82.05% for episode detection, and 96.31% Dice score on the MIT-BIH database
- Performance on AFDB: 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% respectively for the same metrics
- Demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models including UNet, Res-UNet, and LinkNet
- Showed strong generalization ability when tested across different databases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The Multiscale Temporal Information Fusion (TIF) block allows the model to capture global, long-range arrhythmic dependencies that simple local convolutional filters would miss, leading to improved detection of arrhythmia onset and ending points. The TIF block uses a series of large 10x1 convolution filters arranged in series and parallel, creating multiple distinct temporal receptive fields (10x1, 12x1, 14x1), enabling the model to inspect points of interest at various scales. This multiscale approach connects distant arrhythmic occurrence locations on the feature map, improving comprehension of global patterns.

### Mechanism 2
The Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) mechanism weighted by the temporal context from the encoder allows the decoder to focus on significant time steps, improving the model's ability to detect and classify intermittent arrhythmias. The MHA is applied after the TCN blocks in the encoder, learning contextual representations by capturing temporal interactions across all time steps in a weighted manner. These weighted features are then combined with upsampled features from the decoder, effectively integrating global context into the local reconstruction process.

### Mechanism 3
The combined loss function, integrating class-wise weighted Dice loss with Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), addresses class imbalance, which is critical for detecting clinically important but rare arrhythmias. The CCE loss evaluates class predictions at each time step individually, while the weighted Dice loss helps with imbalanced segmentation tasks. The authors modified the Dice loss with class-wise weights, assigning larger weights to less frequent classes (e.g., weight 43.8 for PREX vs. 0.7 for NSR) to force the optimizer to pay more attention to rare classes.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Semantic Segmentation Networks (Encoder-Decoder architectures)
- Why needed here: The paper frames arrhythmia classification as a dense prediction task where every time point in the input ECG signal needs a class label. Understanding encoder-decoder structures and skip connections is essential.
- Quick check question: If the model's input is a 2560-sample ECG signal, what is the fundamental goal of the decoder part of the network?

### Concept: Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
- Why needed here: The core feature extractor is a TCN. Understanding dilated causal convolutions is critical to grasp how the model captures long-range temporal dependencies without using recurrent layers.
- Quick check question: In a TCN, what is the purpose of the dilation rate in the convolutional layers?

### Concept: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA)
- Why needed here: This mechanism is a key component for capturing global context. Knowing how attention mechanisms create weighted representations of a sequence is needed to understand the "global" part of the model.
- Quick check question: In a self-attention layer, what do the Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V) vectors represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Input -> [Encoder: TCN + TIF] -> MHA -> Bridge -> [Decoder + MHA features] -> Output Head

### Critical path
Input -> [Encoder: TCN + TIF] -> MHA -> Bridge -> [Decoder + MHA features] -> Output Head

### Design tradeoffs
The architecture is more complex and has longer training times than baselines (UNet, LinkNet) but provides superior performance. The design prioritizes capturing long-range context (via TIF/MHA) over pure computational efficiency.

### Failure signatures
The model struggles with patterns that rely heavily on long-term historical data beyond the 10s window, such as bigeminy and trigeminy. It also exhibits higher false negative rates on noise data, which can be confused with certain arrhythmias like VT/VFIB.

### First 3 experiments
1. **Baseline Recreation:** Implement the "TCN-LinkNet" baseline described in section 2.4 to establish a performance baseline and verify the data pipeline on the MIT-BIH dataset.
2. **TIF Ablation:** Add the Multiscale TIF block to the baseline and evaluate its impact on overall F1-scores, specifically looking for improvements in global pattern recognition.
3. **MHA Integration:** Add the MHA component and compare performance, particularly on detecting the onset and ending points of intermittent arrhythmias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the proposed framework be optimized using lightweight algorithms without degrading its superior arrhythmia detection performance? The current multihead self-attention (MHA) mechanism imposes a high computational demand and increased complexity compared to baseline models.

### Open Question 2
How can the model architecture be modified to better capture the historical dependencies required for classifying bigeminy and trigeminy arrhythmias? The current local-global representation learning effectively captures sudden changes but fails to model the long-term periodic context specific to these rhythmic patterns.

### Open Question 3
What specific enhancements are required to improve the model's robustness to noise and prevent confusion with malignant arrhythmias? Noise in the MADB database exhibits frequency characteristics analogous to Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VFIB), leading to high false negative rates.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks ablation studies to isolate the contribution of key architectural components (TIF and MHA blocks)
- Evaluation focuses primarily on the MIT-BIH dataset, with limited testing on alternative databases
- The performance gains over baseline models could stem from increased model complexity rather than the specific proposed mechanisms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Overall framework design and general performance metrics (F1-scores, Dice scores) are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about superior performance compared to baselines, though the specific contribution of each architectural component remains uncertain without ablation studies
- **Low Confidence:** Claims regarding the specific mechanisms by which TIF and MHA blocks improve performance, as these are not empirically validated through controlled experiments

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing either the TIF or MHA components to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance
2. Evaluate the model's performance on additional arrhythmia databases (e.g., PTB Diagnostic Database) to assess generalizability across different patient populations
3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating its performance on ECG signals with varying levels of noise and artifact contamination to better understand its real-world clinical utility
