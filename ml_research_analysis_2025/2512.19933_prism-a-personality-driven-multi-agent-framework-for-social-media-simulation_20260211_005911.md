# PRISM: A Personality-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Social Media Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19933
- Reference count: 39
- Reduces distributional divergence by 66.7% compared to homogeneous baselines

## Executive Summary
PRISM introduces a multi-agent framework that simulates social media dynamics using personality-driven agents based on MBTI types. Unlike traditional homogeneous agent models, PRISM assigns cognitive policies to large language model agents initialized with empirical priors from real social media data. The framework couples stochastic differential equations for continuous emotional evolution with personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision processes for discrete decision-making. Experiments demonstrate superior personality consistency with human ground truth and successful replication of emergent phenomena like rational suppression and affective resonance.

## Method Summary
PRISM employs large language model agents with personality-conditional policies derived from MBTI cognitive functions. Agents are initialized using Dirichlet-smoothed posterior distributions P(e_k|T_i) estimated from 47,207 real discussion threads. The framework uses a hybrid architecture coupling continuous emotional states via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion processes with discrete message events through personality-conditional POMDPs. Each agent's behavior is conditioned on its MBTI type, with specific parameter values for stiffness, volatility, and susceptibility matrices that differ systematically across personality dimensions.

## Key Results
- Reduces distributional divergence by 66.7% compared to homogeneous baselines
- Achieves superior personality consistency with human ground truth
- Successfully replicates emergent phenomena like rational suppression and affective resonance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Personality-conditional priors grounded in empirical data reduce behavioral drift and improve simulation fidelity. Dirichlet-smoothed posterior distributions P(e_k|T_i) derived from real discussion threads bias each MBTI type toward archetype-consistent emotional baselines. Thinking types concentrate probability mass on "Neutral" states while Feeling types show higher entropy with elevated "Consoling"/"Happy" states.

### Mechanism 2
Hybrid SDE-PC-POMDP coupling preserves long-term behavioral coherence while enabling discrete interaction events. Continuous emotional states evolve via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion with personality-dependent stiffness and volatility, while discrete message events inject Dirac delta impulses that couple the layers.

### Mechanism 3
Threshold-based activation produces emergent phenomena without explicit top-down rules. Agents respond only when an activation function U_ij(t) exceeds type-specific thresholds, where emotional deviation terms create feedback loops that generate macro-level patterns like rapid contagion waves.

## Foundational Learning

- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**: Models emotional state evolution with mean-reversion plus stochastic noise. Without understanding SDE intuition, stiffness/volatility parameters are opaque. Quick check: Given stiffness Θ=2.0 and baseline μ=0.5, does an agent starting at e(0)=0.9 converge faster or slower than one with Θ=0.5?

- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**: Agents observe only partial dialogue history and must decide actions under uncertainty. The PC-POMDP extension adds personality-conditional policies. Quick check: Why would a fully observable MDP fail to capture realistic social media behavior?

- **MBTI Cognitive Functions (Ti, Te, Fi, Fe, etc.)**: Maps MBTI types to specific behavioral profiles. Understanding Jungian functions clarifies why stiffness/susceptibility differ across types. Quick check: Which dimension (T/F, E/I, S/N, J/P) most directly governs emotional susceptibility vs. rational suppression according to the ablation study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Prior Estimation Pipeline -> SDE Layer -> PC-POMDP Layer -> MLLM Response Generator -> Coupling Interface
- **Critical path**: Initialize agent emotional states from Dirichlet priors → compute SDE drift/diffusion update → evaluate activation threshold → active agents generate responses via MLLM → apply message impulses → project states back to valid simplex
- **Design tradeoffs**: Discrete MBTI vs. continuous Big Five (loses granularity but enables crisp role-based policies); empirical vs. synthetic priors (real data improves fidelity but introduces domain dependence); fine-tuned vs. prompted MLLM (adds training cost but improves role adherence)
- **Failure signatures**: State explosion if emotional dimensionality too high; annotation drift from GPT-4o labeling errors; threshold cascades from poorly calibrated thresholds; role collapse without strong personality conditioning
- **First 3 experiments**: Validate priors against human-labeled ground truth; replicate ablation study removing each MBTI dimension; run controlled simulation on controversial topic to confirm bifurcation between Analyst and Diplomat sentiment trajectories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- MBTI-to-emotion mapping relies on GPT-4o annotations without direct human validation
- Hybrid SDE-PC-POMDP coupling lacks external corpus validation for the specific architecture
- Empirical priors may overfit to platform-specific behaviors and demographic biases

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Personality-conditional priors improve consistency over homogeneous baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Hybrid SDE-PC-POMDP architecture produces realistic behavioral dynamics
- **Low Confidence**: Specific parameter choices generalize across domains

## Next Checks
1. **Ground Truth Validation**: Hold out 10% of social media corpus for human-annotated MBTI labels and emotional states; compare against GPT-4o-derived priors using calibration curves and confusion matrices.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Test PRISM on a different social platform (e.g., Facebook comments) without retraining priors; measure degradation in personality consistency and emotional realism.

3. **Real-World Phenomenon Replication**: Attempt to replicate documented social media phenomena (e.g., information cascades, echo chambers) from peer-reviewed studies; compare PRISM-generated statistics against empirical data.
