# Physiological-model-based neural network for modeling the metabolic-heart rate relationship during physical activities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.10144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10144
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PMB-NN achieves R²=0.88, RMSE=9.96 bpm for heart rate estimation during physical activities

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Physiological-Model-Based Neural Network (PMB-NN) framework that combines a simplified cardiovascular physiological model with a fully connected neural network to estimate heart rate from oxygen uptake measurements during physical activities. The framework integrates data-driven learning with physiological constraints by embedding a differential equation model of cardiovascular dynamics into the training process, allowing simultaneous optimization of both neural network weights and physiological parameters. Trained on data from 25 participants performing resting, cycling, and running activities, PMB-NN demonstrates performance comparable to pure data-driven models while ensuring physiological plausibility and enabling personalized parameter identification.

## Method Summary
PMB-NN integrates a simplified cardiovascular physiological model with a fully connected neural network through a hybrid training approach. The framework takes oxygen uptake (VO₂) as input and estimates heart rate (HR) while enforcing physiological constraints via a custom loss function combining data fidelity and differential equation residuals. The model simultaneously learns neural network weights and physiological parameters (λ₁-λ₆) through backpropagation, creating personalized cardiovascular models for each individual. Training uses RMSprop optimization with a specific loss weighting scheme (10⁵ for physics loss) to balance fitting accuracy with physiological plausibility.

## Key Results
- Achieved median R² score of 0.88 and RMSE of 9.96 bpm on validation data
- Performance matched benchmark fully connected neural network while significantly outperforming traditional physiological model
- Demonstrated superior physiological plausibility with smooth, monotonic VO₂-HR coupling versus zig-zag artifacts in pure data-driven models
- Successfully identified personalized physiological parameters without boundary effects
- Showed robustness to input uncertainty with RMSE remaining under 15 bpm under realistic noise conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Physics-Informed Regularization
The framework improves generalization by penalizing predictions that violate cardiovascular conservation laws. The total loss combines data fidelity ($L_{data}$) with differential equation residual ($L_{DE}$), weighted at 10⁵ to ensure predictions follow physiological manifolds rather than arbitrary data patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Parameter Identification
The model treats physiological parameters as trainable variables alongside neural network weights, allowing individualization of the cardiovascular response. This resolves the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy by learning personalized digital twins of each subject's physiology.

### Mechanism 3: Monotonicity Enforcement via ODE Structure
The differential equation links heart rate derivatives to VO₂ through specific kinetic relationships, ensuring smooth, monotonic responses consistent with aerobic metabolism. This structure filters out high-frequency noise and artifacts while maintaining physiological plausibility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Understanding the balance between data loss and physics loss is the core innovation. Quick check: If physics loss weight is too high, what happens to fitting noisy data?
- **Cardiovascular Hemodynamics (CO, SV, TPR)**: The model relies on $CO = HR \times SV$ and $MAP = CO \times TPR$. Quick check: If TPR decreases during exercise, how must HR respond to maintain blood pressure?
- **Digital Twins**: The framework creates personalized physiological models. Quick check: How does the model distinguish sensor noise from pathological anomalies when comparing estimated vs. measured HR?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VO₂ (input) -> FCNN backbone (2 hidden layers, 64 units each, Tanh activation) -> Heart Rate prediction -> Physics loss constraint (6 trainable λ parameters) -> Total loss optimization
- **Critical path**: 1) Forward pass VO₂ through FCNN to get HR_pred, 2) Calculate $L_{data}$ (MSE between HR_pred and HR_measured), 3) Calculate $L_{DE}$ (Residual of ODE 6 using HR_pred, VO₂, and current λ values), 4) Backpropagate Total Loss ($L_{data} + 10^5 L_{DE}$) to update both FCNN weights and λ parameters
- **Design tradeoffs**: Increasing $L_{DE}$ weight ensures physiological plausibility but may increase RMSE if subject deviates from model; aggressive learning rates might destabilize λ parameter identification
- **Failure signatures**: Boundary clustering (λ values hitting min/max limits), zig-zag artifacts (under-weighted $L_{DE}$), convergence failure (high RMSE with perfect monotonicity)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train FCNN without $L_{DE}$ term to reproduce zig-zag artifacts, 2) Inject 20% Gaussian noise into VO₂ input to verify robustness, 3) Extract λ values for high-performing subject and test standalone PM reconstruction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Wearable integration**: How does PMB-NN perform when VO₂ is estimated from accelerometer data rather than directly measured, and what accuracy degradation occurs in the full IMU-to-HR pipeline?
- **Pathological populations**: Can the simplified physiological model assumptions remain valid for populations with cardiovascular diseases or autonomic dysfunction?
- **Population-level priors**: Can population-level latent parameter priors be learned to enable rapid personalization for new users without extensive individual calibration data?
- **Multimodal sensing**: Does embedding additional non-invasive sensing modalities (e.g., continuous blood pressure) improve physiological plausibility and parameter identification accuracy?

## Limitations

- The simplified cardiovascular model may inadequately represent pathological conditions or non-linear reflexes like baroreceptor responses during rapid postural changes
- Validation relied on healthy participants performing controlled laboratory activities, requiring further testing in heterogeneous populations
- Parameter identifiability depends on sufficient input-output variation and may degrade with sparse or highly noisy data

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The hybrid architecture demonstrably improves physiological plausibility over pure data-driven approaches, supported by quantitative metrics (R² = 0.88, RMSE = 9.96 bpm)
- **Medium confidence**: Performance on par with benchmark FCNN while enforcing physiological plausibility suggests successful regularization, but direct comparison to state-of-the-art wearable HR estimators is absent
- **Medium confidence**: Robustness to input noise (RMSE < 15 bpm under realistic conditions) is demonstrated, but sensitivity to hyperparameters requires systematic exploration

## Next Checks

1. Apply PMB-NN to a distinct cohort (e.g., cardiac patients or elderly subjects) to assess generalizability beyond healthy, active adults
2. Benchmark computational latency and memory usage on embedded hardware to validate suitability for continuous, on-device monitoring
3. Systematically vary the $L_{DE}$ weight (e.g., 10⁴ to 10⁶) to quantify the trade-off between physiological plausibility and prediction accuracy across subjects
