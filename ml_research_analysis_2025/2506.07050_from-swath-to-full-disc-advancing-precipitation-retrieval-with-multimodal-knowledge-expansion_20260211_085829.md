# From Swath to Full-Disc: Advancing Precipitation Retrieval with Multimodal Knowledge Expansion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.07050
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07050
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PRE-Net achieves precipitation retrieval performance comparable to IMERG using only infrared data through multimodal knowledge distillation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate full-disc precipitation retrieval by introducing the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task. Current methods face limitations: infrared (IR)-based algorithms are globally available but inaccurate, while passive microwave and radar methods are accurate but limited in spatial coverage. The proposed solution, PRE-Net, employs a two-stage multimodal knowledge expansion pipeline. In the Swath-Distilling stage, a teacher model trained on multimodal data (IR, PMW, PR) transfers knowledge to a student IR-only model using Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc IR knowledge. Experimental results on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate that PRE-Net significantly outperforms leading IR-based products (PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR) and achieves performance comparable to multimodal-based algorithm IMERG, with metrics like RMSE of 0.8714 and CSI of 0.3912.

## Method Summary
PRE-Net tackles the precipitation retrieval expansion problem through a two-stage knowledge distillation framework. The first stage, Swath-Distilling, trains a multimodal teacher model on coincident IR, passive microwave, and precipitation radar data, then transfers this knowledge to an IR-only student model using Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). This stage focuses on improving accuracy within the narrow swath where high-quality reference data exists. The second stage, Full-Disc Adaptation, uses Self-MaskTune to refine the student model's predictions across the entire full-disc IR image by balancing the distilled multimodal knowledge with the student's own full-disc IR understanding. This approach enables accurate precipitation retrieval across the full disc while maintaining the global coverage advantages of IR-based methods.

## Key Results
- PRE-Net achieves RMSE of 0.8714 and CSI of 0.3912, outperforming IR-only methods PERSIANN-CCS and PDIR
- The model demonstrates performance comparable to the multimodal IMERG product while using only infrared data
- Regional generalization experiments show promising results for deployment in Australia's wet season following training on East Asia monsoon data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of PRE-Net stems from its ability to transfer complex precipitation physics learned from high-quality passive microwave and radar data to the more widely available infrared data. By using the teacher-student distillation framework with coordinated masking, the model learns to recognize subtle IR signatures that correlate with precipitation patterns even in regions without direct PMW/PR coverage. The wavelet enhancement component helps preserve important spatial features during the distillation process, while the self-mask tuning stage allows the model to adapt its understanding to the full-disc context rather than just the limited swath areas.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring learned patterns from multimodal data (IR + PMW + PR) to single-modality models - needed because PMW/PR data has limited spatial coverage while IR provides global coverage
- **Coordinated Masking**: Simultaneously masking regions in both teacher and student inputs during training - needed to focus learning on relevant features while preventing overfitting to noise
- **Wavelet Enhancement**: Using wavelet transforms to preserve spatial features during knowledge transfer - needed to maintain important precipitation structure information
- **Self-Mask Tuning**: Dynamically adjusting the model's focus between multimodal knowledge and full-disc IR patterns - needed for effective full-disc adaptation beyond the limited reference swath

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Teacher Model (Multimodal) -> CoMWE Distillation -> Student Model (IR-only) -> Self-MaskTune -> Final PRE-Net

**Critical Path:**
IR data → Teacher model inference → Knowledge distillation via CoMWE → Student training → Full-disc adaptation via Self-MaskTune → Precipitation retrieval

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. coverage: Multimodal methods are more accurate but limited to swath areas; PRE-Net trades some accuracy for full global coverage
- Complexity vs. efficiency: Two-stage training increases development complexity but enables effective knowledge transfer
- False alarms vs. missed detections: Model prioritizes reducing underreporting (lower POD) over false alarms (higher FAR)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-smoothing in regions with complex terrain where IR signatures differ significantly from training data
- Persistent false alarms in cloud-covered areas without actual precipitation
- Degradation in performance during extreme weather events not well-represented in training data

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing CoMWE to quantify its contribution to overall performance
2. Cross-regional validation testing model trained on East Asia on independent Australian precipitation data
3. Temporal validation examining model stability across different seasons and weather patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does PRE-Net perform in global regions with precipitation regimes significantly different from the training data, such as snow-dominated high-latitudes or intense tropical cyclones?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The conclusion explicitly states that the regional generalization results "demonstrate PRE-Net's potential for global deployment," yet the experimental validation is limited to the East Asia monsoon region and the Australia wet season.
- **Why unresolved:** The diversity of precipitation physics (e.g., orographic, convective, stratiform) varies globally; the model's ability to generalize to "global" regimes where IR signatures differ fundamentally from the training set (e.g., snow vs. rain) remains unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation metrics (CSI, RMSE) specifically calculated for diverse global climate zones, particularly high-latitudes and tropical ocean basins, using global ground truth datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent does the model's acceptable increase in False Alarm Rate (FAR) degrade its utility for automated, operational flood warning systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in the analysis of Table 4 that "a slight increase in the FAR metric is acceptable... addressing underreporting is more critical," acknowledging a specific bias in the model's design.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors argue that preventing missed detections (disasters) outweighs false alarms, the quantitative "breaking point" where high false alarms erode user trust or overwhelm response resources in an operational context is not defined.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An operational utility study or cost-loss analysis measuring the impact of the elevated FAR on specific hydrological modeling or disaster response workflows.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the distilled knowledge effectively transfer to other geostationary satellites (e.g., GOES, Meteosat) with different IR spectral characteristics without retraining the teacher model?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The method relies on FY-4A/AGRI IR data inputs. The paper claims "potential for global deployment," but global coverage requires integrating data from multiple geostationary satellites with varying sensor configurations.
- **Why unresolved:** The "Swath-Distilling" stage trains a student model specific to the FY-4A IR spectral bands. It is unclear if the learned "multimodal knowledge" is sensor-invariant or strictly coupled to the FY-4A spectral response.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-sensor evaluation results where a model trained on FY-4A (IR) + GPM (PMW/PR) is tested on GOES-East IR data for the same precipitation events.

## Limitations
- Performance in regions with precipitation regimes significantly different from training data (e.g., snow-dominated high-latitudes) remains unverified
- The acceptable increase in False Alarm Rate may limit utility for operational flood warning systems where false alarms can overwhelm response resources
- Generalization to other geostationary satellites with different IR spectral characteristics has not been demonstrated

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Technical implementation of the two-stage pipeline (Swath-Distilling and Full-Disc Adaptation) is well-described and reproducible

**Medium Confidence:**
- Claims about performance improvements over existing methods are supported by quantitative metrics but require validation across diverse geographical regions and weather conditions

**Low Confidence:**
- The assertion that the model achieves "comparable performance to IMERG" needs broader validation across different precipitation regimes and temporal scales

## Next Checks

1. Test PRE-Net's performance on independent datasets from different satellite missions and geographical regions, particularly focusing on areas with complex topography and extreme precipitation events.

2. Conduct a detailed ablation study isolating the contributions of Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement to identify potential overfitting or domain-specific biases.

3. Evaluate the model's temporal stability and performance across different seasons and climate zones to assess its robustness for operational deployment.
