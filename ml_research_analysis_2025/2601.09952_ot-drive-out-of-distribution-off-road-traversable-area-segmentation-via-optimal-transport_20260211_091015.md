## Executive Summary
OT-Drive addresses reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured off-road environments where existing data-driven methods fail under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem, introducing a Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) that disentangles scene information into weather, time-of-day, and road type attributes to construct generalizable semantic anchors. An Optimal Transport-based Fusion (OT Fusion) module then aligns multi-modal features onto the manifold defined by these anchors, achieving distribution-level fusion that is robust to OOD conditions.

## Method Summary
OT-Drive introduces a Scene Anchor Generator that factorizes scene distributions into weather, time-of-day, and road type attributes using vision-language models, then constructs domain-invariant semantic anchors. The Optimal Transport-based Fusion module treats RGB and surface normal feature distributions as empirical measures and solves an entropy-regularized transport problem to find optimal couplings between modalities. The fused features are projected via barycentric mapping and decoded for traversable area segmentation. The framework achieves OOD generalization by aligning features to scene anchors rather than to fixed distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%
- Achieves 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%
- Demonstrates strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, enhancing practicality for real-world deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Compositional Generalization via Marginal Probability Factorization
Factorizing scene distributions into independent marginal probabilities (weather × time-of-day × road type) enables generalization to unseen attribute combinations. Rather than modeling P(S) holistically, the Scene Anchor Generator computes P(W|I), P(D|I), P(R|I) separately using VLM-based classifiers, then combines them via tensor product. This allows recombination of learned factors into novel configurations absent from training data.

### Mechanism 2: Distribution-Level Alignment via Optimal Transport
Treating multi-modal fusion as an optimal transport problem achieves more robust OOD alignment than pixel-level or token-level correspondence. RGB and surface normal feature maps are treated as empirical distributions (μ_I, μ_N). OT Fusion solves entropy-regularized transport problems to find optimal couplings π* that minimize global transportation cost to scene anchor targets, then projects via barycentric mapping.

### Mechanism 3: Domain-Invariant Semantic Anchors from Language Priors
Vision-language model text embeddings provide domain-invariant semantic anchors that remain stable across visual domain shifts. Static Scene Prototypes (SP) are pre-computed by enumerating all attribute combinations via frozen text encoder E_T. At inference, cached prototypes are weighted by posterior probabilities—no text encoder needed during deployment.

## Foundational Learning

- **Optimal Transport & Sinkhorn Algorithm**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical framework for OT Fusion; understanding entropy-regularized OT is essential to modify cost functions or regularization
  - Quick check question: Given source distribution μ ∈ ℝⁿ and target ν ∈ ℝᵐ, can you explain why Sinkhorn iterations produce a doubly stochastic transport plan?

- **Vision-Language Model Alignment (CLIP-style)**
  - Why needed here: SAG relies on image-text contrastive learning; modifying attribute classifiers requires understanding [CLS] token and temperature scaling
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use ⟨CLS_img, T_ai⟩/τ with learnable τ rather than fixed temperature?

- **Manifold Hypothesis & Distribution Alignment**
  - Why needed here: Justifies why distribution-level OT outperforms point-wise alignment; informs decisions about feature space design
  - Quick check question: What would break if RGB and surface normal features already shared a common embedding space before OT?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  RGB Image ──> Pixel Encoder ──> F_I
  [CLS] ──> SAG ──> Scene Anchor (T_S)
  Surface Normal (D2NT estimated) ──> Pixel Encoder ──> F_N
  OT Fusion (π*_I, π*_N) ──> Fused Features ──> Mask Decoder ──> Segmentation

- **Critical path:** RGB → [CLS] token → SAG probability estimation → Scene Anchor synthesis → OT Fusion coupling → Barycentric projection → Decoder query initialization. Surface normal path is parallel but depends on accurate D2NT estimation.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Closed-set vs. open-set scene space: Predefined attribute space ensures efficiency but cannot handle novel attributes. Future work suggests MLLM integration.
  - Frozen vs. fine-tuned text encoder: Frozen enables inference caching (25.6% speedup) but may limit domain-specific semantic adaptation.
  - Max pooling for target distribution: Eq. (9) uses max(P_I, P_N) for robustness, but may discard complementary uncertain predictions.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - SAG misclassification: Wrong scene anchor construction → systematic bias in fusion targets
  - Surface normal estimation errors: D2NT failures propagate into F_N, corrupting OT coupling
  - OOD beyond attribute space: Novel scene types not in W×D×R enumeration → anchors poorly matched

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation: SAG attribute importance** — Remove one attribute at a time to measure marginal contribution to OOD generalization; validate factorization assumption
  2. **OT regularization sensitivity** — Sweep ε ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0} and measure mIoU on known vs. unknown scenes; identify stability region
  3. **Cross-dataset sanity check** — Train on ORFD, test on ORAD-3D with surface normal estimated by alternative methods to isolate sensor-to-alignment robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) be integrated into the OT-Drive framework to handle open-world scene attributes beyond the current closed-set definitions? The current Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) relies on a fixed set of attributes (weather, time, road) for efficiency; MLLMs introduce substantial computational overhead that may violate the real-time constraints (21 FPS) critical for autonomous driving.

### Open Question 2
Does the factorization of scene distributions into weather, time-of-day, and road type fail to generalize when distribution shifts are driven by unmodeled factors? The Scene Anchor Generator explicitly models only three specific attributes based on dataset annotations, assuming these factors fully characterize the domain shift. If an OOD scenario is caused by factors orthogonal to these three (e.g., seasonal vegetation changes), the SAG may construct insufficient or misleading semantic anchors.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the Optimal Transport fusion mechanism to systematic errors in the upstream surface normal estimation (D2NT)? The method relies on pre-computed surface normal maps as a source distribution, treating them as ground truth input rather than modeling the uncertainty or failure modes of the estimator. If the normal map provides geometrically plausible but semantically incorrect features, the "optimal" plan might reinforce errors rather than correct them via RGB fusion.

## Limitations
- Closed-set attribute space limits scalability to novel terrain types without MLLM integration
- Performance on cross-sensor modalities (e.g., stereo depth instead of LiDAR normals) remains unevaluated
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (entropy regularization ε and temperature τ) not fully characterized

## Confidence

- **High**: mIoU improvements on ORFD OOD (95.16%) and cross-dataset transfer (89.79%) are well-supported by reported experiments
- **Medium**: Compositional generalization via marginal factorization is theoretically sound but depends on conditional independence assumptions not fully validated across diverse real-world conditions
- **Medium**: Distribution-level OT fusion superiority over pixel-level methods is demonstrated, but ablation against alternative alignment strategies (e.g., attention-based) is absent

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation: SAG attribute importance** — Remove one attribute at a time to measure marginal contribution to OOD generalization; validate factorization assumption
2. **OT regularization sensitivity** — Sweep ε and measure mIoU on known vs. unknown scenes; identify stability region
3. **Cross-sensor robustness** — Replace D2NT surface normals with stereo depth estimation and measure performance degradation on ORFD OOD
