# Smart UX-design for Rescue Operations Wearable - A Knowledge Graph Informed Visualization Approach for Information Retrieval in Emergency Situations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13539
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Developed knowledge graph-informed UX design for wearable device to support information retrieval and treatment recommendations during emergency rescue operations

## Executive Summary
The KIRETT project developed a knowledge graph-informed UX design for a wearable device to support information retrieval and treatment recommendations during emergency rescue operations. The approach addresses the challenge of providing health professionals with fast, accurate medical guidance in high-pressure environments. The system combines real-time medical data, AI-driven situation detection, and contextual treatment recommendations to improve first-aid rescue operations.

## Method Summary
The KIRETT project designed a wearable UX system using a Trenz TE0802 (Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC) board with dual ARM cores for separate application logic and display rendering. The system retrieves real-time vitals (SpO2, Pulse, ECG) via Bluetooth and uses a Neo4j knowledge graph based on treatment paths for decision support. An artificial neural network trained on 300,000+ rescue operation records provides probability-based complication predictions. The visualization approach uses pre-generated text-to-image assets to overcome LCD limitations, with inter-processor shared memory communication ensuring smooth real-time performance.

## Key Results
- Successfully designed a wearable UX with large visual components, warning/notification screens, approval screens, navigational overview screens, and patient monitors
- Implemented memory-mapped inter-processor communication to ensure smooth real-time performance on constrained hardware
- Evaluated design with German Red Cross and hospital professionals, demonstrating improved information retrieval in high-stress scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining specialized hardware architecture with intelligent software design. The dual-core processor architecture separates application logic from display rendering, preventing UI freezing during complex operations. The knowledge graph provides structured treatment pathways that can be rapidly traversed, while the pre-rendered text-to-image approach bypasses the limitations of small LCD displays. The ANN situation detection provides probabilistic guidance based on historical rescue operation data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dual-core MPSoC architecture**: Separates application logic from display rendering to prevent UI blocking - needed for real-time responsiveness in emergency situations
- **Knowledge graph traversal**: Uses Neo4j to navigate treatment pathways based on patient vitals and situation detection - needed for contextual medical guidance
- **Text-to-image pre-rendering**: Converts UI text to images at readable sizes to overcome LCD font limitations - needed for clear information display in high-stress environments
- **Memory-mapped inter-processor communication**: Uses shared memory with validity bits for dynamic variable exchange between cores - needed for synchronized real-time updates

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: A53 (Application Logic) -> Neo4j Database -> Situation Detection ANN -> Shared Memory -> R5 (Display Rendering) -> LCD

**Critical Path**: Real-time vitals input → Situation detection → Knowledge graph query → Pre-rendered image selection → Display update

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational flexibility for real-time reliability by using pre-rendered images instead of dynamic text rendering, and separates processing tasks across two cores to maintain UI responsiveness during complex operations.

**Failure Signatures**: Display glitching or freezing occurs when the A53 processor blocks display tasks; unreadable text results from attempting native font rendering instead of loading pre-generated image assets.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Verify inter-processor communication by writing test values to shared memory addresses and confirming R5 reads them correctly
2. Test Neo4j query performance with sample treatment paths to ensure response times meet real-time requirements
3. Validate text-to-image generation by rendering sample UI elements at different sizes and measuring readability on the 320x240 LCD

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing specific ANN architecture details and performance metrics for situation detection validation
- Knowledge graph schema and Cypher query logic not fully specified
- Limited evaluation methodology with only 7 professionals and no quantitative usability metrics

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core hardware architecture (TE0802 MPSoC with dual-core configuration) and the general UX design principles (large visual components, pre-rendered text-to-image approach) are well-specified and technically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The system's ability to retrieve and display real-time vitals data via Bluetooth is supported by standard practices, though implementation details are sparse.

**Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of the knowledge graph-informed treatment recommendations and ANN-powered situation detection cannot be independently verified due to missing technical specifications and performance metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Request and implement the complete ANN architecture specifications and evaluation metrics for the situation detection system to assess its predictive accuracy and clinical utility.
2. Obtain the knowledge graph schema documentation and Cypher query examples to validate the treatment path traversal logic and recommendation generation.
3. Conduct quantitative usability testing with rescue personnel using standardized metrics (e.g., NASA-TLX) to measure cognitive load and task completion times compared to existing solutions.
