# PIANO: Physics-informed Dual Neural Operator for Precipitation Nowcasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.01062
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01062
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** PIANO achieves CSI of 0.763 for moderate precipitation at 6-hour lead time, outperforming baseline models

## Executive Summary
PIANO introduces a novel dual neural operator framework for satellite-based precipitation nowcasting that explicitly incorporates physics constraints through the advection-diffusion equation. The method decouples temporal forecasting from physical dynamics inference using two neural operators: T-NO (Time-stepping) learns data-driven spatio-temporal patterns, while V-NO (Velocity-extraction) infers the underlying velocity field responsible for precipitation evolution. By combining data-driven and physics-informed losses, PIANO demonstrates significant improvements in moderate precipitation prediction (4mm/h) and short-term heavy precipitation (8mm/h) compared to baseline models NPM and PhyDNet. The model shows strong generalization across seasons with low variability in predictions, though it struggles with heavy precipitation at longer lead times.

## Method Summary
PIANO uses two neural operators trained jointly: T-NO processes multi-channel satellite imagery (IR 10.5µm, WV 6.3µm, WV 7.3µm) and DEM to predict future satellite images, while V-NO extracts the velocity field from these predictions. The model is trained using a combination of standard MSE loss (L_data) and physics-informed PDE loss (L_PDE) that enforces the advection-diffusion equation. A critical hyperparameter α=1.0 balances these losses optimally. The framework processes 8-frame sequences of 768×768 patches, with outputs converted from satellite to radar images using a separate Pix2Pix ResNet. Training uses Sat2RDR data from 2020-2024, excluding September-December due to missing 0600hr data, with 2020-2022 for training, 2023 for validation, and 2024 for testing.

## Key Results
- PIANO achieves CSI of 0.763 for moderate precipitation (4mm/h) at 6-hour lead time
- Outperforms baseline models (NPM, PhyDNet) across most lead times for moderate precipitation
- Shows low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating strong generalization
- Struggles with heavy precipitation (8mm/h) at longer lead times (7-8 hours) compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual Operator Decoupling for Physics and Dynamics
Separating temporal forecasting from physical dynamics inference allows explicit physics constraints without sacrificing the model's ability to learn complex data patterns. PIANO uses two distinct neural operators: T-NO learns data-driven spatio-temporal patterns to advance the state, while V-NO infers the underlying velocity field. This decoupling allows the PINN loss, which enforces the advection-diffusion equation, to be applied primarily through V-NO, preventing it from overly constraining T-NO's expressiveness.

### Mechanism 2: Physics-Informed Loss as a Training Regularizer
Enforcing the advection-diffusion equation via a physics-informed loss during training improves forecast accuracy, particularly for longer lead times. The total loss function combines standard MSE loss with a PDE loss that penalizes predictions violating the governing equation. Sensitivity analysis shows that well-tuned weighting factor α=1.0 improves performance at longer lead times compared to pure data-driven models.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Channel Satellite Input for State Representation
Using multiple spectral bands from satellite imagery (infrared, water vapor) alongside topographic data provides a richer state representation for predicting precipitation-related dynamics. The multi-modal input captures temperature, moisture, and terrain information, which are key drivers of precipitation. Selected satellite channels (IR 10.5 µm, WV 6.3 µm, WV 7.3 µm) and DEM contain sufficient information to proxy the state variables relevant to the advection-diffusion of precipitation systems.

## Foundational Learning

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Understanding how a loss function can be constructed from a partial differential equation (PDE) like the advection-diffusion equation is essential for grasping the L_PDE term in PIANO's training. Quick check: How is the advection-diffusion equation used to calculate a loss value from the model's output?

- **Neural Operators**: PIANO is built on neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces rather than just vectors. Understanding this is key to grasping how the model processes entire spatio-temporal fields. Quick check: What is the fundamental difference between a standard neural network and a neural operator in terms of their inputs and outputs?

- **Satellite Meteorology (IR and Water Vapor channels)**: The model's input uses specific spectral bands (10.5, 6.3, 7.3 µm). Basic understanding of what these bands represent (cloud-top temperature, atmospheric moisture) provides context for the model's state representation. Quick check: What does the infrared (IR) channel typically represent in satellite imagery for weather forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:** T-NO (Time-stepping Neural Operator) -> V-NO (Velocity-extraction Neural Operator) -> PINN Loss Module -> Pix2Pix ResNet
- **Critical Path:** Multi-channel satellite imagery and DEM fed into T-NO, which outputs forecast sequence of satellite images. This forecast sequence fed into V-NO, which outputs estimated physical fields (v, D, R). Both outputs used by PINN Loss Module to compute L_PDE. Final loss L_total = L_data + α*L_PDE trains combined system. Trained T-NO output translated to radar image by Pix2Pix ResNet.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Physics constraint strength (α) is critical—too low lacks physical consistency, too high over-constrains. Decoupled operators allow modular development and explicit physics enforcement but require complex two-stage training. Advection-diffusion approximation simplifies real atmospheric dynamics, improving generalization but potentially limiting accuracy.
- **Failure Signatures:** Performance collapse at long lead times suggests issues with V-NO's ability to learn meaningful velocity field. High seasonal variability indicates overfitting to training data. Poor heavy precipitation performance suggests advection-diffusion model may be insufficient for capturing intense dynamics.
- **First 3 Experiments:** 1) Baseline ablation: Train PIANO with α=0 (data-only), α=1.0 (recommended), α=5.0 (strong physics). Compare CSI scores at 4mm/h and 8mm/h across lead times. 2) Operator isolation test: Train T-NO and V-NO separately, then jointly. 3) Visual inspection of V-NO outputs: Visualize velocity field learned by V-NO and check alignment with known meteorological patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the physics-informed loss weight (α) be optimized to balance short-term accuracy against long-term physical consistency? The conclusion calls for "further optimization of model hyperparameters," while Table 2 demonstrates that performance varies significantly with different fixed values of α. The current static approach forces a trade-off; setting α to optimize 8-hour predictions degrades 1-hour accuracy compared to lower values.

### Open Question 2
Can the PIANO architecture be modified to improve accuracy for heavy precipitation events (>8mm/h) at longer lead times? Table 1 shows that while PIANO excels at moderate rainfall, it underperforms compared to PhyDNet for 8mm events at 7h and 8h lead times. The current physics constraints (advection-diffusion) may struggle to capture the complex convective dynamics required for predicting heavy rainfall over extended periods.

### Open Question 3
Is the reported high performance robust against sampling bias, or is it an artifact of the specific seasonal sub-sampling used? The authors note that "CSI values... are incredibly larger than those reported... [possibly] due to the differently sampled data" and the exclusion of Sept–Dec data. The "season-aware sampling" and exclusion of winter months may have simplified the prediction task relative to baseline evaluations, inflating the metrics.

## Limitations
- Lack of specification for exact neural operator architectures makes exact reproduction difficult
- Performance at 8mm/h heavy precipitation thresholds is notably worse than baseline models at longer lead times
- Requires complex two-stage training with carefully tuned physics loss weighting (α=1.0), indicating sensitivity to hyperparameter selection

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of decoupling temporal forecasting from physics inference through dual neural operators is well-supported by experimental results, particularly the sensitivity analysis showing α=1.0 outperforms pure data-driven approaches at longer lead times.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of improved moderate precipitation nowcasting (4mm/h) is well-supported by CSI metrics, but the assertion that physics constraints universally improve performance is qualified by the fact that physics constraints degrade performance at 8mm/h heavy precipitation events.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalization claims across seasons are based on internal metrics without external validation on independent datasets or geographic regions, making it difficult to assess true model robustness.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Ablation Study:** Systematically test alternative neural operator architectures (FNO, DeepONet, U-Net variants) for both V-NO and T-NO to determine sensitivity of performance to architectural choices, as the current paper does not specify exact implementations.

2. **Cross-Geographic Transfer:** Evaluate PIANO on satellite precipitation data from a different geographic region (e.g., North America or Europe) to test claimed generalization capabilities beyond the South Korean dataset, as regional atmospheric dynamics may not be well-captured by the advection-diffusion equation.

3. **Heavy Precipitation Dynamics Analysis:** Conduct detailed case studies of failed predictions at 8mm/h thresholds to identify whether limitations stem from physics model's inability to capture convective processes, insufficient temporal resolution, or other factors, and test whether incorporating additional physics (e.g., moist thermodynamics) improves heavy precipitation forecasting.
