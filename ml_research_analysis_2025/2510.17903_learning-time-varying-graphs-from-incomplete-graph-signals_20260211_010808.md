# Learning Time-Varying Graphs from Incomplete Graph Signals

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.17903
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17903
- **Authors**: Chuansen Peng; Xiaojing Shen
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Joint inference of time-varying networks and missing signal recovery via unified non-convex optimization with ADMM

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the dual challenge of inferring dynamic network topologies and recovering missing graph signals from partially observed data. The authors propose a unified non-convex optimization framework that integrates graph learning and signal recovery into a single joint problem, enabling bidirectional information flow between graph and signal domains. By introducing a fused-lasso type regularizer, the method captures realistic network dynamics through temporal smoothness in the sequence of graph Laplacians, making it particularly suitable for time-varying network analysis.

The proposed approach employs an efficient ADMM algorithm with closed-form solutions for both subproblems, ensuring scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. Despite the inherent non-convexity, the authors establish theoretical convergence guarantees and derive non-asymptotic statistical error bounds. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both convergence speed and joint accuracy of graph learning and signal recovery, especially in high missing-data regimes.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a unified non-convex optimization framework that simultaneously learns time-varying network topologies and recovers missing graph signals. The method integrates graph learning and signal recovery into a single joint problem, using a fused-lasso type regularizer to enforce temporal smoothness in the sequence of graph Laplacians. An efficient ADMM algorithm is developed with closed-form solutions for both subproblems, ensuring scalability. The approach handles the non-convexity through theoretical convergence guarantees and derives non-asymptotic statistical error bounds. The framework allows bidirectional information flow between graph and signal domains, making it particularly effective for dynamic network analysis under incomplete observations.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in convergence speed and joint accuracy
- Effective performance maintained in high missing-data regimes
- Scalable to large-scale networks and long time horizons through closed-form ADMM updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by unifying graph learning and signal recovery into a single joint optimization problem, allowing information to flow bidirectionally between the two domains. The fused-lasso type regularizer enforces temporal smoothness in the evolution of graph Laplacians, capturing realistic network dynamics. The non-convex optimization framework, despite its complexity, achieves convergence through the ADMM algorithm with closed-form solutions. This integration is particularly powerful because graph structure informs signal recovery while observed signals guide graph learning, creating a synergistic effect that improves performance in both tasks simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
**Graph Signal Processing**: Understanding signals defined on graph structures and their spectral properties - needed to formulate the joint optimization problem; quick check: can represent signals in graph Fourier domain
**Time-Varying Network Analysis**: Methods for tracking dynamic network structures over time - needed to model temporal evolution of graphs; quick check: can model smooth transitions between consecutive graph snapshots
**Non-Convex Optimization**: Techniques for solving optimization problems with non-convex objectives - needed for the unified framework; quick check: can handle local minima through proper initialization
**ADMM Algorithm**: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for distributed optimization - needed for scalable solution; quick check: can decompose complex problems into tractable subproblems
**Regularization Techniques**: Methods like fused-lasso for promoting structural properties - needed to enforce temporal smoothness; quick check: can control the degree of smoothness through regularization parameter

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Observed signals -> Signal Recovery Subproblem -> Intermediate estimates -> Graph Learning Subproblem -> Graph Laplacians -> Regularization -> Updated estimates (iterative loop)
**Critical Path**: Missing signal imputation depends on learned graph topology, which in turn depends on signal estimates - creates feedback loop optimized through ADMM
**Design Tradeoffs**: Non-convexity enables better modeling of complex relationships but requires careful initialization; unified framework increases computational complexity but improves accuracy through information sharing
**Failure Signatures**: Poor initialization may lead to local minima; excessive regularization can oversmooth temporal dynamics; missing data ratio beyond certain threshold may degrade both tasks
**First Experiments**: 1) Test on synthetic data with known ground truth for both graph and signals; 2) Vary missing data ratio from 10% to 90% to assess robustness; 3) Compare convergence speed against baseline methods on identical problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Fused-lasso regularizer assumes temporal smoothness, which may not hold for networks with abrupt structural changes
- Non-convex optimization may converge to local minima depending on initialization and parameter settings
- Performance in extremely high missing-data regimes (>90% missing) requires further validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical convergence guarantees and closed-form ADMM updates
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical performance claims based on synthetic experiments, though real-world validation is limited
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability claims for large-scale networks, pending independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on real-world dynamic networks with ground truth topologies to validate performance claims beyond synthetic data
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis across a wider range of missing-data ratios (up to 95%) and network sparsity levels to assess robustness
3. Compare against additional state-of-the-art baselines that employ different optimization strategies (e.g., spectral methods, deep learning approaches) to establish relative performance gains
