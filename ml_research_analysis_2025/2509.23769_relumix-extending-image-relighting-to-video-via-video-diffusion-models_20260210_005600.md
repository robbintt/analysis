  image relighting techniques to video sequences by leveraging video diffusion models.
  The method decouples the relighting process into two stages: first, an artist relights

# ReLumix: Extending Image Relighting to Video via Video Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23769
- Authors: Lezhong Wang; Shutong Jin; Ruiqi Cui; Anders Bjorholm Dahl; Jeppe Revall Frisvad; Siavash Bigdeli
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: 9× faster than I2VEdit and 6× faster than Light-A-Video while achieving state-of-the-art temporal consistency and visual fidelity

## Executive Summary
ReLumix extends image relighting to video sequences by leveraging a fine-tuned stable video diffusion model. The framework propagates illumination changes from a single artist-relit reference frame throughout an entire video sequence, achieving both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Trained exclusively on synthetic data, the method demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world videos while significantly outperforming existing approaches in speed and quality metrics.

## Method Summary
ReLumix fine-tunes a 14-frame stable video diffusion model to propagate relighting from a single reference frame across video sequences. The method combines three key components: frame replacement where the relit reference replaces the first input frame, embedding fusion that concatenates the reference with noised input at the embedding level, and gated cross-attention that modulates lighting application spatially. The framework is trained on a synthetic CARLA dataset with 75 scenes × 10 lighting conditions and demonstrates robust sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieves SSIM 0.747, PSNR 22.308, and LPIPS 0.143 on CARLA test set
- 9× speed-up over I2VEdit and 6× speed-up over Light-A-Video
- Strong zero-shot generalization to real-world videos including DAVIS, VIDIT, and FMV datasets
- Demonstrates robust sim-to-real transfer with complex lighting variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frame replacement anchors temporal propagation by exploiting autoregressive generation dynamics in video diffusion models.
- Mechanism: The relit reference frame R physically replaces the first frame of V_input (Eq. 1). In SVD's autoregressive generation, the first frame establishes a "powerful prior that influences the synthesis of all subsequent frames" (Sec. 3.2), propagating illumination intent forward while preserving motion dynamics.
- Core assumption: SVD's pre-trained motion priors are sufficiently robust to maintain temporal coherence when only the first frame is modified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "temporal bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors"
  - [section 3.2] "This technique treats the reference frame as a strong initial boundary condition"
  - [corpus] RelightVid (arXiv:2501.16330) similarly addresses temporal-consistent video relighting but uses different conditioning strategies
- Break condition: Significant camera motion or parallax introduces content not present in the reference frame, causing lighting inconsistency (Fig. 7, Sec. 6).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gated cross-attention enables content-aware lighting modulation without explicit segmentation masks.
- Mechanism: A dynamic gate G_dyn is computed from query features via a small neural network, then combined with learnable static gate α. The gate scales cross-attention output O_attn, allowing the model to "learn an implicit mask for applying the relighting effect" (Alg. 1, Sec. 3.4).
- Core assumption: Query features encode sufficient semantic information to determine spatially-varying lighting response (e.g., diffuse vs. specular surfaces).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending"
  - [Table 3] Adding GC to baseline FR yields statistically significant PSNR improvement (p < 1.46×10⁻⁷)
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific gating mechanism in video relighting
- Break condition: Scenes with highly complex material interactions may exceed the model's capacity to learn appropriate gating implicitly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Early embedding fusion preserves fine-grained lighting characteristics throughout the denoising process.
- Mechanism: The reference frame R is replicated across time to create R̃, concatenated with V_noisy along channels, then processed by encoder E (Eq. 2). This forces initial layers to recognize both scene content and target illumination "as a strong conditioning signal" (Sec. 3.3).
- Core assumption: Channel-wise concatenation at the embedding level preserves sufficient lighting detail (color palette, shadow softness, texture) without information bottleneck.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the sequence"
  - [Table 1] Full model (FR&GC&EF) achieves SSIM 0.747 vs. FR&GC alone at 0.501
  - [Table 3] Adding EF to FR alone improves LPIPS significantly (p = 0.034)
- Break condition: Long video sequences may cause feature drift if the conditioning signal weakens over temporal distance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) architecture**
  - Why needed here: ReLumix fine-tunes SVD's 14-frame VideoUNet; understanding its temporal attention, channel configuration (12 input, 4 output), and autoregressive generation is prerequisite to modifying it.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how SVD's temporal modules ensure frame-to-frame consistency?

- Concept: **Cross-attention conditioning in diffusion models**
  - Why needed here: The gated cross-attention module replaces standard cross-attention; understanding Q/K/V attention and conditioning contexts is essential before implementing the gating mechanism.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention inject conditioning information into the denoising U-Net?

- Concept: **Synthetic-to-real transfer in vision tasks**
  - Why needed here: ReLumix trains exclusively on CARLA synthetic data but generalizes to real-world videos; understanding domain gap challenges helps interpret the sim-to-real claim critically.
  - Quick check question: What properties of synthetic training data typically enable or hinder real-world generalization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Artist relights reference frame R → Frame replacement (V'_input = [R, V_input[1:T]]) → Embedding fusion (concat R̃ with V_noisy) → Denoising UNet with gated cross-attention → Output relit video

- Critical path:
  1. Artist relights reference frame R using arbitrary image relighting method (IC-Light, physics-based renderer, etc.)
  2. R replaces first frame → V'_input
  3. R̃ (replicated R) concatenated with V_noisy → encoder E → fused embedding E_f
  4. Denoising UNet with gated cross-attention attends to context C
  5. Dynamic gate G_dyn modulates attention output per-location
  6. Output: temporally coherent relit video

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Full fine-tuning vs. LoRA**: Authors chose full weight unfreezing (except embedders) because "video relighting task is very different from the original SVD task" (Sec. 3.5)—higher compute but better adaptation
  - **Synthetic-only training**: Avoids expensive real-world annotation but limits generalization to lighting conditions absent from CARLA
  - **Mask-free design**: Eliminates segmentation dependency but may struggle with identity preservation in complex scenes

- Failure signatures:
  - **Significant camera motion**: New scene content lacks correspondence in reference frame → lighting inconsistency (Fig. 7)
  - **Dynamic light sources**: Moving lights (spotlights, vehicle headlights) not handled (Sec. 6)
  - **Identity drift**: If GC gate fails to learn appropriate modulation, object appearance may change

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation baseline**: Train with frame replacement (FR) only on CARLA test split—expect SSIM ~0.52, PSNR ~14.0 (Table 1)
  2. **Component validation**: Add GC and EF incrementally—verify statistical significance of improvements using paired tests (Table 3 methodology)
  3. **Real-world generalization**: Apply to DAVIS videos using IC-Light relit references—measure temporal stability (Temporal LPIPS, Flow Consistency) against baselines (Table 2)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to temporally propagate illumination for dynamic light sources, such as moving spotlights or vehicle headlights?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state in the Limitations section that the framework "is not yet equipped to handle dynamic light sources within the scene."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture is designed to propagate a static illumination style extracted from a single reference frame throughout the entire sequence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified architecture capable of accepting time-varying lighting conditions or a sequence of relit reference frames, evaluated on benchmarks with moving light sources.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the single-reference frame bottleneck be overcome to maintain lighting consistency during significant camera parallax or large transformations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that relying on a single static reference frame creates an information bottleneck when "new scene content is revealed" during large camera motion.
- Why unresolved: The model currently relies on Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) motion priors to hallucinate lighting for unseen regions, which lacks the physical accuracy of the reference-guided areas.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of single-frame vs. multi-frame reference inputs on scenes with extreme parallax, measuring texture and lighting fidelity in newly revealed areas.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the fidelity of video propagation degrade non-linearly when using reference frames generated by noisy or non-physical image relighting methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model is trained on clean synthetic data (CARLA) but claims to support "any" image relighting technique, including potentially unstable generative methods.
- Why unresolved: The robustness of the Gated Cross-Attention mechanism to high-frequency artifacts or domain shifts in the input reference frame is not quantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study measuring output video quality (e.g., FVD, temporal consistency) while systematically varying the noise levels and artifact intensity of the input reference frame.

## Limitations

- Sim-to-real generalization is primarily demonstrated on curated datasets with controlled conditions, with untested performance on highly dynamic real-world scenes
- Framework creates brittleness when encountering significant camera motion or parallax due to reliance on single reference frame
- Computational efficiency claims don't account for artist intervention overhead or substantial GPU resources required for fine-tuning

## Confidence

- **Temporal coherence via frame replacement**: High - well-supported by architecture and ablation results
- **Gated cross-attention effectiveness**: Medium - statistically significant improvements but underspecified implementation details
- **Sim-to-real generalization capability**: Medium - qualitative results suggest generalization but synthetic training data limits breadth of applicability

## Next Checks

1. **Dynamic lighting robustness test**: Evaluate ReLumix on videos containing moving light sources (spotlights, vehicle headlights, flickering lights) to validate the limitation claim that "moving light sources are not handled."

2. **Cross-dataset generalization study**: Test the model's performance when trained on CARLA but evaluated on real-world videos with significantly different characteristics (urban vs. natural scenes, different camera motions) to quantify the sim-to-real transfer limits.

3. **Long-sequence stability analysis**: Apply ReLumix to extended video sequences (>100 frames) to assess whether the embedding fusion conditioning signal maintains effectiveness over longer temporal distances, measuring feature drift and lighting consistency decay.
