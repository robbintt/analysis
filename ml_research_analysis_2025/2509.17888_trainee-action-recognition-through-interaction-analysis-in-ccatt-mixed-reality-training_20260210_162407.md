# Trainee Action Recognition through Interaction Analysis in CCATT Mixed-Reality Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17888
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17888
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Fine-tuned HOI model achieves 94.7% F1 for IV equipment detection vs. 52.0% pretrained

## Executive Summary
This study develops a vision-based pipeline for detecting trainee-equipment interactions in Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) mixed-reality training simulations. The approach fine-tunes a Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN) model on 20,000 labeled images from 20 simulation sessions to identify human-object interaction triplets under challenging conditions including occlusion and lighting variation. Performance metrics extracted from detected interactions are mapped to a hierarchical Cognitive Task Analysis model to provide interpretable assessment of trainee situational awareness and decision-making. The system demonstrates substantial improvement over pretrained models across three key medical devices, enabling automated extraction of reaction time and interaction duration metrics for performance evaluation.

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage fine-tuning approach on a Cascade Disentangling Network pretrained on HICO-DET. First, the full CDN architecture (ResNet-50 encoder + transformer + decoders) is trained end-to-end on CCATT-specific data. Second, the visual encoder is frozen and only the Human-Object Pair Decoder and Interaction Decoder are fine-tuned to specialize verb classification. Interaction detections undergo temporal Gaussian smoothing followed by threshold-based segmentation to produce stable interaction intervals. These intervals are mapped to performance metrics through a five-level hierarchical Cognitive Task Analysis model, enabling automated extraction of metrics like reaction time and interaction duration from raw video observations.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned model achieves 94.7% F1 for IV equipment, 84.4% F1 for mechanical ventilator, and 82.5% F1 for ProPaq monitor
- Temporal overlap ratio improves from 0% (pretrained) to 98.02% for IV equipment after fine-tuning
- Domain-specific metrics (overlap ratio, false interaction count) demonstrate superiority over frame-level F1 alone
- Automated performance metrics (reaction time, interaction duration) extracted from interaction detections

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-adaptive fine-tuning of pretrained HOI models substantially improves trainee-equipment interaction detection in specialized medical training environments.
- Mechanism: The two-stage fine-tuning approach first optimizes the full CDN architecture end-to-end to align visual features with CCATT equipment, then freezes the encoder and fine-tunes only the Human-Object Pair Decoder and Interaction Decoder. This decoupling allows spatial localization priors to be preserved while specializing verb classification for the target domain.
- Core assumption: Verb features generalize across domains better than object-specific visual features, enabling semantic mapping from HICO categories to CCATT interactions.
- Evidence anchors: Fine-tuning improved model performance across three key devices: IV equipment (94.7% F1), mechanical ventilator (84.4% F1), and ProPaq monitor (82.5% F1), compared to pretrained model scores of 52.0%, 47.0%, and 47.0% respectively. In the first stage of fine-tuning, we trained the entire CDN model... In the second stage... we conducted partial architecture training.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) models enable automated extraction of interpretable, domain-relevant performance metrics from raw interaction detections.
- Mechanism: The five-level CTA hierarchy decomposes training objectives through cognitive processes to observable actions and finally quantifiable metrics. Detected trainee-equipment interaction timestamps feed directly into metrics like "alarm reaction time" and "interaction duration," which serve as proxies for higher-level cognitive competencies.
- Core assumption: Observable interactions with equipment reliably indicate underlying cognitive states (e.g., faster reaction to alarms indicates better situational awareness).
- Evidence anchors: These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations. Level 5 – Performance Metrics: Maps observable actions to quantifiable indicators.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal smoothing of frame-level HOI predictions produces stable, physically plausible interaction intervals suitable for performance metric extraction.
- Mechanism: Raw HOI confidence scores exhibit sharp frame-to-frame fluctuations. Gaussian kernel smoothing across temporal sequences, followed by threshold-based segmentation, enforces temporal continuity consistent with real-world interaction physics.
- Core assumption: Valid interactions persist over multiple frames; single-frame spikes are noise.
- Evidence anchors: Temporal smoothing and domain-specific evaluation metrics showed fine-tuned models achieved 98.02% overlap for IV equipment versus 0% for the pretrained model. Human-object interaction scores were computed as the product of object detection confidence and verb classification probability, often exhibiting sharp and erratic fluctuations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection**
  - Why needed here: HOI models detect triplets of (human, object, action), essential for understanding what trainees are doing with which equipment—not just that they are present.
  - Quick check question: Given an image of a person near a ventilator, can you explain why an HOI model might predict "no_interaction" even if the person's hand is close to the device?

- **Transfer Learning with Partial Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The paper's success depends on adapting a general HOI model to a specialized domain without training from scratch, requiring understanding of which model components to freeze vs. fine-tune.
  - Quick check question: Why might freezing the visual encoder after an initial end-to-end training phase improve verb classification on a minority class?

- **Temporal Post-Processing for Video Predictions**
  - Why needed here: Frame-level predictions are noisy; understanding how and why to apply temporal smoothing is critical for extracting usable interaction intervals.
  - Quick check question: If your interaction detection model produces confidence scores of [0.2, 0.9, 0.3, 0.85, 0.2] across five frames, what would a simple moving average (window=3) produce, and why might this be problematic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frame extraction -> CDN inference -> HOI triplet scoring -> Temporal smoothing -> Interval segmentation -> Metric computation
- **Critical path**: Frame extraction → CDN inference → HOI triplet scoring → Temporal smoothing → Interval segmentation → Metric computation. The fine-tuned model's performance depends most heavily on the quality of Stage 2 (object localization in crowded scenes) and Stage 3 (verb classification under class imbalance).
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Two-stage vs. single-stage HOI: CDN's cascaded design separates localization from interaction classification, reducing representational conflict but adding complexity.
  - Fine-tuning depth: Full end-to-end training improves object detection but risks overfitting; decoder-only fine-tuning preserves generalization but may underfit new object categories.
  - Temporal smoothing σ: Larger values reduce false positives but may miss brief interactions; smaller values preserve temporal precision but increase noise.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Complete occlusion: Model cannot detect interactions when equipment or trainee is fully blocked from view.
  - Class imbalance bias: Without decoder-focused fine-tuning, model overpredicts "no_interaction" majority class.
  - Domain gap: Pretrained model without fine-tuning produces near-zero overlap ratios despite reasonable verb confidence.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline transfer test: Run pretrained CDN-HICO on a 5-minute CCATT video clip. Compute frame-level F1 and temporal overlap ratio. Expected: poor overlap (<10%) but non-trivial verb confidence for "hold"/"carry" actions.
  2. Ablation on fine-tuning stages: Compare (a) end-to-end only, (b) decoder-only, (c) two-stage sequential fine-tuning on a held-out session. Measure F1 per equipment type and start-time latency. Expected: (c) achieves best balance across metrics.
  3. Temporal smoothing sensitivity: Grid-search σ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0} seconds on validation data with expert temporal annotations. Plot overlap ratio vs. false interaction count. Expected: optimal σ around 1-2 seconds for CCATT interaction durations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can temporal modeling and multi-view integration techniques effectively address complete occlusions where trainee bodies or equipment are entirely out of view?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Although the system is robust to partial occlusions, it does not address complete occlusions where the body or equipment is entirely out of view; future enhancements will target occlusion robustness through temporal modeling and multi-view integration."
- Why unresolved: Current pipeline only handles partial occlusions; complete occlusions result in missed detections with no current mitigation strategy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of model performance on completely occluded segments before and after implementing temporal/multi-view fusion, measuring overlap ratio recovery.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methods can reduce the human annotation burden while maintaining accuracy for complex team dynamics assessment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking."
- Why unresolved: Semi-automated labeling pipeline still requires manual validation; no solution proposed for automating team dynamics assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a self-supervised or weakly-supervised approach achieving comparable F1 scores without expert-annotated training data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can additional CTA metrics (task handover latency, action sequencing, multitasking indicators) be reliably derived from the current HOI detection outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will extend the pipeline to include additional CCATT-relevant metrics defined in the Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) model, such as interaction duration, task handover latency, action sequencing, and multitasking indicators."
- Why unresolved: These metrics are defined in the CTA model but not yet implemented or validated against ground truth.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between automatically extracted metrics and expert-rated team performance assessments across multiple sessions.

## Limitations

- **Data availability**: The study relies on CCATT simulation data that is not publicly accessible, limiting external validation and reproducibility.
- **Generalizability**: While the fine-tuned model achieves high performance on three specific equipment types, the approach has not been tested on other medical devices or different training scenarios.
- **Temporal smoothing assumptions**: The Gaussian kernel approach assumes interactions persist over multiple frames, which may not hold for very brief but critical actions.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental claim that domain-adaptive fine-tuning improves HOI detection in specialized training environments is well-supported by the 52.0%→94.7% F1 improvement for IV equipment. The CTA-based performance metric extraction provides a coherent framework for translating detections into interpretable assessment scores.

**Medium Confidence**: The two-stage fine-tuning strategy's superiority over single-stage approaches is demonstrated through comparison with pretrained models, but ablation studies directly comparing different fine-tuning strategies are not reported. The specific hyperparameter choices (learning rates, epochs, σ values) are referenced but not fully specified.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the system's ability to assess cognitive competencies like situational awareness rely on assumptions about the mapping between observable interactions and internal mental states that are not empirically validated in this work.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing (a) end-to-end only fine-tuning, (b) decoder-only fine-tuning, and (c) two-stage sequential fine-tuning on a held-out validation session to isolate the contribution of each stage.

2. **Temporal Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the Gaussian smoothing parameter σ across a broader range (0.5-5.0 seconds) and measure the trade-off between overlap ratio and false positive rate to identify optimal settings for different interaction durations.

3. **Cross-Device Transferability**: Test the fine-tuned model on a new equipment type not included in the original three (e.g., syringe pump or patient monitor) to evaluate the approach's ability to generalize beyond the training domain.
