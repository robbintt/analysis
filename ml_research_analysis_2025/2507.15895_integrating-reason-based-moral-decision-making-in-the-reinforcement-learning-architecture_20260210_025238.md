- Key outcome: Presents a novel approach to building artificial moral agents (AMAs) by extending reinforcement learning with an ethics module centered around a reasoning unit, enabling agents to infer moral obligations from normative reasons and act in accordance with them.

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents a novel approach to building artificial moral agents (AMAs) based on reason-based moral decision-making, addressing the challenge of developing ethical behavior in autonomous systems. The core idea is to extend reinforcement learning (RL) with an ethics module centered around a reasoning unit, enabling agents to infer moral obligations from normative reasons and act in accordance with them. A prototype Reason-Based Artificial Moral Agent (RBAMA) was implemented and tested in a simulated bridge environment featuring moral dilemmas. The RBAMA successfully learned to recognize and prioritize normative reasons, demonstrating the potential to fulfill key ethical desiderata: moral justifiability, trustworthiness, and robustness. Experiments showed the RBAMA's capability to navigate moral conflicts by prioritizing rescuing drowning persons over avoiding pushing someone off a bridge. Comparative evaluations against multi-objective RL approaches highlighted the RBAMA's principled advantages, including better generalization and explicit control over moral prioritization, while also revealing limitations such as the current inability to incorporate expected outcomes into reasoning. Future work includes refining the framework to address these limitations and expanding test environments.

## Method Summary
The approach extends reinforcement learning with an ethics module containing a reasoning unit that infers moral obligations from normative reasons. The RBAMA architecture integrates this reasoning component with traditional RL components to enable moral decision-making. The system was prototyped and tested in a simulated bridge environment featuring moral dilemmas where agents must balance competing ethical obligations.

## Key Results
- RBAMA successfully learned to recognize and prioritize normative reasons in a simulated bridge environment
- The agent demonstrated ability to resolve moral conflicts by prioritizing rescuing drowning persons over avoiding pushing someone off a bridge
- Comparative evaluation showed RBAMA's advantages in moral justifiability, trustworthiness, and robustness compared to multi-objective RL approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly separating moral reasoning from reward-based learning, allowing agents to apply normative ethical principles independently of task-specific rewards. This separation enables principled moral prioritization through the reasoning unit's ability to weigh different normative reasons against each other, rather than treating ethical considerations as just another reward signal to be optimized alongside task objectives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Normative reasons**: Ethical principles or considerations that create moral obligations (needed because these form the basis for moral decision-making; quick check: verify the agent correctly identifies relevant reasons in given scenarios)
- **Moral prioritization**: The process of weighing competing ethical obligations to determine which should take precedence (needed because real moral dilemmas involve conflicting obligations; quick check: test agent's behavior when multiple reasons apply simultaneously)
- **Reinforcement learning integration**: How ethical reasoning interfaces with traditional RL reward structures (needed because the framework must work within existing RL architectures; quick check: verify learning convergence and performance metrics)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Ethics Module -> Reasoning Unit -> Action Selection -> Environment

**Critical Path**
Normative reasons database → Reasoning unit inference → Moral obligation determination → Action selection → Environment feedback → Learning update

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Explicit reasoning vs. implicit learning: The framework chooses explicit moral reasoning over learning ethics purely from rewards, trading computational overhead for principled decision-making
- Database dependency vs. generalization: Relies on predefined normative reasons rather than learning them from experience, limiting adaptability to novel situations
- Moral justifiability vs. performance: Prioritizes ethically defensible decisions that may not always optimize task performance

**Failure Signatures**
- Inability to handle novel situations without applicable normative reasons
- Over-reliance on database completeness leading to ethical blind spots
- Computational overhead causing delays in time-sensitive decisions
- Rigid prioritization that doesn't account for contextual factors or uncertainty

**Three First Experiments**
1. Test RBAMA's behavior in scenarios where multiple normative reasons conflict with similar weight
2. Evaluate performance when the normative reasons database contains incomplete or contradictory information
3. Measure computational overhead and decision latency compared to baseline RL approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cannot currently incorporate expected outcomes into moral reasoning, limiting real-world applicability
- Simplified bridge scenario doesn't capture complexity of real moral dilemmas involving uncertainty and contextual factors
- Performance heavily dependent on quality and completeness of normative reason database
- Evaluation focuses on "correct" moral choices without measuring computational overhead or robustness to environmental noise

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence Assessment**

*High Confidence:* The core architectural contribution of integrating a reasoning unit with RL is sound and technically feasible. The successful demonstration that the RBAMA can learn to recognize and prioritize normative reasons in controlled scenarios is well-supported by the experimental results.

*Medium Confidence:* The claim that RBAMA better fulfills desiderata of moral justifiability, trustworthiness, and robustness compared to multi-objective RL approaches is plausible but requires more extensive validation. The comparative evaluation shows promising results but is limited to a narrow set of scenarios.

*Low Confidence:* Claims about the framework's ability to generalize to complex, real-world moral dilemmas and handle edge cases remain speculative without further testing in more diverse environments.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the framework's ability to incorporate expected outcomes into moral reasoning, particularly in scenarios where different actions have varying probabilities of success or harm.

2. Evaluate RBAMA's performance in more complex moral environments with multiple simultaneous dilemmas, partial observability, and dynamic changes in the moral landscape over time.

3. Conduct systematic testing of the framework's behavior when encountering novel situations with no directly applicable normative reasons, measuring both fallback behavior and learning capacity for new moral rules.
