# Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22367
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 45% reduction in MSE compared to baseline on AVI 2025 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of inferring latent personality traits from multimodal interview data by introducing a psychology-informed prompt engineering approach combined with a novel Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by personality-specific prompts to extract high-level semantic representations from transcribed speech, then fuses these with audio and visual behavioral cues through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Experiments on the AVI 2025 dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving first place in the Personality Assessment track with significant improvements over baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The framework processes video, audio, and text from interview data through specialized encoders: SigLIP2 for visual features, Emotion2Vec for audio, and Whisper for transcription. A psychology-informed prompt incorporating task description, ASR text, and demographic metadata guides an LLM (SFR-Embedding-Mistral) to generate personality-relevant semantic embeddings. These text features serve as queries in a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns and integrates asynchronous audio and visual signals. A chunk-wise projector manages dimensionality while preserving local semantic structures, followed by a text-feature enhancer and ensemble regression head for final predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 45% reduction in mean squared error compared to baseline methods
- First place ranking in Personality Assessment track of AVI 2025 dataset
- Outperforms single-modality approaches by leveraging multimodal apparent behaviors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Instruction-based prompts unlock latent psychological knowledge within LLMs, enabling extraction of trait-specific semantic representations that outperform generic text encoders. The composite prompt (personality task description + ASR text + demographic metadata) guides the LLM to prioritize personality-relevant semantics over general linguistic features during embedding.

### Mechanism 2
Text serves as the anchor (Query) for cross-modal attention, improving feature alignment by filtering audio and visual signals through the semantic lens of spoken content. The Cross-Modal Connector uses text features as queries and audio/visual features as keys/values, forcing the model to retrieve only contextually relevant behavioral cues.

### Mechanism 3
Chunk-wise dimensionality reduction preserves fine-grained local semantic information better than global projection, mitigating the "curse of dimensionality" in small-sample regimes. The Chunk-Wise Projector splits high-dimensional vectors into smaller chunks processed independently, preserving localized semantic structures that global projections destroy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Instruction-Following Embeddings (Prompt Engineering for Regression)**
  - Why needed: Standard embeddings treat demographic context and long-form text as isolated inputs, while personality assessment requires integration
  - Quick check: Does the embedding vector change significantly when "Subject's Meta Info" (e.g., age from 20 to 50) is altered in the prompt?

- **Cross-Modal Attention (Query-Key-Value Mechanics)**
  - Why needed: The architecture uses attention to "search" video/audio for cues relevant to text, not simple concatenation
  - Quick check: If text query is "I am excited," which visual features (Keys) should receive highest attention weights?

- **Ensemble Learning for Variance Reduction**
  - Why needed: Personality labels are subjective and the dataset (644 participants) is small for deep learning, leading to high prediction variance
  - Quick check: Why does averaging 32 independent regression heads produce more robust predictions than a single head with 32x parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video (FFmpeg) → Face Crop → SigLIP2 (Visual); Audio (16kHz) → Emotion2Vec (Audio); Audio → Whisper → Text; Text + Meta-Data + Task Description → SFR-Embedding-Mistral (LLM); LLM Output → Chunk-Wise Projector (CWP); Text (Query) + Audio/Video (Key/Value) → Cross-Modal Connector (CMC); Fused features → Text-Feature Enhancer (TFE) (Gated residual); Ensemble Regression Head (32 MLPs) → Average Prediction

- **Critical path:** The Prompt → LLM → CWP path is most critical. If the prompt fails to elicit valid semantic features, the entire fusion network fails due to lack of meaningful anchor.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Frozen vs. Fine-tuned Encoders: All pre-trained encoders frozen to save memory and prevent overfitting, but limits adaptation to domain-specific interview nuances
  - Chunking vs. Global Projection: CWP adds complexity and segmentation hyperparameters but preserves local feature integrity better than unstable global projection

- **Failure signatures:**
  - ASR Error Propagation: Garbled text from Whisper leads to irrelevant LLM embeddings, causing entire fusion network to fail
  - Overfitting on Demographics: Model might learn spurious correlations (e.g., "All 50-year-olds are Conscientious") via prompt rather than analyzing behavior

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Prompt Ablation: Compare "LLM-Embedding" (no prompt) vs. "LLM-Embedding*" (with prompt) on validation MSE to quantify instruction tuning value
  2. Projection Analysis: Train identical models using Single Projector vs. Chunk-Wise Projector and plot validation loss curves to verify convergence speed
  3. Fusion Component Isolation: Run ablations on Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network (CMC-only vs. TFE-only vs. Both) to confirm both alignment and enhancement are necessary

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on high-quality ASR output creates fragile critical path where downstream performance is bottlenecked by upstream transcription quality
- Prompt engineering approach may learn spurious demographic correlations rather than genuine behavioral patterns, especially given small sample size (644 participants)
- Chunk-wise projector lacks strong theoretical grounding or corpus support, appearing heuristic rather than principled

## Confidence

**High Confidence (3/5):** The claim of 45% MSE reduction is well-supported by experimental results and ablation studies showing complete system outperforms individual components.

**Medium Confidence (2/5):** The assertion that instruction-based prompts unlock latent psychological knowledge is plausible but under-validated, with limited evidence beyond performance improvement.

**Low Confidence (1/5):** The claim that chunk-wise dimensionality reduction preserves local semantic information better than global projection lacks strong theoretical justification, with empirical results potentially specific to this dataset and model combination.

## Next Checks

1. **ASR Error Tolerance Testing:** Systematically inject controlled transcription errors into Whisper output and measure degradation in personality prediction accuracy to quantify text-centric architecture fragility and identify error tolerance threshold.

2. **Demographic Prompt Bias Analysis:** Train parallel models with identical text but varying demographic metadata in prompts to determine whether LLM is learning personality-relevant features or demographic shortcuts.

3. **Chunk Size Sensitivity Study:** Conduct systematic ablation study varying chunk sizes from 1 to 4096 dimensions to identify optimal chunk size and determine whether improvement stems from chunking mechanism itself or simply parameter reduction.
