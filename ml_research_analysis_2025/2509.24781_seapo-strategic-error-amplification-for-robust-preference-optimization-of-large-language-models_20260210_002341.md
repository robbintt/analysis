# SeaPO: Strategic Error Amplification for Robust Preference Optimization of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24781
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24781
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SeaPO improves truthfulness by 5-10 percentage points and enhances preference optimization when positive and negative samples have similar quality

## Executive Summary
SeaPO addresses a critical challenge in large language model training where preference optimization struggles when positive and negative samples have similar quality. The method strategically injects predefined error types—correctness, logic, and hallucination errors—into negative samples to amplify the distinction between preferred and non-preferred responses. This amplification enables more effective preference optimization by ensuring clear quality differences between training pairs.

Evaluations across five capability dimensions (math, reasoning, coding, knowledge, and truthfulness) and multiple model scales (1.5B to 14B parameters) demonstrate significant performance improvements. The method shows particular strength in truthfulness tasks with 5-10 percentage point gains, while mixing different error types produces broader performance benefits across most tasks.

## Method Summary
SeaPO introduces a strategic error amplification approach for preference optimization in large language models. The core innovation involves injecting predefined error types—correctness errors (factual inaccuracies), logic errors (reasoning flaws), and hallucination errors (fabrication of information)—into negative samples during training. This manipulation ensures that negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples, creating clearer preference signals for the optimization process. The model then learns to avoid these specific error patterns while maintaining capability across various tasks. The approach is evaluated across five capability dimensions and multiple model scales, with particular emphasis on tasks where traditional preference optimization struggles due to similar quality between positive and negative samples.

## Key Results
- SeaPO achieves 5-10 percentage point improvements in truthfulness tasks
- Performance gains observed across math, reasoning, coding, knowledge, and truthfulness capabilities
- Mixing different error types leads to broader and more stable performance improvements across most tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SeaPO works by addressing the fundamental challenge in preference optimization where positive and negative samples may have similar quality, making it difficult for models to learn clear preferences. By strategically injecting errors into negative samples, the method amplifies the quality gap between preferred and non-preferred responses. This amplified signal enables the preference optimization algorithm to more effectively distinguish between good and bad outputs, leading to better learning. The approach is particularly effective for truthfulness tasks where models often struggle with factual accuracy and hallucination.

## Foundational Learning

**Preference Optimization** - The process of training models to prefer certain types of outputs over others based on human feedback or quality signals. Why needed: Traditional methods fail when quality differences between samples are subtle. Quick check: Does the optimization algorithm converge when quality gaps are small?

**Error Injection Techniques** - Methods for programmatically introducing specific types of errors into model outputs. Why needed: Creates controlled negative examples for training. Quick check: Are injected errors realistic and representative of actual model failures?

**Quality Gap Amplification** - The strategic widening of quality differences between positive and negative samples. Why needed: Enables clearer learning signals in preference optimization. Quick check: Does amplification improve optimization convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Error Injection Module -> Preference Optimization -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The core workflow involves preparing positive and negative samples, applying error injection to negative samples, running preference optimization, and evaluating performance improvements across capability dimensions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead of error injection for improved optimization effectiveness. The choice of error types represents a balance between realistic failure modes and clear optimization signals.

**Failure Signatures**: The approach may struggle when injected errors don't match real-world failure patterns, or when error injection creates unrealistic samples that don't generalize to natural model outputs.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Baseline comparison without error injection across all five capability dimensions
2. Single error type injection (correctness only) to isolate effects
3. Mixed error type injection with varying ratios to find optimal combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Uncertainty about whether artificially injected errors capture real-world preference distribution shifts
- Limited evaluation scope focused on analytical tasks, with unclear generalization to creative or conversational domains
- Performance improvements reported as relative gains without baseline performance context

## Confidence
High confidence in: The core methodology of injecting strategic errors to amplify preference signal; the general trend of performance improvements across tested dimensions; the observation that error mixing provides broader benefits.

Medium confidence in: The magnitude of improvements (5-10 percentage points); the stability claims across different tasks; the scalability implications to larger models.

Low confidence in: Generalizability to non-analytical tasks; the relationship between injected errors and naturally occurring model failures; long-term robustness of the approach.

## Next Checks
1. Test SeaPO on a diverse corpus including creative writing, summarization, and conversational tasks to assess domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine which specific error types contribute most to performance gains in different task categories
3. Evaluate performance on models with 30B+ parameters to assess scalability limits and potential diminishing returns
