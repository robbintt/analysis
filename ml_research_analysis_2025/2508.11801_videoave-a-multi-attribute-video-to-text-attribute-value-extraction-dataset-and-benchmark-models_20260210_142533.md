## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11801

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text attribute value extraction dataset, addressing the gap in existing AVE datasets limited to text-to-text or image-to-text settings. The dataset covers 14 diverse domains with 172 unique attributes and 224k training samples. To ensure data quality, the authors propose a CLIP-based Mixture of Experts (CLIP-MoE) filtering system to remove mismatched video-product pairs. The paper establishes a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating four state-of-the-art video vision language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Results show that while video input offers unique advantages, video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings, with significant room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging effective temporal information.

## Method Summary
The VideoAVE dataset is constructed from Amazon Review Dataset, filtering for MP4 videos and removing non-visual attributes. A CLIP-based Mixture of Experts (CLIP-MoE) system uses three video-text models (X-CLIP, ViCLIP, VideoCLIP) with z-score normalized similarity scores to remove mismatched video-title pairs. The dataset contains 224k training and 25k evaluation samples across 14 domains. Four video VLMs (Video-LLaVA, VideoLLaMA3, InternVideo2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) are benchmarked under two settings: attribute-conditioned value prediction (with attribute prompts) and open attribute-value pair extraction (without prompts). Evaluation uses fuzzy F1 matching where predictions must share >50% substring length with ground truth values.

## Key Results
- Video input outperforms single/multiple images on 7 of 10 tested attributes, particularly for dynamic attributes like "Signal Format" (84.01% vs. 71.90%)
- Fine-tuning significantly improves performance: Qwen2.5-VL achieves 62.15% vs. 39.18% on Appliances in attribute-conditioned setting
- Open attribute-value extraction is significantly harder than attribute-conditioned prediction, with Qwen2.5-VL dropping from 39.18% to 4.66% on Appliances without fine-tuning
- Video-to-text AVE remains challenging, with substantial room for improvement in temporal information utilization and noise filtering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: CLIP-based Mixture of Experts Filtering (CLIP-MoE)
- Claim: Multi-model consensus filtering removes mismatched video-product pairs more robustly than single-model approaches.
- Mechanism: Three contrastive video-language models (X-CLIP, ViCLIP, VideoCLIP) independently compute video-title similarity scores. Z-score normalization per model mitigates distributional differences. A sample is retained only if at least K models exceed threshold τ, creating an ensemble agreement criterion.
- Core assumption: Mismatched pairs exhibit consistently low similarity across diverse model architectures and training objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs"
  - [section 2.2.2] Equations 1-3 define the normalization and filtering criteria with M=3 models
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence; related AVE papers (MADIAVE, ImplicitAVE) focus on extraction methods rather than data filtering
- Break condition: If all models share systematic biases (e.g., favoring certain product categories), consensus may retain bad pairs or reject valid ones.

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Visual Cue Extraction from Video
- Claim: Video input captures dynamic attribute cues that static images cannot reliably convey.
- Mechanism: Product videos reveal functional attributes (e.g., "Item Form: Spray" via nozzle action) and spatial relationships through motion and multi-angle views. Temporal frames provide sequential evidence that accumulates into stronger attribute predictions.
- Core assumption: Relevant attribute information is visually discernible through motion or sequential frames, not just static appearance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1, Figure 1] Spray nozzle example: "this information becomes apparent in the product video, where the spray nozzle and the visible wet surface of the shoe clearly indicate a liquid material and spray form"
  - [section 3.2.3, Table 5] Video outperforms single/multiple images on attributes like "Signal Format" (84.01% vs. 71.90%), "Guitar Bridge System" (29.30% vs. 21.62%)
  - [corpus] MADIAVE paper confirms implicit AVE from multimodal data remains challenging due to "complexity of multidimensional data"
- Break condition: When videos contain distracting visual elements or irrelevant content, noise may degrade performance (Figure 2 shows blue box distraction causing incorrect color/pattern predictions).

### Mechanism 3: Fine-Tuning for Attribute-Value Space Alignment
- Claim: Fine-tuning VLMs on domain-specific AVE data teaches valid value mappings that pre-training does not capture.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained VLMs may produce overly descriptive or ambiguous answers for attributes like "Suggested Users." Fine-tuning constrains predictions toward fixed candidate sets (e.g., "Mens," "Womens," "Unisex-Adults") by learning attribute-to-vocabulary mappings from the training distribution.
- Core assumption: The fine-tuning dataset contains sufficient and accurate attribute-value pairs to establish reliable mappings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.1] Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL achieves 62.15% vs. 39.18% (zero-shot) on Appliances in attribute-conditioned setting
  - [section 3.2.2] "a pre-trained VLM may respond to suggested users with an overly descriptive or ambiguous answer when queried directly. However, the model better aligns predictions with a fixed candidate set after fine-tuning"
  - [corpus] Self-Refinement Strategies paper suggests LLM-based AVE benefits from iterative refinement, complementing fine-tuning approaches
- Break condition: If training data contains label noise or inconsistent value vocabularies, fine-tuning may amplify errors rather than correct them.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training**
  - Why needed here: CLIP-MoE filtering relies on contrastive models (X-CLIP, ViCLIP, VideoCLIP) that learn aligned video-text embeddings. Understanding how these models compute similarity scores is essential for interpreting filtering decisions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why z-score normalization is necessary when combining similarity scores from models with different training distributions?

- Concept: **Multi-Label Attribute Value Extraction**
  - Why needed here: VideoAVE averages 3.43 attributes per product. Standard single-label classification metrics don't apply; fuzzy F1 matching accommodates natural language variations in predicted values.
  - Quick check question: How does fuzzy matching (common substring > 50% of label length) differ from exact match evaluation, and what types of predictions does it favor?

- Concept: **Zero-Shot vs. Fine-Tuned VLM Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark evaluates both settings to distinguish pre-trained knowledge from domain-adapted performance. Significant gaps indicate learning opportunities in the training data.
  - Quick check question: Why might a zero-shot VLM outperform a fine-tuned model on certain attributes (e.g., "Hair Type" in Table 5 where text input scores 31.69 vs. video's 25.41)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Amazon Review Dataset -> MP4 filtering -> Task-oriented pruning (remove non-visual attributes) -> CLIP-MoE filtering -> Train/Test split (9:1)
  - CLIP-MoE Module: 3 parallel video-text encoders (X-CLIP, ViCLIP, VideoCLIP) -> similarity computation -> z-score normalization -> threshold filtering (τ, K parameters)
  - Benchmark Framework: 4 VLMs (Video-LLaVA, VideoLLaMA3, InternVideo2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) -> two evaluation modes (attribute-conditioned, open extraction) -> fuzzy F1 scoring

- Critical path:
  1. Video preprocessing: Ensure MP4 format, validate video-title correspondence
  2. CLIP-MoE filtering: Set τ and K empirically (paper uses K requiring majority agreement across M=3)
  3. VLM inference: Feed video + prompt, extract structured attribute-value pairs
  4. Evaluation: Apply fuzzy matching, compute category-level and attribute-level F1

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Video vs. Image input**: Video provides temporal cues but introduces noise and higher compute cost. Table 5 shows video wins on 7/10 attributes, but multiple images outperform on "Pattern" (55.01% vs. 46.16%)
  - **Attribute-conditioned vs. Open setting**: Conditioned setting provides prompts but assumes known attribute inventory. Open setting is realistic but significantly harder (Qwen2.5-VL drops from 39.18% to 4.66% on Appliances without fine-tuning)
  - **Filtering strictness**: Higher τ/K reduces noise but shrinks dataset size. Paper reports 335k MP4 -> 248.8k filtered (26% reduction)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Subjective attributes**: Models struggle with "multicolor vs. blue and silver" distinctions (section 3.2.2)
  - **Visually ambiguous attributes**: "Material: plastic vs. polyester" not reliably discernible
  - **Lighting-sensitive attributes**: "Finish Type: blushed vs. polished" confused under poor lighting
  - **Video distraction**: Figure 2 shows irrelevant objects (blue box) causing incorrect predictions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce CLIP-MoE filtering on a sample subset**: Select 1000 video-title pairs, run all 3 models, compute similarity distributions. Manually inspect pairs where models disagree to understand failure modes.
  2. **Zero-shot baseline on single domain**: Run Qwen2.5-VL on one category (e.g., "Sports" with 71 unique attributes) under both evaluation modes. Compare attribute-conditioned vs. open F1 to quantify prompt guidance impact.
  3. **Modality ablation study**: For 10 products with all modalities available (title, single image, multiple images, video), run inference with Qwen2.5-VL and compare per-attribute accuracy. Identify which attributes benefit most from temporal information vs. textual specification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can computational methods be developed to identify the most relevant visual content within long product videos to improve robustness and inference efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "For future work, we will explore methods for identifying the most relevant visual content to enhance both robustness and inference efficiency."
- Why unresolved: Current VLMs process entire videos, which Section 3.2.3 notes can introduce "irrelevant or noisy information" (e.g., background objects) that degrades performance compared to static images.
- Evidence: A framework that selectively processes video frames to maximize F1 scores while reducing computational latency relative to full-video baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What evaluation metrics beyond Fuzzy F1 are needed to accurately assess model decision-making in the open attribute-value extraction setting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2.1 argues that the generalized setting "calls for more nuanced evaluation metrics besides F1 to better capture the model’s decision-making process in realistic e-commerce scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The generalized setting requires models to identify relevant attributes without prompts, but current Fuzzy F1 scores do not distinguish between errors in attribute identification versus value extraction.
- Evidence: A new metric that disentangles attribute proposal accuracy from value accuracy and correlates better with human judgments of product catalog quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Video VLMs be advanced to better leverage effective temporal information while filtering out visual noise in product videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Abstract states there is "room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging effective temporal information."
- Why unresolved: The modality comparison in Section 3.2.3 shows that while video helps with dynamic attributes (e.g., "Signal Format"), it often performs worse than multiple images for attributes like "Pattern" due to distracting visual elements.
- Evidence: A model architecture that demonstrates superior performance on motion-dependent attributes (e.g., "Item Form: Spray") over static baselines without sacrificing performance on static attributes.

## Limitations

- **Dataset Construction Reliability**: The CLIP-MoE filtering system's effectiveness depends on parameter choices (τ, K) that are not explicitly specified. While the approach claims to reduce noise by requiring consensus across three models, the paper does not provide ablation studies showing how different threshold values affect dataset quality versus quantity.
- **Generalizability Across Domains**: VideoAVE covers 14 domains with varying attribute vocabularies (7 to 71 unique attributes per domain). The benchmark results show significant performance variation across categories, but the paper does not analyze whether model failures stem from domain-specific challenges or fundamental AVE limitations.
- **Temporal Information Utilization**: While the paper argues that video provides temporal cues for attributes like "Signal Format" and "Guitar Bridge System," it does not quantify how much temporal information is actually captured by the evaluated VLMs.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The dataset construction methodology is well-documented with clear filtering criteria and evaluation metrics. The fuzzy F1 scoring approach and the distinction between attribute-conditioned and open extraction settings are properly defined.
- **Medium Confidence**: The benchmark results showing video's advantage on certain attributes are supported by experimental evidence. However, the attribution of success to temporal reasoning versus increased visual information remains uncertain without detailed analysis of model attention or temporal feature extraction.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that CLIP-MoE filtering significantly improves data quality lacks direct validation. No comparison is provided between filtered and unfiltered datasets in terms of downstream model performance or manual quality assessment. The filtering parameters appear to be chosen empirically without sensitivity analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis for CLIP-MoE**: Systematically vary τ and K values across a reasonable range, then evaluate how dataset size and composition changes affect downstream VLM performance on a validation subset. This would quantify the tradeoff between data quantity and quality.

2. **Temporal Feature Attribution Study**: For attributes where video outperforms images, analyze the specific video frames or temporal segments that models attend to during prediction. This could involve frame-level attention visualization or ablation studies where temporal information is progressively removed.

3. **Domain-Specific Performance Decomposition**: Break down benchmark results by domain rather than just coarse attribute categories. Compare performance across domains with similar attribute types but different product contexts to isolate domain-specific challenges from general AVE difficulties.
