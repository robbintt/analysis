# CellARC: Measuring Intelligence with Cellular Automata

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07908
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07908
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 95k-train synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata, enabling unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling with explicit knobs for alphabet size, radius, rule family, Langton's λ, query coverage, and cell entropy.

## Executive Summary
CELLARC is a synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata. It decouples generalization from human priors by generating tasks from formal CA rules, enabling unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling with explicit knobs for alphabet size, radius, rule family, Langton's λ, query coverage, and cell entropy. Each episode contains five supports and one query, serialized in ≤256 tokens, supporting rapid iteration with small models.

The benchmark includes 95k training episodes and two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) designed to probe different generalization capabilities. The extrapolation split is 100% chaotic and focuses on the most challenging CA rules. We evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines across small/medium/large parameter regimes.

## Method Summary
CELLARC decouples generalization from human priors by generating tasks from formal CA rules, enabling unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling with explicit knobs for alphabet size, radius, rule family, Langton's λ, query coverage, and cell entropy. Each episode contains five supports and one query, serialized in ≤256 tokens, supporting rapid iteration with small models. The benchmark includes 95k training episodes and two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) designed to probe different generalization capabilities. The extrapolation split is 100% chaotic and focuses on the most challenging CA rules. We evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines across small/medium/large parameter regimes.

## Key Results
- Transformer with task embeddings achieves 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on interpolation/extrapolation splits
- Oracle ensemble selecting between transformer and best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity
- Large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on 100-task subsets, demonstrating the value of broad pretraining for low-coverage, high-entropy cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Coverage-Gated Rule Inference
- Claim: Model accuracy scales with the fraction of query windows observed in support examples.
- Mechanism: Each CA rule is a local mapping F: [k]^(2r+1) → [k]. When supports collectively cover more unique centered windows from the query (higher cov), the effective hypothesis space shrinks, enabling both symbolic lookup and neural interpolation to succeed.
- Core assumption: Models cannot reliably extrapolate to unseen neighborhoods without additional structural priors.
- Evidence anchors: Per-token accuracy rises with query-weighted coverage cov and declines as dynamics become more active/entropic (higher Langton's λ and H).

### Mechanism 2: Task Embeddings Bind Episode Context
- Claim: Additive task embeddings improve vanilla architectures by providing per-episode context without inflating sequence length.
- Mechanism: A learned embedding e_ep is broadcast as a bias to all token positions, allowing the model to maintain a shared latent representation of the current rule across all five support pairs and the query.
- Core assumption: The embedding can encode sufficient rule information to generalize within an episode.
- Evidence anchors: Transformer (large) improves from 51.0/28.3 (ICL) to 58.0/32.4 (TE); TE supplies a low-cost episode context that helps bind the five supports into a coherent latent rule without inflating sequence length.

### Mechanism 3: Chaotic Dynamics Compound Coverage Deficits
- Claim: High-entropy, high-λ CA rules amplify the penalty for unseen windows.
- Mechanism: Chaotic rules (λ > 0.5) produce diverse neighborhood outputs; when coverage is low, the unseen portion of the rule table contains higher-information transitions, making majority-backoff or interpolation less effective.
- Core assumption: Entropy and λ capture meaningful difficulty beyond simple coverage.
- Evidence anchors: TESTEXTRAPOLATION is 100% chaotic (by λ bin) with median statistics cov≈0.50, λ≈0.888, and H≈2.26; Cell entropy H has the strongest negative correlation with accuracy (Spearman ρ = -0.72 for Transformer-TE).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cellular Automata Basics (k, r, local rules)**
  - Why needed here: Every CELLARC episode instantiates a unique CA defined by alphabet size k, radius r, and a synchronous local rule F. Understanding neighborhoods and rule tables is prerequisite to interpreting coverage metrics.
  - Quick check question: Given k=3 and r=2, how many possible neighborhood configurations exist? (Answer: 3^5 = 243)

- Concept: **Langton's λ and Cell Entropy H**
  - Why needed here: These are the primary complexity knobs; λ measures activity (fraction of non-quiescent transitions), H measures empirical unpredictability. They define the interpolation/extrapolation split boundary.
  - Quick check question: If a rule has λ=0.9, which dynamical regime is it likely in? (Answer: Chaotic)

- Concept: **Query-Weighted Coverage (cov)**
  - Why needed here: Coverage directly determines solvability; cov ≥ 0.5 is the release threshold for training data. It quantifies how much of the query's local hypothesis space is observed.
  - Quick check question: If supports cover 70% of query windows, what baseline accuracy would you expect from de Bruijn? (Answer: Approximately 70%, since it memorizes observed windows)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Episode serializer -> Task embedding layer -> Core encoder -> Output head
- Critical path: 1. Load episode from JSONL/Parquet 2. Serialize with markers (or extract individual I/O pairs for TE mode) 3. Inject task embedding (if TE mode) 4. Forward pass through encoder 5. Compute cross-entropy loss on query positions only (masked in ICL; direct in TE)
- Design tradeoffs: TE vs. ICL: TE is memory-efficient and improves vanilla models; ICL generalizes better for recursive models but requires longer contexts. Model capacity: 10M parameters clear de Bruijn; 1M parameters competitive; 100K parameters struggle on extrapolation. Symbolic vs. neural: de Bruijn excels when cov is high; neural models interpolate better under partial coverage.
- Failure signatures: Recursive models with TE prefix tokens: Training loss drops while validation loss rises (shortcut overfitting; see Figure 10). CNN in ICL mode: Collapses on extrapolation (18.6% vs. 29.0% with TE). NCA: OOM errors at medium/large scales; plateaus below 25% at small scale (cannot invert rules).
- First 3 experiments: 1. Reproduce the de Bruijn baseline on both test splits; verify accuracy tracks cov. This establishes a reference and validates your data pipeline. 2. Train a small Transformer-TE (0.11M params) for 10 epochs; plot training/validation accuracy by epoch. Confirm TE provides consistent gains over ICL. 3. Stratify evaluation by cov bins (e.g., [0.5, 0.6], [0.6, 0.7], etc.) on TESTEXTRAPOLATION; compare Transformer-TE vs. de Bruijn per bin. This reveals where neural interpolation outperforms symbolic lookup.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can compact, open models be modified to match the inference capabilities of large pre-trained models (like GPT-5) on specific CA families, such as Linear mod-k, without relying on massive scale?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that GPT-5 outperforms the best small-model baseline (Transformer-TE) on the extrapolation split, driven largely by "strong performance on Linear mod-k," and state that "matching this behavior with compact open models remains an open challenge."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the performance gap is due to fundamental architectural limitations in small Transformers or the lack of broad pretraining data that implicitly teaches program induction priors.
- What evidence would resolve it: An architectural modification or training objective that allows a 10M-parameter model to match GPT-5's accuracy on the Linear mod-k subset of the extrapolation split.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can a practical, learned selector be implemented to effectively leverage the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic solvers?
- Basis in paper: The paper presents an "Oracle Ensemble" (selecting the best of Transformer vs. de Bruijn per episode) which achieves significantly higher accuracy (65.4%) than either alone, and explicitly notes this "exposes headroom for learned selectors using only metadata or quick probes."
- Why unresolved: The Oracle Ensemble assumes access to ground truth for selection; it is currently unknown how to build a model that predicts which solver is better based only on available inputs (episode metadata or initial probe results).
- What evidence would resolve it: A trained meta-model that uses metadata (e.g., λ, coverage) to switch between neural and symbolic baselines, significantly outperforming individual baselines and approaching the Oracle upper bound.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the inductive biases that enable efficient rule discovery in 1D CA transfer effectively to 2D cellular automata or more expressive machine models like Mealy machines?
- Basis in paper: The authors list "2D multicolor CELLARC" and "Beyond CA: more expressive automata" as prioritized future work to address the "expressiveness limits" of the 1D hypothesis space.
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark is restricted to 1D local dynamics, which under-represents long-range spatial composition and stateful computation, leaving the generalizability of current architectural findings untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the current baselines (Transformer, de Bruijn) on 2D or Turing-complete variants of the benchmark to see if the Transformer maintains its dominance over symbolic methods.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can gradient-based meta-learning provide superior adaptation efficiency compared to the in-context learning (ICL) and task embedding (TE) regimes currently evaluated?
- Basis in paper: The paper states CELLARC is "well-suited for gradient-based meta-learning" and suggests future work should study "how meta-initializations trade off with in-context strategies."
- Why unresolved: Current baselines rely on either fixed weights with context (ICL) or standard training with embeddings (TE), leaving the potential benefits of explicit meta-learning for fast rule acquisition unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A meta-learning algorithm (e.g., MAML) that achieves higher accuracy on the extrapolation split with fewer gradient steps or support examples than the Transformer-TE baseline.

## Limitations
- Missing precise training hyperparameters (learning rate, marker token IDs) that could affect reproduction
- Assumes task embeddings are uniformly beneficial, yet recursive models overfit with them
- Oracle ensemble assumes perfect selection between two models, which may not hold in practice
- Limited validation that λ and H correlate with intrinsic rule complexity beyond coverage effects

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Coverage-gated rule inference mechanism; task embeddings improving vanilla transformers; chaotic dynamics compounding coverage deficits
- **Medium confidence**: de Bruijn symbolic solver performance; large model (GPT-5 High) gains; neuro-symbolic complementarity
- **Low confidence**: Recursive model behavior with TE; NCA scaling limitations

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity sweep**: Train the 10M-parameter transformer baseline across a range of learning rates (1e-4 to 1e-3) and compare interpolation/extrapolation accuracies to identify optimal settings and variance.
2. **Coverage threshold validation**: Bin TESTEXTRAPOLATION by coverage (e.g., 0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.7) and plot per-token accuracy for Transformer-TE vs. de Bruijn to confirm neural interpolation outperforms symbolic lookup in low-coverage regimes.
3. **Oracle selection robustness**: Simulate non-ideal oracle selection (e.g., 90% accuracy choosing the better of transformer vs. de Bruijn) on TESTINTERPOLATION and TESTEXTRAPOLATION to bound realistic neuro-symbolic gains.
