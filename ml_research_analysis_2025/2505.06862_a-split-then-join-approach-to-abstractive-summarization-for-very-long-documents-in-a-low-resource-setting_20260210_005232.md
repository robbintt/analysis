# A Split-then-Join Approach to Abstractive Summarization for Very Long Documents in a Low Resource Setting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06862
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06862
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: SPIN 3 variant achieves ROUGE-1 scores of 41.7 on arXiv and 35.6 on BigPatent, outperforming baseline BIGBIRD-PEGASUS (39.6 and 23.6)

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of abstractive summarization for very long documents (over 20,000 tokens) in low-resource settings, where existing models like BIGBIRD-PEGASUS are limited to processing only 4,096 tokens per document. The proposed SPIN (Split-then-Join) approach augments training data by splitting long document-summary pairs into smaller segments, then pairing them using ROUGE-L similarity. Three variants were evaluated: SPIN 1 splits both documents and summaries into equal parts; SPIN 2 pairs document parts with the full summary; and SPIN 3 selects the best-generated summary among parts based on ROUGE-L scores. Experiments on arXiv and BigPatent datasets showed that SPIN 3 achieved the highest performance, with ROUGE-1 scores of 41.7 and 35.6 respectively, outperforming the baseline BIGBIRD-PEGASUS (39.6 and 23.6) and other SPIN variants. This demonstrates that key information in long documents is not always in the beginning and can be distributed throughout, making selective summary generation more effective than truncating or fixed-length splitting.

## Method Summary
The SPIN approach addresses long-document summarization limitations by splitting documents into manageable segments and intelligently pairing them with relevant summary portions. The method processes documents exceeding 4,096 tokens by dividing them into parts, then uses ROUGE-L similarity to match document segments with appropriate summary segments. Three variants were developed: SPIN 1 creates equal splits of both documents and summaries, SPIN 2 pairs each document part with the full summary, and SPIN 3 generates summaries for each part then selects the best one based on ROUGE-L scores. This approach effectively augments training data for long documents while maintaining semantic relevance between inputs and outputs, allowing the model to learn how to extract key information from distributed locations within lengthy texts.

## Key Results
- SPIN 3 variant achieved ROUGE-1 scores of 41.7 on arXiv dataset and 35.6 on BigPatent dataset
- Baseline BIGBIRD-PEGASUS performance was 39.6 (arXiv) and 23.6 (BigPatent) on ROUGE-1
- SPIN 3 outperformed other variants by selecting the best-generated summary among document parts rather than concatenating multiple outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SPIN approach works by recognizing that long documents contain key information distributed throughout rather than concentrated at the beginning. By splitting documents into segments and using ROUGE-L similarity to pair them with relevant summary portions, the model can learn to identify important content regardless of its position. The best-summary selection mechanism in SPIN 3 allows the model to choose the most comprehensive representation of the document's content rather than forcing all information into a single output. This selective approach is more effective than simple truncation or fixed-length splitting because it preserves the ability to capture distributed key information while maintaining the model's token limit constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- ROUGE-L similarity metric: Measures longest common subsequence between generated and reference summaries; needed to assess content overlap and guide document-summary pairing decisions
- Transformer-based summarization models: Use self-attention mechanisms but are limited by quadratic complexity; quick check: verify model can process 4,096 tokens as claimed
- Long-document processing constraints: Standard transformers cannot handle documents >4,096 tokens due to memory limitations; quick check: confirm computational complexity calculations
- Low-resource training augmentation: Creating synthetic training pairs from existing data to improve model performance; quick check: validate that split pairs maintain semantic coherence
- Abstractive vs extractive summarization: Abstractive generates novel sentences while extractive copies phrases; quick check: examine sample summaries to verify abstractive generation quality

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Document -> Tokenizer -> Splitter -> ROUGE-L Matcher -> SPIN Variant -> Generator -> ROUGE Evaluator -> Best Summary Selector
Critical path: Input document is split into segments, each segment is paired with summary portions using ROUGE-L similarity, then summaries are generated and evaluated to select the best output
Design tradeoffs: Processing overhead vs performance gain - SPIN adds computational cost during training and inference but achieves better summary quality than baseline approaches
Failure signatures: Poor ROUGE-L matching leading to irrelevant summary segments, token limit violations if document segments are too long, or loss of document coherence when concatenating multiple summaries
First experiments: 1) Test ROUGE-L matching accuracy on a small document-summary subset, 2) Validate that split document segments maintain semantic integrity, 3) Compare summary quality of individual segments vs concatenated outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach assumes ROUGE-L similarity reliably indicates semantic relevance, but this metric may not capture semantic alignment when key information is distributed across different sections
- Evaluation relies solely on ROUGE metrics, which have known limitations in capturing semantic quality and factual consistency in summaries
- Experimental validation is restricted to arXiv and patent datasets, limiting generalizability to other domains or languages
- Additional computational overhead during training and inference phases may impact practical deployment in resource-constrained environments
- No evaluation of human judgment or factual consistency between generated summaries and source documents

## Confidence
- High confidence: BIGBIRD-PEGASUS struggles with documents exceeding 4,096 token limit and truncating or simple splitting reduces summary quality
- Medium confidence: Key information is distributed throughout long documents rather than concentrated at the beginning, inferred from relative performance gains
- Medium confidence: SPIN approach effectiveness demonstrated on specific datasets but may not transfer to other domains or summarization tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each SPIN variant component to determine which aspects drive performance improvements
2. Evaluate summary factual consistency and semantic quality using human annotators or factuality-aware metrics like SummaC to verify that longer summaries maintain accuracy and coherence
3. Test the SPIN approach on additional long-document domains (legal documents, medical literature, technical reports) and cross-lingual settings to assess generalizability beyond arXiv and patent datasets
