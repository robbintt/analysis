# Voiced-Aware Style Extraction and Style Direction Adjustment for Expressive Text-to-Speech

## Quick Facts

- This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing high-quality expressive speech in text-to-speech systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Spotlight-TTS, a novel text-to-speech system designed to improve expressive speech synthesis by addressing the challenge of style extraction from reference speech. The key innovation lies in the voiced-aware style extraction mechanism that focuses on style-rich voiced regions while maintaining continuity across unvoiced regions using an unvoiced filler module. Additionally, the style direction adjustment technique disentangles content from style using orthogonal constraints while preserving prosodic information. The model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models with significant improvements in naturalness, style similarity, and reduced word error rates.

## Method Summary
Spotlight-TTS extends FastSpeech 2 with a voiced-aware style encoder and style direction adjustment mechanism. The system processes speech by first extracting voiced (V) and unvoiced (UV) regions, then applying Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) only to voiced frames. An unvoiced filler module with ConvNeXt blocks and biased self-attention maintains prosodic continuity in unvoiced regions. The style direction adjustment uses orthogonality constraints to disentangle content from style, with Householder reflection for rotation and prosody projection via negative cosine similarity. The model is trained with multiple loss components including style direction (SD) loss, style-prosody (SP) loss, and adversarial loss.

## Key Results
- Achieved naturalness mean opinion score (nMOS) of 4.26±0.04
- Achieved style similarity mean opinion score (sMOS) of 3.84±0.04
- Achieved lowest word error rate of 12.64 among compared models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The voiced-aware style extraction focuses on regions where expressive style is most prominent (voiced segments) while the unvoiced filler module ensures smooth transitions between speech regions. The style direction adjustment with orthogonal constraints prevents content information from leaking into the style embedding, maintaining the integrity of both representations. This dual approach allows the model to capture rich expressive patterns while preserving linguistic content, resulting in more natural and stylistically consistent speech synthesis.

## Foundational Learning

**Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)**
- Why needed: Efficiently encodes expressive style information from voiced regions into discrete representations
- Quick check: Verify codebook size and embedding dimension match the reference implementation

**Biased Self-Attention**
- Why needed: Maintains prosodic information in unvoiced regions while distinguishing between voiced and unvoiced frames
- Quick check: Confirm β=0.02 for unvoiced regions and β=1 for voiced regions produces expected attention patterns

**Orthogonal Constraints**
- Why needed: Ensures content and style embeddings remain disentangled during training
- Quick check: Monitor E_c · E_s^T should approach zero when stop-gradient is applied to content

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
FastSpeech 2 base -> Multi-length discriminator -> Voiced-aware style encoder (Global + RVQ + Unvoiced filler) -> Style direction adjustment losses -> BigVGAN vocoder

**Critical Path**
Input text → FastSpeech 2 → Style encoder (Global + RVQ + Unvoiced filler) → Style direction adjustment → Multi-length discriminator → BigVGAN → Output speech

**Design Tradeoffs**
The voiced-aware approach trades some style information from unvoiced regions for improved naturalness and reduced content leakage, while the orthogonality constraints add computational overhead but ensure better disentanglement.

**Failure Signatures**
- High WER (>15): Indicates content leakage into style embedding
- Discontinuous prosody or high RMSE_f0: Suggests biased self-attention not properly preserving unvoiced region prosody
- Low sMOS with high nMOS: May indicate style extraction not capturing enough expressive information

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate V/UV flag extraction consistency across ESD dataset using pitch detection
2. Test biased self-attention implementation with β=0.02/1 thresholds on validation set
3. Monitor SD loss and SP loss convergence during initial training epochs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Key architectural details for voiced-aware style encoder remain underspecified (RVQ codebook size, embedding dimensions)
- Exact implementation of biased self-attention mechanism not fully detailed
- Learning rate schedule and batch size unspecified, making hyperparameter tuning challenging

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core methodology of voiced-aware style extraction and unvoiced filler module is well-described and theoretically sound

**Medium Confidence**: Ablation study results are compelling but exact implementation details leading to improvements are not fully specified

**Low Confidence**: Exact hyperparameters for RVQ, architecture dimensions, and learning rate schedule are unspecified

## Next Checks
1. Verify pitch detection method produces consistent V/UV flags across ESD dataset with different threshold parameters
2. Implement biased self-attention with β=0.02 for unvoiced regions and validate prosodic preservation using RMSE_f0 and F1_v/uv scores
3. Monitor SD loss (E_c · E_s^T) and SP loss convergence during training to ensure proper content-style disentanglement and prosody preservation
