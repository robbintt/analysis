# Content Accuracy and Quality Aware Resource Allocation Based on LP-Guided DRL for ISAC-Driven AIGC Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.12079
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12079
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LPDRL-F achieves >50% improvement in average CAQA compared to generation-quality-only schemes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses resource allocation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks for AI-generated content (AIGC), where sensing accuracy and communication quality jointly impact service quality. The authors propose a Content Accuracy and Quality Aware (CAQA) metric that jointly considers sensing accuracy, generation errors, and communication quality. They formulate a non-convex optimization problem (CAQA-AIGC) to maximize average CAQA by jointly allocating sensing energy, generating steps, and communication energy. To solve this NP-hard problem, they propose a low-complexity LP-guided deep reinforcement learning with action filter (LPDRL-F) algorithm that decomposes the problem into sensing-generating and communication subproblems.

## Method Summary
The method involves formulating the CAQA-AIGC optimization problem and solving it using LPDRL-F, which decomposes the 3D non-convex problem into a 2D sensing-generating resource allocation (SGenRA) solved by DRL-F with action filter, and a 1D convex communication resource allocation (ComRA) solved optimally by a ranking-based algorithm (RCE). The DRL agent uses Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with a hybrid action space (discrete generation steps via Gumbel-softmax, continuous sensing energy). An action filter prunes the DRL action space by mapping raw outputs to feasible ranges that satisfy minimum CAQA constraints. The RCE algorithm optimally allocates communication energy once sensing and generation decisions are fixed.

## Key Results
- LPDRL-F converges faster than existing DRL algorithms
- LPDRL-F achieves more than 10% higher average CAQA compared to existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms
- With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC achieves more than 50% improvement in average CAQA compared to schemes focusing solely on content generation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating sensing accuracy and generation errors into a unified metric (CAQA) enables joint optimization of sensing, computing, and communication resources for ISAC-driven AIGC. The CAQA metric (Eq. 8) factors in sensing accuracy Υₖ, generation accuracy (1-εₖ), and communication quality min(xₖ/Dc, 1), creating a direct link between resource allocations and the target QoE metric. This product-form representation is based on visual perception models but lacks new psychovisual validation.

### Mechanism 2
Decomposing the 3D non-convex problem into a 2D subproblem for DRL and a 1D convex subproblem for optimal analytical solution reduces learning complexity and improves solution quality. LPDRL-F uses DRL with action filter to decide sensing energy and generation steps, then solves the communication energy allocation as a standard linear program. This relies on the ComRA subproblem becoming convex once sensing and generation decisions are fixed.

### Mechanism 3
The action filter prunes the DRL action space by mapping raw DNN outputs to a feasible range, accelerating convergence and improving final policy performance. It calculates minimum sensing energy required to meet user's minimum CAQA constraint given the chosen generation step, then maps the DNN's raw output to the valid energy range. This prevents exploration of blatantly infeasible actions that violate constraint C5.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The CAQA Metric (QoE Modeling)**
  - Why needed here: This is the objective function the entire system optimizes. Understanding its constituent parts and how they compete for resources is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: If you increase the number of AIGC generation steps for a user, which components of CAQA (Θₖ, xₖ) change, and in which direction?

- **Concept: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Continuous Control**
  - Why needed here: DRL (specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic or SAC framework) is used to solve the non-convex, high-dimensional SGenRA subproblem where analytical methods fail.
  - Quick check question: In the SAC algorithm used, what is the role of the two critic networks Q_θ₁, Q_θ₂, and why are two used instead of one?

- **Concept: Problem Decomposition and Convex Optimization (LP)**
  - Why needed here: The core algorithmic strategy is to decompose an NP-hard problem into a hard part for DRL and an easy (convex) part for optimal, fast solvers. Recognizing when a subproblem becomes an LP is key to this approach.
  - Quick check question: After the DRL agent outputs sensing energy E_s and generation steps z, why does the communication energy allocation E_c problem become a linear program (Eq. 16)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment -> DRL Agent -> Action Filter -> RCE Solver -> Environment
- **Critical path:**
  1. State s is fed to the DRL Agent
  2. Agent's Actor outputs raw discrete z and continuous Ẽ_s
  3. Action Filter transforms Ẽ_s to feasible E_s
  4. E_s and z are passed to the RCE Solver, which returns optimal E_c
  5. Full action a = (E_s, z, E_c) is executed in the Environment
  6. Reward r (AvgCAQA) and next state s' are observed
  7. Transition (s, a, r, s') is stored in the replay buffer for Agent training

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Optimality vs. Complexity: LP-decomposition is heuristic but guarantees optimality for ComRA subproblem
  - Exploration vs. Constraint Satisfaction: Action filter enforces hard constraint on minimum CAQA, which speeds learning but might prematurely exclude regions
  - Generalization vs. Specialization: Model is trained on randomly reset user positions and requirements; performance may degrade in vastly different scenarios

- **Failure signatures:**
  1. Slow/No Convergence: DRL reward plateaus early or oscillates wildly
  2. Constraint Violation: Many users fail to meet Ωₖ,min at test time
  3. Poor Scalability: Training time increases drastically with number of users K
  4. Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: Performance varies significantly across random seeds

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Comparison: Implement JDRL-F and JGDM-F baselines, compare convergence speed and final AvgCAQA against LPDRL-F
  2. Ablation Study: Run LPDRL-F with action filter disabled and with RCE solver replaced by uniform allocation
  3. Stress Testing: Evaluate trained LPDRL-F agent's performance when key parameters are shifted from training values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the CAQA-AIGC framework be extended to support collaborative sensing and coordinated generation across multi-cell networks with multiple ISAC devices and AIGC servers?
  - Basis in paper: The Conclusion states that future work should focus on "more practical ISAC-based AIGC networks with multiple ISAC devices and AIGC servers"
  - Why unresolved: Current LPDRL-F is designed for single-device, single-server architecture and doesn't address inter-cell interference or handover challenges
  - What evidence would resolve it: A multi-agent reinforcement learning extension demonstrating stability and improved AvgCAQA in multi-cell simulation

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent does the mathematical formulation of the CAQA metric correlate with human subjective perception of Quality of Experience (QoE)?
  - Basis in paper: The Conclusion notes that "subjective validation is beyond the scope of this paper"
  - Why unresolved: CAQA is defined via product of accuracy and normalized image resolution but hasn't been verified against actual user feedback
  - What evidence would resolve it: A user study comparing predicted CAQA rankings against Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from human participants

- **Open Question 3:** How robust is the LPDRL-F algorithm to estimation errors in the specific sensing accuracy and generation error models used for training?
  - Basis in paper: The system model relies on specific empirical formulas for sensing accuracy and generation error that may vary with hardware or model changes
  - Why unresolved: The DRL policy learns optimal mapping based on these specific mathematical relationships; if actual channel or diffusion model deviates, policy may converge to sub-optimal allocations
  - What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis evaluating performance drop in AvgCAQA when inference-time parameters deviate from training values

## Limitations

- The CAQA metric's universal applicability across different ISAC hardware setups and AIGC models is assumed but not rigorously proven
- The model parameters are stated as "fitted from empirical data" without showing the fitting process
- The action filter's pruning of the action space could potentially exclude high-reward edge cases

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The LPDRL-F algorithm design (DRL + LP decomposition + action filter) is clearly specified and the problem decomposition logic is sound
- **Medium Confidence:** The simulation results comparing LPDRL-F to baselines are convincing for the tested scenarios, but hyperparameter transparency is limited
- **Low Confidence:** The CAQA metric's correlation with human QoE and robustness to model estimation errors are not validated

## Next Checks

1. **Re-implement the sensing accuracy model:** Use parameters (ξ=0.95, ϖ=0.3, τ=0.5) to plot Υₖ(nₖ) and verify it matches the "linear decline" described. Test impact of mis-specifying parameters on learned policy.

2. **Test action filter robustness:** For a range of (zₖ, Ωₖ,min) values, compute E_{k,s}^q using Eq. 10 and verify it is non-negative and less than E_{s,max}. Check if filter creates discontinuities in reward landscape.

3. **Stress-test generalization:** Train LPDRL-F on K=10 users, then evaluate performance on K=20 and K=5. Measure degradation in AvgCAQA and identify at which point algorithm's assumptions break down.
