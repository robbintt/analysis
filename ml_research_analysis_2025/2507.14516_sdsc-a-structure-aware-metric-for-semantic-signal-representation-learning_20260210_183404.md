# SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.14516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Introduces SDSC, a structure-aware metric that improves semantic signal representation learning by measuring waveform polarity and magnitude overlap, achieving comparable or better downstream performance than MSE.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric for time-series self-supervised representation learning that addresses limitations of distance-based losses like MSE, which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. SDSC extends the Dice Similarity Coefficient to continuous, signed signals by measuring structural agreement through signed amplitude intersections, providing a bounded [0,1] score that explicitly reflects local waveform structure. The authors demonstrate that SDSC can be used as a training objective via a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function and propose a hybrid loss combining SDSC with MSE to balance structural fidelity and amplitude accuracy. Experimental results across forecasting and classification benchmarks show that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios, with downstream performance closely tied to structural alignment rather than reconstruction error alone.

## Method Summary
SDSC is a structure-aware metric that quantifies similarity between continuous signals by measuring the intersection of their signed amplitudes, extending the Dice Similarity Coefficient to time-series. It uses a Heaviside function to check polarity agreement and multiplies by magnitude overlap, then normalizes by total signal magnitude to produce a score in [0,1]. For training, the non-differentiable Heaviside is approximated with a sigmoid function (α=10) to enable gradient flow. The authors propose a hybrid loss combining SDSC with MSE, using uncertainty weighting to balance structural fidelity and amplitude accuracy. The metric is evaluated within the SimMTM framework for pre-training on various forecasting and classification datasets, with z-score normalization applied per channel.

## Key Results
- SDSC achieves comparable or improved downstream performance vs. MSE in both forecasting (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Electricity, Traffic) and classification (Epilepsy, SleepEEG, FD-B, Gesture, EMG) tasks
- SDSC-based pre-training shows superior in-domain and low-resource performance, with structural alignment correlating more strongly with downstream success than reconstruction error alone
- The hybrid loss (SDSC + MSE) outperforms standalone MSE in complex datasets like Electricity, demonstrating the value of balancing shape fidelity with amplitude accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structural Agreement via Signed Intersection
SDSC quantifies local waveform similarity more faithfully than distance metrics by explicitly penalizing polarity mismatches and ignoring amplitude scale. The metric calculates the intersection of signed amplitudes using a Heaviside function (checking sign agreement) multiplied by the magnitude overlap (min(|E|, |R|)), normalized by total signal magnitude to yield a score in [0,1] where polarity inversion results in a score of 0, regardless of amplitude proximity. This mechanism assumes local waveform structure carries more semantic weight than pointwise numerical distance.

### Mechanism 2: Gradient Flow via Smooth Approximation
The Heaviside step function is non-differentiable at zero, preventing gradient-based optimization. The authors replace it with a sigmoid function Ĥ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-αx)) with sharpness parameter α=10, smoothing the transition to allow gradients to flow when signals cross or match polarity boundaries. This assumes α=10 provides sufficient gradient signal without causing instability or vanishing gradients.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Loss for Amplitude-Structure Balance
A hybrid loss combining SDSC and MSE stabilizes learning by decoupling structural fidelity from amplitude accuracy. Since SDSC is scale-invariant and ignores absolute amplitude, combining it with MSE (via uncertainty weighting) ensures the model learns to preserve both shape and scale. This assumes a trade-off between structural consistency and amplitude error that cannot be minimized simultaneously by a single standard loss function.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
  - **Why needed here:** SDSC is a direct adaptation of DSC from image segmentation to 1D signals; understanding DSC is essential to grasp the numerator in Equation (4)
  - **Quick check question:** How does the DSC handle a case where the predicted set is completely inside the ground truth set compared to Jaccard Index?

- **Concept:** The Heaviside Step Function
  - **Why needed here:** This function acts as the binary switch for "polarity agreement" in SDSC; understanding its discontinuity explains why the authors must use a sigmoid approximation for training
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the derivative of the standard Heaviside function undefined at x=0, and problematic for backpropagation?

- **Concept:** Reconstruction vs. Contrastive Learning in SSL
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses SimMTM, which combines both; SDSC replaces only the reconstruction branch, so distinguishing these components is critical to understanding what SDSC actually affects
  - **Quick check question:** In a masked autoencoder, does the reconstruction loss typically force the model to learn global context or local features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input window X -> Encoder (SimMTM) -> Latent representation Z -> Decoder -> Reconstructed X-hat -> SDSC Loss Module -> Gradients
- **Critical path:**
  1. Input window X is masked
  2. Encoder generates latent representation Z
  3. Decoder reconstructs X-hat
  4. SDSC compares X-hat and X by element-wise sign check (Sigmoid) and magnitude overlap
  5. Gradients backpropagate through the Sigmoid approximation to update weights
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Alignment vs. Cost: SDSC is O(T) and alignment-free, unlike DTW (O(T²)); it is faster but ignores global temporal warping
  - Shape vs. Value: Pure SDSC sacrifices absolute amplitude accuracy for shape fidelity; use Hybrid for forecasting, consider Pure SDSC for classification where scale is irrelevant
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Zero Grads: If polarity is consistently inverted, the pure Heaviside would be 0; with Sigmoid, gradients might be very small if α is too high
  - Amplitude Drift: Using pure SDSC on unnormalized data may cause the model to predict values orders of magnitude off while maintaining correct shape
  - Stagnant Loss: If α is too low, the structure constraint is too soft, behaving like correlation and failing to enforce strict polarity
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Toy Data):** Train a small MLP to reconstruct a sine wave using (a) MSE and (b) SDSC; invert the phase of the target; verify MSE reports low error while SDSC reports ≈ 0
  2. **Ablation on α:** Run pre-training on ETTh1 dataset with α ∈ {1, 10, 100}; monitor gradient norms and stability to confirm α=10 is the "sweet spot"
  3. **Linear Probing:** Freeze the encoder pre-trained with SDSC vs. MSE on a classification dataset (e.g., Epilepsy); compare linear probe accuracy to verify structural pre-training yields "more semantically faithful representations"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SDSC perform when integrated into other self-supervised frameworks, such as TiMAE or alternative contrastive formulations, beyond the SimMTM backbone used in this study?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "We leave... integration into additional pretraining frameworks (e.g., TiMAE or alternative contrastive formulations), as future work."
- Why unresolved: Experiments were restricted to SimMTM to isolate the effect of the reconstruction objective under controlled conditions
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing SDSC-based pre-training performance when implemented within masked autoencoder (MAE) architectures or other contrastive learning paradigms

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does SDSC compare in a direct head-to-head training scenario against shape-based alignment objectives like DILATE?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes, "We leave direct head-to-head training with alignment-based objectives such as DILATE... as future work due to computational constraints."
- Why unresolved: While the paper compares SDSC to distance-based and correlation-based metrics, it does not benchmark against specialized shape-based losses due to their high computational complexity
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating training convergence speed and downstream accuracy between SDSC and DILATE on identical hardware

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise theoretical relationship between local structural similarity and task-specific generalization in time-series models?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion explicitly states, "Understanding the relationship between structural similarity and task-specific generalization also remains an open research question."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates empirically that structural fidelity correlates with performance, it does not provide a formal theoretical explanation for why this alignment leads to better semantic representations
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or ablation studies isolating specific structural features (e.g., polarity preservation) to prove their causal impact on downstream task performance

### Open Question 4
- Question: Is SDSC effective for domain adaptation or cross-modal learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest, "Future work may explore... investigating its role in domain adaptation or cross-modal learning scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on single-domain forecasting and classification; the metric's ability to handle distribution shifts or align signals across different modalities (e.g., audio to video) is untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying SDSC to transfer learning tasks where the source and target domains differ significantly in amplitude or noise characteristics

## Limitations

- The structural agreement mechanism assumes z-score normalization is always appropriate, which may not hold for signals with clinically relevant DC offsets or baseline shifts
- The optimal α=10 for the sigmoid approximation is empirically chosen without systematic sensitivity analysis
- The hybrid loss formulation depends on uncertainty-weighting parameters that are not fully specified in the paper

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism (SDSC formulation and its theoretical properties as a bounded [0,1] metric)
- **Medium confidence** in the experimental results, given the reproducibility plan includes several assumptions about unspecified hyperparameters
- **Medium confidence** in the claim that SDSC provides "more semantically faithful representations" based on the linear probing results, though the ablation study is limited

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the proposed ablation study on α values (1, 10, 100) across multiple datasets to verify the claimed gradient stability
2. Conduct a controlled experiment where phase-inverted signals are used to verify SDSC's polarity sensitivity vs. MSE's insensitivity
3. Perform a small-scale reproduction of the epilepsy classification task to validate the linear probing results and assess the impact of z-score normalization assumptions
