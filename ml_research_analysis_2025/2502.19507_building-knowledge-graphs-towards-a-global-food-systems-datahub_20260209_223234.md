- Primary result: Modular knowledge graph framework for wheat value chain sustainability data with nitrogen and disease management modules

## Executive Summary
This work develops a modular knowledge graph framework to standardize sustainability data across the wheat value chain, addressing the lack of structured, interoperable agricultural datasets. Using the KNARM methodology, the authors designed ontologies for nitrogen and disease management, integrating existing vocabularies (e.g., AgroPortal, ENVO) and experimental data from Kansas State University. The graph, stored in GraphDB, supports SPARQL querying and aims to enable AI/ML-driven decision-making for sustainable practices. A sustainability module mapping SMART and IDEA frameworks to UN SDGs was implemented. While the framework enhances data integration and scalability, challenges remain in semantic alignment and user accessibility. Future work includes expanding modules and transforming the project into a global food systems datahub.

## Method Summary
The paper employs the KNARM methodology—a nine-step iterative process combining sub-language analysis, structured/unstructured expert interviews, vocabulary recycling from existing ontologies, metadata creation, and knowledge acquisition validation—to develop modular ontologies for nitrogen and disease management in wheat production. These ontologies are encoded in OWL using Protégé, populated with experimental and public data (weather, soil, KSU results) in GraphDB via Python/RDFLib scripts, and validated through competency questions. The framework integrates existing agricultural vocabularies (ENVO, WTO, AgroPortal) and supports SPARQL querying for information retrieval. A sustainability module maps SMART and IDEA frameworks to UN SDGs using ROBOT for CSV-to-OWL conversion. The modular structure enables independent development and validation of sub-domains while maintaining interoperability through defined relationships and reused terminology.

## Key Results
- Successfully designed modular ontologies for nitrogen and disease management in wheat value chain
- Implemented SPARQL querying capability in GraphDB for information retrieval
- Mapped SMART and IDEA sustainability frameworks to UN SDGs using OWL conversion
- Identified semantic alignment challenges as key limitation for datahub integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A modular ontology architecture enables scalable integration of heterogeneous agricultural datasets while preserving domain-specific structure.
- Mechanism: The system decomposes the wheat value chain into self-contained sub-modules (nitrogen management, disease management with chemical/cultural/genetic sub-components), each encapsulating concepts and relationships within its sub-domain. Modules interconnect via defined relationships but can be developed, validated, and extended independently.
- Core assumption: Domain boundaries can be cleanly separated such that cross-module dependencies remain manageable; experts can model sub-domains without requiring full-system knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The modeling of the ontology (i.e., the schema) for the Knowledge Graph has been in progress... following a modular structure using KNARM methodology."
  - [section] "This modular structure enables us to integrate various components of the wheat value chain and allows seamless integration with other agricultural datasets, creating a unified, scalable approach to data representation in sustainable agriculture."
  - [corpus] Limited direct support; neighboring papers on smart farming platforms (e.g., SUSTAINABLE Platform) address integration but not modular KG architecture specifically.
- Break condition: Cross-cutting concepts (e.g., weather affecting both nitrogen and disease) create circular dependencies; module interfaces become semantically ambiguous.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The KNARM methodology's iterative expert engagement systematically transforms domain knowledge into formal ontologies while reducing the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
- Mechanism: Nine-step process—sub-language analysis of data patterns, unstructured/structured interviews with domain experts, vocabulary recycling from existing ontologies, metadata creation, knowledge acquisition validation loops, database formation, semi-automated ontology building, and validation via competency questions. Human expertise remains in the loop throughout.
- Core assumption: Domain experts can consistently articulate tacit knowledge; automated methods remain insufficient for agricultural domain complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "KNARM addresses the knowledge acquisition bottleneck by incorporating human expertise, recognizing that the automated methods are still very limited in scope."
  - [section] "These questions serve as a benchmark, such that if our model provides comprehensive answers, the schema can be deemed complete."
  - [corpus] No neighboring papers reference KNARM; weak external validation of this specific methodology.
- Break condition: Expert availability becomes inconsistent; competency questions fail to converge on schema completeness; validation cycles exceed practical iteration limits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reusing established agricultural ontologies and applying OWL reasoning enables semantic interoperability and knowledge inference beyond explicitly encoded facts.
- Mechanism: Integrate existing vocabularies (ENVO for environmental entities, WTO for wheat traits, AgroPortal resources) to inherit standardized terminology. Encode axioms (domain/range constraints, equivalences) in OWL using Protégé. Apply reasoners (HermiT, Pellet) to infer new relationships and detect inconsistencies.
- Core assumption: Existing ontologies align sufficiently with wheat production needs; reasoners can handle computational complexity at scale.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Reusing established ontologies offers significant advantages, such as saving time, ensuring consistency, and enhancing interoperability."
  - [section] "After the successful creation of our schema and integration of existing ontologies, we plan to infer new knowledge from the knowledge base. Reasoning will be conducted utilizing reasoners such as HermiT, Pellet, and other existing reasoners."
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Towards an Ontology of Traceable Impact Management in the Food Supply Chain" supports ontology-based approaches for food supply chains.
- Break condition: Ontology alignment conflicts (naming inconsistencies, overlapping concepts with differing definitions) become unresolvable; reasoning time complexity becomes prohibitive for large graphs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: OWL (Web Ontology Language) and RDF Triple Stores
  - Why needed here: The system encodes knowledge in OWL axioms via Protégé, stores data as RDF triples in GraphDB, and queries via SPARQL. Understanding class hierarchies, object properties, and reasoning semantics is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between an OWL equivalentClass axiom and rdfs:subClassOf?

- Concept: Competency Questions for Ontology Design
  - Why needed here: KNARM uses competency questions to define ontology scope and validate completeness—if the KG cannot answer them, the schema is incomplete.
  - Quick check question: Given a competency question "Which fungal diseases are treated by cultural practices?", what classes and properties must exist in the schema?

- Concept: Ontology Alignment and Mapping Rules
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies semantic inconsistency across ontologies as a major challenge; future work requires equivalence axioms, subclass mappings, and manual checking.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent that two ontologies use "Fungicide" and "Chemical_Treatment" to refer to the same concept?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Schema Layer (Protégé OWL ontologies) -> Data Layer (GraphDB RDF triples) -> Integration Layer (ROBOT, reused vocabularies) -> Query Layer (SPARQL endpoints) -> Reasoning Layer (HermiT, Pellet) -> Sustainability Module (SMART/IDEA to UN SDGs)

- Critical path:
  1. Define competency questions with domain experts (KNARM steps 1-5)
  2. Design schema iteratively through structured/unstructured interviews
  3. Encode schema in Protégé as OWL ontology; integrate existing vocabularies
  4. Populate GraphDB with experimental and public data sources
  5. Validate by answering competency questions via SPARQL
  6. Run reasoners for consistency validation and inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expert-intensive validation (KNARM) vs. automated scalability: Paper prioritizes accuracy through human-in-loop, accepting slower development velocity.
  - Modular independence vs. cross-module querying: Self-contained modules simplify maintenance but may require complex federated SPARQL queries.
  - Vocabulary reuse vs. custom modeling: Inheriting ENVO/AgroPortal terms saves effort but risks semantic misalignment with domain-specific needs.

- Failure signatures:
  - Competency questions return incomplete, inconsistent, or empty results
  - Reasoners report logical inconsistencies (e.g., unsatisfiable classes) in merged ontology
  - SPARQL query latency degrades unacceptably as graph size increases
  - Domain experts disagree on schema definitions after multiple KNARM iterations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Write SPARQL queries for 5 competency questions in the Disease Management module; document which queries fail and trace to missing schema elements.
  2. Attempt to merge a new external ontology (e.g., Weather Ontology) with the existing nitrogen module; catalog all naming conflicts and axiom mismatches encountered.
  3. Run HermiT reasoner on the current ontology snapshot; identify any reported inconsistencies and trace each to its source axiom.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What automated techniques can resolve semantic and naming inconsistencies when merging multiple agricultural knowledge graphs into a unified datahub?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The next major challenge in creating a datahub combining the set of KGs into one is to deal with semantic and naming inconsistency... We plan to do simple manual checking and use mapping rules."
- Why unresolved: Authors acknowledge ontology alignment is a separate research field; their current manual approach does not scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: Automated alignment methods with quantified accuracy on agricultural ontologies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can knowledge validation ensure accuracy and reliability of information within large agricultural knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Another significant limitation is knowledge validation, as ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information within a KG remains a complex task."
- Why unresolved: No validation methodology is proposed; the limitation is acknowledged without solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A methodology with metrics measuring accuracy, completeness, and consistency of KG contents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What interfaces would enable non-technical stakeholders (farmers, bakers, millers) to effectively interact with the knowledge graph without SPARQL expertise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Non-technical users often face difficulties interacting with KGs due to the complexity of graph-based query languages and the limited availability of user-friendly interfaces."
- Why unresolved: Current implementation uses GraphDB with SPARQL; no accessible interface exists for domain stakeholders.
- What evidence would resolve it: Usability studies showing non-technical users querying the KG with acceptable accuracy.

## Limitations
- Semantic alignment errors when merging external ontologies remain a critical bottleneck without clear resolution strategies
- KNARM methodology lacks external validation, with no neighboring literature referencing this specific approach
- No accessible interfaces exist for non-technical stakeholders to interact with the knowledge graph

## Confidence
- High confidence: Modular ontology architecture enabling domain-specific knowledge encapsulation
- Medium confidence: OWL reasoning enabling semantic interoperability
- Low confidence: KNARM methodology's effectiveness in reducing knowledge acquisition bottlenecks

## Next Checks
1. Request and publish the complete list of competency questions used for ontology validation
2. Share the OWL ontology files and GraphDB endpoint configuration for independent testing
3. Conduct a small-scale reasoning experiment on a subset of the graph to measure inference time complexity and identify potential scalability issues
