# Principled Design of Interpretable Automated Scoring for Large-Scale Educational Assessments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17069
- Reference count: 20
- The paper introduces ANALYTICSCORE, the first principled interpretability framework for automated short-answer scoring that achieves near-state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining interpretability through FGTI principles.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ANALYTICSCORE, the first principled interpretability framework for automated short-answer scoring that operationalizes four core principles: Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI). The framework extracts explicit analytic components from student responses, featurizes them into human-understandable values using LLMs, and applies ordinal logistic regression for scoring. Across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset, ANALYTICSCORE achieves scoring accuracy within 0.06 QWK of uninterpretable state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating strong alignment with human featurization judgments.

The work addresses a critical gap in automated scoring systems by making scoring decisions interpretable to diverse assessment stakeholders including test takers, test developers, and test users. The framework establishes a strong baseline for future work in interpretable scoring, demonstrating that interpretability can be achieved without sacrificing much accuracy. The paper also identifies key open questions and limitations that point toward future research directions in this emerging field.

## Method Summary
The ANALYTICSCORE framework operates through a three-phase pipeline: (1) Response analysis using LLMs to extract analytic components that constitute human grading logic; (2) Featurization of extracted components into numerical values using a structured three-label scheme (0=irrelevant, 1=partial paraphrase, 2=direct quote); and (3) Scoring through ordinal logistic regression that maps featurized values to score points. The framework is designed to be faithful to human scoring processes, grounded in explicit analytic components, traceable through interpretable steps, and interchangeable with human scoring components. Evaluation was conducted on 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset, comparing performance against both human and machine baselines while measuring alignment between LLM and human featurization judgments.

## Key Results
- ANALYTICSCORE achieves QWK of 0.86-0.96 across 10 items, within 0.06 of uninterpretable SOTA methods
- Strong alignment with human featurization judgments (QWK: 0.90, 0.72, 0.81) across different assessment areas
- Demonstrates that interpretable scoring is feasible without significant accuracy loss
- Establishes first principled framework for interpretable automated scoring in educational assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by decomposing the scoring process into interpretable components that mirror human grading logic. By extracting explicit analytic components from responses and featurizing them into human-understandable values, the system maintains traceability throughout the scoring pipeline. The ordinal logistic regression model provides a transparent mapping from featurized components to final scores, allowing stakeholders to understand exactly how each component contributes to the overall score. This decomposition aligns with how human graders actually evaluate responses, making the system's decisions both faithful to human practices and interpretable to users.

## Foundational Learning
- **FGTI Principles**: Faithfulness (accurate representation of human scoring), Groundedness (based on explicit components), Traceability (clear reasoning steps), and Interchangeability (components can replace human judgment). Why needed: Provides a systematic framework for designing interpretable scoring systems that meet diverse stakeholder needs.
- **Analytic Components**: Explicit elements extracted from student responses that constitute human grading logic. Why needed: Forms the basis for interpretable scoring by breaking down complex responses into understandable parts.
- **Featurization Task**: Three-label scheme (0=irrelevant, 1=partial paraphrase, 2=direct quote) for converting extracted components into numerical values. Why needed: Creates a standardized, human-interpretable representation of response quality.
- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Statistical model that maps featurized values to score points while maintaining interpretability. Why needed: Provides transparent scoring decisions compared to black-box neural networks.
- **LLM-based Extraction**: Using large language models to identify analytic components from student responses. Why needed: Enables automated identification of complex grading elements at scale.
- **QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa)**: Metric measuring agreement between automated and human scoring, accounting for ordinal nature of scores. Why needed: Appropriate evaluation metric for educational scoring where partial credit matters.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Response -> LLM Extraction -> Analytic Components -> Featurization -> Ordinal Logistic Regression -> Score

**Critical Path**: The core pipeline flows from response input through LLM extraction of analytic components, featurization into numerical values, and ordinal logistic regression scoring. Each step must succeed for interpretable scoring to be achieved.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes interpretability over maximum accuracy, accepting a 0.06 QWK gap compared to uninterpretable SOTA methods. This tradeoff enables stakeholder understanding and trust while maintaining competitive performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when analytic components are too complex for current featurization schemes, when LLM extraction misses nuanced grading elements, or when ordinal logistic regression cannot capture subtle logical relationships between components.

**Exactly 3 First Experiments**:
1. Test framework on additional educational domains beyond the current ASAP-SAS dataset to validate generalizability
2. Compare performance of different LLM models for analytic component extraction to identify optimal architectures
3. Conduct ablation studies removing each FGTI principle to measure their individual contributions to interpretability and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can more complex yet traceable scoring modules (e.g., LLM workflows with modular evidentiary reasoning steps) close the 0.06 QWK gap between ANALYTICSCORE and uninterpretable SOTA methods while preserving FGTI principles?
- Basis in paper: "Future work should explore more complex yet traceable and interchangeable alternatives to ordinal logistic regression. Examples of possible alternatives are LLM workflows or agents which consist of modules that each compute a specific evidentiary reasoning step."
- Why unresolved: The ordinal logistic regression used in Phase 3 may not sufficiently capture logical nuances for complex items; the trade-off between traceability and accuracy remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of alternative traceable scoring architectures on ASAP-SAS and additional datasets, demonstrating higher QWK while maintaining human-interpretable reasoning steps.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well do LLM-extracted analytic components and featurization labels align with the target constructs that assessment items are designed to measure?
- Basis in paper: "It is also important to measure how the extracted analytic components and the featurization task align with the target constructs that the assessment item is intended to capture... We hope to see larger-scale studies on both featurization alignment and construct alignment in authentic assessment environments."
- Why unresolved: Current study lacked access to item design documentation; construct validity of extracted components remains unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies in authentic assessment settings with access to construct definitions, comparing extracted components against expert-defined construct mappings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do real-world assessment stakeholders (test takers, developers, test users) find FGTI-based explanations actionable and trustworthy in operational contexts?
- Basis in paper: "Field studies should be conducted in the future to validate the needs of the real-world assessment stakeholders and iteratively refine the design of interpretable scoring systems."
- Why unresolved: Current stakeholder analysis was theoretical, derived from literature; practical utility and usability remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Field studies with actual stakeholders using ANALYTICSCORE explanations in realistic decision-making scenarios, measuring trust, comprehension, and actionable insights.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the ambiguous "partial paraphrase" label (label 1) in the featurization task be refined to improve human-LLM alignment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "Alignment for label 1 is moderate-to-low, ranging from 0.68 down to 0.11. We attribute this result to the relatively ambiguous nature of the label category 1, coupled with the rarity of label 1 in human rating."
- Why unresolved: The three-label scheme creates an ambiguous middle category that both humans and LLMs struggle with consistently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Alternative labeling schemes (e.g., binary, finer-grained multi-level, or probability-based) evaluated on human inter-rater reliability and LLM alignment metrics.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to a single dataset (ASAP-SAS) covering only 10 items from one educational domain
- Performance gap of 0.06 QWK compared to uninterpretable state-of-the-art methods
- Heavy reliance on LLM-based extraction raises concerns about consistency and potential bias across different models

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The FGTI framework principles are clearly articulated and operationalized in a systematic manner
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that interpretable scoring is feasible without significant accuracy loss, based on current evidence
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that this establishes a strong baseline for future work, given the limited scope of validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ANALYTICSCORE across multiple educational domains and assessment formats (e.g., STEM subjects, multiple-choice explanations, constructed responses) to test generalizability
2. Conduct cross-LLM validation to assess consistency in analytic component extraction and identify potential model-specific biases
3. Perform longitudinal studies tracking interpretability and accuracy as assessment complexity increases, including responses with varying levels of correctness and completeness
