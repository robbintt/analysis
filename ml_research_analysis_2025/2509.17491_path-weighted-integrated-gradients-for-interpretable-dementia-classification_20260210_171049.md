core_contribution: Path-Weighted Integrated Gradients (PWIG) is a generalization of
  Integrated Gradients that incorporates a customizable weighting function into the
  attribution integral, enabling targeted emphasis along the path from baseline to
  input. This allows improved interpretability, noise mitigation, and detection of
  path-dependent feature relevance.

# Path-Weighted Integrated Gradients for Interpretable Dementia Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17491
- Reference count: 19
- PWIG generalization of Integrated Gradients with customizable weighting function for improved interpretability in dementia classification

## Executive Summary
Path-Weighted Integrated Gradients (PWIG) introduces a customizable weighting function into the attribution integral of Integrated Gradients, enabling targeted emphasis along the path from baseline to input. This approach addresses limitations of standard attribution methods by allowing researchers to control the importance of different points along the integration path. The method was applied to dementia classification using OASIS-1 MRI data, where it successfully highlighted clinically meaningful brain regions associated with different stages of dementia while achieving 99.80% validation accuracy.

## Method Summary
PWIG extends Integrated Gradients by incorporating a weighting function into the path integral, allowing selective emphasis of certain regions along the attribution path. The method preserves key properties like implementation invariance and sensitivity, though it violates completeness unless using uniform weighting. For the dementia classification task, a ResNet-50 architecture was trained on OASIS-1 MRI data, and PWIG was used to generate attribution maps highlighting brain regions most influential in classification decisions. The weighting function was chosen to emphasize clinically relevant regions, improving interpretability of the model's predictions.

## Key Results
- PWIG achieved 99.80% validation accuracy on OASIS-1 dementia classification task
- Attribution maps highlighted clinically meaningful brain regions associated with dementia stages
- Generated explanations were sharp, stable, and aligned with medical expectations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PWIG works by allowing researchers to customize the path integral through a weighting function, which emphasizes certain regions of the attribution path over others. This flexibility enables targeted analysis of feature importance along the path from baseline to input, addressing limitations of uniform weighting in standard Integrated Gradients. The weighting function can be designed to highlight clinically relevant regions or mitigate noise in specific path segments.

## Foundational Learning
- Integrated Gradients basics: Understanding path integrals from baseline to input is essential for grasping PWIG's extension
- Attribution map interpretation: Knowledge of how neural networks assign importance to input features is crucial
- MRI preprocessing for dementia analysis: Familiarity with neuroimaging data preparation and normalization
- ResNet architecture fundamentals: Understanding the base model used for feature extraction
- Clinical significance of brain regions: Knowledge of which brain areas are associated with dementia progression

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: MRI data -> ResNet-50 backbone -> PWIG attribution layer -> Clinical interpretation

Critical path: Input preprocessing -> Feature extraction (ResNet-50) -> Attribution computation (PWIG) -> Visualization

Design tradeoffs: PWIG offers flexibility in weighting but sacrifices completeness property; ResNet-50 provides strong feature extraction but may be computationally intensive

Failure signatures: Poor attribution maps may indicate inappropriate weight function selection; low validation accuracy could suggest overfitting or insufficient training data

First experiments:
1. Test different weight functions on simple synthetic datasets to observe their impact on attributions
2. Compare PWIG attributions with standard Integrated Gradients on a subset of OASIS-1 data
3. Validate attribution maps against known clinical markers of dementia progression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions including the optimal selection of weighting functions for different medical imaging tasks, the generalizability of results beyond the OASIS-1 dataset, and the need for quantitative validation of attribution maps against clinical expert review.

## Limitations
- High validation accuracy raises concerns about potential overfitting
- Attribution maps lack quantitative validation against established neuroimaging biomarkers
- Limited guidance on selecting appropriate weight functions for different tasks

## Confidence
- High confidence: Theoretical framework and mathematical properties of PWIG are well-established
- Medium confidence: Clinical relevance of attribution maps, pending further validation
- Low confidence: Generalization beyond OASIS-1 dataset and across dementia types

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive cross-validation across multiple independent cohorts to assess model generalization and robustness
2. Perform quantitative comparison of PWIG attribution maps against established neuroimaging biomarkers and expert-annotated regions of interest
3. Test PWIG with various weight functions on different medical imaging tasks to establish guidelines for weight function selection and evaluate impact on attribution quality and clinical utility
