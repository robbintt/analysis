# CliniDial: A Naturally Occurring Multimodal Dialogue Dataset for Team Reflection in Action During Clinical Operation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12936
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12936
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Multimodal dialogue dataset for team reflection in clinical operations; best macro F1 ~51% with GPT-4o

## Executive Summary
CliniDial is a multimodal dialogue dataset capturing team interactions, patient physiological signals, and video data from simulated clinical operations. The dataset aims to understand teamwork dynamics in medical settings and presents significant challenges including label imbalance, rich conversational interactions, and multimodal inputs. Current NLP methods including BERT and LLMs struggle with this domain-specific data, particularly in handling imbalanced classes and integrating clinical signals. The best-performing model (GPT-4o) achieves only 51% macro F1, highlighting the difficulty of the task.

## Method Summary
The dataset contains 22 clinical operation sessions with 6.5K turns across four behavior codes (Seek, Evaluate, Plan, Implement) plus None. Data includes transcripts, audio, two camera angles, and nine physiological signals. Experiments test fine-tuned BERT and prompted LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama 3 8B/70B) with various context sizes and few-shot demonstrations. Multimodal inputs are tested by adding video frames and physiological signal screenshots. Evaluation uses 10-fold cross-validation with 17/2/3 train/val/test splits per fold.

## Key Results
- Current methods achieve poor performance: best macro F1 ~51% (GPT-4o 5-shot), micro F1 ~67% (BERT fine-tuned)
- Label imbalance severely impacts results: 55% "None" labels vs 4.5% "Plan" labels
- Conversational context helps large-window models but hurts small-window models
- Multimodal inputs (video, physiology) fail to improve performance and often degrade it

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conversational context improves classification for LLMs with sufficient context windows, but degrades performance for models with smaller context capacity.
- Mechanism: GPT-4o (128K context window) shows macro F1 improvement from 47.3% to 49.8% when context size increases from 1 to 3 turns, then declines at context size 5. Llama 70B degrades from 46.0% to 36.4% as context grows, likely due to information dilution and smaller context window (8K tokens).
- Core assumption: Models require both architectural capacity (context window) and pre-training exposure to long-form clinical dialogue to effectively leverage context.
- Evidence anchors: Figure 5 shows GPT-4o 1-shot improving from 47.3% to 49.8% (context 1→3), while Llama 70B 1-shot drops from 46.0% to 36.4% (context 1→5).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Few-shot demonstrations help smaller LLMs initially but can degrade performance with too many examples; larger models show more stable improvement.
- Mechanism: Llama 8B improves from 22.7% (0-shot) to 37.0% (1-shot), then declines to 32.7% (5-shot). GPT-4o improves steadily from 47.3% (1-shot) to 51.1% (5-shot). Smaller models may be distracted by longer inputs rather than learning from demonstrations.
- Core assumption: Model scale determines capacity to extract useful patterns from demonstrations without being overwhelmed by input length.
- Evidence anchors: "Experiments with existing methods (BERT, LLMs like GPT-4, Llama) show significant performance limitations, with best macro F1 scores around 51%."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Direct multimodal input (video, physiological signals) fails to improve LLM classification in domain-specific clinical settings due to lack of pre-training exposure.
- Mechanism: GPT-4o's macro F1 decreases from 48.2% (text-only) to 46.8% (text+video) and 44.9% (text+physiology). Verbalizing signals before input causes further degradation (error accumulation). Model misinterprets physiological readings (e.g., assigns EtCO2 value to heart rate).
- Core assumption: Multimodal models require domain-specific pre-training data to correctly interpret specialized signals; general visual-language pre-training is insufficient for clinical operation rooms.
- Evidence anchors: "GPT-4o fails to leverage the visual or the physiological signals effectively... we hypothesize that... since there would not be too many scenes online corresponding to physiological signals, GPT-4o may have not encountered such data in its pre-training process."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Label imbalance in classification (macro vs. micro F1)**
  - Why needed here: Dataset has ~55% "None" labels vs. ~4.5% "Plan" labels; micro F1 can appear high while minority classes are poorly predicted.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts "None" for all inputs and achieves 55% accuracy, is it useful for detecting "Plan" behaviors?

- Concept: **Context window and effective context length**
  - Why needed here: 1,000-token inputs (context + demonstration) consume 1/8 of Llama's 8K window; models with smaller windows show degraded performance with longer contexts.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with an 8K context window perform worse than a model with 128K context window on the same 1,000-token input?

- Concept: **Multimodal fusion and domain grounding**
  - Why needed here: Physiological signals (SpO2, ECG, EtCO2) and surgical video require domain-specific knowledge; models trained on general image-text data may misinterpret clinical signals.
  - Quick check question: If an LLM has never seen an anesthesia monitor display during pre-training, how should it be expected to correctly read EtCO2 values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Transcripts + Video (2 angles) + Physiological signals (9 types) -> BERT fine-tuning / LLM prompting -> Classification (5 classes: Seek, Evaluate, Plan, Implement, None)

- Critical path: 1. Data acquisition (ethical approval required) 2. Transcript-video-physiology alignment 3. Baseline text-only classification 4. Context experiments (1-5 turns) 5. Multimodal experiments (video + physiology)

- Design tradeoffs: Fine-tuning (BERT) vs prompting (LLMs): Fine-tuning achieves higher micro F1 (66.6%) but lower macro F1 (48.6%); prompting maintains better class balance. Context length: More context helps large-window models but hurts small-window models. Direct multimodal input vs verbalization: Both fail, but verbalization adds error accumulation; neither improves over text-only.

- Failure signatures: Macro F1 much lower than micro F1 → model biased toward majority class ("None"). Performance degrades with added context → model lacks context window capacity or context adds noise. Multimodal input hurts performance → model lacks domain-specific pre-training; check for hallucinations in signal interpretation. Llama 8B: 0-shot→1-shot jump followed by decline with more demonstrations → model overwhelmed by input length.

- First 3 experiments: 1. Fine-tune BERT-base with classification head on text-only data; expect ~66% micro F1, ~48% macro F1. 2. Test GPT-4o 5-shot with context size 3; expect best macro F1 ~51%. 3. Test GPT-4o multimodal input and inspect verbalized outputs for hallucinations; expect performance degradation and misread physiological values.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent does incorporating audio analysis (e.g., detecting stress, urgency, or intent) improve the classification accuracy of team reflection behaviors compared to text-only baselines?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "In this paper, we did not include analyses of the audio setting," and explicitly note that audio characteristics could offer a better understanding of the interactions, leaving this exploration for future study.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study deliberately restricted inputs to text, video, and physiological signals, omitting the audio modality despite its inclusion in the dataset.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark experiments on CliniDial that integrate audio features (prosody, tone) and report improved Macro F1 scores or confusion matrices compared to the text-only BERT/LLM baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can advanced prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or fine-tuning on medical expertise significantly mitigate the low performance (approx. 51% Macro F1) observed in current LLMs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly invite future efforts to "investigate the low F1 scores," suggesting that "prompting methods such as chain of thought (CoT) prompting could be tested" or exploring "models fine-tuned with medical expertise."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper’s experiments were limited to standard fine-tuning (BERT) and zero/few-shot prompting (GPT-4/Llama), which failed to handle the domain-specific complexity effectively.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study showing that medical-domain-specific fine-tuning or CoT prompting yields statistically significant improvements in classifying minority labels like "Plan" or "Implement."

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What novel fusion methods are required to prevent hallucination and enable models to correctly reason over domain-specific physiological signals (e.g., accurately reading ECG/EtCO2 values) in multimodal clinical settings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that GPT-4o fails to leverage physiological signals, often hallucinating values (e.g., mistaking gas readings for heart rate), and identify "correctly reason[ing] the situations" as an important direction for future research.
- **Why unresolved:** Current multimodal models struggle to interpret specialized clinical visual data (monitor screenshots), leading to performance drops when these modalities are added.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of a multimodal architecture that achieves higher accuracy in signal interpretation tasks than the current verbalization-based approach used in the paper.

## Limitations

- Data access requires ethical approval, limiting independent validation
- BERT fine-tuning hyperparameters not specified, affecting baseline comparisons
- Multimodal fusion methods not thoroughly explored beyond simple verbalization
- Limited error analysis on why physiological signal interpretation fails

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Label imbalance analysis showing macro F1 much lower than micro F1 is well-supported by dataset statistics and standard classification metrics. Few-shot demonstration effects on smaller models are consistently demonstrated with clear performance trends.

- **Medium confidence**: Context window capacity effects are plausible but rely on assumptions about pre-training exposure not directly validated. Multimodal failure attribution to pre-training limitations is reasonable but not empirically tested.

- **Low confidence**: Specific claims about physiological signal hallucination lack detailed error analysis to confirm root causes.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the label imbalance effect by fine-tuning BERT on the dataset with 10-fold CV and verify macro F1 (~48.6%) is significantly lower than micro F1 (~66.6%).

2. Test context window limits systematically by running Llama 3 8B experiments at context sizes 1, 3, 5 turns and verify the reported degradation from 46.0% to 36.4% macro F1.

3. Analyze multimodal input failures by obtaining GPT-4o multimodal predictions and manually inspecting 10-20 cases where performance degraded, categorizing error types.
