## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RAGPulse, the first open-source workload trace dataset specifically designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Collected from an operational university-wide Q&A system serving over 40,000 users, RAGPulse captures unique RAG-specific characteristics including highly skewed document access patterns and significant temporal locality between requests. The dataset uses privacy-preserving hash-based anonymization while preserving structural and temporal dynamics essential for system research. Analysis of RAGPulse reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit pronounced hot document access behavior and strong inter-request contextual dependencies, validating the need for content-aware batching and retrieval caching optimizations.

## Method Summary
The RAGPulse dataset was collected from an operational university-wide Q&A system over a 6-week period, capturing detailed request traces from more than 40,000 users. The collection methodology employed privacy-preserving hash-based anonymization to protect user data while maintaining the structural and temporal characteristics essential for system research. The dataset captures unique RAG-specific behaviors including document access patterns, temporal locality between requests, and the interactions between user queries and the retrieval system. Implementation guidance is provided to enable researchers to reproduce realistic RAG serving scenarios using the dataset.

## Key Results
- Real-world RAG workloads exhibit pronounced hot document access behavior with highly skewed access patterns
- Strong temporal locality exists between consecutive RAG requests, indicating significant inter-request contextual dependencies
- The dataset validates the need for content-aware batching and retrieval caching optimizations in RAG serving systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAGPulse works by providing researchers with realistic, anonymized workload data that captures the unique characteristics of RAG systems that differ from traditional query workloads. The mechanism leverages actual operational data from a large-scale university Q&A system, preserving the temporal and structural dynamics while ensuring privacy through hashing. This enables researchers to develop and validate optimization strategies that account for the specific challenges of RAG workloads, such as the relationship between document access patterns and retrieval caching effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

1. **RAG Workload Characteristics**: Understanding that RAG workloads differ significantly from traditional query workloads due to document retrieval components.
   - Why needed: Traditional database and query optimization techniques may not apply to RAG systems.
   - Quick check: Verify that document access patterns show higher skewness than traditional database queries.

2. **Temporal Locality in RAG Systems**: Recognition that consecutive RAG requests often share contextual dependencies and similar document access patterns.
   - Why needed: Enables development of caching and batching strategies specific to RAG workloads.
   - Quick check: Measure the correlation between consecutive document access patterns.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Data Collection**: Techniques for anonymizing workload traces while preserving characteristics essential for optimization research.
   - Why needed: Enables open sharing of real-world workload data without compromising user privacy.
   - Quick check: Validate that hashed traces maintain statistical properties of original data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Requests -> Query Processing -> Document Retrieval -> LLM Generation -> Response Delivery

**Critical Path**: The most performance-sensitive path involves the Document Retrieval stage, which directly impacts both latency and resource utilization. This stage benefits most from caching and batching optimizations identified through RAGPulse analysis.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The privacy-preserving hashing approach preserves workload characteristics but may alter certain fine-grained patterns. The 6-week collection period provides adequate temporal coverage but may miss longer-term seasonal patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Cache performance degradation when temporal locality assumptions break down
- Retrieval bottlenecks when document access patterns shift significantly
- Batch processing inefficiencies when inter-request dependencies are not properly modeled

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Implement and benchmark content-aware batching strategies using RAGPulse patterns
2. Evaluate retrieval caching effectiveness across different temporal windows using the dataset
3. Compare optimization performance when using RAGPulse versus synthetic workload generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dataset's validity depends on the representativeness of a single university Q&A system for broader RAG workloads, which remains uncertain
- The privacy-preserving hashing approach may alter certain workload characteristics that could affect optimization strategies
- The temporal analysis covers only a 6-week period, potentially missing longer-term patterns in document access and user behavior

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The dataset collection methodology and anonymization approach are sound and well-documented. The observed hot document access patterns and temporal locality are clearly demonstrated in the analysis.

**Medium confidence**: The generalizability of findings to other RAG system contexts beyond university Q&A applications. The impact of privacy-preserving transformations on workload characteristics relevant to optimization research.

**Low confidence**: The long-term stability of observed workload patterns beyond the 6-week collection period. The influence of specific LLM and embedding model choices on the workload characteristics.

## Next Checks
1. Compare RAGPulse patterns against workload traces from different RAG application domains (e.g., enterprise search, customer support) to assess generalizability.
2. Validate that optimization strategies developed using RAGPulse perform comparably when applied to real-world systems with different privacy transformations or anonymization approaches.
3. Extend the temporal analysis to multiple months or quarters to verify the stability of observed access patterns and temporal locality characteristics.
