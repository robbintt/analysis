# Causal Structure Learning for Dynamical Systems with Theoretical Score Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14361
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CADYT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data for causal structure learning in dynamical systems

## Executive Summary
CADYT presents a novel approach to causal structure learning in continuous-time dynamical systems that effectively handles irregular sampling patterns. The method combines Gaussian Processes with exact inference to model continuous-time dynamics and employs an information-theoretic score based on the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. By using a greedy search algorithm, CADYT identifies the underlying causal structure while maintaining computational tractability. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods like DYNOTEARS, PCMCI+, and VARLINGAM, achieving better metrics including lower Structural Hamming Distance and higher F1 scores and AUPRC values.

## Method Summary
CADYT addresses causal discovery in continuous-time dynamical systems by integrating Gaussian Process regression with an information-theoretic scoring framework. The method uses exact GP inference to model continuous-time dynamics from irregularly sampled data, then applies a greedy search algorithm guided by a score derived from the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. This approach simultaneously handles the continuous-time nature of the data and identifies the causal structure, making it particularly effective for systems with irregular sampling intervals. The method's theoretical foundation ensures that the discovered causal structures are both statistically and causally sound.

## Key Results
- CADYT achieves lower Structural Hamming Distance compared to baselines on synthetic datasets
- The method obtains higher F1 scores and AUPRC values than competing approaches
- Performance remains robust on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, with consistent improvements over DYNOTEARS, PCMCI+, and VARLINGAM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CADYT works by leveraging the continuous-time modeling capabilities of Gaussian Processes to handle irregular sampling patterns while maintaining exact inference for accurate parameter estimation. The information-theoretic score based on the Algorithmic Markov Condition ensures that the discovered causal structure minimizes the description length of the data, leading to more parsimonious and interpretable models. The greedy search algorithm efficiently explores the space of possible causal structures while avoiding local optima through careful initialization and iterative refinement. This combination of continuous-time modeling, principled scoring, and efficient search enables CADYT to outperform discrete-time approaches that struggle with irregular sampling.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian Processes: Non-parametric Bayesian models for regression that provide uncertainty quantification and smooth interpolation between observations; needed for continuous-time modeling of dynamical systems
- Algorithmic Markov Condition: Theoretical foundation stating that the true causal direction minimizes the description length of the joint distribution; needed for principled causal scoring
- Minimum Description Length principle: Information-theoretic framework for model selection based on compression; needed to balance model complexity and fit
- Greedy search algorithms: Heuristic optimization methods that make locally optimal choices at each step; needed for tractable exploration of causal structure space
- Structural Hamming Distance: Metric for evaluating causal structure learning by counting edge disagreements; needed for quantitative performance comparison

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data -> GP Regression -> Information-theoretic Score -> Greedy Search -> Causal Structure
Critical path: Irregularly sampled time series → Gaussian Process interpolation → MDL-based scoring → Greedy structure search → Estimated causal graph
Design tradeoffs: Exact GP inference provides accuracy but limits scalability; greedy search is computationally efficient but may miss global optima; MDL scoring is theoretically sound but computationally intensive
Failure signatures: Poor performance on high-dimensional systems, sensitivity to hyperparameter choices in GP kernel, convergence to local optima in structure search
First experiments:
1. Apply CADYT to a simple linear dynamical system with known ground truth to verify basic functionality
2. Test on a small-scale irregularly-sampled dataset (3-5 variables) to validate the GP interpolation step
3. Compare performance on regularly vs irregularly-sampled versions of the same dataset to assess the method's advantage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional systems (50+ variables) due to computational complexity of exact GP inference and greedy search
- Reliance on Gaussian noise assumption in GP framework, limiting applicability to non-Gaussian dynamical systems
- Limited validation on real-world datasets, with most experiments conducted on synthetic data with known ground truth structures

## Confidence
- Methodology and theoretical framework: High
- Experimental results on benchmark datasets: High
- Real-world applicability and robustness to noise: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test CADYT on high-dimensional dynamical systems (50+ variables) to assess scalability and computational requirements
2. Evaluate performance on real-world datasets from domains like neuroscience or climate science where ground truth causal structures are partially known
3. Benchmark against other continuous-time causal discovery methods specifically designed for irregularly-sampled data, such as GP-based approaches with different inference schemes
