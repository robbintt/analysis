# LLMs Judge Themselves: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Human-Aligned Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15746
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Game-theoretic aggregation of peer LLM rankings aligns better with human judgment than single-model evaluation, with Kemeny-Young achieving median Pearson 0.771 on GSM8K

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a game-theoretic framework for evaluating large language models where models serve as both evaluators and evaluatees, providing mutual rankings of each other's outputs. The decentralized peer rankings are aggregated using classical voting algorithms like Kemeny-Young and compared against human preferences from Chatbot Arena. The framework demonstrates that aggregated peer evaluations align more closely with human judgments than single-model evaluations, particularly excelling in objective tasks like mathematics and coding while mitigating self-preference bias through collective aggregation.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a decentralized peer evaluation protocol where multiple LLMs generate responses to shared questions, then anonymously rank all responses (including their own) per question using domain-specific prompts. These individual rankings are converted to pairwise preferences and aggregated using game-theoretic voting algorithms (primarily Kemeny-Young) to produce consensus rankings. The aggregated results are validated by comparing them to human preference rankings from Chatbot Arena using Pearson correlation and Kendall's tau at both micro-level (per-question) and macro-level (dataset-wide) granularities.

## Key Results
- Kemeny-Young aggregation achieves median Pearson correlation of 0.771 on GSM8K, outperforming individual models' 0.714
- Game-theoretic aggregation mitigates self-preference bias, with SIE-SFE differences generally modest (typically <0.1 positions)
- Alignment strength varies by task type, with objective tasks (math, code) showing higher correlation (up to 0.941 macro-level) than subjective tasks like creative writing
- Aggregated rankings show stronger alignment with human judgment than any single model evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aggregating peer evaluations reduces variance and improves alignment with human judgment compared to single-model evaluation
- Mechanism: Multiple evaluators produce rankings with individual noise and bias; aggregation algorithms (especially Kemeny-Young) minimize total pairwise discordance across all input rankings, producing a consensus that cancels idiosyncratic errors while preserving shared signal
- Core assumption: Individual evaluator errors are at least partially independent; collective signal exists across evaluators
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These decentralized peer rankings are aggregated using classical voting algorithms... results show that game-theoretic aggregation methods align more closely with human judgments than single-model evaluations"
  - [section 4.2] "both Kemeny and Kendall reach a median Pearson correlation of 0.771, surpassing the best individual model, GPT-4o-2024-11-20, which achieves a lower median of 0.714 and a wider interquartile range"
  - [corpus] AutoBench validates reciprocal peer assessment as viable; limited direct corpus evidence for Kemeny-Young superiority in LLM contexts
- Break condition: If evaluator errors are highly correlated (e.g., all models share systematic blind spots), aggregation fails to improve alignment

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Game-theoretic aggregation mitigates self-preference bias without requiring explicit bias removal
- Mechanism: Self-inclusive evaluation (SIE) and self-free evaluation (SFE) converge because the aggregation objective minimizes global discordance; a single self-favoring vote cannot dominate the collective preference structure
- Core assumption: The number of evaluators is sufficient that no single evaluator (including self) can substantially shift the aggregate
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework also mitigates self-preference bias, as aggregated rankings are much closer to unbiased peer evaluations than raw self-assessments"
  - [section 4.3] "SIE-SFE differences are generally modest... 4o-0513 shifts by only -0.02... These small deltas indicate that aggregation substantially reduces the influence of self-preference"
  - [corpus] Peer elicitation games (PEG) show similar bias mitigation through multi-discriminator structures
- Break condition: If all evaluators exhibit correlated self-preference (e.g., models collude or share training data artifacts), aggregation cannot distinguish genuine quality from collective bias

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Alignment strength varies by task type, with objective tasks (math, code) showing higher correlation than subjective tasks (creative writing)
- Mechanism: Objective tasks have clearer evaluation criteria that are shared across models and humans; subjective tasks require capturing stylistic or preference-based signals that vary more across evaluators
- Core assumption: Human preference signals from Chatbot Arena are reliable ground truth; benchmark-to-arena mapping is valid
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "GSM8K benchmark shows the strongest alignment... macro level, it reaches a Pearson correlation of 0.941... benchmarks involving CEval or Creative Writing exhibit lower and more variable correlations"
  - [section 4.4] "game-theoretic aggregation is particularly effective in tasks with clearer evaluation criteria, such as math and code generation"
  - [corpus] PersonaEval highlights evaluator role identification as prerequisite; suggests subjective evaluation requires additional calibration
- Break condition: If human arena rankings themselves contain noise or bias (crowdworker variability, platform effects), correlation metrics may not reflect true alignment

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Kemeny-Young Rank Aggregation**
  - Why needed here: This is the core algorithm producing consensus rankings; understanding its objective (minimizing Kendall-Tau distance) explains why it outperforms alternatives
  - Quick check question: Given rankings [A>B>C], [B>A>C], [C>A>B], what ranking minimizes total pairwise disagreement?

- Concept: **Self-Preference Bias in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper's bias mitigation claim rests on understanding that models systematically favor their own outputs; this is the problem being solved
  - Quick check question: If a model rates its own response 2 positions higher than peer evaluation on average, what does this imply for the SE vs. PE comparison?

- Concept: **Micro-level vs. Macro-level Correlation**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates at two granularities; micro-level reveals per-question variance while macro-level summarizes dataset alignment—both are needed to assess reliability
  - Quick check question: If micro-level correlation has high variance but macro-level correlation is high, what does this suggest about the evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Response Generation Module: Each LLM generates answers to shared question set Q
  2. Peer Evaluation Protocol: Each model ranks all responses (including own) per question; outputs pairwise preferences
  3. Preference Aggregation Engine: Kemeny-Young (default) or alternative voting algorithms compute consensus ranking
  4. Human Alignment Validator: Compares aggregated rankings to Chatbot Arena via Pearson/Kendall correlation

- Critical path:
  Question sampling → Response generation (parallel across models) → Anonymous ranking collection (parallel across evaluator-question pairs) → Per-question preference matrix construction → Kemeny-Young aggregation → Correlation computation with human reference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Kemeny-Young vs. faster methods**: KY is NP-hard with heuristics; Borda is O(n) but less robust to noise
  - **Full ranking vs. truncated top-k**: Truncated reduces evaluator burden but loses discrimination power (Table 5 shows ~8% alignment drop)
  - **Self-inclusive vs. self-free**: SIE uses all data but risks bias; SFE is cleaner but discards signal; paper shows difference is small post-aggregation

- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation with human rankings despite high aggregation confidence → check evaluator homogeneity or benchmark-arena mismatch
  - High variance in micro-level correlations → indicates task-specific evaluator disagreement; may need domain-specific aggregation
  - SIE/SFE divergence > 0.5 positions → suggests self-bias is dominating; investigate specific models or task types

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce GSM8K baseline**: Run 6-model peer evaluation on 50 GSM8K samples; verify median Pearson ~0.77 with Kemeny-Young; check 25th percentile > 0.60
  2. **Ablate aggregation method**: Compare Kemeny-Young vs. Borda vs. Copeland on same data; confirm KY achieves highest median and lowest IQR
  3. **Probe bias mitigation**: Compute SE-PE gap and SIE-SFE gap on IFEval (where Table 13 shows 5/6 models have self-preference); verify SIE≈SFE post-aggregation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the game-theoretic aggregation framework be adapted to improve alignment with human judgment in highly subjective tasks, such as creative writing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "the effectiveness of our approach varies across task types, achieving stronger alignment in objective domains than in creative writing."
- Why unresolved: The current study establishes that Kemeny-Young aggregation works well for math and coding but yields lower correlation in subjective domains; it does not propose specific adjustments to the voting algorithms or evaluation criteria to bridge this gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the performance of weighted voting schemes or prompt-level adjustments specifically designed for subjective nuances against the standard aggregation methods on creative writing benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the decentralized peer ranking framework maintain high alignment with human judgment when utilizing a heterogeneous pool of evaluator models, particularly including smaller or open-source models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experimental setup relies exclusively on a "homogeneous" set of six top-tier proprietary models (GPT-4o and Claude variants). It is unstated if the "game" functions effectively if the agents (evaluators) have significantly lower reasoning capabilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that strong models can judge each other, but the validity of the consensus mechanism when the pool includes weaker models—which may introduce noise or distinct systematic biases—remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results replicating the framework using a diverse mixture of open-source and proprietary models of varying parameter sizes (e.g., Llama, Mistral) and comparing the resulting correlations to the current high-resource baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the decentralized evaluation framework robust against strategic manipulation or collusion if agent models are explicitly prompted to maximize their own utility?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper adopts a "game-theoretic" framework but treats models as compliant judges (addressing only *implicit* self-preference bias). It does not explore how the system behaves under *active* strategic play, where models might attempt to game the ranking logic.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mitigates unintentional self-preference bias via aggregation, it does not test the framework's resilience against adversarial strategies, such as a model consistently ranking competitors lower to manipulate the global Kemeny-Young ranking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results involving "adversarial" evaluator models programmed with utility functions that reward ranking manipulation, to test if the current aggregation methods resist such collusion.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness varies significantly across task types, showing weaker alignment with human judgment in subjective domains like creative writing compared to objective tasks
- The study relies exclusively on a homogeneous set of six top-tier proprietary models, leaving uncertainty about how the framework performs with heterogeneous or smaller models
- The results depend heavily on Chatbot Arena rankings as ground truth, which may contain platform-specific biases that don't generalize to other evaluation contexts

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The self-preference bias mitigation mechanism (SIE ≈ SFE post-aggregation) is well-supported by the reported deltas and consistent with peer elicitation literature
- **Medium confidence**: The task-type alignment differences (objective vs. subjective tasks) are plausible given evaluation clarity, but could reflect benchmark-to-arena mapping artifacts rather than fundamental properties
- **Medium confidence**: The Kemeny-Young superiority claim is supported within tested conditions, but alternative methods weren't extensively explored, and the computational overhead isn't fully characterized

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-platform validation**: Replicate the framework using a different human preference dataset (e.g., LMSYS Leaderboard or crowdsourced rankings) to verify that Kemeny-Young alignment advantage persists outside Chatbot Arena
2. **Scalability stress test**: Systematically increase the number of evaluators (3→6→9 models) and questions (20→100→500) while measuring Kemeny-Young computation time and correlation stability to establish practical limits
3. **Bias correlation analysis**: Measure pairwise correlations between individual model evaluator biases (self-preference, domain preferences) to empirically test whether independent error assumptions hold across the evaluator pool
