# Copyright Detection in Large Language Models: An Ethical Approach to Generative AI Development

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20623
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20623
- Reference count: 23
- Introduces open-source copyright detection platform for verifying unauthorized use of copyrighted content in LLM training datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an open-source platform for detecting copyrighted content in Large Language Models' training data. The system improves upon existing methods by integrating passage extraction, paraphrase generation, question-answering, and multiple-choice evaluation within a user-friendly web interface. Key innovations include reducing computational overhead by 10-30% through optimized API calls, improving similarity detection with preprocessing pipelines using SBERT embeddings, and enhancing dataset validation. The framework enables content creators to efficiently determine if their work was used in LLM training, promoting transparency and ethical AI development.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a black-box membership inference approach that evaluates whether an LLM can distinguish original copyrighted passages from semantically equivalent paraphrases. The process involves extracting unique passages using BM25 scoring, generating multiple paraphrase variants with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, validating paraphrase quality using SBERT embeddings, and evaluating LLM responses through multiple-choice questions. The system uses LangGraph orchestration and Pinecone vector storage, achieving computational efficiency improvements through preprocessing pipelines that filter invalid passages and normalize lengths.

## Key Results
- 10-30% reduction in computational overhead through optimized API calls and preprocessing
- Improved similarity detection accuracy using SBERT embedding-based validation
- Enhanced dataset validation with expanded 4-option multiple-choice format reducing random selection probability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Memorization Detection via Multiple-Choice Discrimination
LLMs exposed to specific text during training are more likely to recognize and prefer that exact wording. The system presents a multiple-choice question with the original passage and 4 paraphrased alternatives; higher selection accuracy of the original indicates memorization. This works because models exhibit measurable preference for text patterns encountered during training, persisting even when presented alongside semantically equivalent alternatives.

### Mechanism 2: Unique Passage Extraction via BM25 Scoring
Selecting passages with low intra-document similarity improves detection accuracy by minimizing false positives from common phrases. The BM25 algorithm vectorizes passages and computes similarity scores. Passages with the lowest scores (minimal similarity to other document passages) are selected, as they're more distinctive and more reliably indicate memorization if recognized.

### Mechanism 3: Preprocessing Pipeline for Data Quality and Efficiency
Filtering invalid passages and normalizing lengths reduces API token usage by up to 50% and improves reproducibility. SBERT embeddings with cosine similarity verify paraphrases retain semantic integrity. Invalid passages (NULL values, API errors, incomplete sentences) are filtered. Length normalization prevents extreme variations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Membership Inference Attacks**: Why needed here - The core approach is a form of membership inference—determining whether specific content was in training data. Understanding this technique class contextualizes why multiple-choice discrimination works and its limitations.
  - Quick check question: Why are confidence-score-based membership inference attacks unreliable for copyright detection?

- **BM25 Ranking Algorithm**: Why needed here - Used for unique passage extraction. Understanding TF-IDF principles explains why low-scoring passages are more distinctive.
  - Quick check question: Given a passage appearing frequently across many documents, would its BM25 score be high or low? Why does this matter for detection?

- **SBERT Embeddings and Cosine Similarity**: Why needed here - Core to preprocessing for validating paraphrase quality. Essential for implementing filtering logic.
  - Quick check question: If two sentences have cosine similarity of 0.95, what does this indicate? What threshold would filter bad paraphrases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Web UI → Backend (LangGraph StateGraph orchestration) → Passage Extraction (BM25 uniqueness scoring) → Paraphrase Generation (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, temp=0.7) → QA Layer (JSON-formatted question generation) → Multiple-Choice Evaluation (4 options, randomized ordering) → Statistical Analysis (ROC/AUC, hypothesis testing) → Pinecone Vector Store (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim embeddings)

- **Critical path**: User submits content → BM25 extracts unique passages → Claude generates 4 paraphrase variants per passage → Preprocessing filters invalid passages via SBERT similarity → MC questions assembled (original + 4 paraphrases) → Target LLM evaluated; ROC/AUC determines memorization likelihood → Results logged to Pinecone with metadata for duplicate detection

- **Design tradeoffs**: 4 paraphrases vs 3: Reduces random selection from ~33% to ~20%, but increases API calls per passage. Simplified randomization vs full permutation: Current approach is simpler; full permutation better eliminates selection bias. Claude for paraphrases vs open-source: Higher quality but introduces API dependency

- **Failure signatures**: High false positive rate: Unique passages may be common in general web corpora. Inconsistent results: Insufficient answer permutation or temperature too high. Token usage spike: Preprocessing letting through invalid passages. Low accuracy: Either target LLM wasn't trained on content, or paraphrase quality issues

- **First 3 experiments**: Baseline validation: Test on books confirmed in known datasets (C4/Pile) to establish true positive rate. False positive calibration: Test with original synthetic content never published to establish baseline false positive rate. Threshold tuning: Vary SBERT cosine similarity thresholds for paraphrase filtering to optimize quality-coverage balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can selective knowledge removal techniques, such as "Unlearn," be effectively implemented to erase copyrighted content from LLMs trained on standard datasets like C4 and Pile? The current paper focuses solely on the detection of copyrighted content, not the remediation or removal of the content from the model's weights.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does a dedicated full permutation function improve the mitigation of selection biases compared to the streamlined randomization strategy currently implemented? The paper proposes this enhancement to strengthen bias mitigation but reports results based on the simpler initial implementation.

### Open Question 3
Can the framework be effectively adapted and scaled across diverse AI model architectures and international regulatory frameworks? The current system is demonstrated on specific models (Claude, GPT-4o) and a specific legal premise; generalization to other architectures or different copyright laws is not demonstrated.

### Open Question 4
Does the reduction in the number of evaluated passages (enabled by increasing multiple-choice options) strictly maintain detection sensitivity across different text domains? While the theoretical reduction in Type I error is cited, the empirical impact on Type II errors (false negatives) when reducing the volume of evaluated passages is not detailed in the results.

## Limitations
- Lack of provided prompt templates and source code creates significant barriers to faithful reproduction
- Corpus-based validation is weak—no direct evidence demonstrates that BM25 uniqueness scoring or SBERT preprocessing actually improves copyright detection accuracy
- The assumed relationship between passage uniqueness and memorization indication may yield false positives if unique passages are common in broader web corpora

## Confidence

- **Medium**: The multiple-choice discrimination mechanism is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation in the corpus
- **Low**: Passage uniqueness scoring via BM25 assumes distinctive passages indicate memorization, but no validation shows this reduces false positives
- **Medium**: Preprocessing improvements (filtering, length normalization) are logical but the claimed 10-30% computational reduction is not substantiated

## Next Checks

1. **True Positive Rate Validation**: Test the system on copyrighted content confirmed to be in known training datasets (C4, Pile) and measure actual detection accuracy versus claims

2. **False Positive Rate Calibration**: Evaluate the system on original synthetic content never published to establish baseline false positive rates

3. **Ablation Study on Prompt Structure**: Test how variations in prompt templates affect paraphrase quality and MCQ selection accuracy to identify sensitivity to implementation details
