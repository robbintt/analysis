# Federated Fine-Tuning of LLMs: Framework Comparison and Research Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.04436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04436
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Comparative analysis of three federated LLM fine-tuning frameworks showing distinct trade-offs between accuracy, communication overhead, and client-side computation.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three federated learning frameworks for fine-tuning large language models: FedLLMs (direct parameter aggregation), KD-FedLLMs (knowledge distillation via logits), and Split-FedLLMs (split learning with activations). Each framework addresses the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs in resource-constrained federated settings by balancing communication and computation overhead while preserving data privacy. The analysis evaluates model accuracy, communication overhead, and client-side computational load across different configurations and datasets, providing practical guidance for selecting the appropriate framework based on primary constraints. A case study using GPT-2 and the Banking77 dataset confirms these trade-offs and identifies optimization opportunities for each approach.

## Method Summary
The paper implements and compares three federated LLM fine-tuning frameworks using GPT-2 with the Banking77 dataset. FedLLMs employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA adapters, distributing tunable parameters to clients for local training and aggregating updates via FedAvg. KD-FedLLMs uses a public dataset for knowledge distillation, where clients generate logits that are aggregated and distilled at the server before being redistributed. Split-FedLLMs partitions the model between client and server, with clients computing forward passes and servers completing backward propagation. All frameworks use 3 clients with 1667 samples each, 100 communication rounds, and results are averaged over 3 random seeds (0, 1, 42). The paper evaluates accuracy, communication overhead, and client computation across varying LoRA ranks and split points.

## Key Results
- FedLLMs achieves highest model accuracy but incurs moderate communication and computation costs due to parameter exchange.
- KD-FedLLMs offers lowest communication overhead for classification tasks but requires high client-side computation and depends on public dataset alignment.
- Split-FedLLMs minimizes client-side computation at the cost of higher communication overhead from activation transfer.
- Framework selection should be based on primary constraint: accuracy (FedLLMs), bandwidth (KD-FedLLMs), or client compute (Split-FedLLMs).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: FedLLMs - Direct Parameter Aggregation
- Claim: Direct parameter exchange enables collaborative fine-tuning while preserving data locality, achieving the highest model accuracy among the three frameworks.
- Mechanism: Server distributes global tunable parameters (e.g., LoRA weights) → clients fine-tune locally on private data → clients upload fine-tuned parameters → server aggregates via averaging → iterate until convergence.
- Core assumption: PEFT methods (LoRA, adapters) can capture task-specific knowledge in a compact parameter set that transfers effectively across clients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FedLLMs, where clients upload model parameters or gradients to enable straightforward and effective fine-tuning"
  - [Section III.A] "FedLLMs are expected to deliver the best model performance because they directly update the parameters, allowing for more accurate adaptation to the local data"
  - [corpus] Neighbor surveys (e.g., "A Survey on Federated Fine-tuning of Large Language Models") confirm FedLLM as the foundational approach for federated LLM adaptation.
- Break condition: Non-IID data distributions cause parameter divergence; heterogeneous clients with mismatched LoRA ranks break aggregation.

### Mechanism 2: KD-FedLLMs - Logit-Based Knowledge Distillation
- Claim: Knowledge distillation via logits reduces communication overhead for classification tasks but introduces accuracy-computation tradeoffs.
- Mechanism: Clients fine-tune locally → generate logits on a public dataset → upload logits to server → server aggregates and distills knowledge → global logits distributed → clients align local models via KD loss against global knowledge.
- Core assumption: A shared public dataset exists with sufficient alignment to private data distributions for meaningful knowledge transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KD-FedLLMs, which leverage KD for efficient knowledge sharing via logits"
  - [Section III.B] "KD-FedLLMs are most communication-efficient for classification tasks, where logits are relatively small, but become less efficient for generative tasks"
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence directly validating KD-FedLLM efficacy; neighbor papers focus on parameter-based FedLLM variants.
- Break condition: Public dataset poorly aligned with private data (Section IV.B); generative tasks with large vocabulary sizes cause logit dimensionality explosion.

### Mechanism 3: Split-FedLLMs - Activation-Based Computation Partitioning
- Claim: Model splitting offloads computation to the server, minimizing client-side load at the cost of higher communication overhead.
- Mechanism: Client computes forward pass through initial layers → sends activations and labels to server → server completes forward/backward on deeper layers → server returns activation gradients → client performs partial backpropagation → tunable parameters uploaded and aggregated.
- Core assumption: Intermediate activations contain sufficient information for server-side computation; activation/gradient transfer is feasible within communication budgets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Split-FedLLMs, which split the LLMs into two parts, with one part executed on the client and the other one on the server, to balance the computational load"
  - [Section II.C] "The LLMs can be split between client and server based on the design...inter-transformer splitting, where initial transformer blocks are processed by the client"
  - [corpus] "Splitlora" (arxiv 2407.00952) cited in references provides implementation foundation.
- Break condition: Communication overhead from per-sample activation transfer exceeds computational savings; split point misaligned with client resource constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: All three frameworks build on PEFT to make LLM fine-tuning tractable in federated settings by reducing trainable parameters from billions to millions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why LoRA's low-rank decomposition reduces both communication and computation compared to full fine-tuning?

- Concept: **Knowledge Distillation (Teacher-Student Learning)**
  - Why needed here: KD-FedLLMs rely on transferring knowledge via soft logits rather than parameters; understanding KD loss (KL divergence) is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between hard labels and soft logits, and why do soft logits preserve more information?

- Concept: **Split Learning and Gradient Flow**
  - Why needed here: Split-FedLLMs require understanding how backpropagation operates across a client-server boundary with activation/gradient exchanges.
  - Quick check question: How does the chain rule apply when gradients must flow from server back to client through transmitted activations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Client-side**: Frozen pre-trained LLM backbone + tunable parameters (LoRA adapters) + private dataset + framework-specific logic (logit generation for KD, forward-only for Split)
  - **Server-side**: Aggregation module (FedAvg-style) + framework-specific components (KD knowledge processor, server-side LLM layers for Split)
  - **Communication layer**: Parameter upload/download (FedLLMs), logit vectors (KD-FedLLMs), activation tensors + gradients (Split-FedLLMs)

- Critical path:
  1. Select framework based on primary constraint (accuracy → FedLLMs; bandwidth → KD-FedLLMs; client compute → Split-FedLLMs)
  2. Configure PEFT method (LoRA rank, target modules) per Section V guidelines
  3. For KD: curate aligned public dataset; for Split: determine optimal split point
  4. Execute training rounds with convergence monitoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **FedLLMs**: Highest accuracy (★★★★★), moderate communication (★★★), moderate client computation (★★★★) → prioritize when model quality is critical
  - **KD-FedLLMs**: Moderate accuracy (★★★), lowest communication for classification (★★), highest client computation (★★★★★) → prioritize for bandwidth-constrained classification tasks
  - **Split-FedLLMs**: Good accuracy (★★★★), highest communication (★★★★★), lowest client computation (★★★) → prioritize for compute-constrained clients with reliable networks

- Failure signatures:
  - FedLLMs: Accuracy plateaus under severe non-IID data; aggregation fails when clients use heterogeneous LoRA ranks
  - KD-FedLLMs: Accuracy drops when public dataset distribution diverges from private data; communication explodes for generative tasks (50K+ logit dimensions)
  - Split-FedLLMs: Training instability from activation quantization; round timeouts from per-sample activation transfer overhead

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **FedLLM baseline sweep**: Vary LoRA rank (r=4, 8, 16) on Banking77 to establish accuracy-communication Pareto frontier
  2. **KD-FedLLM alignment test**: Compare performance with public datasets of varying similarity to private data distribution
  3. **Split-FedLLM split point analysis**: Measure client computation time and communication volume across different transformer layer split points (e.g., layer 6 vs. layer 12 in GPT-2)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can tunable parameter configurations be dynamically designed to optimize the trade-off between model accuracy and resource consumption in FedLLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly ask "how to design the configuration of tunable parameters for optimization of this trade-off, ensuring high model accuracy while minimizing communication and computational overhead" in Section IV.A.1.
- Why unresolved: The optimal configuration depends on fluctuating client resources (bandwidth and compute) and the non-linear relationship between parameter count (e.g., LoRA rank) and task-specific accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithms that adjust parameters in real-time based on resource availability, demonstrating maintained accuracy with reduced communication costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the alignment between public datasets and clients' private data distributions be verified and improved to ensure effective knowledge distillation in KD-FedLLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section IV.B.1 identifies the need to "improve the alignment between public datasets and clients’ private data distributions" to mitigate irrelevant distilled knowledge.
- Why unresolved: Privacy constraints prevent direct comparison between public and private data, making it difficult to assess if the public dataset captures the necessary features of the private data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework utilizing lightweight client feedback (e.g., label statistics) to iteratively refine the public dataset, resulting in higher global model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What dynamic partitioning strategies can adaptively adjust the model split point between client and server based on heterogeneous resource availability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights "investigating dynamic partitioning strategies that adaptively adjust the split point" as a key research opportunity for Split-FedLLMs in Section IV.C.1.
- Why unresolved: Transformer architectures are monolithic, making it complex to dynamically slice layers without incurring excessive latency or synchronization issues across diverse client hardware.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanism that shifts the cut-layer based on real-time client profiling (memory/bandwidth), successfully balancing computational load without degrading convergence speed.

## Limitations

- Framework comparison relies on a single dataset (Banking77) and model (GPT-2), limiting generalizability to other domains and LLM architectures.
- KD-FedLLMs framework's efficacy lacks substantial empirical validation, with sparse corpus evidence for knowledge distillation in federated LLM settings.
- Split-FedLLMs communication overhead claims are based on theoretical analysis rather than comprehensive empirical measurement across varying conditions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of FedLLMs as a parameter aggregation approach is well-established in federated learning literature, with clear evidence from neighbor surveys and the paper's implementation details.
- **Medium Confidence**: The KD-FedLLMs mechanism has theoretical grounding in knowledge distillation literature, but practical efficacy in federated LLM settings lacks substantial empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The Split-FedLLMs framework's communication overhead claims are based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical measurement, with optimization opportunities (activation compression) untested for performance impact.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Generalizability Test**: Implement and compare all three frameworks on at least two additional datasets (e.g., one with longer sequences, one with more classes) to validate whether the observed accuracy-communication-computation trade-offs hold across different data distributions and task complexities.

2. **Communication Overhead Measurement**: For Split-FedLLMs, empirically measure per-round communication volume with varying activation sizes, model depths, and batch sizes across different network conditions (simulated latency/bandwidth) to validate the claimed overhead advantage over parameter-based approaches.

3. **Public Dataset Alignment Experiment**: Systematically vary the distribution alignment between public and private datasets in KD-FedLLMs (e.g., using domain adaptation techniques to create controlled misalignment) to empirically validate the critical assumption that public-private alignment is necessary for effective knowledge distillation.
