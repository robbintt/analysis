# Adaptive Data Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.12620
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12620
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ADEPT achieves superior performance with 30% reduced computational costs by adaptively scheduling update epochs via multi-armed bandit algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ADEPT, a framework that improves data efficiency and generalization in deep reinforcement learning by adaptively managing data utilization across learning stages using multi-armed bandit algorithms. The framework selects optimal update epochs to reduce computational overhead while mitigating overfitting. Experiments on Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet benchmarks show ADEPT achieves superior performance with significantly reduced computational costs compared to fixed update epoch approaches.

## Method Summary
ADEPT formulates the scheduling of update epochs (NUE) as a multi-armed bandit problem where the bandit dynamically selects optimal update frequencies based on task performance. The framework wraps existing on-policy RL algorithms (PPO, DrAC) and replaces fixed update schedules with bandit-driven selection from candidate NUE values {3, 2, 1}. The bandit uses estimated returns from the value network as reward signals to make scheduling decisions. The approach is evaluated on Procgen environments, MiniGrid, and PyBullet benchmarks with comparison against vanilla PPO baselines.

## Key Results
- ADEPT achieves 83.22 average return on StarPilot using only 70% of the FLOPs compared to vanilla PPO
- 30% reduction in computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance
- Enhanced generalization measured by improved Interquartile Mean (IQM) scores across test environments
- Superior performance compared to fixed update epoch schedules across all tested benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Treating NUE as discrete actions in a MAB problem enables dynamic resource allocation that outperforms fixed schedules. The framework defines candidate update frequencies and uses bandit algorithms to select specific frequencies based on historical performance. The estimated task return serves as a proxy for utility of specific update frequencies at each learning stage.

### Mechanism 2
Adaptive data utilization reduces overfitting by preserving agent plasticity. Fixed high-frequency updates can force policies to memorize training trajectories. By adaptively lowering NUE, the framework reduces gradient pressure on specific data batches, preventing fitting to spurious correlations in training levels.

### Mechanism 3
Computational overhead is reduced by minimizing unnecessary gradient computations. The update phase consumes majority of FLOPs in on-policy RL. By selecting smaller K values when performance gains are marginal, ADEPT skips forward/backward passes that would occur in fixed schedules.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Armed Bandits (UCB & Thompson Sampling)**: ADEPT relies entirely on bandit algorithms to decide update frequency. Understanding exploration-exploitation trade-off is required to tune the framework. Quick check: If exploration coefficient c=0, the bandit greedily exploits the first positive result, potentially missing the global optimum.

- **On-Policy RL & Update Epoch (PPO)**: The specific lever ADEPT pulls is the "Number of Update Epochs" (NUE). PPO re-uses data for multiple epochs to improve sample efficiency, and increasing K too much leads to policy degradation/overfitting. Quick check: Why does PPO re-use the same batch of data for multiple epochs rather than sampling fresh data every time?

- **Generalization Metrics (IQM, Median, OG)**: The paper evaluates success not just on training return, but on test-level generalization. You need to distinguish between "memorizing a level" and "learning a generalizable policy." Quick check: Why is the "Interquartile Mean" (IQM) often preferred over the "Mean" when evaluating RL agents across multiple environments or seeds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Buffer (FIFO) -> Bandit Core -> Value Estimator -> RL Optimizer -> Policy/Value networks

- **Critical path**: Sample rollouts → Compute GAE → Query Bandit with current history → Bandit selects K_t → Update Policy/Value networks for K_t epochs → Calculate actual mean return → Update Bandit statistics

- **Design tradeoffs**: ADEPT(U) [UCB] provides high variance, aggressive compression for maximum FLOP reduction. ADEPT(G) [GTS] offers more stable updates for better IQM performance. ADEPT(R) [Round-Robin] requires no value estimates but is generally outperformed.

- **Failure signatures**: Oscillating selection occurs if window size W is too small, causing erratic switching. Stuck at max/min happens if value estimates are uninformative, wasting compute or failing to learn.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run PPO+ADEPT(R) with K={1,2,3} on BigFish to verify code wraps update loop correctly. 2) Run PPO+ADEPT(U) on StarPilot, sweep exploration coefficient c ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 5.0} to observe FLOPs reduction vs performance trade-off. 3) Train on Procgen Easy mode and test on full distribution, comparing IQM of Vanilla PPO vs PPO+ADEPT(U).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework be improved to handle inaccurate value network predictions that degrade scheduling quality? The decision-making process relies on task return predicted by the value network, and inaccurate predictions directly affect scheduling quality. This dependency is noted as a remaining limitation requiring future work on robustness.

### Open Question 2
Does the assumption of Gaussian reward distributions in ADEPT(G) limit performance in environments with non-normal return profiles? The authors acknowledge that assuming normal distribution may not generalize well to all scenarios, and the efficacy of this distributional assumption was not analyzed against heavy-tailed or multi-modal reward distributions.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the oscillatory selection of update epochs contribute to value network underfitting? The paper highlights that oscillatory scheduling may lead to underfitting in the value network, potentially degrading overall performance, but does not isolate the negative effects of rapid switching versus consistent scheduling.

## Limitations
- The framework's performance heavily depends on the accuracy of value network predictions as bandit rewards, which may be unreliable in sparse reward settings
- Computational savings claims depend on bandit consistently selecting lower K values, with no analysis of worst-case scenarios where bandit gets stuck at high K
- The theoretical link between adaptive NUE scheduling and reduced overfitting to training environments remains informal despite empirical demonstration

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of bandit-based NUE selection and its basic implementation are sound and well-specified
- **Medium confidence**: The computational savings claims are reasonable given the update phase dominates FLOPs, but depend heavily on bandit exploration settings
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization improvements are supported by test results, though the causal mechanism is plausible but not rigorously proven

## Next Checks

1. Test bandit performance with artificially corrupted value estimates (add Gaussian noise) to verify robustness to inaccurate reward signals
2. Run ablation studies where bandit is forced to select only high K values to quantify the worst-case computational overhead
3. Compare learning curves with and without ADEPT on environments with varying levels of reward sparsity to identify break conditions for the value-based bandit signal
