## Executive Summary
FireScope addresses the challenge of predicting wildfire risk across continents by introducing a reasoning-to-generation framework that combines a vision-language model with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning and a vision encoder-decoder architecture. The approach leverages a novel large-scale dataset, FireScope-Bench, which pairs Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined wildfire risk rasters in the USA and real wildfire events in Europe for out-of-distribution evaluation. By training a vision-language model with reinforcement learning to produce interpretable reasoning traces and conditioning a spatial decoder through feature-wise linear modulation, FireScope achieves substantial out-of-distribution gains over strong baselines, while maintaining robust in-distribution performance.

## Method Summary
FireScope employs a two-stage sequential training approach where a vision-language model is first fine-tuned with reinforcement learning to generate chain-of-thought reasoning traces and scalar risk scores, then a lightweight vision decoder is trained to produce spatial risk rasters conditioned on the scalar output through feature-wise linear modulation layers. The system processes Sentinel-2 imagery combined with climate data, using a novel large-scale dataset that includes expert-defined risk rasters for training and real wildfire events for out-of-distribution testing.

## Key Results
- FireScope achieves substantial out-of-distribution gains over strong baselines while maintaining robust in-distribution performance
- Expert feedback and automated metrics confirm that reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful
- CoT Oracle conditioning yields best OOD ROC AUC (0.717-0.750) across all vision backbones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit chain-of-thought reasoning improves out-of-distribution generalization by steering the model toward causal, transferable features rather than spurious visual correlations.
- Mechanism: The VLM Oracle is fine-tuned with GRPO reinforcement learning to produce step-by-step reasoning traces before outputting a scalar risk score. This forces the model to articulate intermediate factors (vegetation density, climate conditions, topography) rather than directly mapping pixels to risk.
- Core assumption: The causal drivers of wildfire risk (vegetation, climate, terrain) transfer across continents, while local visual textures do not.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FireScope achieves substantial out-of-distribution gains over strong baselines, while maintaining robust in-distribution performance. Expert feedback and automated metrics confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful."
  - [Section 5.2, Table 1] CoT Oracle conditioning yields best OOD ROC AUC (0.717-0.750) across all vision backbones, with consistent gaps over non-CoT variants.
  - [corpus] Related work on spatial uncertainty quantification (arXiv:2510.09666) supports the need for uncertainty-aware reasoning in wildfire forecasting, though does not test CoT specifically.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conditioning a lightweight vision decoder through FiLM layers with a semantically-compressed scalar forces the decoder to rely on the Oracle's reasoning as a contextual prior rather than auxiliary metadata.
- Mechanism: The Oracle outputs a single 0-9 risk score. This scalar is broadcast through FiLM layers (feature-wise affine transformations) at each decoder block.
- Core assumption: A single scalar can encode sufficient task-relevant information to guide spatial prediction without introducing spurious correlations from the VLM's embedding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.2] "FiLM layers are applied before each trainable block. The decoder is trained to regress a normalized risk raster."
  - [Section 5.3, Figure 4] The Qwen+decoder ablation (attaching decoder directly to VLM embeddings) underperforms FireScope, suggesting the scalar bottleneck provides more structured conditioning than raw embeddings.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Two-stage sequential training (first Oracle, then decoder with frozen Oracle outputs) allows each module to specialize in complementary representations - reasoning vs. spatial decoding - without gradient interference.
- Mechanism: The Oracle is trained first with RL (GRPO) to maximize reward based on accuracy and format. Its outputs are then cached and used as fixed conditioning for decoder training via supervised regression.
- Core assumption: The optimal reasoning policy for scalar prediction is also optimal for guiding spatial prediction; no joint optimization is needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1] "We first fine-tune a vision-language model (VLM) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to reason about a given area and produce a scalar wildfire risk estimate."
  - [Section 5.3] Ablation shows 40× more training data for U-Net still underperforms FireScope OOD, suggesting sequential reasoning training contributes generalization beyond data scaling.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: GRPO enables RL fine-tuning of the VLM to produce variable-length CoT outputs without requiring a critic model. It estimates advantages by comparing sampled outputs within a group, reducing memory overhead vs. actor-critic methods.
  - Quick check question: Given 4 sampled outputs with rewards [0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.9], what is the advantage of the second output after group normalization?

- Concept: **Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)**
  - Why needed here: FiLM layers enable the scalar Oracle output to condition the decoder's feature maps via learned affine transformations (γ, β), allowing semantic guidance without architectural changes to the decoder.
  - Quick check question: If a FiLM layer receives conditioning scalar c=0.8 and feature map with mean μ=0.2, what affine transformation would amplify the conditioning signal?

- Concept: **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Evaluation Protocol**
  - Why needed here: FireScope-Bench is explicitly designed to test cross-continental generalization (train USA, test Europe). Understanding this protocol is critical for interpreting the claimed generalization gains.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model achieve high in-distribution MSE but poor OOD ROC AUC, and what does this indicate about the learned features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Inputs: Sentinel-2 image (1024×1024) + Climate vector (60-dim)
      ↓
  Stage 1: Oracle (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct)
      - GRPO fine-tuning with CoT reasoning
      - Output: reasoning trace + scalar risk (0-9)
      ↓
  Stage 2: Vision Encoder-Decoder (SegFormer/AlphaEarth/U-Net)
      - Encoder: frozen (except U-Net)
      - FiLM layers: modulate decoder features with scalar
      - Decoder: trained with L1 + SSIM + edge loss
      ↓
  Output: Risk raster (341×341, normalized [0,1])

- Critical path:
  1. Verify Oracle GRPO training converges (reward plateaus, CoT length stabilizes)
  2. Generate cached Oracle outputs for full training set
  3. Train decoder with FiLM conditioning; monitor ID metrics (MSE, SSIM) and OOD metrics (ROC AUC on Europe events)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Scalar bottleneck vs. richer conditioning**: Single scalar limits spatial granularity but improves interpretability; multi-dimensional conditioning could improve fidelity but reduce transparency.
  - **Frozen encoder vs. end-to-end training**: Freezing SegFormer/AlphaEarth encoders reduces overfitting but may limit adaptation to wildfire-specific features.
  - **Climate vector concatenation vs. Oracle-only conditioning**: Raw climate input improves ID performance (Table 3) but harms OOD (Table 1), suggesting overfitting to climate signatures.

- Failure signatures:
  - **CoT collapse**: Reasoning traces become repetitive or fail to mention domain factors → check token diversity and factor mentions.
  - **FiLM bypass**: Decoder ignores conditioning (ablation shows minimal difference between conditioned and unconditioned) → check γ scale and β bias magnitudes.
  - **OOD degradation without ID change**: Model overfits to USA-specific correlations → inspect error distribution by latitude/year (Figure 6).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Oracle ablation**: Train Oracle without CoT (supervised fine-tuning only) and compare OOD ROC AUC. Expected: 3-5% degradation per Table 2.
  2. **FiLM strength sweep**: Vary FiLM layer initialization scale and measure consistency metric. Target: consistency > 0.9, fidelity > 0.3.
  3. **Encoder comparison on limited data**: Train U-Net from scratch vs. frozen SegFormer on 1K subset. Expected: frozen encoder more robust to limited data; scratch U-Net benefits more from CoT conditioning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the FireScope architecture be modified to allow the Oracle to provide CoT-enhanced, spatially resolved, or multi-dimensional conditioning instead of a single scalar signal?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states the communication is bottlenecked by a scalar signal and suggests exploring token-level or region-aware embeddings for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current design uses FiLM layers conditioned on a single value, limiting the spatial granularity the reasoning module can impose on the decoder.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new architecture implementing dense conditioning (e.g., token-level cross-attention) that demonstrates improved fine-grained raster accuracy without losing OOD generalization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific linguistic or structural attributes of the generated chain-of-thought (CoT) traces contribute to the subjectivity observed in expert evaluations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion section notes a "level of subjectivity" where different experts achieved significantly different agreement scores (0.33 vs. 0.11 QWK) when interpreting the model's reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the variance in expert utility but does not isolate which features of the CoT make it useful to some experts but not others.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the correlation between specific CoT characteristics (e.g., citation of specific vegetation types vs. general climate descriptions) and expert satisfaction scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the model rely on memorizing regional climate signatures versus learning generalizable physical relationships when achieving strong in-distribution performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion highlights a tension where coarse climate data might allow models to "memorize regional climate signatures rather than learning generalizable physical relationships."
- Why unresolved: While OOD transfer is demonstrated, the internal mechanism for ID performance remains ambiguous; it is unclear if the model is truly "reasoning" or simply mapping climate zones to risk profiles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments involving in-distribution samples with synthetically swapped climate vectors to test if the model relies on geographic priors or input physics.

## Limitations

- The communication between reasoning and generation modules is bottlenecked by a scalar signal, limiting spatial granularity
- There is a level of subjectivity in expert evaluations, with different experts achieving significantly different agreement scores
- Coarse climate data might allow models to memorize regional climate signatures rather than learning generalizable physical relationships

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: In-distribution performance metrics (MSE, SSIM) and their comparison to baselines; out-of-distribution evaluation protocol design and its interpretation.
- **Medium confidence**: The causal role of CoT reasoning in OOD generalization (fidelity metric suggests partial faithfulness); the effectiveness of scalar-FiLM conditioning versus richer conditioning schemes.
- **Low confidence**: Whether CoT traces are genuinely causal versus post-hoc rationalizations; whether joint training would outperform sequential training; whether the climate vector's negative OOD effect generalizes to other climate-sensitive domains.

## Next Checks

1. **CoT faithfulness validation**: Conduct human evaluation of CoT traces for 100 test samples, scoring whether mentioned factors (vegetation, climate, terrain) actually correlate with prediction errors. Target: >70% agreement between CoT factors and actual error drivers.

2. **FiLM design ablation**: Compare FiLM conditioning against (a) direct embedding conditioning, (b) spatially-varying scalar conditioning (per-region risk), and (c) no conditioning. Measure both OOD ROC AUC and reasoning consistency/fidelity.

3. **Joint training comparison**: Implement end-to-end differentiable CoT with RL from predictions (using actor-critic methods) and compare against sequential training on OOD ROC AUC and reasoning fidelity. Expected: joint training improves consistency but may reduce OOD generalization if reasoning becomes task-specific.
