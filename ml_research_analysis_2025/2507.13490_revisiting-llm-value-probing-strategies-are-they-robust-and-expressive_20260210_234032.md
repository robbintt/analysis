# Revisiting LLM Value Probing Strategies: Are They Robust and Expressive?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.13490
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13490
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Key outcome**: Value probing methods show large variances under input perturbations, with only weak correlations to actual model action preferences

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates three popular LLM value probing strategies - token logits, sequence perplexity, and text generation - across five leading language models. The study reveals that all three methods exhibit significant instability when subjected to input perturbations like prompt style changes and selection bias, with sequence perplexity demonstrating the most stability. The research finds that larger models show greater robustness regardless of the probing method used. Most critically, the study uncovers only weak correlations (0.1-0.3) between the values extracted through these probing methods and the actual preferences exhibited by models in value-related scenarios, suggesting that current value-probing approaches provide limited insight into model behavior.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three probing methods - token logits, sequence perplexity, and text generation - across five LLMs (Llama3, GPT-4, Claude3, Gemini, Qwen2). The researchers test robustness by introducing input perturbations including prompt style variations and selection bias. For expressiveness, they use demographic prompting with 100 prompt sets to improve alignment with human values. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, they measure correlations between probed value representations and actual model action preferences in value-related scenarios. The experiments examine how model size affects robustness and compare the performance of different probing methods under identical conditions.

## Key Results
- All three value probing methods show large variances under input perturbations, with sequence perplexity demonstrating the most stability
- Larger models exhibit greater robustness to perturbations across all probing methods
- Weak correlations (0.1-0.3) exist between probed values and actual model action preferences in value-related scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind value probing methods relies on interpreting model internal representations as indicators of value preferences. Token logits capture per-token confidence scores that reflect immediate value judgments. Sequence perplexity measures overall coherence and alignment with expected value patterns. Text generation produces explicit value statements through natural language. The instability arises because these internal representations are sensitive to surface-level prompt variations rather than underlying semantic content. The weak correlation with actual behavior suggests that internal value representations may not directly translate to behavioral preferences, possibly due to contextual reasoning, goal-seeking behavior, or the models' ability to override stated values in decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- **Value Probing Methods**: Techniques for extracting internal value representations from LLMs through controlled inputs and measurements
  - Why needed: To understand what values models internalize during training and how they might behave in real-world applications
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between token logits, sequence perplexity, and text generation approaches?

- **Input Perturbations**: Systematic variations in prompts to test stability of value representations
  - Why needed: To assess whether value probes are reliable across different contexts and presentation styles
  - Quick check: How would you design a prompt style perturbation experiment?

- **Model Size Effects**: Relationship between model parameter count and robustness of value representations
  - Why needed: To understand how model scale influences the reliability of value extraction methods
  - Quick check: What hypothesis would you test about model size and probing stability?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Prompts -> Value Probing Method (Logits/Perplexity/Generation) -> Value Representation -> Action Preference Validation

**Critical Path**: Prompt Generation -> Value Extraction -> Correlation Analysis -> Behavior Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Token logits offer fine-grained analysis but high variance
- Sequence perplexity provides stability but less interpretability
- Text generation enables natural language responses but shows weakest improvement from demographic prompting

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Large variances in value representations across similar prompts
- Weak correlations between probed values and actual model behaviors
- Inconsistent improvements from demographic prompting across methods

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Compare stability of value representations across three probing methods using identical prompt perturbations
2. Test robustness differences between small and large models for each probing method
3. Measure improvement in value alignment using demographic prompts across all methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited diversity in the five tested LLMs, potentially missing important architectural variations
- Relatively narrow range of demographic prompts (100 sets) that may not capture full value diversity
- Subjective human judgment in defining and scoring value-related scenarios
- Focus on prompt-level perturbations without exploring other sources of variance like temperature or context length

## Confidence
**High Confidence (★★★)**:
- Method stability differences are well-supported by extensive experimentation
- Larger models showing greater robustness is consistently demonstrated
- Weak correlation between probed values and action preferences is robustly demonstrated

**Medium Confidence (★★)**:
- Relative effectiveness of demographic prompting may vary with different prompt sets
- Ranking of perturbation impact may not generalize to all perturbation types
- Generalizability to other probing objectives beyond values

**Low Confidence (★)**:
- Predictions about future larger models
- Applicability to specialized or domain-specific models
- Long-term stability across model updates

## Next Checks
1. Replicate robustness experiments using 500+ diverse demographic prompts covering additional cultural dimensions and languages
2. Conduct cross-model correlation analysis between different probing methods to quantify overlapping versus distinct value aspects
3. Extend action preference validation to real-world deployment scenarios and expert human evaluations to assess practical relevance of weak correlations
