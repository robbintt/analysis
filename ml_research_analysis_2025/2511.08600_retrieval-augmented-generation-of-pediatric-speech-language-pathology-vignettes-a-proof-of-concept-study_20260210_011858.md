# Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08600
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600
- Authors: Yilan Liu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RAG-based system achieves 100% structural completeness for pediatric SLP vignettes, with commercial models scoring 4.39-4.50 and open-source models 4.18-4.25 on automated quality rubric.

## Executive Summary
This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the technical feasibility of using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with engineered prompts to generate school-based speech-language pathology (SLP) vignettes. A multi-model system was developed integrating curated domain knowledge with prompt templates, supporting five commercial and open-source LLMs. Across 35 validation cases spanning seven disorder types and grade levels, the system achieved 100% structural completeness with marginal quality differences between commercial (4.39-4.50) and open-source models (4.18-4.25). Integration of authoritative clinical guidelines enabled generation of content aligned with professional standards. The study establishes proof-of-concept for scalable, privacy-preserving generation of SLP simulation materials, though extensive expert validation remains necessary before educational or research implementation.

## Method Summary
The study employed a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline integrating curated clinical knowledge with engineered prompts. The knowledge base consisted of 44 PDFs (ASHA guidelines, developmental research, IEP exemplars) processed into 3,233 chunks (1,200 characters each with 200-character overlap) and embedded using text-embedding-3-small into ChromaDB. Seven validation scenarios spanning six disorder categories and grades Pre-K-10th were used to test the system. A dual-prompt architecture was implemented: a comprehensive 493-line prompt for commercial models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) and a focused 281-line version for open-source models (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B). The system used temperature=0.7 and k=10 chunk retrieval via cosine similarity. Automated quality scoring evaluated completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP/note quality across four dimensions.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% structural completeness across 35 validation cases
- Commercial models showed marginally higher quality scores (4.39-4.50) compared to open-source models (4.18-4.25)
- All generated cases included required components: demographics, background information, assessment results, measurable annual IEP goals formatted according to SMART criteria, and session notes
- Automated scoring demonstrated acceptable quality with scores ranging from 4.18 to 4.50 across different model types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Grounding via Semantic Retrieval
- Claim: Retrieving authoritative domain documents at generation time reduces hallucinations and enables clinically appropriate outputs without model fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: User queries (disorder type + grade level) are embedded and matched against pre-indexed knowledge chunks using cosine similarity. The top k=10 chunks are injected into the prompt context, providing the LLM with ASHA guidelines, developmental norms, and IEP exemplars it lacked during pre-training. This anchors generation in verified sources rather than parametric memory alone.
- Core assumption: The knowledge base contains sufficiently comprehensive and relevant information for the target disorder-grade combinations; retrieval similarity translates to clinical relevance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials"
  - [section]: "RAG reduces hallucinations by anchoring generation in verified documents rather than parametric knowledge alone (Y. Liu et al., 2025)"
  - [corpus]: Related corpus papers show RAG effectiveness in clinical decision support and medical QA, though no direct SLP-specific RAG validation exists (Amugongo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025)
- Break condition: Retrieval returns tangentially related but clinically insufficient chunks; rare disorder presentations or complex co-morbidities exceed knowledge base coverage; query formulation fails to capture nuance.

### Mechanism 2: Expert Knowledge Encoding via Structured Prompts
- Claim: Encoding clinical expertise into reusable prompt templates eliminates the need for end-users to possess dual clinical-technical skills, ensuring consistent output structure and quality.
- Mechanism: Prompts operationalize SMART goal criteria, assessment selection rules, developmental appropriateness constraints, and documentation standards into explicit instructions. The premium prompt (493 lines) specifies exact JSON schema, measurable criteria formats, session note structure, and evidence-based intervention references—replacing ad hoc user prompting with systematic expert-validated templates.
- Core assumption: Clinical judgment can be sufficiently captured in structured instructions; prompt complexity aligns with model instruction-following capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompts...100% structural completeness across 35 validation cases"
  - [section]: "Generated cases consistently included all required components: demographics...assessment results...measurable annual IEP goals formatted according to SMART criteria"
  - [corpus]: Sahoo et al. (2024) survey demonstrates prompt engineering improves consistency; Wang et al. (2024) shows significant gains in reliability through structured prompting
- Break condition: Edge cases requiring clinical judgment beyond rule-based encoding; cultural-linguistic variations not anticipated in template design; model ignores constraints despite explicit instructions.

### Mechanism 3: Model-Calibrated Prompt Complexity
- Claim: Simplifying prompt structure for smaller open-source models prevents instruction-following failures while maintaining core clinical validity.
- Mechanism: The dual-prompt architecture emerged from empirical observation: smaller models (3-7B parameters) produced incomplete JSON with missing required fields when given the comprehensive 493-line prompt. The focused 281-line version uses direct imperative instructions, reduced verbosity, and condensed formatting specifications—matching cognitive load to model capacity while preserving essential constraints (SMART goals, quantitative data requirements).
- Core assumption: Simpler prompts can maintain acceptable clinical quality for resource-constrained models; quality degradation from simplification remains within acceptable bounds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Commercial models showed marginally higher quality advantages (4.39-4.50 vs. 4.18-4.25), but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance"
  - [section]: "Initial testing with unified comprehensive prompt revealed that smaller open-source models (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) struggled with extended multi-step instructions, producing incomplete JSON structures"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for model-specific prompt adaptation; this represents an empirical finding from system development
- Break condition: Complex multi-disorder cases require nuanced reasoning only captured in comprehensive prompts; quality gap widens significantly for clinical appropriateness beyond structural completeness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Embeddings and Semantic Similarity**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how text-embedding-3-small creates 1,536-dimensional representations enables debugging retrieval quality. If retrieved chunks seem irrelevant, the issue may be embedding-model mismatch or query formulation.
  - Quick check question: Given a query for "2nd grade articulation disorder," what would cause retrieval to return fluency-related chunks instead?

- **Concept: Chunk Size and Overlap Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: The 1,200-character chunks with 200-character overlap balance semantic coherence (larger chunks preserve context) against retrieval precision (smaller chunks enable finer-grained matching). Understanding this helps diagnose why specific information may be missed or diluted.
  - Quick check question: If assessment instrument specifications span 800 characters but are split across chunk boundaries, how does overlap help? What retrieval problems might persist?

- **Concept: JSON Schema Enforcement via Prompts**
  - Why needed here: The system relies on prompts (not code-level validation) to enforce output structure. Understanding prompt-based schema constraints explains why open-source models needed simplified prompts and where structural failures might occur.
  - Quick check question: Why does the prompt specify "Return only valid JSON. Do not include explanatory text before or after the JSON"? What failure mode does this prevent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Knowledge Base Layer: 44 PDFs (ASHA guidelines, developmental research, IEP exemplars) → LangChain PyPDFLoader → RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (1,200/200) → 3,233 chunks
  - Vector Store: ChromaDB storing text-embedding-3-small vectors (1,536-dim) with metadata (source type, collection, file ID)
  - Orchestrator: Python backend coordinating query embedding → ChromaDB retrieval (k=10, cosine similarity) → prompt template population → model API call → JSON parsing/validation
  - Model Interface: Unified API for commercial (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and local (Ollama: Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B)
  - Output Layer: JSON → Excel conversion via pandas; Gradio UI with tabbed navigation

- **Critical path:**
  1. User input: disorder type + grade level (+ optional population specs)
  2. Query construction: structured query embedding via text-embedding-3-small
  3. Retrieval: ChromaDB returns k=10 chunks ranked by cosine similarity
  4. Prompt assembly: retrieved context + user params → template population (premium vs. free based on model selection)
  5. Generation: LLM inference at temperature=0.7
  6. Output processing: JSON validation → Excel/PDF formatting → UI display

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Dual-prompt maintenance: Higher engineering overhead vs. single unified template; justified by empirical observation of open-source model failures with complex prompts
  - k=10 retrieval: More context improves clinical grounding but increases prompt length and token costs; smaller k risks missing critical information
  - Temperature 0.7: Balances case diversity (higher temp) against consistency/measurability (lower temp); clinical documentation favors consistency
  - Automated vs. expert evaluation: Computational scoring enables rapid iteration but cannot detect subtle clinical errors; paper explicitly flags this limitation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Missing JSON fields: Indicates prompt complexity exceeds model instruction-following capacity; solution is simplified prompt or larger model
  - Low internal consistency scores (3.08-3.66): Background information, assessment results, and goals don't align; may indicate retrieval returned generic rather than disorder-specific guidance
  - Assessment-instrument mismatch: Generated case uses GFTA-3 (articulation test) for pragmatic disorder assessment; indicates knowledge base gaps or retrieval failure for disorder-specific instruments
  - Session notes lack goal references: 66% of cases showed this formatting issue; prompt refinement needed for explicit goal-numbering requirements

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Retrieval quality baseline: Generate 10 cases per disorder type with k=10, manually inspect retrieved chunks for relevance. Identify which disorder types have weakest retrieval and whether chunk content or query formulation is the bottleneck.
  2. Model-prompt interaction: Run identical 7 scenarios with both prompt versions on all 5 models. Quantify structural failure rates and quality score differences to validate dual-prompt necessity.
  3. Expert validation pilot: Have 2-3 school-based SLPs rate 10 generated cases (5 commercial, 5 open-source) on clinical realism, developmental appropriateness, and documentation quality. Compare expert ratings to automated scores to identify systematic blind spots in computational evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do RAG-generated pediatric SLP vignettes achieve clinical accuracy and cultural appropriateness comparable to human-authored cases when evaluated by expert speech-language pathologists?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation."
- Why unresolved: Only automated computational evaluation was conducted; no expert SLP review assessed clinical realism, developmental appropriateness, or cultural sensitivity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Multi-rater expert review studies with established inter-rater reliability protocols, comparing AI-generated and human-authored vignettes across clinical accuracy dimensions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does practice with RAG-generated SLP cases improve student clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and goal-writing skills compared to traditional case-based instruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Randomized controlled trials comparing learning outcomes between students practicing with AI-generated versus traditional cases would provide critical evidence about educational effectiveness."
- Why unresolved: No student pilot testing or educational outcome measurement was conducted; educational effectiveness cannot be assumed from technical performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: RCTs measuring pre/post differences in clinical reasoning assessments, diagnostic accuracy, and IEP goal quality between student groups using AI-generated versus traditional cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can disorder-specific assessment selection be reliably automated to prevent inappropriate instrument choices for complex or co-occurring disorder presentations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Clinical analysis identified "assessment mismatch" where the system selected GFTA-3 (articulation test) for a pragmatic disorder case, indicating "an area for system refinement."
- Why unresolved: Current knowledge retrieval may surface assessments semantically related to disorder categories without verifying appropriateness for specific diagnostic purposes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of assessment selection accuracy across all 11 disorder types with expert verification of instrument-disorder appropriateness.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What mechanisms can improve internal consistency for multi-domain language disorder cases where current models show degraded performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "Language disorders, particularly those involving multiple domains, consistently yielded lower consistency scores across both model categories, likely reflecting the inherent complexity of coordinating syntax, morphology, semantics, and phonology within cohesive goal structures."
- Why unresolved: Multi-constraint optimization for coordinating several clinical domains simultaneously remains technically challenging; prompt engineering and RAG retrieval strategies have not addressed this systematically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies testing multi-agent architectures, hierarchical prompting strategies, or domain-specific consistency checking on mixed expressive-receptive language cases.

## Limitations

- Clinical validity remains unproven: Only automated scoring was conducted; no expert clinician review confirmed clinical accuracy or educational appropriateness.
- Knowledge base coverage limits: 44-document corpus may not capture rare disorders, cultural-linguistic variations, or complex co-morbid presentations.
- Educational effectiveness unknown: No student testing or learning outcome measurement was performed to validate pedagogical utility.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Technical feasibility of RAG-based generation system; 100% structural completeness; quality score differentials between commercial and open-source models are reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that RAG reduces hallucinations compared to parametric knowledge; clinical appropriateness of generated content as measured by automated rubric.
- **Low confidence**: Educational effectiveness of generated vignettes; safety for unsupervised use in clinical training; scalability to diverse SLP contexts beyond tested scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Expert clinician review**: Have 3-5 practicing school-based SLPs independently rate 20 generated vignettes (10 commercial, 10 open-source) on clinical realism, developmental appropriateness, and documentation quality. Compare expert scores to automated metrics to identify systematic blind spots.
2. **Rare disorder testing**: Generate cases for low-incidence conditions (e.g., selective mutism, childhood apraxia of speech) to evaluate knowledge base coverage limits and retrieval effectiveness for less-represented disorder types.
3. **Educational impact pilot**: Implement generated vignettes in a controlled SLP student training session (n=15-20 students). Measure learning outcomes, perceived realism, and student confidence compared to traditional case-based instruction.
