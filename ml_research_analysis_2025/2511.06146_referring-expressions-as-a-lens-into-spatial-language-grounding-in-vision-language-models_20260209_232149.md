# Referring Expressions as a Lens into Spatial Language Grounding in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.06146
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06146
- **Authors**: Akshar Tumu; Varad Shinde; Parisa Kordjamshidi
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Primary result**: VLMs struggle with complex spatial relations in referring expression comprehension, with task-specific models outperforming general VLMs on compositional spatial reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates spatial reasoning capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). The authors evaluate five prominent models—MGA-Net, Grounding DINO, LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL2, and Qwen2.5-VL—on a dataset containing complex referring expressions with spatial relations. The study reveals significant performance gaps when models encounter expressions with multiple spatial relations, directional constraints, and negations, highlighting fundamental limitations in current VLM architectures for spatial language grounding.

The research demonstrates that task-specific models designed for REC tasks outperform general-purpose VLMs in handling compositional spatial reasoning, suggesting that architectural specialization remains important for complex spatial understanding. These findings provide crucial insights into the current state of spatial reasoning in VLMs and identify specific areas where architectural improvements are needed to enhance real-world applicability of vision-language systems.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of five vision-language models on a referring expression comprehension task using a dataset specifically designed with complex spatial relations. The evaluation protocol involves testing models' ability to ground referring expressions that contain various types of spatial information, including proximity relations, geometric relations, and directional relations. Performance is measured by grounding accuracy, with particular attention paid to how models handle increasing spatial complexity in expressions. The study compares general-purpose VLMs against task-specific models to identify architectural advantages for spatial reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- VLMs show significant performance degradation when processing referring expressions with multiple spatial relations, directional relations, and negations
- Task-specific REC models like MGA-Net outperform general VLMs due to explicit compositional learning mechanisms for spatial reasoning
- Spatial relations improve grounding accuracy over attribute-only expressions, but performance drops sharply as spatial complexity increases
- VLMs demonstrate better handling of ambiguous proximity relations compared to precise geometric relations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The observed performance patterns reflect fundamental architectural differences between task-specific and general VLMs. Task-specific models incorporate explicit compositional mechanisms that break down complex spatial expressions into manageable components, enabling systematic reasoning about spatial relationships. General VLMs, while proficient at pattern matching and surface-level understanding, lack the structured approach needed for compositional spatial reasoning. The superior performance on proximity relations suggests that models rely more on learned statistical associations for vague spatial concepts rather than geometric computation, while directional and negated relations require more precise spatial reasoning capabilities that current architectures struggle to provide.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatial Relation Types**: Understanding different categories of spatial relations (proximity, geometric, directional) is crucial for analyzing model performance patterns. Quick check: Can you categorize a given spatial relation into these types?
- **Compositional Reasoning**: The ability to break down and sequentially process multiple spatial constraints is fundamental to complex spatial understanding. Quick check: Can you parse a multi-relation expression into sequential reasoning steps?
- **Grounding Accuracy Metrics**: Familiarity with evaluation metrics for referring expression comprehension helps interpret performance differences. Quick check: Can you calculate accuracy given ground truth and predicted bounding boxes?
- **Model Architecture Differences**: Understanding the distinction between task-specific and general VLMs is key to interpreting performance gaps. Quick check: Can you identify whether a given model is task-specific or general-purpose based on its design?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Image + Text -> Visual Encoder -> Language Encoder -> Fusion Module -> Spatial Reasoning Module -> Output Bounding Box

Critical path: Visual features extraction → Cross-modal fusion → Spatial relation parsing → Bounding box prediction

Design tradeoffs: General VLMs prioritize broad capability over specialized spatial reasoning, while task-specific models sacrifice versatility for improved compositional spatial understanding. This creates a performance gap on complex spatial tasks that require systematic reasoning about multiple constraints.

Failure signatures: Models typically fail by either misidentifying objects (visual grounding failure) or misinterpreting spatial relations (language understanding failure). Multi-relation expressions often trigger cascading errors where early misinterpretation propagates through subsequent reasoning steps.

First experiments:
1. Test single-relation expressions to establish baseline performance before evaluating multi-relation complexity
2. Evaluate models on negated spatial relations to assess logical reasoning capabilities
3. Compare proximity vs geometric relation performance within the same model to identify spatial reasoning preferences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The evaluation is based on a single dataset, which may not capture the full diversity of spatial language patterns in real-world applications
- The five evaluated models represent a specific snapshot of VLM capabilities, potentially missing architectural innovations that could address identified limitations
- Binary success/failure metrics may oversimplify the nuanced nature of spatial reasoning failures and their underlying causes

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Models struggle with multiple spatial relations, directional relations, and negations
- Task-specific models outperform VLMs on compositional spatial reasoning

Medium confidence:
- VLMs perform better on proximity relations than geometric relations
- Spatial relations improve grounding accuracy over attributes alone
- Performance drops significantly with increased spatial complexity

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the same models on multiple REC datasets with varying spatial complexity to assess whether performance patterns hold across different data distributions and annotation styles.

2. **Ablation studies**: Systematically remove spatial relations from expressions to quantify their specific contribution to grounding accuracy, controlling for other linguistic features like attribute descriptions.

3. **Error pattern analysis**: Conduct detailed qualitative analysis of failure cases to distinguish between spatial reasoning errors, visual grounding failures, and language understanding issues, potentially revealing different intervention points for model improvement.
