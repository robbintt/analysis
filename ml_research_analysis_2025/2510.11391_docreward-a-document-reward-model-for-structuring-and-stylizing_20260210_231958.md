# DocReward: A Document Reward Model for Structuring and Stylizing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.11391
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11391
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DOCREWARD outperforms GPT-4 by 14.6 percentage points in human preference accuracy and achieves 60.8% win rate in document generation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DOCREWARD, a document reward model designed to evaluate structural and stylistic professionalism in documents. The model operates through a textual-quality-agnostic framework trained on a large dataset of document pairs, allowing it to assess layout and formatting independently of textual content. DOCREWARD demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, including a 14.6 percentage point advantage over GPT-4 in human preference accuracy and a 60.8% win rate in document generation tasks. The model effectively guides document generation agents to produce documents with superior structure and style while maintaining robustness across different domains and languages.

## Method Summary
DOCREWARD employs a textual-quality-agnostic framework that separates structural and stylistic evaluation from textual content assessment. The model is trained on a large dataset of document pairs, learning to identify and reward professional document layouts and formatting independently of the underlying text. This approach enables the model to focus specifically on visual and organizational elements of documents, making it particularly effective for guiding document generation systems toward more polished outputs. The training methodology emphasizes the independence of structural evaluation from textual quality, allowing for more precise optimization of document presentation aspects.

## Key Results
- Outperforms GPT-4 by 14.6 percentage points in human preference accuracy
- Achieves 60.8% win rate in document generation tasks compared to baseline models
- Demonstrates effectiveness in guiding document generation agents to produce better-structured and styled documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The textual-quality-agnostic framework allows DOCREWARD to focus exclusively on structural and stylistic elements without being influenced by textual content quality. This separation enables more precise evaluation of document layout, formatting, and organization. By training on document pairs rather than absolute quality scores, the model learns to distinguish subtle differences in professionalism between similar documents, making it more sensitive to improvements in document structure and style.

## Foundational Learning
- **Document structure evaluation**: Understanding how to assess layout and organization independently of content - needed to create a model focused on visual elements; quick check: test on documents with identical text but different layouts
- **Textual-quality-agnostic training**: Separating structural evaluation from textual content assessment - needed to ensure the model focuses on formatting rather than content quality; quick check: evaluate performance on documents with varying text quality
- **Document pair learning**: Training on relative comparisons rather than absolute scores - needed to capture subtle differences in professionalism; quick check: test ability to rank similar document variants
- **Cross-domain robustness**: Ensuring consistent performance across different document types - needed for practical applicability; quick check: evaluate on academic, business, and technical documents
- **Human preference alignment**: Measuring success through human evaluation rather than automated metrics - needed to ensure practical relevance; quick check: conduct A/B testing with human users
- **Reward modeling**: Using reinforcement learning principles for document generation guidance - needed to provide actionable feedback to generation systems; quick check: measure impact on generation quality over time

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Input -> Structural Analysis Module -> Stylistic Evaluation Module -> Reward Score Output -> Generation Agent Feedback

**Critical Path**: Document input flows through structural analysis to identify layout patterns, then through stylistic evaluation to assess formatting quality, culminating in a reward score that guides document generation agents.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model prioritizes structural evaluation independence over comprehensive textual analysis, trading some contextual understanding for focused layout assessment. This design choice enables more precise optimization of document presentation but may miss content-context interactions.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may struggle with highly specialized document formats where standard structural patterns don't apply, or when textual content quality directly impacts perceived document professionalism. Performance degradation may occur when evaluating documents that intentionally break conventional formatting rules for creative or domain-specific purposes.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate DOCREWARD on document pairs with identical text but varying layouts to test structural evaluation independence
2. Test the model's ability to rank document quality when textual content varies significantly
3. Assess cross-domain performance by evaluating documents from academic, business, and technical domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, though several areas for future research are implied by the limitations section and the focus on structural evaluation.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on human preference studies and controlled generation tasks, potentially limiting real-world applicability
- Claims of "textual-quality-agnostic" assessment need further validation with documents containing varying degrees of textual sophistication
- Performance across different document types (technical papers, business reports, legal documents) and cultural contexts remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The model's ability to outperform GPT-4 in controlled evaluation settings and human preference studies
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about domain and language robustness, given limited evaluation scope
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to real-world document generation workflows and diverse document types

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DOCREWARD on a diverse benchmark of real-world documents from multiple domains (academic, legal, business, technical) to assess cross-domain performance
2. Test the model's sensitivity to different levels of textual quality while maintaining structural evaluation consistency
3. Conduct A/B testing with actual document generation systems to measure impact on end-user satisfaction and productivity in practical workflows
