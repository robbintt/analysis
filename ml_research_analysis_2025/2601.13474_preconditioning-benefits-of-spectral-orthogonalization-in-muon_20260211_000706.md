# Preconditioning Benefits of Spectral Orthogonalization in Muon

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13474
- Reference count: 40
- Muon is a matrix-structured optimizer using spectral orthogonalization that achieves condition-number-free convergence for symmetric matrix factorization and linear transformer ICL

## Executive Summary
This paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis of Muon, a matrix-structured optimizer that uses spectral orthogonalization of gradients, which has shown strong empirical performance in large language model pretraining. The authors prove that a simplified version of Muon achieves linear convergence with iteration complexities independent of condition numbers for symmetric matrix factorization and in-context learning of linear transformers. The key insight is that Muon's dynamics decouple into independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. This work formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization and offers theoretical justification for Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems.

## Method Summary
Muon is a matrix-structured optimizer that applies spectral orthogonalization to gradients, transforming the optimization problem into a decoupled set of scalar problems in the spectral domain. The algorithm first computes the spectral decomposition of the gradient matrix, then updates each eigenvalue independently using a simple scalar update rule. This approach effectively preconditions the optimization landscape by removing correlations between different spectral components. The theoretical analysis focuses on a simplified version of Muon that captures the essential preconditioning mechanism while being amenable to rigorous mathematical treatment. The convergence analysis leverages the fact that after spectral orthogonalization, the dynamics decouple into independent scalar sequences, each converging at a rate that does not depend on the condition number of the original problem.

## Key Results
- Muon achieves linear convergence for symmetric matrix factorization with iteration complexity independent of condition number
- The convergence rate analysis reveals that Muon's dynamics decouple into independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain
- Muon provably outperforms both gradient descent and Adam in terms of condition-number dependence for the studied matrix problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Muon's preconditioning effect stems from spectral orthogonalization, which transforms the matrix optimization problem into a set of decoupled scalar problems. When gradients are spectrally orthogonalized, each eigenvalue component evolves independently according to a simple scalar dynamics. This decoupling removes the ill-conditioning that typically arises from correlations between different spectral modes in matrix optimization problems. The resulting scalar dynamics for each spectral component exhibit convergence behavior that is independent of the original problem's condition number, as the preconditioning effectively equalizes the curvature across all spectral directions. This mechanism explains why Muon can achieve faster convergence than classical optimizers that operate directly on the original ill-conditioned landscape.

## Foundational Learning

**Spectral decomposition**: Decomposing a matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors to analyze and manipulate its structure; needed to understand how Muon transforms the optimization landscape, quick check: verify that X = UΛU^T for symmetric X.

**Condition number**: Ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue magnitude; characterizes ill-conditioning of optimization problems, quick check: compute κ = λ_max/λ_min for test matrices.

**Orthogonalization**: Process of making vectors or subspaces mutually perpendicular; central to Muon's preconditioning mechanism, quick check: verify U^T U = I for orthogonal matrices.

**Matrix factorization**: Optimization problem of decomposing a matrix into product of simpler matrices; the primary application studied, quick check: test convergence on synthetic factorization tasks.

**In-context learning**: Ability of models to perform tasks based on provided examples without parameter updates; relevant for linear transformer analysis, quick check: implement linear attention mechanism.

**Gradient Lipschitz continuity**: Property ensuring gradients don't change too rapidly; relevant for extending analysis to general neural networks, quick check: verify ∇²f ≤ L I for smooth objectives.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Gradient computation -> Spectral decomposition -> Orthogonalization -> Scalar updates -> Recomposition

Critical path: The core computational bottleneck is the spectral decomposition step, which requires O(n³) operations for n×n matrices. This dominates the runtime and limits scalability to very large matrices.

Design tradeoffs: Muon trades computational complexity in the spectral decomposition step for improved convergence rates. The algorithm requires full gradient information and exact spectral decomposition, which may be impractical for very large-scale problems or noisy gradient settings.

Failure signatures: Muon may fail when matrices have very close or repeated eigenvalues, as the spectral decomposition becomes numerically unstable. The algorithm also assumes access to exact gradients and perfect spectral decomposition, which may not hold in stochastic optimization settings.

First experiments:
1. Compare Muon's convergence on symmetric matrix factorization against gradient descent and Adam with varying condition numbers
2. Test Muon's performance on non-symmetric matrix factorization to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate the impact of approximate spectral decomposition (using truncated SVD) on convergence rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does Muon achieve condition-number-free convergence for matrix linear regression (minimize_W ||WX - Y||_F^2), and if so, under what conditions?
The paper only analyzes symmetric matrix factorization and linear transformer ICL; matrix regression has different geometric structure.

### Open Question 2
Can Muon's convergence guarantees be extended to less restrictive initialization conditions beyond small random initialization?
Current proofs rely on initialization being sufficiently small (α small) to ensure subspace alignment; the mechanism allowing convergence from larger initializations is not understood.

### Open Question 3
Can a unified theoretical framework explain Muon's preconditioning effects under general gradient Lipschitz conditions for neural network training?
Existing analyses rely on idealized models, impose per-iteration conditions whose validity is unverified, or fail to explain empirical advantages over classical optimizers.

### Open Question 4
Can the heuristic connection between Muon's and ScaledGD's preconditioners be rigorously formalized?
The paper shows both methods use non-diagonal preconditioners and achieve condition-number-free convergence, but only provides heuristic arguments about when their preconditioners approximately coincide.

## Limitations

The theoretical analysis is limited to two specific matrix optimization problems (symmetric matrix factorization and in-context learning of linear transformers), which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to other optimization settings.

The analysis assumes access to full gradient information and perfect spectral decomposition, which may not be practical in real-world applications where gradients are noisy and expensive to compute.

The analysis focuses on a simplified version of Muon that may not capture all aspects of the practical implementation used in large language model pretraining.

## Confidence

High: The theoretical convergence rates and iteration complexities derived for the simplified Muon algorithm on the studied matrix problems are mathematically rigorous and well-supported by the proofs.

Medium: The claim that Muon's performance is independent of condition numbers is supported by the theoretical analysis for the specific problems studied, but requires further validation on more diverse optimization problems.

Low: The claim that these theoretical insights directly explain Muon's effectiveness in large language model pretraining is largely speculative, as the analysis does not directly address the complexities of deep learning optimization.

## Next Checks

1. Extend the theoretical analysis to non-symmetric matrix factorization problems to test the generality of the preconditioning benefits observed in the symmetric case.

2. Conduct empirical comparisons of Muon against gradient descent and Adam on the same matrix optimization problems studied theoretically to verify the claimed performance improvements.

3. Analyze the impact of gradient noise and approximate spectral decomposition on the convergence rates to bridge the gap between the theoretical model and practical implementation.
