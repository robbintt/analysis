# Contrastive Learning for Correlating Network Incidents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.24446
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24446
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** Contrastive learning significantly outperforms L2 baseline for network incident correlation (MAP 0.908 vs 0.533)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach for correlating network incidents based on similarities in network monitoring data. The method, called Contrastive Learning for Situation Retrieval (CLSR), trains a deep neural network to produce embeddings that reflect similarity between network situations. The model is trained using contrastive learning on a large unlabeled dataset of network situations, learning to embed similar situations close together in vector space. When given a reference network situation (query), CLSR retrieves the most similar past incidents using vector search with cosine similarity. Evaluation on real-world WLAN access point data shows CLSR significantly outperforms a baseline L2 distance retriever, achieving a mean average precision (MAP) of 0.908 compared to 0.533 for the baseline, and perfect precision at rank 1. The results suggest that contrastive learning is a promising approach for reliable network incident correlation, enabling operators to find similar past incidents without manual template definition or labeled data requirements.

## Method Summary
The method uses a 1D CNN architecture to embed network time series into a 128-dimensional space. The model is trained with contrastive learning using NT-Xent loss, where positive pairs are created through odd-even splitting of time series windows. During inference, cosine similarity search retrieves the most similar past incidents. The approach requires no manual template definition or labeled data, relying instead on self-supervised pair generation and contrastive learning to learn meaningful embeddings.

## Key Results
- CLSR achieves MAP of 0.908 versus baseline L2 retriever at 0.533
- Perfect precision@1 indicates the most similar incident is always retrieved first
- Data augmentations improve some incident classes but create trade-offs for others
- Temperature parameter τ affects performance, with no universally optimal value

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised pair generation through temporal splitting creates viable training signal without manual labels.
- Mechanism: Odd-even splitting transforms a single 2T-length sequence into two T-length sequences (odd-indexed vs even-indexed samples). These pairs are structurally similar but not identical, providing the positive pairs needed for contrastive learning.
- Core assumption: Temporal proximity and interleaved sampling from the same source produces meaningfully similar network situations that the model should learn to recognize as related.
- Evidence anchors: [section] Section 4.1 explicitly describes odd-even splitting: "A pair of similar network situations X, X' can be obtained by stacking the odd-indexed vectors and the even-indexed vectors into two matrices." [abstract] References "self-supervised learning method" trained on "large unlabeled dataset."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive loss shapes embedding space such that cosine similarity reflects structural rather than raw-value similarity.
- Mechanism: The normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent) pushes embeddings of positive pairs together while pushing all other batch samples apart. Temperature τ controls the concentration of the distribution. Through this, the model learns representations invariant to the augmentations applied during training.
- Core assumption: The similarity relationship defined by the pair generation and augmentation strategy captures operationally meaningful similarity for network troubleshooting.
- Evidence anchors: [section] Equation (1) in Section 4.2 defines the loss: "ℓi,j = −log exp(cos_sim(zi,zj)/τ) / Σ exp(cos_sim(zi,zk)/τ)" [section] Section 4.2 states the model is trained such that "similar situations have vector representations close to each other in the embedding space."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentations encode invariance preferences, trading off retrieval accuracy across different incident classes.
- Mechanism: Optional transformations (cyclic shift, vertical shift, scaling) force the model to ignore specific variations. This makes the model robust to those variations but may reduce discriminability where those variations are actually meaningful signals.
- Core assumption: The augmentations applied reflect nuisance variations operators want to ignore, not signal variations they want to distinguish.
- Evidence anchors: [section] Section 4.1 states: "they increase precision for some queries while reducing it for others. Therefore, they can be used deliberately to steer similarity detection." [section] Section 5.4 notes CLSR-10-scale outperforms vanilla on "Single disassociation" but "no single augmentation method consistently outperforms all others."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contrastive learning and NT-Xent loss**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how positive/negative pairs and temperature scaling shape the embedding space is essential for diagnosing retrieval failures and tuning hyperparameters.
  - Quick check question: Given a batch of 256 samples, can you explain why increasing temperature τ makes the loss more "uniform" vs. more "focused" on hard negatives?

- Concept: **Time series representation for neural networks**
  - Why needed here: The model uses 1D convolutions over T timesteps with C features. Understanding how CNNs capture local temporal patterns helps explain why certain incident classes (e.g., "Drop") are easier to learn than others.
  - Quick check question: Why might global average pooling after convolutions lose temporal position information, and is that desirable here?

- Concept: **Information retrieval metrics (MAP, Precision@k)**
  - Why needed here: Evaluation uses Mean Average Precision across 40 retrieval tasks. Understanding MAP is critical for interpreting whether improvements are meaningful.
  - Quick check question: If a retriever gets Precision@1 = 1.0 but MAP = 0.60, what does that tell you about performance at lower ranks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Raw time series → 60-min segmentation → 10-sample averaging → odd-even splitting → imputation (-100 for missing) → optional augmentations → training/validation split
  - Input (B, 30, 1) → Normalization → 3× Conv1D(kernel=5, filters=128) with BatchNorm+ReLU → Dense(128) → Dropout(0.5) → GlobalAveragePooling1D → Dense(128) embedding
  - AdamW optimizer (lr=1e−5, weight decay=1e−4), batch size 256, early stopping (patience=5 epochs)
  - Query embedding → cosine similarity search over precomputed database embeddings → top-k retrieval

- Critical path: The pair generation strategy (odd-even splitting + augmentations) directly determines what the model learns as "similar." If this does not align with operational needs, no amount of architecture tuning will fix retrieval quality.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Augmentations: Cyclic shift adds temporal invariance but may reduce position sensitivity. Vertical shift and scaling reduce baseline/magnitude sensitivity but hurt classes where absolute values matter (e.g., "Stable 40").
  - Temperature τ: Lower values (0.1) enforce tighter clusters; higher values (0.2) allow more spread. Section 5.4 shows no universally optimal τ.
  - Model capacity: 3 Conv1D layers with 128 filters is lightweight; deeper models may capture more complex patterns but risk overfitting with limited diverse data.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Precision@1 with high Precision@5: Embeddings are not discriminative enough at fine granularity.
  - Class-specific MAP collapse: Augmentation may have removed discriminative signal for that class.
  - Training loss plateaus quickly with poor validation performance: Insufficient negative diversity or collapsed embeddings; check batch size and data shuffling.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Train CLSR-10 (τ=0.1, no augmentations) on provided data split; verify MAP ≈ 0.88 and Precision@1 ≈ 1.0 to validate pipeline correctness.
  2. Ablation on augmentation impact per class: Train variants with individual augmentations (cyclic-only, vertical-only, scale-only); measure per-class MAP to confirm which transformations help/hurt each incident pattern.
  3. Temperature sweep: Train with τ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3}; plot MAP vs. τ to identify optimal range and verify tradeoffs reported in Section 5.4.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can network topology and configuration data be effectively integrated into the CLSR framework to enhance correlation accuracy?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states that "an integration with topology graphs or tabular configuration data would be a valuable extension," and Section 3 notes this is "left to future work."
  - Why unresolved: The current formalization restricts input to time-series matrices (I^{T × C}), lacking the architecture to process graph structures or static tabular data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified CLSR architecture that jointly embeds time-series telemetry with topology graphs, demonstrating improved retrieval performance on datasets where connectivity influences incidents.

- **Open Question 2:** Does supervised fine-tuning yield significant performance improvements over the purely self-supervised pre-training approach?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 lists "fine-tuning CLSR on labeled data" as potential future work to achieve "further improvements in retrieval performance."
  - Why unresolved: The current study evaluates the model solely on self-supervised contrastive learning using unlabeled data (Section 4).
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative ablation study measuring Mean Average Precision (MAP) of the pre-trained model before and after supervised fine-tuning on the labeled test set.

- **Open Question 3:** Can a universal augmentation strategy be developed to mitigate the class-specific trade-offs observed with current transformations?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.4 observes that data augmentations like scaling or vertical shift "do not consistently improve retrieval precision across all queries," creating trade-offs where performance gains in one class (e.g., Single disassociation) cause losses in another (e.g., Stable 40).
  - Why unresolved: The paper concludes that no single model variant is best across all classes, suggesting the current augmentation policies are suboptimal for a generalized solution.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A training regime using learned or adaptive augmentation policies that achieves state-of-the-art precision simultaneously across all defined incident classes without manual selection.

## Limitations

- The evaluation dataset is proprietary, preventing independent verification of the reported performance gains
- The odd-even temporal splitting assumption may not hold for network scenarios with rapid state transitions
- Augmentation strategies introduce class-specific trade-offs that require careful tuning for different operational contexts

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core contrastive learning mechanism (NT-Xent loss, embedding similarity) is well-established and technically sound. The architectural design choices (1D CNN, normalization, batch size) are reasonable for time series data.
- **Medium confidence:** The pair generation strategy (odd-even splitting) is novel for network incident correlation but lacks extensive validation across diverse scenarios. The augmentation impact varies significantly by incident class, suggesting limited generalizability.
- **Low confidence:** The dataset-specific performance metrics (MAP of 0.908 vs 0.533 baseline) cannot be independently verified without access to the proprietary WLAN data.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset generalization test:** Apply CLSR to a public network time series dataset (e.g., network intrusion detection datasets) to verify performance gains beyond the proprietary WLAN data.
2. **Pair generation sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary the temporal window size and splitting strategy to quantify how sensitive retrieval quality is to the positive pair construction method.
3. **Augmentation ablation across classes:** Conduct controlled experiments measuring per-class MAP with different augmentation combinations to develop guidelines for when to apply specific transformations based on incident characteristics.
