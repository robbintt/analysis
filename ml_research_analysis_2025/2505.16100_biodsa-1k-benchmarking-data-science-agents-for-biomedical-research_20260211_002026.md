# BioDSA-1K: Benchmarking Data Science Agents for Biomedical Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16100
- Authors: Zifeng Wang; Benjamin Danek; Jimeng Sun
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Reasoning-augmented agents significantly outperformed non-reasoning baselines in biomedical hypothesis validation, with ReAct-Reasoning achieving 86.6% code executability and 92% accuracy at identifying non-verifiable hypotheses.

## Executive Summary
BioDSA-1K introduces a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on biomedical data science tasks. The benchmark consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks derived from 329 published studies, each paired with analysis plans and evidence summaries. Agents are evaluated across four dimensions: hypothesis decision accuracy, evidence alignment, reasoning correctness, and code executability. The results demonstrate that reasoning-augmented agents significantly outperform non-reasoning baselines, particularly in reducing Type II errors and identifying non-verifiable hypotheses.

## Method Summary
The benchmark extracts hypotheses, analysis plans, and evidence summaries from published biomedical studies using GPT-4o. Four agent variants are evaluated: CodeGen (single-shot code generation), ReAct (iterative thought-action), CodeGen-Reasoning (O3-mini plans with GPT-4o execution), and ReAct-Reasoning (reasoning-augmented iteration). Agents analyze diverse biomedical data types from cBioPortal, with evaluation focusing on Type I/II error rates, evidence alignment scores, code executability, and non-verifiable hypothesis detection accuracy.

## Key Results
- Reasoning-augmented agents consistently outperformed non-reasoning baselines, reducing Type II errors by 24-29% across all data types
- ReAct-Reasoning achieved the highest code executability rate (86.6%) among all variants
- ReAct-Reasoning demonstrated 92% accuracy in identifying non-verifiable hypotheses
- Evidence alignment scores remained modest (0.16-0.27), highlighting challenges in capturing nuanced analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reasoning augmentation improves hypothesis validation by reducing Type II errors more than Type I errors.
- Mechanism: Decoupling experiment planning from code execution allows specialized processing—planning models focus on reasoning steps while execution models handle implementation. This division reduces missed relevant findings (Type II) by encouraging systematic analysis coverage.
- Core assumption: Planning and execution require distinct cognitive operations that benefit from model specialization; the planning model's reasoning transfers effectively to the execution model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results showed that reasoning-augmented agents significantly outperformed non-reasoning baselines, particularly in reducing Type II errors."
  - [section 3.2] "Reasoning-enhanced agents...consistently outperform their base counterparts in terms of lower error rates. For instance, ReAct-R* reduces the Type I and II errors in the Genomics category to 0.060 and 0.125, respectively, compared to 0.069 and 0.159 for the base ReAct model."
  - [corpus] Related work (Huang et al. "Automated hypothesis validation with agentic sequential falsifications") supports sequential reasoning for hypothesis testing, though evidence for model specialization specifically is weak in corpus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative code execution with observation feedback (ReAct) improves code executability and reduces hallucinated findings.
- Mechanism: Alternating between reasoning steps and code execution allows agents to observe intermediate results, catch errors dynamically, and refine analysis. This contrasts with single-shot code generation where failures block meaningful validation.
- Core assumption: Error feedback is interpretable and actionable within the agent's context window; iterative refinement converges rather than diverging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ReAct-Reasoning achieved the highest code executability (86.6%)."
  - [section 3.3] "ReAct-based agents exhibit the highest code executability rates, with ReAct Reasoning achieving 86.6% and ReAct at 84.9%, outperforming both CodeGen (76.9%) and CodeGen Reasoning (58.2%)."
  - [section 3.3] "Variable or object misuse is the most common failure mode...Logic and mathematical errors, as well as import or module-related issues, occur less frequently."
  - [corpus] BioDisco paper mentions "iterative feedback" for hypothesis generation, providing weak support for iterative approaches in biomedical contexts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit planning enables better detection of non-verifiable hypotheses where data is insufficient.
- Mechanism: Structured analysis plans require agents to identify necessary variables and data tables upfront. When required elements are absent, reasoning-augmented agents can recognize data insufficiency rather than forcing conclusions.
- Core assumption: Agents can accurately assess data availability during planning; the planning process surfaces gaps that single-shot approaches miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ReAct-Reasoning...was most effective at identifying non-verifiable hypotheses (92% accuracy)."
  - [section 3.4] "One-round code generation methods, such as CodeGen gpt-4o and CodeGen o3-mini, achieve only 63% and 57% TPR, respectively...In contrast, reasoning-augmented agents like CodeGen Reasoning, ReAct, and particularly ReAct Reasoning perform more conservatively, with ReAct Reasoning achieving a TPR of 92%."
  - [corpus] EvidenceBench addresses evidence extraction from papers but doesn't directly address non-verifiable hypothesis detection; corpus evidence for this mechanism is weak.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Type I vs. Type II errors in hypothesis testing
  - Why needed here: The benchmark explicitly optimizes for reducing Type II errors (missed findings) over Type I errors (false positives), reflecting biomedical research priorities where missing a true association is costly.
  - Quick check question: Given error rates E_I=0.08 and E_II=0.14, which represents false positives and which represents missed discoveries?

- Concept: ReAct framework (Reasoning + Acting)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the alternation between "thoughts" (reasoning steps) and "actions" (code execution) is essential for implementing or modifying the iterative agents.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between ReAct and CodeGen in terms of how they handle analysis failures?

- Concept: Evidence alignment vs. decision accuracy
  - Why needed here: The benchmark distinguishes between getting the right answer (decision accuracy) and following the correct analytical process (evidence alignment), addressing a gap in prior evaluations.
  - Quick check question: Why might an agent achieve high decision accuracy but low evidence alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset captioning (cBioPortal) -> Hypothesis/evidence extraction (GPT-4o) -> Agent execution (four variants) -> Code execution -> Observation collection -> Hypothesis decision -> Metric computation

- Critical path: Dataset captioning → hypothesis/evidence extraction → agent execution → code execution → observation collection → hypothesis decision → metric computation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Schema-based captions preserve privacy but may lose signal from patient-level patterns
  - Including non-verifiable hypotheses increases realism but complicates evaluation
  - Using LLM-as-judge for evidence alignment introduces model dependency in evaluation

- Failure signatures:
  - Variable/object misuse (27-32% of non-executable code): Agents reference columns or tables that don't exist
  - Hallucinated findings (8-13% when code is non-executable): Agents report conclusions without successful analysis
  - Over-assertiveness on non-verifiable tasks: Non-reasoning agents incorrectly label 37-43% of non-verifiable hypotheses as True/False

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce executability rates: Run all four agent variants on a 50-task subset, categorize failures using the error taxonomy (Variable/Object Misuse, Math/Logic Error, Import/Module Error).
  2. Ablate reasoning: Compare CodeGen vs. CodeGen-Reasoning on Genomics tasks specifically to isolate the contribution of structured planning to Type II error reduction.
  3. Test non-verifiable detection: Create 20 synthetic non-verifiable hypotheses by pairing claims with unrelated datasets, measure TPR for "Not Verifiable" classification across all variants.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can AI agent architectures be optimized to significantly improve evidence alignment scores beyond the modest 0.20–0.25 range observed in complex tasks like clustering and survival analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 3.3 that "Evidence alignment scores remain modest... highlighting the need for improved reasoning and domain-specific modeling capabilities in AI systems aimed at biomedical data analysis."
- Why unresolved: Current reasoning-augmented methods (e.g., ReAct-Reasoning) only marginally improved alignment over baselines, suggesting fundamental limitations in capturing nuanced analysis or domain knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of an agent architecture achieving consistent alignment scores > 0.50 across all analysis types in BioDSA-1K without manual intervention.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the overrepresentation of well-established, high-volume topics (e.g., genomics) in BioDSA-1K limit the generalizability of trained agents to emerging or data-scarce biomedical research areas?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes the dataset "overrepresents well-established topics... potentially underrepresenting emerging areas... This skew may influence model performance and generalizability."
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark composition reflects publication volume bias, making it unclear if current agents can perform robust analysis on rare conditions or novel scientific inquiries outside the training distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of current SOTA agents on a separate, curated benchmark of emerging biomedical fields showing performance stability comparable to high-volume domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What safeguards can prevent AI agents from hallucinating hypothesis decisions when generated code fails to execute?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.4 notes that in non-executable code settings, "AI agents sometimes turn out to hallucinate the findings," deciding "True" or "False" in ~13% of cases where the code could not run.
- Why unresolved: Agents currently lack robust self-correction mechanisms to recognize that a lack of execution precludes a verifiable conclusion, leading to potential misinformation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified agent workflow where the rate of definitive "True/False" decisions in non-executable scenarios drops to near 0%.

## Limitations
- LLM-as-judge evaluation introduces model-dependent variability in evidence alignment scoring
- Private nature of cBioPortal data requires external access for replication
- Schema-only data sharing may miss nuanced patient-level patterns critical for certain analyses

## Confidence
- High confidence: Code executability improvements from ReAct (86.6%) and reasoning-augmented agents' superior performance
- Medium confidence: Evidence alignment scores (0.16-0.27) due to inherent difficulty and LLM-as-judge limitations
- Medium confidence: Type II error reduction claims depend on specific error definition and LLM evaluation methodology

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the code executability gap between ReAct and CodeGen variants using the same error taxonomy to verify the 8.7% improvement
2. Implement LLM-as-judge evaluation independently to measure inter-annotator agreement on evidence alignment scores
3. Test reasoning-augmented agents on synthetic non-verifiable hypotheses to verify the 92% true positive rate for "Not Verifiable" classification
