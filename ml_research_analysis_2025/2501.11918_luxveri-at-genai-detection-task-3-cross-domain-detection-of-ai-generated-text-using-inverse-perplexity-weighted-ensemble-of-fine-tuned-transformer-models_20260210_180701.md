# LuxVeri at GenAI Detection Task 3: Cross-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text Using Inverse Perplexity-Weighted Ensemble of Fine-Tuned Transformer Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.11918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11918
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Inverse perplexity-weighted ensemble achieved 0.826 TPR (rank 10) for non-adversarial and single RoBERTa achieved 0.801 TPR (rank 8) for adversarial detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an ensemble approach for cross-domain detection of AI-generated text using inverse perplexity-weighted fine-tuned transformer models. The method combines RoBERTa-base models with perplexity-based weighting to improve classification accuracy across diverse text domains. The ensemble achieved strong performance in non-adversarial settings (TPR 0.826, rank 10) while the single fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model excelled in adversarial conditions (TPR 0.801, rank 8), demonstrating a critical tradeoff between ensemble benefits and adversarial robustness.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a balanced 10% subset of the RAID dataset, fine-tuning two RoBERTa-base models (standard and OpenAI-detector variant) for binary classification. For non-adversarial detection, models are combined using inverse perplexity-weighted soft voting, where weights are calculated as 1/(P-1) based on each model's perplexity. The adversarial detection uses the single fine-tuned RoBERTa model. Training employed 2-3 epochs with lr 1e-5 to 2e-5, batch sizes of 4 (train) and 16 (val), and early stopping.

## Key Results
- Non-adversarial ensemble achieved TPR of 0.826, ranking 10th out of 23 detectors
- Single fine-tuned RoBERTa achieved TPR of 0.801 in adversarial detection, ranking 8th out of 22
- Ensemble outperformed single model in non-adversarial but underperformed in adversarial settings
- Inverse perplexity weighting improved ensemble accuracy by prioritizing high-confidence models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Inverse perplexity weighting improves ensemble accuracy by prioritizing models with higher confidence on specific inputs.
- **Mechanism:** The system calculates a weight w_i based on the inverse of the model's perplexity (P_i - 1). During soft voting, the prediction probabilities of models with lower perplexity (interpreted as higher confidence) are scaled up, contributing more to the final classification decision.
- **Core assumption:** Lower perplexity on a specific text sample directly correlates with higher classification accuracy for that sample.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "effectiveness of inverse perplexity-based weighting for enhancing generalization"
  - [section 3.4.2] "giving higher confidence models greater influence"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "LuxVeri at GenAI Detection Task 1" applies this same weighting mechanism, suggesting it is a consistent strategy for this team.
- **Break condition:** If a model is confidently wrong (low perplexity but incorrect prediction), this weighting mechanism amplifies the error, potentially degrading performance more than a simple average.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Balanced stratified sampling of training data enables cross-domain generalization despite using only 10% of the available dataset.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of random sampling, the authors selected a proportional subset across all 8 domains (e.g., abstracts, poetry, news) and 12 generation models. This forces the transformer to learn domain-agnostic "machine" features rather than overfitting to the statistical artifacts of a single genre.
- **Core assumption:** The 10% subset sufficiently represents the variance of the full 11.8GB RAID dataset.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.1] "reduction was carried out in a balanced manner across all genres... to ensure that each subset was proportionally represented"
  - [section 5] "trained on a subset... limiting the model's ability to capture its full diversity"
  - [corpus] [weak/missing] Corpus neighbors do not specifically discuss the efficacy of 10% subsampling versus full data training for RAID.
- **Break condition:** Performance on underrepresented generator architectures (e.g., Mistral or Cohere) will degrade, as seen in the results table where these scored lower than GPT variants.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Standard fine-tuned RoBERTa architectures offer superior robustness in adversarial conditions compared to OpenAI-detector-integrated ensembles.
- **Mechanism:** While the ensemble excelled in non-adversarial settings, the single fine-tuned RoBERTa-base performed best under adversarial attack. This suggests that the specific linguistic perturbations introduced by adversarial attacks may confuse the auxiliary OpenAI detector or distort the perplexity signals used for weighting, making the simpler, robustly fine-tuned single model more reliable.
- **Core assumption:** The adversarial attacks (e.g., paraphrasing) alter text in ways that specifically disrupt the perplexity-based confidence heuristic.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1] "In the adversarial testing, the fine-tuned RoBERTa model outperformed other detectors... securing 8th out of 22"
  - [section 4.2] Table 3 shows FT RoBERTa (0.801) outperformed FT RoBERTa + RoBERTa OpenAI (0.760) in adversarial settings.
- **Break condition:** If adversarial methods evolve to specifically target RoBERTa's attention heads without altering perplexity, this single-model robustness would likely fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Perplexity (PPL)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core heuristic used to weight the ensemble. You must understand that perplexity measures how "surprised" a model is by a text sequence, effectively acting as a proxy for prediction confidence.
  - **Quick check question:** If Model A has a perplexity of 10 and Model B has a perplexity of 100, which model receives a higher weight in the LuxVeri ensemble?

- **Concept: Soft Voting**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper contrasts this with hard voting. Understanding that probabilities are summed (rather than counting class labels) is necessary to see how the weighting affects the outcome.
  - **Quick check question:** Does soft voting aggregate the predicted probability distribution (0.7 AI / 0.3 Human) or just the final class label (AI)?

- **Concept: Cross-Domain Transfer**
  - **Why needed here:** The primary challenge is "Domain Shift" (e.g., training on poetry, testing on recipes). You need to grasp why this is harder than standard detection.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model trained only on "News" fail to detect AI-generated "Poetry"? (Hint: Look for stylistic priors).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** RAID dataset (10% balanced subset) -> Two RoBERTa-base variants (fine-tuned standard and fine-tuned OpenAI detector) -> Perplexity Weighting Engine (calculates weights as 1/(P-1)) -> Weighted Soft Voting Aggregator

- **Critical path:** The system depends heavily on the Tokenizer alignment between the RAID data and the RoBERTa models, and the precise implementation of the Perplexity Weighting formula (Eq. 2 in text). An off-by-one error in P-1 breaks the scaling.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Ensemble vs. Adversarial Robustness:** The paper demonstrates a critical tradeoff: the ensemble (best for normal text) was worse than the single model for adversarial text. You must select the deployment mode based on the threat model.
  - **Data vs. Compute:** Using 10% data (approx 518k samples) reduced compute time but admitted caps on performance ceiling, particularly for complex generators like GPT-4.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Generator Specific Bias:** The model struggles significantly with "Cohere-Chat" (TPR 0.546) and "Mistral" in non-adversarial settings. Do not deploy this specific ensemble for detecting Cohere outputs without re-training.
  - **Adversarial Ensemble Drop:** If the ensemble mode yields lower scores than the single model, check if the input contains adversarial perturbations (e.g., synonyms/paraphrasing) which likely destabilized the perplexity weights.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Weighting Ablation:** Run the ensemble with uniform weights (no perplexity) vs. inverse perplexity weights to isolate the specific performance gain of the weighting mechanism on the RAID-test set.
  2. **Adversarial Component Analysis:** Evaluate the OpenAI-RoBERTa component alone on the adversarial test set to confirm if it is the "weak link" causing the ensemble's adversarial performance drop.
  3. **Data Scaling Test:** Train on 10%, 20%, and 50% of the RAID dataset to plot the performance curve and determine if the "computational constraint" tradeoff was worth the accuracy loss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent does increasing the training data volume from the 10% subset to the full RAID dataset improve detection performance for underrepresented domains?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that computational constraints restricted training to a subset, and using the full dataset could improve performance.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors lacked the computational resources to utilize the full 802 million words during the experiment.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparison of True Positive Rate (TPR) scores across all domains when the model is fine-tuned on the complete RAID dataset versus the 10% subset.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does integrating architectures specifically designed for multilingual or long-sequence contexts (e.g., XLM-RoBERTa or RemBERT) improve robustness compared to the current RoBERTa-only ensemble?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section notes that excluding models like RemBERT and XLM-RoBERTa might have limited performance on noisy data, long sequences, and multilingual tasks.
- **Why unresolved:** The study deliberately restricted the model selection to RoBERTa-base variants to focus on the inverse perplexity weighting method.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks showing detection performance of an XLM-RoBERTa or RemBERT ensemble against the RoBERTa baseline on multilingual and long-text subsets of the RAID dataset.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can dynamic ensemble strategies reduce the computational overhead associated with inverse perplexity weighting while maintaining high detection accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion proposes exploring "dynamic ensemble strategies" to address the computational overhead mentioned in the Limitations.
- **Why unresolved:** The current system uses a static weighted voting strategy that requires perplexity calculation for all models in the ensemble.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing the inference latency and resource consumption of a dynamic selection mechanism against the static inverse perplexity-weighted ensemble.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Why does the inverse perplexity-weighted ensemble underperform a single fine-tuned RoBERTa model in adversarial detection scenarios?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table 3 shows the ensemble achieved a TPR of 0.760 (Rank 10) in adversarial detection, while the single fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved a higher TPR of 0.801 (Rank 8).
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not analyze why the ensemble method, which improved non-adversarial results, failed to boost performance under adversarial conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study analyzing the confidence (perplexity) scores of individual ensemble members when processing adversarial attacks to determine if the weighting mechanism amplifies errors.

## Limitations

- 10% balanced sampling admits performance ceiling, particularly for underrepresented generator architectures like Mistral and Cohere
- Perplexity-based weighting mechanism assumes strong correlation between low perplexity and classification accuracy, which may fail when models are "confidently wrong"
- Ensemble approach underperforms single model in adversarial detection, suggesting adversarial perturbations specifically destabilize the perplexity-based confidence heuristic
- Paper lacks sufficient ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of each component

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The ensemble approach achieved an aggregate TPR of 0.826, ranking 10th out of 23 detectors for non-adversarial detection
- The fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model achieved a TPR of 0.801, securing 8th place out of 22 detectors for adversarial detection
- The perplexity-based weighting mechanism does improve ensemble accuracy in non-adversarial settings

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The balanced 10% sampling strategy enables cross-domain generalization
- The ensemble underperforms the single model specifically due to adversarial perturbations affecting the perplexity weights

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The inverse perplexity weighting is the primary driver of performance gains
- The 10% sampling represents sufficient variance of the full RAID dataset

## Next Checks

1. **Weighting Mechanism Ablation:** Run the ensemble with uniform weights versus inverse perplexity weights on the RAID test set to quantify the specific performance contribution of the weighting mechanism, isolating whether it provides genuine improvement or simply adds complexity.

2. **Adversarial Component Analysis:** Evaluate the OpenAI-RoBERTa component in isolation on the adversarial test set to determine if it is the "weak link" causing the ensemble's adversarial performance drop, or if the weighting mechanism itself fails under adversarial conditions.

3. **Data Scaling Experiment:** Train models on 10%, 20%, and 50% of the RAID dataset to empirically determine the relationship between training data volume and detection performance, particularly for underrepresented generators like Mistral and Cohere.
