- Introduces Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW) method achieving 99% accuracy in controlled environments and 70% in HEC-prone areas

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a seismic signal-based framework for detecting and classifying elephant footfalls to mitigate Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). The core innovation is the Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW) method, a novel event detection technique specifically designed for elephant footfall patterns. The framework combines CCW with machine learning classification using nine handcrafted features and demonstrates effective real-time performance on embedded systems. Experimental results show the system can detect elephants up to 155.6 meters in controlled environments and 140 meters in natural settings while maintaining competitive accuracy across different habitat types.

## Method Summary
The framework processes seismic signals through a multi-stage pipeline: preprocessing with 6th-order Butterworth filtering (80 Hz cutoff) and band-stop filtering (50-60 Hz) to remove ambient noise, event detection using either the novel CCW method or traditional STA/LTA, and classification using SVM with RBF kernel. CCW employs a central short window flanked by long windows with approximately 1:5 ratio to capture elephant footfall patterns more accurately than traditional methods. Nine features are extracted including zero crossings, DTW alignment cost, and predominant frequency, with SHAP analysis identifying zero crossings and DTW cost as most influential. The system achieves 99% accuracy in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99% classification accuracy in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats
- Successfully detected elephants up to 155.6 meters in controlled settings and 140 meters in natural environments
- Outperformed traditional STA/LTA method in event separation accuracy while maintaining lower computational complexity suitable for embedded systems
- Identified zero crossings and DTW alignment cost as the most influential features across all environments through SHAP analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds because CCW specifically addresses the temporal characteristics of elephant footfalls, which differ from other seismic sources like vehicles or human footsteps. By using context-aware windowing that adapts to the unique energy patterns in elephant footfall signals, CCW can better isolate true events while minimizing false positives. The feature selection process, validated through SHAP analysis, ensures that the most discriminative characteristics of elephant seismic signatures are captured, while the SVM classifier with RBF kernel provides robust decision boundaries in the multi-dimensional feature space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW):** A novel event detection method using adaptive windowing ratios to capture elephant footfall patterns. Needed to improve upon traditional fixed-window methods that struggle with varying seismic signatures. Quick check: Verify energy ratio peaks align with known footfall timing.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** A game-theoretic approach for explaining machine learning model predictions. Needed to identify which features most influence classification decisions across different environments. Quick check: Confirm top features match expected seismic characteristics.
- **DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) Alignment Cost:** Measures similarity between temporal sequences that may vary in speed or timing. Needed to handle natural variations in footfall patterns while maintaining discriminative power. Quick check: Compare DTW costs between elephant and non-elephant events.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw Seismic Signal -> Preprocessing (Butterworth + Band-stop filters) -> Event Detection (CCW/STA-LTA) -> Feature Extraction (9 features) -> Classification (SVM with RBF kernel)

**Critical Path:** Seismic signal acquisition → CCW event detection → Feature extraction → SVM classification

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes computational efficiency for real-time embedded deployment over maximum theoretical accuracy, using handcrafted features instead of deep learning to reduce processing requirements. The choice of CCW over more complex neural networks enables deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining sufficient accuracy for practical HEC mitigation.

**Failure Signatures:** High false positives in natural environments indicate insufficient noise suppression or feature discrimination; performance degradation in HEC areas suggests feature overlap between elephants and human/cattle activities; low detection range points to inadequate signal-to-noise ratio or suboptimal event detection thresholds.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test CCW vs STA/LTA event detection on a small subset of seismic data to verify the 1:5 window ratio improvement claim
2. Train SVM classifier with varying feature subsets to confirm zero crossings and DTW cost as top predictors
3. Measure computational latency of the complete pipeline on target embedded hardware to verify real-time capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Critical parameter values for CCW and STA/LTA thresholds are not explicitly provided, requiring researchers to perform their own parameter optimization
- Dataset availability is limited, with specific datasets and video annotations not publicly accessible for independent validation
- Performance in HEC environments, while promising at 70%, still represents room for improvement given the challenging nature of these scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence claims:**
- 155.6 meter detection range in controlled environments (directly references Pinnawala dataset experimental data)

**Medium confidence claims:**
- 140 meter detection range in natural environments (depends on undocumented dataset specifics and video annotation quality)
- 73% accuracy in natural elephant habitats (supported by systematic feature analysis but requires dataset verification)

**Low confidence claims:**
- Generalizability to other seismic animal detection applications (framework appears specifically tuned to elephant footfall characteristics)

## Next Checks
1. Publish the raw seismic datasets and corresponding video annotations to enable independent verification of the 140 meter detection claim
2. Release the exact threshold values and window parameters for CCW and STA/LTA to ensure reproducible event detection
3. Test the framework on publicly available seismic datasets with different animal footfall patterns to assess generalization beyond elephant-specific features
