# Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 12.19% AUROC and 30.68% AUPRC improvement over state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of semi-supervised graph anomaly detection where normal nodes exhibit diverse homophily levels. The proposed RHO method introduces adaptive spectral filtering through two complementary views - cross-channel and channel-wise - to capture heterogeneous normality patterns. A consistency enforcement module aligns these views through contrastive learning, while a one-class objective pushes normal nodes toward hypersphere centers. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in scenarios where normal nodes have varying homophily patterns.

## Method Summary
RHO learns adaptive spectral filters to capture heterogeneous homophily patterns in normal nodes through two complementary views: cross-channel (shared filter across all features) and channel-wise (individual filters per feature channel). The AdaFreq module applies learnable frequency response filters g(λ) = 1 - kλ to graph Laplacian operators, allowing the model to adaptively preserve consistent spectral patterns across diverse normal nodes. A Graph Normality Alignment (GNA) module enforces consistency between views via contrastive learning, treating same-node representations as positive pairs and different-node representations as negatives. The method uses a one-class objective to map normal nodes toward hypersphere centers while anomalies remain distant. Training uses a small set of labeled normal nodes (typically 15%) to optimize the combined loss function.

## Key Results
- RHO substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 12.19% AUROC and 30.68% AUPRC improvement over the best competing method GGAD
- The method effectively handles varying homophily levels in normal nodes without requiring generated anomalies
- Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of both views and the importance of the GNA module
- RHO demonstrates robust performance across diverse real-world datasets with different graph characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Adaptive spectral filters capture heterogeneous homophily patterns better than fixed filters
- Learnable frequency response filters g(λ) = 1 - kλ preserve consistent spectral patterns across diverse normal nodes
- Normal nodes at different homophily levels exhibit coherent spectral behavior in specific frequency bands that can be learned from limited labeled data

### Mechanism 2
- Learning homophily patterns in both cross-channel and channel-wise views captures complementary normality information
- Cross-channel view uses shared k across all attributes while channel-wise view learns d separate parameters
- Different feature channels encode distinct homophily variations, providing complementary information

### Mechanism 3
- Contrastive alignment between views enforces consistent normality representations
- GNA treats same-node representations from both views as positive pairs and different-node representations as negative pairs
- Consistent normal patterns should appear in both views for normal nodes but not for anomalies

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph Spectral Theory**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how signals decompose into frequency components via graph Fourier transform is essential to grasp why adaptive filtering helps
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the graph Laplacian eigenvectors with small eigenvalues correspond to "low-frequency" signals on a graph?

- Concept: **Homophily in Graphs**
  - Why needed here: The core problem RHO addresses is that normal nodes can have varying homophily levels, breaking standard GNN assumptions
  - Quick check question: Given a node v with homophily H_v = 0.4, what does this tell you about the relationship between v's label and its neighbors' labels?

- Concept: **One-Class Classification / Hypersphere Learning**
  - Why needed here: RHO uses a one-class loss to map normal nodes to a hypersphere center, with anomalies expected to lie outside
  - Quick check question: In a one-class setup with only normal training data, how does the model learn to distinguish anomalies at test time?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input features -> Feature MLP -> AdaFreq (Cross-channel & Channel-wise in parallel) -> Projection Heads -> GNA Module -> One-class Centers -> Anomaly scoring via averaged distances to centers

- Critical path: Input features → MLP → AdaFreq (both views in parallel) → GNA alignment → One-class loss → Anomaly scoring via averaged distances to centers

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More layers (T) → richer frequency responses but risk of over-smoothing
  - Larger α → stronger view alignment but may over-constrain on small datasets (Reddit, Photo use α=0.1; others use 1.0)
  - Assumption: Sparse graphs need smaller learning rates for stability (5e-4 for Elliptic/Question, 5e-6 for DGraph)

- Failure signatures:
  - Normal nodes with very low homophily being flagged as anomalies (symptom of fixed-filter methods RHO aims to fix)
  - Camouflaged anomalies near hypersphere center (in cross-channel view alone—requires channel-wise complement)
  - Over-smoothing on small, high-feature-similarity graphs when α is too large

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Homophily stratification test: Sample labeled normal nodes with varying low/high homophily ratios. Verify AdaFreq maintains AUROC across conditions while GCN/BWGNN degrade
  2. Ablation on views: Run RHO with only L_ccr, only L_cwr, and both. Expect performance drop when either view is removed
  3. Filter visualization: After training, plot learned g(λ) curves. Check that cross-channel filter shows adaptive low-frequency retention while channel-wise filters show diverse responses across channels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can the RHO framework be extended to support inductive learning scenarios where unseen nodes and edges are introduced after training?
- Can the trade-off hyperparameter α (controlling normality alignment) be determined adaptively rather than requiring dataset-specific manual tuning?
- Would increasing the order of the adaptive polynomial filter beyond the proposed linear form yield significant performance gains for datasets with highly complex homophily distributions?

## Limitations

- RHO is a transductive method and cannot be directly applied in inductive settings where unseen nodes are introduced after training
- The method requires dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the alignment weight α
- Performance may degrade when normal nodes have incoherent spectral patterns across all frequencies

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines on benchmark datasets, ablation studies showing GNA's contribution
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical justification for adaptive filtering's superiority over fixed filters, generalization across diverse homophily distributions
- **Low confidence**: Behavior on extremely sparse graphs, scalability to graphs with millions of nodes, robustness to varying proportions of labeled normal nodes

## Next Checks

1. Test RHO on graphs with extreme homophily variance (both very high and very low) to identify breaking points where adaptive filtering fails
2. Evaluate performance when labeled normal node proportion varies from 5% to 50% to assess semi-supervised learning limits
3. Conduct stress tests with camouflaged anomalies that have high feature similarity to normal nodes but anomalous structural roles
