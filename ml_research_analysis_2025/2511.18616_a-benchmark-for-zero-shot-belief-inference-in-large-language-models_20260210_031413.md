# A Benchmark for Zero-Shot Belief Inference in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.18616
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18616
- **Authors**: Joseph Malone; Rachith Aiyappa; Byunghwee Lee; Haewoon Kwak; Jisun An; Yong-Yeol Ahn
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces a benchmark testing LLM belief prediction across four conditions (no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, both combined) using debate platform data, finding that combined information outperforms single sources in most domains.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark for zero-shot belief inference in large language models, addressing the lack of systematic evaluation across diverse belief domains. The authors use data from an online debate platform to test how well off-the-shelf LLMs can predict users' stances under four conditions: no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, and both combined. They find that both types of information improve predictions over a blind baseline, with the combination yielding the best performance in most cases. However, the relative value of each varies substantially across belief domains: demographics matter more for identity-linked beliefs like politics and religion, while prior stances matter more for idiosyncratic domains like sports and entertainment. These findings reveal both the capacity and limitations of current LLMs to emulate human reasoning about beliefs.

## Method Summary
The authors created a benchmark using data from an online debate platform where users express beliefs on various topics. They tested off-the-shelf LLMs' ability to predict user stances (support/oppose) under four experimental conditions: with no additional information, with only demographic information, with only prior belief information, and with both types of information combined. The benchmark evaluates prediction accuracy across multiple belief domains including politics, religion, sports, and entertainment. The zero-shot approach means models were not fine-tuned on this data but rather used their pre-existing knowledge to make predictions.

## Key Results
- Combined demographic and prior belief information outperforms either source alone in most belief domains
- The relative importance of demographics versus prior stances varies significantly across domains
- Demographics are more predictive for identity-linked beliefs (politics, religion)
- Prior stances are more predictive for idiosyncratic domains (sports, entertainment)
- All conditions show improvement over blind baseline predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by leveraging the natural argumentative context of debate platforms where users explicitly state and defend their positions. LLMs can use this rich context to infer beliefs through pattern recognition across multiple information sources. The zero-shot design tests the models' pre-existing world knowledge rather than their ability to memorize specific training examples, providing a more realistic assessment of their reasoning capabilities about human beliefs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot inference**: Understanding how models make predictions without task-specific training is crucial for evaluating their general reasoning capabilities. Quick check: Can the model transfer knowledge from related domains?
- **Belief representation**: How abstract concepts like political ideology or religious conviction are encoded in model embeddings affects prediction accuracy. Quick check: Are beliefs represented as continuous vectors or discrete categories?
- **Contextual reasoning**: Models must integrate multiple information sources (demographics, prior stances) to make accurate predictions. Quick check: Does the model weight different information types appropriately?
- **Domain specificity**: Recognition that belief inference patterns vary across domains helps understand model limitations. Quick check: Does performance correlate with domain characteristics?
- **Argumentative structure**: Understanding how debate platforms structure belief expression is essential for interpreting results. Quick check: Are arguments logically connected to stated positions?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Debate Data -> Feature Extraction -> LLM Inference -> Stance Prediction -> Accuracy Evaluation

### Critical Path
The critical path involves extracting user demographic and prior belief features from debate data, feeding this information to the LLM along with prompt instructions, generating stance predictions, and comparing predictions to ground truth labels.

### Design Tradeoffs
Zero-shot evaluation prioritizes generalizability over optimization, sacrificing potential accuracy gains from fine-tuning. Binary stance coding simplifies the task but may lose nuanced position information. Using single-turn predictions limits assessment of iterative reasoning capabilities.

### Failure Signatures
Poor performance on identity-linked beliefs without demographic context indicates models rely too heavily on stated positions. Inconsistent predictions across similar topics suggest insufficient generalization. Low accuracy even with full information reveals fundamental limitations in belief reasoning.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Test whether allowing multiple LLM turns with the data improves prediction accuracy
2. Compare performance across different LLM architectures and parameter sizes
3. Evaluate whether domain-specific prompting strategies improve results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on self-selected debate platform participants may introduce systematic biases
- Binary stance coding may oversimplify complex belief positions
- Single-turn LLM predictions may underestimate full reasoning capabilities
- Limited sample sizes per belief domain affect statistical reliability

## Confidence

### Major Limitations and Uncertainties:
- The self-selected nature of debate participants may create systematic biases in how beliefs are expressed and defended, potentially limiting generalizability to broader populations.
- The binary stance coding (support/oppose) may oversimplify complex belief positions, particularly for nuanced topics where respondents might hold conditional or qualified views.
- The study's use of single-turn LLM predictions without iterative refinement may underestimate the models' full reasoning capabilities.

### Confidence Labels:

- **High Confidence**: The finding that combined demographic and prior belief information outperforms either alone in most domains is robust, supported by clear statistical patterns across multiple belief categories and LLM models.

- **Medium Confidence**: The domain-specific differences in information value (demographics vs. prior stances) are suggestive but require careful interpretation. The observed patterns may be influenced by the specific topics chosen and the limited sample sizes per belief domain.

- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about LLMs' capacity to emulate human reasoning about beliefs is supported but should be qualified by noting that performance remains far from perfect and varies substantially across contexts.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-platform validation**: Replicate the benchmark using data from multiple debate platforms and discussion forums to assess generalizability and identify platform-specific biases.

2. **Multi-turn reasoning evaluation**: Test whether allowing LLMs multiple interaction turns with the data improves prediction accuracy, particularly for complex belief domains.

3. **Ground truth validation**: Conduct human annotation studies to verify the accuracy of the original stance labels and assess whether LLM predictions align with independent human judgments of user positions.
