# RASMD: RGB And SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07603
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First large-scale synchronized RGB-SWIR dataset for autonomous driving with 100,000 paired images

## Executive Summary
RASMD introduces the first large-scale, synchronized RGB and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) dataset for autonomous driving research. The dataset contains 100,000 paired RGB and SWIR images collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. This addresses the critical gap in existing autonomous driving benchmarks, which lack SWIR data despite its proven effectiveness in adverse conditions like fog, rain, and low light. The dataset enables research into robust perception systems that can leverage multispectral information for improved performance in challenging driving scenarios.

## Method Summary
The RASMD dataset was collected using synchronized RGB and SWIR cameras mounted on vehicles driving through various environments. The dataset captures diverse scenarios including different weather conditions, lighting situations, and geographic locations. Images are carefully synchronized and annotated for object detection tasks. The dataset supports both RGB-SWIR fusion approaches and RGB-to-SWIR image translation research. Performance evaluations demonstrate that combining RGB and SWIR data in ensemble frameworks significantly improves object detection accuracy, particularly for vulnerable road users in challenging conditions.

## Key Results
- Ensemble framework combining RGB and SWIR achieves significant performance gains in object detection accuracy
- Notable improvements observed for vulnerable road users in adverse weather conditions
- Demonstrates effectiveness of SWIR data for RGB-to-SWIR image translation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of RASMD stems from SWIR's unique properties in penetrating atmospheric obstructions and maintaining visibility in low-light conditions. SWIR sensors can detect light in the 900-2500 nm wavelength range, which is less affected by scattering from fog, rain, and haze compared to visible light. This complementary information to RGB sensors enables more robust perception in adverse conditions where traditional cameras fail. The synchronized nature of the dataset allows direct comparison and fusion of features from both modalities, maximizing the benefits of multispectral imaging.

## Foundational Learning

1. **SWIR Imaging Principles** - Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum properties and atmospheric transmission windows. Critical for appreciating why SWIR performs better in adverse conditions.
2. **Multispectral Sensor Fusion** - Techniques for combining information from different spectral bands. Necessary for developing effective RGB-SWIR fusion algorithms.
3. **Adverse Weather Perception** - Challenges specific to autonomous driving in fog, rain, and low-light conditions. Provides context for why SWIR is valuable.
4. **Dataset Synchronization** - Methods for ensuring temporal and spatial alignment between different camera modalities. Important for maintaining data quality and enabling effective fusion.
5. **Image Translation** - Generative models for converting between different spectral domains. Enables RGB-to-SWIR translation research using the dataset.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Vehicle-mounted cameras -> Data acquisition system -> Synchronization module -> Storage system -> Annotation pipeline -> Dataset distribution

**Critical Path:** Sensor capture -> Synchronization -> Storage -> Annotation -> Dataset release

**Design Tradeoffs:** SWIR sensors are more expensive and have lower resolution than RGB sensors, but provide superior performance in adverse conditions. The tradeoff between data quality and collection cost was addressed by creating a focused dataset rather than continuous streaming.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor synchronization between RGB and SWIR frames can lead to misalignment artifacts. Insufficient lighting conditions may reduce SWIR effectiveness. Geographic bias in data collection could limit generalizability to different driving environments.

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline object detection using only RGB data on the dataset
2. Object detection using only SWIR data for comparison
3. RGB-SWIR fusion experiments to quantify performance improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Direct comparison with thermal imaging datasets is absent, leaving uncertainty about SWIR's relative performance in adverse conditions
- Geographic and environmental diversity of the dataset is not quantified, raising questions about generalizability
- RGB-to-SWIR translation quality and realism are not thoroughly validated
- The claim of being the "first large-scale" synchronized RGB-SWIR dataset lacks comprehensive survey validation

## Confidence

- High: The dataset's contribution to addressing the absence of SWIR data in autonomous driving benchmarks is well-supported
- Medium: The performance improvements in object detection using RGB-SWIR fusion are demonstrated but could benefit from more rigorous ablation studies
- Low: The comparison with thermal imaging and the generalizability of the dataset to all driving conditions remain unclear

## Next Checks

1. Conduct direct comparison of RASMD with thermal IR datasets in adverse weather conditions to validate SWIR's superiority
2. Quantify the geographic and environmental diversity of the dataset to assess its generalizability
3. Perform detailed evaluation of RGB-to-SWIR translation models including user studies or downstream task performance to validate translated image quality
