## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modernizing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows by integrating artificial intelligence to improve detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and enhance operational efficiency. The study reviews current AI applications in AML, focusing on transaction monitoring, fraud detection, SAR reporting, and KYC, and proposes a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG Graph) system for KYC customer due diligence. The proposed RAG-Graph architecture combines structured and unstructured data into a knowledge graph, enabling natural language queries and automated report generation. Experimental results demonstrate high faithfulness and strong answer relevancy across diverse evaluation settings, with the GraphRAG approach significantly outperforming traditional rule-based systems and vector-based RAG in terms of contextual grounding and multi-hop reasoning, achieving F1 scores above 98% and reducing false positives by 50–90%.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG Graph) system for automating KYC Customer Due Diligence. The method involves constructing a synthetic Neo4j knowledge graph with nodes for customers, accounts, transactions, and relationships (e.g., OWNS, PERFORMED). An agent using GPT-4o-mini connects to the graph via an MCP Server with 12 tools, enabling natural language queries to retrieve structured data. The system is evaluated using the RAGAS framework on 200 multi-level questions (Levels 1–5), measuring Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Context Precision, and Context Recall. The architecture shifts from vector-based embeddings to structured graph traversal, preserving multi-hop relationships critical for complex AML reasoning.

## Key Results
- GraphRAG achieves F1 scores above 98% in KYC customer due diligence tasks.
- The system reduces false positives by 50–90% compared to traditional rule-based systems.
- GraphRAG significantly outperforms vector-based RAG in multi-hop reasoning, maintaining high Context Precision (0.70–1.00) where vector-based methods drop to near zero.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing flattened vector embeddings with structured graph traversal improves retrieval accuracy for multi-hop financial reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** By modeling entities (Customers, Accounts) and relationships (PERFORMED, SHARES_ADDRESS_WITH) as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph (Neo4j), the system preserves structural dependencies that vector-RAG flattens. When the LLM encounters a query requiring indirect links (e.g., "find customers indirectly connected to a sanctioned entity"), it queries the graph schema directly rather than relying on semantic similarity.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM can reliably translate natural language intent into valid graph query syntax (Cypher) to execute these traversals.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 7.3.3]: Table 2 shows Graph_RAG maintaining high Context Precision (0.70–1.00) where Vector_RAG drops to near zero for multi-hop tasks.
  - [Section 7.1.1]: The schema explicitly defines edges for money flow and identity linkage, enabling "multi-hop reasoning."
- **Break condition:** If the relationship schema is incomplete or the query requires logic not mapped to an edge type, the traversal fails, and the LLM may hallucinate a connection.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Tool-use (function calling) grounds the LLM in factual database state, reducing hallucination in compliance reports.
- **Mechanism:** The "MCP Server" acts as a middleware layer, exposing specific functions (e.g., `get_customer_risk_summary`, `trace_shared_accounts`). The LLM does not answer from internal weights; it must invoke a tool to retrieve data, which constrains the final generation to the returned JSON/document context.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient instruction-following capability to select the correct tool and synthesize the output without inventing details outside the tool's response.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 7.1.3]: The system prompt forces the model to "cite data from tools" and avoid speculation.
  - [Section 7.3.1]: High Faithfulness scores (0.84–0.95) across levels suggest the generated answers stayed within the bounds of retrieved context.
- **Break condition:** If the tool returns incomplete data or a "null" result, and the LLM attempts to fill the gap to satisfy the user query, faithfulness drops.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Synthetic data generation allows for evaluation of rare compliance scenarios (e.g., sanctions matches) absent in public benchmarks.
- **Mechanism:** Since real KYC data is private, the authors generated a graph with calibrated risk distributions (2% sanctions, 1% PEPs). This allows the system to be stress-tested on rare, high-risk signals (Level 3-5 queries) that would be statistically missing in standard datasets.
- **Core assumption:** The synthetic transaction patterns and entity relationships accurately reflect the topological properties of real-world money laundering networks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 7.2.1]: Describes the construction of a 10,000-node graph with specific "compliance artifacts."
  - [Corpus]: *Advances in Continual Graph Learning...* supports the difficulty of obtaining real data, validating the synthetic approach necessity.
- **Break condition:** If the synthetic "suspicious" patterns are too simplistic or distinct from real laundering typologies, the model will overfit to the synthetic distribution and fail in production.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Graphs & Cypher**
  - **Why needed here:** The core differentiator of this system is the Neo4j graph database. Unlike SQL tables, the graph uses nodes/edges to represent ownership and fund flows directly.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between querying a "join" in SQL versus traversing a "path" in a graph database like Neo4j?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper proposes "Graph RAG." Standard RAG chunks text into vectors; Graph RAG retrieves structured subgraphs. Understanding the former is necessary to appreciate the architectural shift.
  - **Quick check question:** In standard Vector RAG, how does the system handle a question like "Who is the manager of the person who owns Account X?" (Hint: Consider multi-hop limitations).

- **Concept: LLM Tool Use (Agents)**
  - **Why needed here:** The "MCP Server" transforms the LLM from a text generator into an agent that executes functions (`execute_cypher`, `get_customer_profile`).
  - **Quick check question:** What is the risk if an LLM has access to a "delete_database" tool and receives a malicious prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Synthetic/Real Data → Neo4j (Nodes: Customer, Account, Transaction; Edges: OWNS, PERFORMED) → MCP Server (12 Python tools) → GPT-4o-mini (LLM) + System Prompt → Streamlit (Chat UI)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Schema Design:** Define the graph schema (Fig 3) to support the required 12 tool queries.
  2. **Tool Implementation:** Connect the `text_to_cypher` logic so the LLM can convert natural language to graph queries.
  3. **Prompt Engineering:** Implement the system prompt (Fig 4) to force "Direct Answer → Supporting Details" formatting.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Vector vs. Graph RAG:** Vector RAG is easier to set up (just chunk docs) but fails on multi-hop logic (Table 2). Graph RAG requires complex schema maintenance but solves the multi-hop problem.
  - **Privacy vs. Utility:** The authors note real-world deployment requires audit trails and privacy controls absent in this prototype (Section 7 intro).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Context Recall Drop:** In Level 4 (Temporal analysis), Context Recall dropped to 0.40 (Section 7.3.1). This suggests the agent retrieves *some* relevant data but misses the full time-series scope.
  - **Query Translation Errors:** If the LLM generates invalid Cypher syntax, the tool fails, and the agent must recover gracefully (not explicitly covered in error handling).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Reproduction:** Implement the Level 1 "Fact Retrieval" queries to verify the `get_customer_profile` tool matches the paper's 0.95 Faithfulness score.
  2. **Vector vs. Graph Stress Test:** Run a specific "Level 3" multi-hop query (e.g., "Find shared counterparties") against a Vector Store and the Neo4j setup to observe the precision delta.
  3. **Context Window Audit:** Run a "Level 5" narrative synthesis query and measure the token count of the retrieved context to verify if the "Context Precision" drop is due to context window overflow or retrieval noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can federated learning and privacy-preserving computation be effectively implemented to enable cross-institutional AML model training without violating data sovereignty or strict confidentiality regulations like GDPR?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 states that "The data bottleneck requires solutions that balance privacy with collaboration" and explicitly calls for research into federated learning to "unlock cross-institutional detection of laundering networks."
- **Why unresolved:** Current constraints prevent sharing labeled data across organizations due to privacy laws, forcing reliance on synthetic or proprietary datasets that limit generalizability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A successful deployment of a federated learning framework across multiple financial institutions that maintains high detection accuracy (e.g., F1 > 0.90) while passing regulatory privacy audits.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can graph-based XAI techniques, such as counterfactual explanations and attention visualization, produce Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) narratives that satisfy regulatory auditors and meet legal standards for explainability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 notes that "advances in fairness-aware and explainable AI (XAI) are essential" to bridge the gap between high-performing black-box models and the need for decisions to be "justified in ways that satisfy both investigators and regulators."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper highlights that while models achieve high accuracy, they struggle to provide "explanations in regulator-accepted formats," and current SAR automation lacks standardized evaluation for regulatory alignment.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validation showing that AI-generated SAR narratives are accepted by Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) at a rate comparable to or better than human-authored reports.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent can reinforcement learning (RL) and time-aware graph models outperform static supervised models in detecting evolving, adaptive laundering typologies such as "slow smurfing"?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 identifies "adaptive and adversarial robust detection" as a key future direction, proposing RL and temporal transformers to "capture laundering cycles" that static detection misses.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper notes that RL-driven fraud detection shows promise in experimental settings, but "real-world deployment remains limited" due to training complexity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks demonstrating that RL agents maintain high recall (e.g., >0.97) against simulated adversarial attacks where static models fail to detect structural changes in transaction patterns.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can the RAG-Graph architecture be optimized to address the significant drop in Context Precision and Context Recall (to 0.46) observed during complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 7.3.1 reports that while the system excels at simple factual retrieval (Level 1), performance declines at Level 3 (multi-hop reasoning) and Level 4 (temporal analysis), indicating difficulty in reconstructing complex dependencies.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates the performance degradation in the experimental results but does not propose or test specific architectural modifications to fix the retrieval of fine-grained temporal or counterparty evidence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified Graph RAG architecture that achieves Context Recall > 0.80 on Level 3 and Level 4 queries without compromising the high Faithfulness scores observed at simpler levels.

## Limitations
- The system's real-world applicability is constrained by the quality and completeness of the knowledge graph schema, as evaluation relies entirely on synthetic data.
- The paper does not address how the system handles incomplete or noisy real-world data, nor does it discuss scalability to enterprise-scale graphs.
- Privacy and audit trail requirements for production deployment are acknowledged but not implemented, representing a significant gap between prototype and operational system.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The GraphRAG architecture's superiority over vector-based RAG for multi-hop reasoning is well-supported by the experimental results (F1 > 98%, Context Precision > 0.7 for complex queries).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that GraphRAG reduces false positives by 50-90% is based on synthetic data performance and assumes the graph schema captures real-world relationship patterns accurately.
- **Low Confidence**: The system's ability to handle real-world edge cases, such as incomplete data or novel laundering patterns not represented in the synthetic generation logic, remains unverified.

## Next Checks
1. **Real Data Validation**: Deploy the GraphRAG system on a small real-world dataset (with appropriate privacy controls) to assess performance degradation and identify schema gaps compared to synthetic results.
2. **Schema Robustness Test**: Systematically remove or corrupt specific relationship types in the graph (e.g., SHARES_ADDRESS_WITH edges) and measure the impact on multi-hop query accuracy to understand the system's brittleness.
3. **Scalability Benchmark**: Evaluate the agent's response time and accuracy as the graph scales from 10k to 100k+ customers to identify performance bottlenecks and determine if the current tool-calling architecture remains viable.
