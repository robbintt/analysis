# Do All Individual Layers Help? An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.01167
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01167
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Task-Layer Interaction Vectors quantify task sensitivity to layer interference, and test-time layer knockout improves performance across multiple VLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether all layers in Vision-Language Models contribute positively to all tasks, challenging the assumption that every layer is beneficial. Through systematic layer-zeroing experiments across multiple VLMs, the authors identify "task-interfering layers" whose removal improves performance on specific tasks. They develop the Task-Layer Interaction Vector to quantify how tasks respond differently to layer interventions and demonstrate that tasks with similar cognitive requirements exhibit correlated response patterns. The findings lead to TaLo, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically bypasses interfering layers to improve performance.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct controlled experiments where they zero out individual layers in pretrained VLMs and measure task performance changes. They systematically evaluate this across multiple vision-language tasks (ScienceQA, RefCOCO, Maps) and VLMs (Qwen-VL, LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, InternVL). The Task-Layer Interaction Vector is computed as the average absolute performance difference when each layer is zeroed across all tasks. This vector quantifies each task's sensitivity to layer interference and enables comparison of task similarity through correlation analysis. TaLo uses these insights to identify and bypass the most interfering layer at test time without requiring additional training.

## Key Results
- Layer-zeroing experiments reveal task-interfering layers where zeroing a single layer's parameters improves performance by up to 16.6% accuracy
- Tasks requiring similar cognitive abilities (visual reasoning, semantic reasoning, abstract reasoning) exhibit highly correlated response patterns to layer interventions
- TaLo, the proposed test-time adaptation method, achieves significant performance gains across multiple models and datasets without additional training
- Qwen-VL shows 16.6% accuracy improvement on the Maps task in ScienceQA when applying TaLo

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The phenomenon works because different tasks rely on different cognitive processes and feature representations within VLMs. Some layers may contain feature representations that are beneficial for certain tasks but detrimental to others due to interference effects. When a layer's representations conflict with the optimal processing pathway for a specific task, zeroing that layer can remove harmful interference and improve performance. The Task-Layer Interaction Vector captures these differential sensitivities by measuring how much each task's performance changes when specific layers are disabled.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Model architecture**: VLMs combine vision encoders with language models, requiring understanding of how multimodal representations interact across layers
- **Task-specific feature representations**: Different tasks extract and process visual and linguistic features differently, leading to varying sensitivities to layer interventions
- **Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning paradigms**: The study focuses on test-time adaptation without training, contrasting with traditional fine-tuning approaches
- **Cognitive task categorization**: Visual reasoning, semantic reasoning, and abstract reasoning represent distinct cognitive requirements that may map to different model capabilities
- **Interference vs. facilitation**: Not all layers contribute positively; some may actively harm performance for specific tasks
- **Test-time adaptation methods**: Dynamic adjustment of model behavior during inference without retraining

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Vision Encoder -> Cross-Modal Fusion Layers -> Language Model -> Output

**Critical Path**
Input image and text → Vision encoder features → Fusion layers (potentially interfering) → Language model reasoning → Task output

**Design Tradeoffs**
Zeroing layers provides computational efficiency and task-specific optimization without retraining, but requires identifying the correct interfering layer. The approach trades potential performance loss from disabling useful features against gains from removing harmful interference.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degradation when the wrong layer is zeroed, or when tasks require features distributed across multiple layers. Tasks with complex multimodal reasoning may be particularly sensitive to layer removal.

**First Experiments**
1. Validate layer-zeroing effects on a simple visual question-answering task to confirm interference exists
2. Compare Task-Layer Interaction Vectors across different VLM architectures to identify common patterns
3. Test whether manually selecting interfering layers based on task requirements improves performance over random selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Focus on zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting may miss performance gains achievable through fine-tuning
- Task-Layer Interaction Vectors may conflate different interference mechanisms through absolute performance differences
- Dynamic layer selection at test time may not consistently improve performance across all task types
- The computational overhead of interference detection at test time may offset performance gains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Layer interference effects are real and measurable across all tested models and tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Task similarity based on cognitive requirements predicts interference patterns
- **Low confidence**: Dynamic layer selection at test time consistently improves performance across all scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test whether fine-tuning the identified non-interfering layers yields better performance than test-time adaptation, comparing computational efficiency trade-offs
2. Replicate findings across additional VLM architectures (e.g., SigLIP-based models, open-source CLIP variants) to verify model-agnostic interference patterns
3. Investigate whether layer interference correlates with specific attention head patterns or feature map characteristics, providing mechanistic explanations for the observed effects
