# HapticCap: A Multimodal Dataset and Task for Understanding User Experience of Vibration Haptic Signals

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.13318
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13318
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Introduces HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated multimodal dataset for vibration haptic signals, with 92,070 haptic-text pairs from 235 users describing 2,736 unique vibrations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated multimodal dataset for vibration haptic signals, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs collected from 235 users describing 2,736 unique vibrations across sensory, emotional, and associative dimensions. The dataset addresses key challenges in haptic design by providing rich, multidimensional textual descriptions of user experiences with vibration signals. The authors propose a novel haptic-caption retrieval task and evaluate it using a supervised contrastive learning framework that aligns text and haptic representations. Experiments show that combining the T5 language model with the AST audio model achieves the best performance, particularly when models are trained separately for each description category. This work provides a foundational dataset and baseline methods for understanding and designing meaningful haptic experiences.

## Method Summary
The authors collected vibration signals and corresponding human descriptions across three categories (sensory, emotional, associative) from 235 users. They developed a supervised contrastive learning framework that learns joint embeddings between vibration signals and text descriptions. The framework uses pre-trained audio models (specifically AST) to extract features from vibration signals and pre-trained language models (T5, LLaMA, Mistral) for text processing. Models are trained to align specific vibration embeddings with their corresponding text descriptions within each category, using composite labels that combine haptic IDs and semantic categories.

## Key Results
- The T5+AST model achieves the highest retrieval performance with P@10 scores of 16.6% overall, 17.4% for sensory, 16.3% for emotional, and 15.2% for associative descriptions
- Category-specific model specialization (training separate models for sensory, emotional, associative) outperforms unified models
- Data filtering based on inter-annotator agreement significantly improves retrieval performance, increasing P@10 from 13.1% to 16.6%
- Transfer learning from audio to haptics using pre-trained AST models outperforms training encoders from scratch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Pre-trained audio models (specifically AST) can function as effective feature extractors for vibration haptic signals, outperforming models trained from scratch.
- **Mechanism:** Vibration signals are treated as 1D waveforms analogous to audio. The AST model converts these into log Mel spectrograms, capturing time-frequency patterns (rhythm, attack, decay) that likely correlate with human tactile perception better than raw waveform analysis.
- **Core assumption:** The perceptual mapping between auditory rhythm/intensity and tactile rhythm/intensity is sufficiently similar for transfer learning to occur without extensive domain adaptation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.2] "vibration and audio signals are both one-dimensional signals and share key temporal and frequency-based characteristics... prior work has shown perceptual similarities between the two modalities."
  - [Section 6.2] "AST encoder processes spectrograms, capturing frequency-time patterns... In contrast, Wav2Vec and EnCodec use raw waveforms... and lack global frequency-time representations."
  - [Appendix A.1] Shows performance drops significantly when training a haptic-specific encoder from scratch compared to fine-tuning AST.
- **Break condition:** If the vibration signals contain high-frequency components that exceed the sampling resolution of the pre-trained audio models, or if the tactile feedback relies purely on spatial (rather than temporal) patterns, this transfer mechanism would likely degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Joint embeddings can be learned by supervising contrastive loss with composite labels combining signal identity and semantic category.
- **Mechanism:** The framework constructs labels by concatenating a Haptic ID and a Category (e.g., "F1_sensory"). This forces the model to pull the specific vibration embedding closer to text embeddings in that specific category, while pushing it away from texts of the *same* vibration but a *different* category (and vice versa), creating distinct semantic subspaces.
- **Core assumption:** Sensory, emotional, and associative descriptions are distinct enough that a single vibration embedding can be meaningfully projected into different text subspaces without collapsing the representation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.3] "we combine the category and haptic ID as the label for supervised contrastive learning... linking the haptic signal to its descriptions within a specific category."
  - [Figure 5] Visualizes the pairing mechanism where sensory, emotional, and associative texts are contrasted against the vibration.
- **Break condition:** If user descriptions for "sensory" and "emotional" categories are semantically overlapping (e.g., "intense" describes both a sensation and an emotion) to a high degree, the distinct clustering required by the composite label would fail to form.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Category-specific model specialization (training separate models for sensory, emotional, associative) improves retrieval performance over a unified model.
- **Mechanism:** By training separate models, the system avoids the "averaging" effect of trying to align a single vibration representation with divergent semantic manifolds (physical descriptors vs. metaphors). This allows the "Sensory" model to focus on time-domain features (rhythm, intensity) and the "Associative" model to focus on higher-level semantic patterns (heartbeat, engine).
- **Core assumption:** The variance in user descriptions is higher *between* categories than *within* categories, justifying the parameter overhead of specialized models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "...especially when separately trained for each description category."
  - [Section 6.2] "T5 with AST consistently outperforms others across multiple metrics... particularly excelling in all three categories [when trained individually]."
- **Break condition:** In low-data regimes where training three separate models leads to overfitting, a unified model might theoretically outperform the specialized approach, though the paper does not show this.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core training objective. Unlike triplet loss, SupCon handles multiple positives (multiple valid descriptions for one vibration) and negatives efficiently.
  - **Quick check question:** Given 10 descriptions for one vibration, does the loss treat all 10 as valid positives for that vibration embedding? (Yes, if they share the label).

- **Concept: Transfer Learning (Audio → Haptics)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding why AST (Audio Spectrogram Transformer) works for touch. You must grasp that vibrations and sound share physics (frequency, amplitude, time).
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a model trained on speech (Wav2Vec) perform worse on vibrations than a model trained on general audio events (AST), as seen in the results? (Speech has specific spectral structures not present in arbitrary vibrations).

- **Concept: Human Annotation Agreement**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on filtering "low agreement" data to boost performance. You need to understand that haptic perception is subjective and noisy.
  - **Quick check question:** If two users describe a vibration as "fast" and "slow" respectively, how does the T5-encoder filtering mechanism handle this? (It calculates cosine similarity; if < 0.5, the description is filtered as an outlier).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Vibration Signal (1D array) -> AST Encoder (spectrogram) -> Projection Head -> Shared Embedding Space <- Projection Head <- T5/LLaMA/Mistral Encoder <- Text Description

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Preprocessing:** Convert vibration to spectrogram (AST) or raw waveform.
  2. **Encoding:** Pass inputs through frozen/unfrozen encoder layers.
  3. **Projection:** Map to shared embedding space.
  4. **Retrieval:** Calculate Cosine Similarity between projected haptic vector and text corpus.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **AST vs. Wav2Vec:** AST (spectrogram) > Wav2Vec (waveform) for this task, likely because human haptic perception aligns better with frequency-time representations than raw pressure waves.
  - **T5 vs. LLaMA:** T5 generally edges out LLaMA in retrieval, suggesting encoder-decoder architectures might handle the "representation extraction" task better than decoder-only LLMs in this specific contrastive setup.
  - **Data Filtering:** Removing low-agreement data improves P@10 by ~20%, but reduces dataset size by ~25% (92k to 68k pairs).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Associative Gap:** The "Associative" category consistently underperforms (P@10 ~15% vs ~17% for Sensory). This indicates linking vibrations to metaphors (e.g., "car engine") is harder than linking to physical traits (e.g., "fast").
  - **Zero-Shot Failure:** Models trained on "Sensory" fail to retrieve "Emotional" descriptions (Table 5), proving the embeddings are not cross-category generalizable without specific training.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Establish Baseline:** Implement T5+AST on the "High Agreement" subset. Verify if P@10 reaches ~16.6 (Table 2) to validate the pipeline.
  2. **Ablation on Audio Transfer:** Train a haptic encoder from scratch (Appendix A.1) vs. fine-tuning AST. Confirm the performance drop to verify the transfer learning hypothesis.
  3. **Inter-Annotator Agreement Analysis:** Visualize the "Low Agreement" filtered descriptions. Check if they are genuinely noisy or simply creative outlier descriptions that the model discards.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can an end-to-end generative framework effectively produce novel, accurate textual descriptions for vibration signals, surpassing the limitations of the current retrieval-based approach?
- To what extent can feature alignment methods, such as adversarial domain adaptation, mitigate the performance gap when models trained on one description category (e.g., sensory) are applied to others (e.g., emotional or associative)?
- How does linguistic and cultural background influence the perception and description of haptic signals, and does the current English-only dataset introduce bias?

## Limitations
- Subjectivity in human perception and the filtering mechanism may eliminate valid but diverse interpretations
- Limited real-world validation demonstrating practical haptic design benefits
- Domain transfer limitations for high-frequency vibrations or spatially complex haptic patterns

## Confidence
**High Confidence:**
- AST-based models significantly outperform raw waveform models for vibration representation
- Category-specific models outperform unified models for retrieval
- Data filtering based on inter-annotator agreement improves retrieval performance

**Medium Confidence:**
- Vibration and audio signals share sufficient perceptual characteristics for effective transfer learning
- The supervised contrastive learning framework effectively learns joint embeddings
- The associative category's lower performance indicates fundamental difficulty in mapping vibrations to metaphors

## Next Checks
1. **Error Analysis on Low-Agreement Descriptions:** Conduct qualitative analysis of the filtered low-agreement descriptions to determine whether they represent genuine perceptual outliers or valid alternative interpretations.

2. **Cross-Modal Generalization Test:** Evaluate model performance on a held-out set of vibrations that were designed based on the retrieved descriptions.

3. **High-Frequency Vibration Performance Analysis:** Systematically test model performance on vibrations containing frequencies above 1 kHz to identify the boundaries of the audio-to-haptics transfer learning assumption.
