# Argos: Agentic Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Autonomous Rule Generation via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14170
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 28.3% improvement in F1 score

## Executive Summary
Argos is a time-series anomaly detection system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate explainable and reproducible anomaly detection rules. The system addresses the challenge of simultaneously achieving explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy in anomaly detection. By employing an agent-based pipeline with feedback loops, Argos iteratively trains and refines detection rules. During deployment, these rules are aggregated with existing anomaly detectors to ensure high accuracy.

## Method Summary
Argos employs an agent-based pipeline that uses LLMs to generate and refine anomaly detection rules through iterative feedback loops. The system combines autonomous rule generation with traditional anomaly detectors during deployment, creating a hybrid approach that balances explainability with performance. The LLM component generates interpretable rules that can be traced back to their decision-making process, while the aggregation mechanism ensures that these rules work in concert with existing detection methods to maintain high accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 28.3% improvement in F1 score on internal datasets
- Demonstrates 9.5% improvement on public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Successfully addresses the challenge of explainable, reproducible, and autonomous anomaly detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Argos leverages LLMs' ability to understand complex patterns and generate human-readable rules that capture domain-specific knowledge. The agent-based pipeline enables iterative refinement of these rules through feedback loops, allowing the system to improve its detection capabilities over time. By combining autonomous rule generation with existing anomaly detectors during deployment, Argos achieves both high accuracy and explainability. The LLM component provides the semantic understanding needed to create meaningful rules, while the feedback mechanism ensures continuous improvement and adaptation to new patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Time-Series Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in sequential data that deviate from expected behavior. Needed to establish the core problem domain and baseline methods. Quick check: Review existing anomaly detection algorithms and their limitations.

**Explainable AI**: Techniques that make AI decision-making transparent and interpretable to humans. Needed to address the black-box nature of many modern detection systems. Quick check: Examine current methods for explaining model predictions.

**Large Language Models in Analytics**: Using LLMs to understand and generate rules for data analysis tasks. Needed to leverage LLMs' pattern recognition and natural language generation capabilities. Quick check: Test LLM performance on simple rule generation tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Input -> LLM Rule Generator -> Rule Refinement Agent -> Anomaly Detector Aggregation -> Output

**Critical Path**: Data flows from input through LLM rule generation, then to the refinement agent where rules are iteratively improved. The final rules are aggregated with existing detectors before producing the final output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades some computational overhead for explainability and autonomy. The hybrid approach balances the strengths of autonomous rule generation with the reliability of established detection methods.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- LLM-generated rules may be too generic or fail to capture domain-specific nuances
- Rule refinement may get stuck in local optima
- Aggregation mechanism might not effectively combine different detection approaches

**First Experiments**:
1. Test rule generation on a simple time-series dataset to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate the refinement agent's ability to improve initial rules through feedback
3. Measure the performance impact of the aggregation mechanism with different combinations of detectors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on two datasets, potentially limiting generalizability
- No detailed analysis of computational overhead for real-time deployment
- Lack of quantitative evaluation of explainability from domain expert perspective

## Confidence

**Performance claims (F1 score improvements)**: Medium confidence
**Explainability assertions**: Medium confidence
**Autonomous rule generation capabilities**: High confidence
**System reliability in production environments**: Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive testing across diverse time-series datasets from different domains (finance, healthcare, IoT) to validate generalizability of performance improvements
2. Measure and report computational overhead and latency introduced by LLM-based rule generation during both training and deployment phases
3. Perform user studies with domain experts to quantitatively assess the quality and understandability of generated anomaly detection rules
