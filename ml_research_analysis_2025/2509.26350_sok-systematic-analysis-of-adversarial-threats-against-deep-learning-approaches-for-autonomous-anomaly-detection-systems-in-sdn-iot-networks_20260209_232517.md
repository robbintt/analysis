# SoK: Systematic analysis of adversarial threats against deep learning approaches for autonomous anomaly detection systems in SDN-IoT networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26350
- Reference count: 40
- This SoK study systematically analyzes adversarial threats targeting deep learning-based autonomous anomaly detection (AAD) systems in SDN-IoT networks

## Executive Summary
This systematic study of knowledge (SoK) analyzes adversarial threats targeting deep learning-based autonomous anomaly detection (AAD) systems in SDN-IoT networks. The research introduces a structured threat model that categorizes attacks into data-level, model-level, and hybrid threats, while evaluating white-box, black-box, and grey-box attack strategies across multiple benchmark datasets. The study reveals that adversarial attacks can significantly reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference attacks causing the most substantial impact and C&W and DeepFool achieving high evasion success rates.

The research also demonstrates that while adversarial training enhances system robustness against attacks, it introduces significant computational overhead that limits real-time deployment in SDN-IoT environments. To address these challenges, the study proposes adaptive countermeasures including real-time adversarial mitigation techniques, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks. The comprehensive approach to attack categorization, impact assessment, and defense evaluation provides a foundational reference for improving the security of DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT networks.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic approach to analyze adversarial threats against deep learning-based autonomous anomaly detection systems in SDN-IoT networks. The methodology involves developing a structured threat model that categorizes attacks into data-level, model-level, and hybrid threats, while evaluating three attack strategies (white-box, black-box, and grey-box) across benchmark datasets including CICIDS2017, InSDN, and CICIoT2023. The research conducts comprehensive experiments to measure attack impact on detection accuracy and evaluates the effectiveness of adversarial training as a defense mechanism, analyzing both its robustness benefits and computational overhead limitations.

## Key Results
- Adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4% in deep learning-based AAD systems
- Membership Inference attacks cause the most significant accuracy reduction, while C&W and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates
- Adversarial training enhances robustness but introduces high computational overhead limiting real-time deployment in SDN-IoT environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic analysis approach works by providing a structured framework for understanding how different types of adversarial attacks can compromise deep learning-based anomaly detection systems. By categorizing threats into data-level, model-level, and hybrid attacks, and evaluating them under white-box, black-box, and grey-box scenarios, the study creates a comprehensive threat landscape that reveals vulnerabilities in SDN-IoT security architectures. The mechanism leverages benchmark datasets to quantify attack impacts and demonstrate how specific attack strategies like Membership Inference, C&W, and DeepFool can effectively evade detection mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial Threat Modeling**: Understanding how to systematically categorize attacks (data-level, model-level, hybrid) is essential for developing comprehensive security frameworks that address all potential attack vectors in SDN-IoT environments.
- **Attack Strategy Classification**: Knowledge of white-box, black-box, and grey-box attack strategies enables security researchers to anticipate and defend against different levels of attacker knowledge and system access.
- **Detection Accuracy Metrics**: Measuring detection accuracy reduction under adversarial conditions provides quantitative benchmarks for evaluating system robustness and identifying critical vulnerabilities.
- **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Understanding the trade-offs between security enhancement through adversarial training and system performance is crucial for practical deployment in resource-constrained SDN-IoT networks.
- **Real-time Security Adaptation**: Developing mechanisms for real-time adversarial mitigation and adaptive retraining is necessary for maintaining security in dynamic network environments where attack patterns evolve continuously.
- **Explainable AI Integration**: Incorporating explainable AI frameworks helps security analysts understand attack patterns and system behavior, enabling more effective response strategies and improved trust in autonomous detection systems.

## Architecture Onboarding
The SDN-IoT network architecture with DL-based AAD systems follows a critical path where network traffic flows through the SDN controller, which routes data to the anomaly detection component for analysis. The DL model processes incoming traffic patterns to identify anomalies, while the adversarial threat model operates at multiple levels: data manipulation before reaching the detection system, model manipulation through gradient-based attacks, or hybrid approaches combining both. Key design tradeoffs include balancing detection accuracy against computational overhead, with adversarial training providing robustness at the cost of real-time performance. Failure signatures include sudden drops in detection accuracy (up to 48.4%), increased false negatives in anomaly detection, and system resource exhaustion during intensive adversarial training processes.

Critical path: Network Traffic → SDN Controller → DL-Based AAD System → Security Response
Design tradeoffs: Detection Accuracy ↔ Computational Overhead
Failure signatures: Accuracy reduction up to 48.4%, increased false negatives, resource exhaustion

First experiments to run:
1. Deploy the DL-based AAD system on CICIDS2017 dataset and measure baseline detection accuracy under normal conditions
2. Implement Membership Inference attack on the trained model and quantify the reduction in detection accuracy
3. Apply adversarial training to the same model and measure the computational overhead while comparing detection accuracy against baseline and attacked scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reported detection accuracy reduction of up to 48.4% may not generalize across all DL architectures and network conditions
- Computational overhead analysis for adversarial training is qualitative rather than quantitative, lacking specific resource consumption metrics
- Proposed countermeasures remain largely conceptual without empirical validation or detailed implementation specifications
- Focus on benchmark datasets may not fully capture the diversity and complexity of real-world SDN-IoT deployments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Structured threat model categorization (data-level, model-level, hybrid) and attack strategy classification (white-box, black-box, grey-box) are methodologically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Attack impact quantification (48.4% accuracy reduction) is based on specific experimental conditions and may vary with different implementations
- **Low confidence**: Proposed countermeasures lack empirical validation and detailed implementation specifications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical validation of proposed countermeasures through real-time implementation in a controlled SDN-IoT testbed, measuring both detection accuracy and computational overhead under varying attack scenarios
2. Expand attack evaluation to include additional adversarial techniques (such as adversarial patch attacks and feature-space attacks) and assess their impact on different DL architectures beyond those tested
3. Perform cross-dataset validation by testing the same attack methodologies on non-benchmark SDN-IoT network traffic to verify the generalizability of the findings
