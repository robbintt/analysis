# Evaluating Robustness in Latent Diffusion Models via Embedding Level Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07706
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07706
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Embedding-level augmentations applied to token embeddings improve adversarial robustness in latent diffusion models while maintaining image fidelity, with CLIP-based Wasserstein distance improvements averaging ~65% on perturbed prompts.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses robustness in latent diffusion models (LDMs) by introducing embedding-level augmentations applied after the text encoder and before the denoising network. The proposed AELIF method applies either masking or Gaussian noise convolution to token embeddings to simulate real-world textual errors such as typos or grammatical inconsistencies. When integrated into DreamBooth fine-tuning, these augmentations improve model robustness to adversarial prompts while maintaining image fidelity. Quantitative evaluations using CLIP-based Wasserstein distances show that AELIF-trained models generate outputs more aligned with training data than baseline models, with robustness improvements averaging ~65% across SDXL and SD3 models on perturbed prompts. The study also proposes dedicated evaluation pipelines to measure both data augmentation benefits and adversarial robustness, contributing a framework for standardized robustness testing in generative image models.

## Method Summary
The method introduces embedding-level augmentations applied after the text encoder and before the denoising network in latent diffusion models. Specifically, AELIF applies either masking or Gaussian noise convolution to token embeddings to simulate real-world textual errors such as typos or grammatical inconsistencies. These augmentations are integrated into DreamBooth fine-tuning and evaluated for their impact on robustness to adversarial prompts while maintaining image fidelity. The study uses CLIP-based Wasserstein distances as a quantitative metric to assess the alignment of generated outputs with training data, demonstrating robustness improvements averaging ~65% across SDXL and SD3 models.

## Key Results
- AELIF-trained models show robustness improvements averaging ~65% across SDXL and SD3 models on perturbed prompts.
- CLIP-based Wasserstein distances indicate generated outputs are more aligned with training data compared to baseline models.
- Integration of embedding-level augmentations into DreamBooth fine-tuning maintains image fidelity while enhancing adversarial robustness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind AELIF's effectiveness lies in its ability to simulate real-world textual errors at the embedding level, forcing the model to learn robust representations that can handle noisy or adversarial input. By applying masking or Gaussian noise convolution to token embeddings, the model is exposed to perturbed text during training, which improves its ability to generate coherent outputs even when faced with adversarial prompts. This approach leverages the latent space of LDMs to enhance generalization without requiring extensive retraining or architectural changes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**: Generative models that operate in a compressed latent space, offering computational efficiency and high-quality image generation. Why needed: LDMs form the basis for the robustness evaluation and augmentation framework.
- **Embedding-Level Augmentations**: Techniques that modify token embeddings to simulate textual errors, such as masking or adding noise. Why needed: These augmentations introduce controlled perturbations to improve model robustness.
- **DreamBooth Fine-Tuning**: A method for personalizing generative models using a small set of images. Why needed: AELIF is integrated into DreamBooth to evaluate its impact on robustness while maintaining image fidelity.
- **CLIP-Based Wasserstein Distances**: A metric for quantifying the alignment between generated outputs and training data using CLIP embeddings. Why needed: This metric provides a quantitative measure of robustness and fidelity.
- **Adversarial Prompts**: Deliberately crafted input prompts designed to challenge or mislead generative models. Why needed: Adversarial prompts serve as a benchmark for evaluating model robustness.
- **Evaluation Pipelines**: Standardized frameworks for assessing data augmentation benefits and adversarial robustness. Why needed: These pipelines ensure reproducibility and comparability of results.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Text Encoder -> Embedding Augmentation (AELIF) -> Denoising Network -> Latent Diffusion Model
- **Critical Path**: The embedding augmentation step is critical for introducing robustness, as it directly modifies the input to the denoising network.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing robustness gains with image fidelity; embedding-level augmentations must not degrade output quality.
- **Failure Signatures**: Reduced image quality or misalignment with training data if augmentations are too aggressive or poorly tuned.
- **First Experiments**: 
  1. Test AELIF robustness on a wider range of text perturbations, including real-world typos, grammatical errors, and out-of-distribution prompts.
  2. Evaluate trade-offs between robustness and other image generation metrics (e.g., diversity, semantic relevance) under non-adversarial conditions.
  3. Extend the AELIF framework to additional LDM architectures and fine-tuning scenarios to assess scalability and robustness transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions, including the generalizability of AELIF's robustness gains beyond the tested adversarial prompt set and the specific architectures evaluated (SDXL, SD3). Additionally, the study does not address potential trade-offs between robustness and other image generation qualities such as creativity or semantic coherence under non-adversarial conditions. The embedding-level augmentations are applied in a controlled manner, and their effectiveness under more varied or extreme perturbations is uncertain.

## Limitations
- The generalizability of AELIF's robustness gains is limited to the tested adversarial prompt set and specific architectures (SDXL, SD3).
- The study does not thoroughly explore the impact of embedding-level augmentations on diverse downstream applications or more complex, real-world textual errors.
- Potential trade-offs between robustness and other image generation qualities, such as creativity or semantic coherence under non-adversarial conditions, are not addressed.

## Confidence
- **Core robustness claims**: Medium - supported by quantitative improvements in CLIP-based Wasserstein distances and adversarial robustness (~65%) but limited to specific architectures and prompt sets.
- **Generalizability**: Low - the study's experimental scope and reliance on synthetic perturbations limit direct extrapolation to broader use cases.
- **Trade-off analysis**: Low - the study does not explore potential trade-offs between robustness and other image generation qualities.

## Next Checks
1. Test AELIF robustness on a wider range of text perturbations, including real-world typos, grammatical errors, and out-of-distribution prompts, using diverse datasets beyond those in the study.
2. Evaluate trade-offs between robustness and other image generation metrics (e.g., diversity, semantic relevance) under non-adversarial conditions to ensure no unintended degradation.
3. Extend the AELIF framework to additional LDM architectures and fine-tuning scenarios to assess scalability and robustness transfer.
