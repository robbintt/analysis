# BifrostRAG: Bridging Dual Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Construction Safety

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13625
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Dual knowledge graph-enhanced RAG system achieving 92.8% precision, 85.5% recall, and 87.3% F1 on multi-hop construction safety questions

## Executive Summary
BifrostRAG introduces a novel dual knowledge graph approach to address the challenge of multi-hop question answering in construction safety regulations. The system combines an Entity Network Graph (ENG) for semantic relationships with a Document Navigator Graph (DNG) for document structure, enabling hybrid retrieval that leverages both graph traversal and vector-based semantic search. This architecture allows the system to navigate complex regulatory texts and synthesize fragmented information across multiple documents, achieving superior performance compared to existing solutions.

The evaluation demonstrates BifrostRAG's effectiveness in handling complex regulatory queries that require reasoning across multiple knowledge sources. By maintaining complementary representations of knowledge through ENG and DNG, the system can efficiently retrieve relevant information while preserving contextual relationships essential for accurate multi-hop reasoning in safety-critical domains.

## Method Summary
BifrostRAG employs a dual knowledge graph architecture where the Entity Network Graph (ENG) captures semantic relationships between safety concepts, regulations, and entities, while the Document Navigator Graph (DNG) maintains structural relationships between documents and their sections. The hybrid retrieval mechanism combines graph traversal algorithms with vector-based semantic search to locate relevant information across multiple hops. During inference, the system first uses DNG to identify relevant document sections, then employs ENG to traverse semantic relationships and synthesize answers from fragmented information sources.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92.8% precision, 85.5% recall, and 87.3% F1 score on multi-hop question answering
- Outperformed state-of-the-art RAG solutions by significant margins
- Demonstrated robust capability in navigating complex regulatory texts and synthesizing fragmented information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual knowledge graph approach addresses a fundamental limitation of traditional RAG systems: their inability to effectively handle multi-hop reasoning across fragmented regulatory documents. By maintaining both semantic relationships (ENG) and document structure (DNG), BifrostRAG can perform targeted graph traversals that respect both the meaning of safety concepts and the hierarchical organization of regulations. This enables the system to identify relevant document sections through DNG, then traverse semantic connections via ENG to synthesize comprehensive answers from multiple knowledge sources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entity Network Graph (ENG)**: Captures semantic relationships between safety concepts and regulations - needed to preserve contextual meaning across documents; quick check: verify relationship accuracy between safety entities
- **Document Navigator Graph (DNG)**: Maintains structural relationships between documents and sections - needed for efficient document-level navigation; quick check: validate section-to-document mapping accuracy
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines graph traversal with vector search - needed to leverage complementary strengths of both approaches; quick check: compare retrieval performance with single-method approaches
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Enables synthesis across multiple knowledge sources - needed for complex regulatory queries; quick check: test with increasing hop distances
- **Graph-based Document Organization**: Structures regulatory texts as navigable graphs - needed to preserve document context; quick check: verify structural integrity after graph construction
- **Semantic Vector Search**: Provides semantic matching capabilities - needed for handling query variations; quick check: evaluate semantic similarity accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Hybrid Retriever (DNG + ENG) -> Evidence Selection -> Answer Synthesis -> Response

**Critical Path**: User query flows through hybrid retrieval system combining DNG (for document navigation) and ENG (for semantic traversal), with evidence selection and synthesis stages producing the final answer.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Dual graphs provide complementary strengths but increase maintenance complexity and computational overhead. The hybrid retrieval approach balances precision (through graph traversal) with recall (through vector search), though at the cost of increased system complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Graph traversal failures when semantic relationships are incomplete or incorrect
- Vector search limitations when regulatory terminology differs from training data
- Document structure inconsistencies leading to incorrect section identification
- Maintenance challenges as regulations are updated and knowledge graphs become outdated

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test single-hop retrieval accuracy using only DNG to validate document navigation capabilities
2. Evaluate semantic relationship quality by testing ENG-only multi-hop reasoning on known regulatory connections
3. Measure hybrid retrieval performance improvement over individual component baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused solely on construction safety regulations, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Dual knowledge graph architecture introduces significant maintenance and scalability challenges
- Limited discussion of computational overhead and performance degradation at scale
- Potential robustness concerns when handling diverse query types and complexity levels

## Confidence

**Performance claims on benchmark dataset**: High
**Domain-specific effectiveness**: Medium  
**Generalizability to other domains**: Low
**Scalability assessment**: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation by testing BifrostRAG on regulatory datasets from healthcare, finance, or environmental compliance to assess generalizability beyond construction safety
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of ENG and DNG components and determine if the dual-graph approach provides significant advantages over single-graph alternatives
3. Evaluate system performance with incrementally larger knowledge graphs (10x, 100x current size) to assess scalability, response time degradation, and maintenance overhead in realistic deployment scenarios
