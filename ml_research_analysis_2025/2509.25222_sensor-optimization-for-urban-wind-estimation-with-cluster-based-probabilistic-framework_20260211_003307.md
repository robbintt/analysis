# Sensor optimization for urban wind estimation with cluster-based probabilistic framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25222
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25222
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Physics-informed machine learning framework for estimating wind velocities along drone trajectories in urban environments, achieving ~19.22% average estimation error

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for estimating wind velocities along drone trajectories in complex urban environments. The core innovation is a cluster-based probabilistic model that partitions the flow field into subdomains, applies clustering to each, and establishes inference matrices to correlate cluster states across subdomains. This approach enables scalable estimation with computational cost proportional to domain complexity, allows extrapolation beyond training data, and enables sensor optimization for minimal estimation uncertainty. The framework is demonstrated on a three-building cluster using RANS simulations with wind speeds of 7.9-20.7 m/s from all directions.

## Method Summary
The framework combines physics-based domain decomposition with cluster-based reduced-order modeling. The flow field is partitioned into subdomains around each building, where local flow structures exhibit stronger internal coherence. Within each subdomain, clustering algorithms (K-Means with K=20) identify recurrent flow states from RANS simulation data. Reynolds number-based non-dimensionalization (u⁺ = u/U∞) enables extrapolation beyond training conditions. An inference matrix P captures conditional probabilities between cluster states across subdomains. Online estimation uses kNN to map sensor readings to cluster centroids, then applies P to estimate target velocities via probability-weighted centroid expectations.

## Key Results
- Optimized sensor achieved an average estimation error of 19.22% across the testing set
- 60% of cases achieved estimation error below 20%, with 90% below 30%
- Estimated velocity fields closely matched reference data along drone trajectories
- Reynolds number scaling enabled successful extrapolation beyond training wind speeds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Physics-based domain decomposition enables scalable estimation by partitioning complex flow into subdomains with stronger internal coherence.
- Mechanism: The flow field is partitioned into subdomains (Ω₁, Ω₂, Ω₃) around each building. Within each subdomain, wakes and local structures exhibit stronger correlation, reducing dimensionality compared to a monolithic representation. Clustering is applied independently within each subdomain, and cross-subdomain dependencies are captured by an inference matrix.
- Core assumption: Localized flow structures (e.g., building wakes) are significantly more coherent within subdomains than across the full domain.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The key enablers are... (2) a physics-based domain decomposition..."; [section III.B.1] "Directly modeling the entire urban flow field as a whole is prohibitively complex... when the flow is narrowed to individual buildings, the associated wakes exhibit strong structural correlations..."
- Break condition: Performance degrades if subdomains are not aligned with physical coherence or if strong inter-building wake interactions are not captured by the inference matrix.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reynolds number-based non-dimensionalization supports extrapolation beyond training velocities.
- Mechanism: Velocities and sensor signals are normalized by freestream velocity U∞ (u⁺ = u/U∞, s⁺ = s/U∞). At high Reynolds numbers, non-dimensional quantities become weakly Reynolds-number dependent, allowing learned relationships to generalize across different absolute wind speeds.
- Core assumption: The flow regime is sufficiently high-Re that non-dimensional features are approximately Reynolds-number independent.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...(1) a Reynolds number-based scaling... extrapolates beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities."; [section III.A] "All velocity and sensor data are non-dimensionalized with respect to the oncoming wind velocity..."
- Break condition: Extrapolation fails if operating conditions fall into regimes where scaling laws break down (e.g., very low Re or stratified flows).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A probabilistic inference matrix enables flow estimation from sparse sensors with quantified uncertainty.
- Mechanism: After clustering each subdomain, an inference matrix P encodes conditional probabilities P(clusterⱼ in Ω_target | clusterᵢ in Ω_sensor). Online, a sensor reading maps to a cluster via kNN; the matrix yields a probability distribution over target clusters; the final estimate is the expectation over centroids.
- Core assumption: Discrete clusters capture essential flow variability, and cross-subdomain dependencies are adequately represented by static conditional probabilities.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...(5) a multi-variate probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates."; [section III.B.3] "The spatial correlations between subdomains are captured by the inference matrix P, which encodes the conditional probabilities..."
- Break condition: Errors increase if K is too small (underrepresentation), training data are non-representative, or conditional dependencies are non-stationary across conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cluster-based Reduced-Order Modeling (CROM)**
  - Why needed here: The framework represents complex flows via discrete recurrent states (clusters); understanding CROM is prerequisite to grasping inference and estimation.
  - Quick check question: How does representing flow snapshots as discrete clusters reduce representation complexity?

- Concept: **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for Classification**
  - Why needed here: kNN maps real-time sensor readings to known cluster centroids during online inference.
  - Quick check question: During online estimation, what does kNN take as input and what does it output?

- Concept: **Conditional Probability and Expectation**
  - Why needed here: Estimation uses a conditional probability distribution over clusters; the final velocity is an expectation over centroids.
  - Quick check question: If P gives 70% probability for cluster j and 30% for cluster k, how is the final velocity estimate computed from centroids c_j and c_k?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Offline:**
    1. Data Generation: RANS simulations across wind speeds/directions.
    2. Preprocessing: Non-dimensionalize by U∞.
    3. Domain Decomposition: Partition into physics-based subdomains.
    4. Clustering: Cluster snapshots within each subdomain (K centroids).
    5. Inference Matrix: Compute conditional probability matrix P between subdomain cluster states.
  - **Online:**
    1. Input: Sensor signal s at location x_s.
    2. Sensor-side clustering: kNN assigns sensor reading to nearest centroid in its subdomain.
    3. Cross-subdomain inference: Use P to get probability distribution over clusters in target subdomain.
    4. Estimation: Compute expected velocity at target location.
  - **Optimization:** Evaluate candidate sensor locations over training set; select location minimizing average estimation error.

- Critical path: Clustering quality (choice of K, representativeness) → fidelity of inference matrix P → online estimation accuracy. Poor clustering or non-representative data breaks the pipeline.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of clusters K: Higher K reduces representation error but increases inference matrix size and sparsity.
  - Subdomain size: Smaller domains capture local effects but require modeling more inter-domain dependencies.
  - Sensor placement: Optimized for average-case uncertainty; may underperform on specific outlier conditions.

- Failure signatures:
  - High test error: Likely insufficient training diversity, poor subdomain definition, or K too low.
  - Extrapolation failure: Non-dimensionalization invalid in new Re regime.
  - Unstable inference: Sensor readings fall in poorly sampled regions of cluster space.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary K (e.g., 10, 20, 50) and measure representation and estimation error to validate clustering and inference sensitivity.
  2. Compare optimized sensor placement vs. random placements to quantify optimization benefit.
  3. Train on subset of wind speeds; test on held-out speeds (including outside training range) to evaluate extrapolation via Re-scaling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework be adapted to estimate wind fields for complete cities while incorporating weather forecast inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract and conclusion state, "We anticipate adaptations and applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input."
- Why unresolved: The current study only demonstrates the framework on a "simple example" of a three-building cluster using simulated data with randomized boundary conditions, not full-city scales or external weather coupling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful validation of the framework on a large-scale urban environment using real-time meteorological data as input.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does generalizing the discrete cluster representation with continuous affine cluster-based expansions improve estimation performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies this as a direction for "Future improvements... achieved by generalizing the discrete cluster representation with continuous affine cluster-based expansions."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on a discrete k-means clustering approach, which limits the resolution of the flow representation to fixed centroids.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified model utilizing affine expansions that demonstrates higher accuracy or lower uncertainty compared to the discrete centroid method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can enabling interpolation between cluster centroids significantly reduce the representation error?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix D identifies the representation error as a limiting factor and suggests "a direction for future work, namely to significantly reduce the error by enabling interpolation between centroids."
- Why unresolved: The average estimation error (19.22%) is currently bounded by the average representation error (18.98%), as the model assigns states to the nearest centroid without intermediate values.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of an interpolation scheme that lowers the estimation error below the current representation error threshold of approximately 19%.

## Limitations

- Reynolds number extrapolation uncertainty: Limited validation of scaling assumptions beyond 7.9-20.7 m/s training range
- Discrete cluster representation error: Fundamental limitation from using fixed centroids to represent continuous flow states
- Subdomain decomposition validity: Limited evidence that chosen subdomains optimally capture flow coherence for complex geometries

## Confidence

**High Confidence**

- The sensor optimization procedure successfully identifies locations that minimize estimation uncertainty
- The Reynolds number scaling enables some level of extrapolation beyond training data

**Medium Confidence**
- The physics-based domain decomposition significantly reduces computational complexity compared to monolithic approaches
- The inference matrix adequately captures cross-subdomain dependencies for the 3-building test case
- The method generalizes across different wind directions (0-360°)

**Low Confidence**
- Performance on urban environments with more than 3 buildings
- Extrapolation capability beyond a factor of 2-3 in wind speed
- Robustness to sensor noise and measurement uncertainty

## Next Checks

1. **Reynolds Number Sensitivity Test**: Systematically evaluate estimation accuracy as a function of Reynolds number ratio between test and training conditions, quantifying the breakdown point where non-dimensionalization fails.

2. **Cluster Resolution Sensitivity**: Vary K from 10 to 50 and measure the trade-off between representation error (decreased with higher K) and inference matrix sparsity/degeneracy (increased with higher K) to identify optimal cluster resolution.

3. **Geometry Scaling Validation**: Test the framework on a 6-building configuration (doubling complexity) using the same subdomain decomposition approach to validate scalability claims and identify when inter-building wake interactions overwhelm the physics-based partitioning.
