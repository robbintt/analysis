# Financial Fraud Detection Using Explainable AI and Stacking Ensemble Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.10050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10050
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Stacking ensemble of gradient boosting models with XAI techniques achieves 99% accuracy and 0.99 AUC-ROC on IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset

## Executive Summary
This research introduces a financial fraud detection framework that combines stacking ensemble methods with explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The approach integrates multiple gradient boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with SHAP for feature selection and LIME, PDP, and PFI for model interpretation. Using the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset, the framework achieves exceptional performance metrics while maintaining interpretability, addressing both the accuracy and transparency requirements crucial for financial applications.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a stacking ensemble approach combining three gradient boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Feature selection is performed using SHAP values to identify the most relevant predictors. For interpretability, multiple XAI techniques are applied including LIME for local explanations, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) for understanding feature effects, and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) for assessing feature relevance. The ensemble leverages the strengths of each individual model while the XAI components ensure transparency and regulatory compliance.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99% accuracy and 0.99 AUC-ROC score on IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset
- Outperformed several recent fraud detection approaches in comparative analysis
- Successfully demonstrated that high predictive performance can be achieved alongside clear interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stacking ensemble leverages the complementary strengths of different gradient boosting algorithms, each with distinct optimization approaches and handling of different data patterns. SHAP values provide theoretically grounded feature selection by measuring each feature's contribution to predictions. The combination of multiple XAI techniques (LIME for local explanations, PDP for global patterns, PFI for importance ranking) offers comprehensive interpretability from different angles, satisfying both technical and regulatory requirements for financial applications.

## Foundational Learning
- Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost): These algorithms build decision trees sequentially, each correcting errors of previous ones; needed for capturing complex fraud patterns; quick check: verify each model's individual performance before ensembling
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Provides game-theoretic approach to feature importance; needed for theoretically sound feature selection; quick check: ensure SHAP values sum to model prediction for verification
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): Creates local surrogate models for individual predictions; needed for explaining specific fraud decisions; quick check: test explanations on known fraud cases for validation
- Partial Dependence Plots (PDP): Visualizes marginal effect of features on predictions; needed for understanding global feature relationships; quick check: compare PDP trends with business domain knowledge
- Permutation Feature Importance (PFI): Measures feature importance by randomly shuffling features and observing performance impact; needed for robust importance ranking; quick check: ensure consistent rankings across multiple runs

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Raw Data -> Preprocessing & Feature Engineering -> Individual GB Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) -> Meta-Learner (Stacking Ensemble) -> SHAP Feature Selection -> LIME/PDP/PFI Interpretation

Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training (3 GB models) → Stacking ensemble prediction → SHAP feature selection → XAI interpretation

Design tradeoffs: The ensemble approach trades computational complexity for improved accuracy and robustness, while the multiple XAI techniques add interpretability overhead but provide comprehensive explanation coverage

Failure signatures: Overfitting indicated by perfect training performance but poor generalization; lack of feature diversity suggesting redundant models; XAI explanations that contradict business logic indicating model-data mismatch

First experiments:
1. Train and evaluate individual gradient boosting models separately to establish baseline performance
2. Test SHAP feature selection on a subset of data to verify computational feasibility
3. Apply LIME explanations to sample fraud cases to validate interpretability quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Reliance on single dataset (IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection) without external validation raises generalizability concerns
- Extremely high performance metrics may indicate potential overfitting, particularly with stacking ensemble approach
- Feature selection methodology using SHAP is not clearly specified in implementation details
- Computational efficiency and scalability for real-time deployment scenarios not addressed
- Practical deployment aspects including concept drift handling and long-term performance maintenance unexplored

## Confidence
High confidence in methodological integration of stacking ensembles with XAI techniques
Medium confidence in reported performance metrics due to lack of external validation
Low confidence in generalizability of results without cross-dataset testing

## Next Checks
1. Validate the model on at least two independent fraud detection datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a computational efficiency analysis to determine real-time deployment feasibility
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each ensemble component and XAI technique to overall performance
