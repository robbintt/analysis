# HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Introduces HGMP, a novel multi-task prompt framework for heterogeneous graphs that significantly outperforms baselines on public datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HGMP (Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning), a novel framework that addresses the challenge of improving multi-task learning in heterogeneous graphs. The key innovation is reformulating all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level format, which enables more effective knowledge transfer during pre-training. The framework incorporates heterogeneous information through a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy and specialized augmentation techniques, while heterogeneous feature prompts refine input graph features through type-specific adjustments.

## Method Summary
HGMP bridges the gap between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks by unifying all downstream tasks into a graph-level format. The framework employs graph-level contrastive pre-training with augmentation techniques specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs. A key component is the heterogeneous feature prompts, which refine input graph features by applying type-specific adjustments to better align with pre-training objectives. This unified approach enables effective knowledge transfer and improves model performance across various tasks.

## Key Results
- HGMP significantly outperforms baseline methods on public datasets
- Demonstrates strong adaptability across various heterogeneous graph tasks
- Shows robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios
- Effectively enhances model generalization in complex heterogeneous graph environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from unifying diverse downstream tasks into a consistent graph-level format, which enables more coherent pre-training and knowledge transfer. The heterogeneous feature prompts apply type-specific adjustments to input features, ensuring better alignment with pre-training objectives. The contrastive pre-training strategy leverages heterogeneous information through specialized augmentation techniques, allowing the model to capture rich structural and semantic relationships in heterogeneous graphs.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph-level contrastive learning** - why needed: To leverage heterogeneous information effectively; quick check: Verify contrastive pairs are constructed meaningfully across different node types

**Task reformulation** - why needed: To unify diverse downstream tasks into a common format; quick check: Confirm all target tasks can be accurately represented at graph level

**Type-specific feature refinement** - why needed: To handle heterogeneity by adjusting features per node/edge type; quick check: Validate feature prompts improve alignment with pre-training objectives

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data preprocessing -> Task reformulation -> Graph-level contrastive pre-training -> Heterogeneous feature prompts -> Downstream task prediction

**Critical path**: Task reformulation serves as the foundation, enabling all subsequent components to operate on a unified graph-level representation. The contrastive pre-training and heterogeneous feature prompts work in tandem to refine representations before final task prediction.

**Design tradeoffs**: Unified graph-level format sacrifices some task-specific granularity for improved knowledge transfer, while heterogeneous feature prompts add computational overhead but improve alignment with pre-training objectives.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance may indicate ineffective task reformulation, inadequate contrastive pair construction, or misaligned feature prompts that don't properly capture heterogeneous relationships.

**First experiments**: 1) Test task reformulation accuracy on a simple heterogeneous graph, 2) Evaluate contrastive learning performance with different augmentation strategies, 3) Measure impact of heterogeneous feature prompts on a single downstream task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Lacks detailed analysis of computational overhead introduced by the prompt-based architecture and heterogeneous feature prompts
- Limited discussion of augmentation technique performance under different graph sparsity levels and node degree distributions
- Evaluation focuses on performance metrics without extensive ablation studies isolating component contributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core technical contribution of unifying downstream tasks and general effectiveness on reported benchmarks
**Medium Confidence**: Specific performance gains from heterogeneous feature prompts and augmentation techniques effectiveness
**Low Confidence**: Robustness claims in few-shot learning scenarios due to limited experimental validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contribution of unified reformulation, contrastive pre-training, and heterogeneous feature prompts
2. Test framework on additional heterogeneous graph datasets with varying sparsity, node degree distributions, and meta-path richness
3. Measure and report computational overhead compared to baseline methods, including memory usage and training time
