- Primary result: Novel flow-matching-based method for realistic guitar synthesis from tablatures that improves audio quality over synthetic baselines

## Executive Summary
GuitarFlow introduces a novel approach to synthesize realistic electric guitar audio from guitar tablatures using Flow Matching and style transfer. The method first renders tablatures into synthetic audio using a simple sample-based virtual instrument, then transforms this audio into more realistic sounding examples using a Flow Matching model. This addresses the challenge of controllable guitar synthesis, particularly the representation of expressive playing techniques like bends and muted strings that are difficult to capture in formats like MIDI.

The model was trained on the GOAT dataset (5.75 hours of real guitar audio with tablature annotations) and evaluated using both objective metrics and a listening test. Results showed significant improvement in realism compared to the original synthetic audio, with better Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and Kernel Audio Distance (KAD) scores. The listening test revealed that GuitarFlow's output was perceived as significantly more realistic than the synthetic baseline, especially when processed through a guitar amplifier.

## Method Summary
GuitarFlow works by first converting guitar tablatures into synthetic audio using a sample-based virtual instrument, then applying a Flow Matching model to transform this synthetic audio into more realistic sounding examples. The Flow Matching approach allows for fine-grained control over the output audio while capturing the nuances of expressive guitar techniques. The method leverages the GOAT dataset for training, which provides synchronized tablature and audio recordings of real guitar performances.

## Key Results
- GuitarFlow achieved significant improvement in Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and Kernel Audio Distance (KAD) scores compared to synthetic baseline
- Listening test showed GuitarFlow's output was perceived as significantly more realistic than synthetic baseline, particularly with guitar amplifier processing
- Method demonstrates promise for realistic guitar synthesis while requiring less data and training time compared to other approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GuitarFlow leverages Flow Matching to learn a mapping from synthetic to realistic guitar audio by training on paired data from the GOAT dataset. The key insight is that the synthetic audio provides a controllable, structured input that captures the intended tablature structure, while the Flow Matching model learns to add realistic timbral and expressive characteristics. This two-stage approach allows the model to focus on realistic sound generation without having to learn the underlying musical structure from scratch.

## Foundational Learning
**Flow Matching**: A generative modeling technique that learns to transform one distribution into another - needed because it allows smooth transitions from synthetic to realistic audio; quick check: verify the flow matching implementation can reproduce known transformations.
**Guitar Tablature Representation**: ASCII-based notation for guitar music that specifies fret positions and strings - needed because it provides precise control over what should be played; quick check: confirm tablature parsing correctly handles all techniques in the dataset.
**Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD)**: Metric for evaluating audio quality based on feature distributions - needed because it provides objective measure of realism improvement; quick check: validate FAD scores align with perceptual differences.
**Kernel Audio Distance (KAD)**: Alternative audio similarity metric using kernel methods - needed because it provides complementary evaluation to FAD; quick check: ensure KAD implementation matches established standards.
**Style Transfer in Audio**: Technique for modifying audio characteristics while preserving content - needed because it frames the synthetic-to-realistic transformation; quick check: test style transfer preserves note timing and pitch information.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Tablature -> Sample-based synthesis -> Synthetic audio -> Flow Matching model -> Realistic guitar audio

**Critical Path**: Tablature parsing → Sample-based synthesis → Flow Matching transformation → Audio output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses simple sample-based synthesis for initial rendering (fast, controllable) rather than complex physical modeling (computationally expensive, less controllable); Flow Matching provides smooth transformations but requires paired training data.

**Failure Signatures**: If Flow Matching fails, synthetic audio will retain unrealistic characteristics; if tablature parsing fails, wrong notes/fret positions will be played; if sample-based synthesis fails, timing/articulation will be incorrect.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test Flow Matching model on simple transformations (e.g., adding reverb) before guitar-specific tasks
2. Validate tablature parsing by comparing rendered synthetic audio against known tablature examples
3. Perform ablation study removing Flow Matching to confirm synthetic baseline performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (5.75 hours) is relatively small compared to large-scale music synthesis benchmarks
- Evaluation focuses on realism relative to synthetic baseline rather than comparison with state-of-the-art methods
- Method's ability to capture highly nuanced expressive techniques remains unclear from presented results

## Confidence
High confidence in core technical contribution and methodology soundness.
- Flow Matching approach for guitar synthesis: High
- Improved realism over synthetic baseline: High
- Data efficiency claims: Medium (limited by dataset size)
- Generalization to all guitar techniques: Medium (limited evaluation scope)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate GuitarFlow against alternative guitar synthesis approaches (e.g., MIDI-based methods with advanced physical modeling) on the same dataset using standardized metrics
2. Conduct a more comprehensive perceptual study with professional guitarists assessing the accuracy of expressive technique reproduction
3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating performance on tablatures from genres and playing styles not well-represented in the GOAT dataset
