# SA-Occ: Satellite-Assisted 3D Occupancy Prediction in Real World

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.16399
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16399
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 39.05% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, a 6.97% improvement over baseline

## Executive Summary
SA-Occ introduces satellite imagery into 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, addressing occlusions and sparse distant sampling in street views. It uses GPS & IMU data to align real-time satellite imagery with street views and introduces three key innovations: (1) Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion to handle temporal inconsistencies in dynamic regions, (2) 3D-Proj Guidance to enhance 2D satellite feature extraction with 3D supervision, and (3) Uniform Sampling Alignment to align sampling density between views. Evaluated on Occ3D-nuScenes, SA-Occ achieves a 39.05% mIoU, a 6.97% improvement over the baseline, while adding only 6.93 ms latency per frame. It outperforms existing methods, especially among single-frame models, demonstrating the potential of satellite-assisted perception.

## Method Summary
SA-Occ extends the FlashOcc baseline by adding a satellite branch that processes GPS-aligned satellite imagery. The street-view branch uses Lift-Splat-Shoot with Uniform Sampling Alignment to match the satellite branch's BEV density. A Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion module gates satellite features using a dynamic mask from the street view, preventing historical satellite data from interfering with current dynamic objects. The satellite branch employs 3D-Proj Guidance, where 3D ground truth is projected into the satellite view to supervise height and semantic predictions. The model is trained end-to-end on Occ3D-nuScenes with weighted losses for semantic, height, depth, and dynamic predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 39.05% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes
- Improves over FlashOcc baseline by 6.97% mIoU
- Adds only 6.93 ms latency per frame
- Outperforms existing methods, particularly among single-frame models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Uniform Sampling Alignment for Cross-View Density Matching
Standard street-view LSS creates dense features nearby but sparse features far away. The Uniform Sampling Alignment (Uni-SA) module projects predefined, uniformly distributed 3D points onto image features to "fill in" the distant BEV features, matching the satellite branch's density before fusion. This ensures satellite views provide dense, uniform context for distant regions. If camera calibration drifts, backward projection samples incorrect pixels, creating misaligned "ghost" features in the BEV.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion for Temporal Asynchrony
Satellite imagery is historical and cannot see current moving cars. A Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion (DDF) module generates a binary dynamic mask from the real-time street view and applies a soft gate to the satellite features. This zeros out satellite features where cars currently are, preventing the model from "seeing" empty roads (from the past) where cars currently exist. If the street view fails to detect a dynamic object (false negative), the gate remains open, and the satellite view (showing an empty road) may overwrite the actual car in the final occupancy grid.

### Mechanism 3: 3D-Proj Guidance for Implicit Height Extraction
Standard 2D convolutions on satellite imagery can infer 3D geometry if explicitly supervised by projected 3D labels. A satellite image is 2D, losing height information. The paper projects the 3D Ground Truth (semantics and height) down into the satellite camera view, forcing the satellite encoder to predict these height/semantic maps as an auxiliary task. This "teaches" the 2D encoder to recognize that shadows or roof shapes correspond to specific 3D heights. In conditions where shadows are ambiguous or lighting differs drastically from the satellite capture time, the implicit height estimation may fail, flattening 3D structures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Bird's Eye View (BEV) Transformation
  - **Why needed here:** The entire architecture relies on fusing Street View and Satellite View. Both must be converted into a common BEV grid to align spatially.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why LSS (Lift-Splat-Shoot) results in "dense-near, sparse-far" features?

- **Concept:** Soft Gating / Attention Mechanisms
  - **Why needed here:** The Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion uses a soft gate (multiplying by a sigmoid mask) rather than a hard binary mask. This allows gradients to flow and provides robustness at object boundaries.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a hard binary mask (0 or 1) cause training instability compared to a soft mask (0.0 to 1.0)?

- **Concept:** Temporal Asynchrony in Sensor Fusion
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation is handling the time gap between satellite imagery (historical) and car sensors (real-time). Understanding that "fusion isn't just adding features" is critical here.
  - **Quick check question:** If a car is parked in the satellite image but has moved in the real world, what happens to the final prediction if we simply add the satellite features to the street features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Multi-view Images + GPS/IMU Pose + Satellite Raster → Street Branch (ResNet + LSS + Uni-SA) + Satellite Branch (ResNet-18 + Soft Gated Conv + U-Shape Extractor) → Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion → 2D Occupancy Head

- **Critical path:** The critical path is the DDF Module. If the dynamic mask (derived from street view) is misaligned with the satellite BEV features, the fusion creates artifacts. The alignment relies entirely on the accuracy of the GPS/IMU extrinsics.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Latency:** The paper adds a parallel branch (Satellite) which increases FLOPs/Params but claims only +6.93ms latency due to parallelizability.
  - **Static vs. Dynamic:** The design explicitly sacrifices satellite information for dynamic objects (by gating it out) to gain superior static context (occlusions/distance).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Ghost Objects:** Occurs if DDF fails to mask a dynamic object and the satellite view shows a different history (e.g., a car "teleports" or duplicates).
  - **Edge Misalignment:** Occurs if GPS is noisy; satellite features (e.g., crosswalk lines) will appear shifted relative to street BEV features.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Verify Projection Alignment:** Input a synthetic scenario with known GPS coordinates; verify that the Uni-SA points and the Satellite crop center align perfectly in the BEV grid.
  2. **DDF Ablation (Binary vs. Soft):** Run inference on a sequence with moving cars. Compare results using F_sat * (1 - M) vs. a hard threshold. Check for gradient stability and edge artifacts.
  3. **Height Supervision Check:** Visualize the output of the Satellite Height Head. Does it accurately predict building heights/shadows, or is it flat? This validates the 3D-Proj Guidance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- **GPS/IMU Dependency:** High-quality pose estimates are critical for spatial alignment between satellite and street BEV features.
- **Temporal Asynchrony:** Assumes satellite imagery is sufficiently recent to represent static scene context, which may not hold in rapidly changing environments.
- **Dynamic Mask Reliance:** Performance depends on accurate street-view perception for dynamic mask generation, creating potential failure cascades.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence (8/10):** Architectural design choices are well-motivated and consistent with the problem statement.
- **Medium Confidence (6/10):** Implementation details for satellite data acquisition are underspecified.
- **Low Confidence (4/10):** Doesn't address failure modes for extreme lighting conditions or severe GPS drift.

## Next Checks
1. **Projection Alignment Verification:** Test Uni-SA with synthetic GPS coordinates where ground truth alignment is known. Verify backward-projected points align with correct satellite pixels in BEV grid.
2. **Dynamic Mask Robustness:** Create scenarios with partially occluded or ambiguous dynamic objects. Evaluate whether DDF correctly gates out satellite features without erasing valid static context.
3. **Temporal Consistency Evaluation:** Compare performance using satellite imagery captured at different time offsets from street-view capture. Measure degradation in mIoU as temporal gap increases.
