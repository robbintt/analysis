# Design, Results and Industry Implications of the World's First Insurance Large Language Model Evaluation Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07794

- Key outcome: CUFEInse v1.0 is the first professional benchmark for evaluating insurance large language models, developed by Central University of Finance and Economics. It includes 14,430 high-quality questions across 5 dimensions and 54 sub-indicators, designed to assess models on insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety & compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Evaluation of 11 mainstream models showed that general-purpose models struggle with actuarial capabilities and compliance, while domain-specific models perform better in insurance-specific scenarios but have weaknesses in business adaptation. The benchmark fills a gap in insurance domain evaluation, offering academia and industry a standardized, authoritative tool for model assessment and selection.

## Executive Summary
CUFEInse v1.0 represents the first professional benchmark specifically designed to evaluate insurance large language models. Developed by Central University of Finance and Economics, this benchmark addresses the critical gap in standardized evaluation tools for insurance AI applications. The benchmark consists of 14,430 carefully curated questions spanning five evaluation dimensions, providing a comprehensive framework for assessing model performance across theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety compliance, intelligent agent applications, and logical reasoning capabilities.

The evaluation of 11 mainstream models revealed significant performance disparities between general-purpose and domain-specific models, particularly in actuarial capabilities and compliance-related tasks. This finding underscores the necessity of domain-specific benchmarks for accurate assessment of specialized AI applications. The benchmark serves as an authoritative tool for both academia and industry, enabling standardized model selection and evaluation while promoting the development of more sophisticated insurance AI solutions.

## Method Summary
CUFEInse v1.0 was developed through a systematic process involving the creation of 14,430 high-quality questions organized into five distinct evaluation dimensions. These dimensions cover insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor, with 54 sub-indicators providing granular assessment criteria. The benchmark was validated through evaluation of 11 mainstream large language models, including both general-purpose and domain-specific variants. The evaluation process measured model performance across these dimensions, revealing critical gaps in general-purpose models' ability to handle actuarial calculations and compliance requirements while demonstrating superior performance of domain-specific models in insurance-related scenarios.

## Key Results
- General-purpose models demonstrated significant weaknesses in actuarial capabilities and compliance-related tasks compared to domain-specific models
- Domain-specific insurance models showed superior performance in insurance-specific scenarios but exhibited limitations in business adaptation and generalization
- The benchmark identified critical gaps between theoretical knowledge and practical application in current insurance AI models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of insurance domain requirements through a multi-dimensional evaluation framework. By incorporating 54 sub-indicators across five major dimensions, the benchmark captures the complexity and specificity of insurance knowledge, ensuring that models are evaluated on both breadth and depth of understanding. The large question set of 14,430 items provides statistical significance and reduces the impact of question-specific biases, while the inclusion of both theoretical and practical assessment criteria ensures relevance to real-world applications.

## Foundational Learning
- Insurance domain knowledge structure: Understanding the hierarchical organization of insurance concepts is crucial for proper benchmark design and evaluation interpretation
- Actuarial calculation principles: Models must demonstrate proficiency in risk assessment and financial calculations specific to insurance
- Regulatory compliance frameworks: Knowledge of insurance regulations and compliance requirements is essential for safe deployment of insurance AI
- Natural language processing for specialized domains: Techniques for adapting general NLP models to domain-specific terminology and context
- Evaluation methodology for AI systems: Understanding of benchmarking principles and statistical validation techniques

Why needed: Insurance domain presents unique challenges requiring specialized knowledge that general-purpose models struggle to master. Quick check: Verify model performance across all five dimensions shows consistent patterns rather than isolated strengths.

## Architecture Onboarding
The benchmark architecture follows a multi-stage evaluation pipeline where question sets are processed through five distinct evaluation dimensions, each with specific assessment criteria and scoring mechanisms. The evaluation process involves question distribution across dimensions, model response generation, scoring based on predefined rubrics, and aggregation of results for comparative analysis.

Critical path: Question Bank -> Dimension Assignment -> Model Evaluation -> Scoring Rubric Application -> Result Aggregation

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive coverage over computational efficiency, using a large question set to ensure robustness but requiring significant evaluation time and resources.

Failure signatures: Models showing high performance in theoretical knowledge but poor results in practical application indicate gaps between training data and real-world applicability.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate model performance on basic insurance terminology and concept recognition
2. Test actuarial calculation accuracy with standardized insurance problems
3. Assess compliance understanding through regulatory scenario analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The benchmark's Chinese language focus may limit its applicability to international insurance markets and multilingual model evaluation
- Reliance on 11 mainstream models for validation may not capture the full spectrum of available insurance-specific models, particularly newer market entrants
- The long-term stability and adaptability of the 14,430-question dataset to evolving insurance practices remains uncertain

## Confidence
- High confidence: The benchmark's existence and basic structure are well-documented
- Medium confidence: Claims about model performance gaps and comparative weaknesses
- Low confidence: Generalizability to non-Chinese markets and long-term applicability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation with insurance practitioners across different markets to verify benchmark relevance and practical utility
2. Test the benchmark's adaptability by evaluating newer model versions and additional domain-specific insurance models
3. Perform longitudinal studies to assess how well the benchmark questions remain relevant as insurance practices evolve
