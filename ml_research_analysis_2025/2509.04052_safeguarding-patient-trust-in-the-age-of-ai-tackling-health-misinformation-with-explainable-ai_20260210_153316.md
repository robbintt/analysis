# Safeguarding Patient Trust in the Age of AI: Tackling Health Misinformation with Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04052
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Explainable AI framework achieving 95% recall in clinical evidence retrieval and 76% F1 score for biomedical misinformation detection

## Executive Summary
This white paper presents an explainable AI framework developed through the EPSRC INDICATE project to combat AI-generated health misinformation while enhancing evidence-based healthcare delivery. The system transforms traditional 6-month expert review processes into real-time, automated evidence synthesis while maintaining clinical rigor. The approach addresses the urgent need for transparent AI systems in healthcare as generative AI creates increasingly sophisticated medical misinformation that threatens patient safety and healthcare system trust globally.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a RAG-based pipeline that crawls PubMed, CENTRAL, and CDSR for breast cancer publications, using PubMedBERT-base-embeddings for document chunking and storage in vector databases. The system integrates Cross-Encoder reranking, human expert relevancy scoring, automated veracity scoring, and LLM synthesis with prior knowledge forbidden. It includes PubGuardLLM for trustworthiness classification and argLLM for claim validation, testing eight open-source LLMs including LLaMA, Mistral, and Claude variants against NICE NG101 guideline questions.

## Key Results
- 95% recall achieved in clinical evidence retrieval for breast cancer publications
- 76% F1 score attained for biomedical misinformation detection using trustworthiness classifiers
- Real-time automated evidence synthesis replacing traditional 6-month expert review processes
- Integration of human-in-the-loop verification while maintaining clinical rigor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by combining retrieval-augmented generation with clinical domain-specific embeddings (PubMedBERT) that capture medical terminology semantics, while maintaining human oversight through expert relevancy scoring and automated veracity checks. The system's architecture leverages vector database storage for efficient similarity search and employs cross-encoder reranking to improve precision over traditional keyword matching. By constraining LLM synthesis with knowledge restrictions and integrating multiple trustworthiness validation layers (PubGuardLLM and argLLM), the system prevents hallucination while ensuring evidence-based outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- Clinical evidence retrieval: Why needed - Foundation for automated guideline creation and evidence synthesis
- Vector database storage: Why needed - Efficient similarity search for document retrieval
- Trustworthiness classification: Why needed - Detection of biomedical misinformation in AI-generated content
- Human-in-the-loop verification: Why needed - Maintains clinical rigor in automated systems
- LLM synthesis with knowledge constraints: Why needed - Prevents hallucination while generating evidence summaries
- Veracity scoring mechanisms: Why needed - Automated assessment of evidence reliability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** PubMed/CENTRAL crawl -> Document chunking/Embedding -> Vector DB storage -> Similarity search + top-K retrieval -> Cross-Encoder reranking -> Human relevancy scoring -> Automated veracity scoring -> LLM synthesis -> PubGuardLLM/argLLM validation

**Critical Path:** Document retrieval → Reranking → Human verification → Synthesis → Trustworthiness validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Real-time automation vs. expert verification; open-access data vs. comprehensive coverage (paywall limitations)

**Failure Signatures:** Low recall due to semantic misclassification (drug/term confusion); incomplete data ingestion from paywall restrictions

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate retrieval recall using standardized clinical question sets from public repositories
2. Benchmark trustworthiness classifier on established biomedical misinformation datasets
3. Test cross-domain generalization by applying framework to different medical specialties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How can the evaluation of explainable AI clinical systems be scaled beyond manual expert review without compromising assessment rigor?
- Basis: "Currently, evaluating its performance at scale remains challenging, as the assessment process is predominantly manual and heavily dependent on human expert involvement—a resource-intensive and expensive approach."

**Open Question 2:** What is the minimum acceptable F1 score for biomedical misinformation classifiers before clinical deployment is ethically justified?
- Basis: System achieves 76% F1 score, but no thresholds for safe deployment in high-stakes healthcare settings are defined.

**Open Question 3:** How does the framework's performance generalize to medical domains beyond breast cancer and guideline types beyond NICE NG101?
- Basis: All reported benchmarks used a single breast cancer guideline as the reference standard, with no cross-domain validation reported.

**Open Question 4:** How should systems handle evidence from paywall-restricted publications that cannot be ingested into the knowledge base?
- Basis: "Data incompleteness, where certain publications were not ingested due to paywall restrictions" was identified as a source of retrieval omissions.

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details for trustworthiness classifiers and LLM synthesis pipeline are abstracted away
- Performance metrics lack independent validation on public benchmarks
- Training data for PubGuardLLM classifier and domain-specific encoders not publicly available
- Single medical domain evaluation limits generalizability claims
- No comparison with existing clinical decision support systems
- Paywall restrictions create coverage gaps in evidence base

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core problem statement and retrieval pipeline architecture
- **Medium Confidence**: Plausible performance metrics without independent validation
- **Low Confidence**: Trustworthiness classification approach lacks sufficient technical detail

## Next Checks
1. Replicate retrieval pipeline using publicly available PubMed datasets and validate recall metrics against standardized clinical question sets
2. Conduct independent evaluation of trustworthiness classifier on established biomedical misinformation datasets
3. Test system robustness across different medical domains beyond breast cancer to assess generalizability
4. Compare framework performance against established clinical decision support systems
5. Investigate alternative approaches for handling paywall-restricted publications
