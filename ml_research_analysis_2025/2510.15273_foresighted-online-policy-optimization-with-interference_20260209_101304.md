- This paper tackles online decision-making under interference, proposing FRONT to achieve foresighted policies with sublinear regret.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online decision-making under interference, where an individual's action affects not only their own reward but also future individuals' outcomes. Traditional contextual bandit methods overlook this interference, leading to short-sighted policies and increased regret. To address this gap, the authors propose a foresighted online policy with interference (FRONT) that considers the long-term impact of current decisions on future rewards.

FRONT employs a novel online additive outcome model with heterogeneous treatment effects and homogeneous interference effects, explicitly incorporating the long-term influence of current actions through an interference action κ_t. The method uses an extended ϵ-Greedy strategy with force pulls to ensure robust parameter inference and regret minimization. Theoretically, the authors establish tail bounds for the online estimator and derive its asymptotic distribution under suitable conditions on the interference network. They prove that FRONT attains sublinear regret under two distinct definitions, capturing both immediate and consequential impacts of decisions, with and without statistical inference. The method is validated through extensive simulations and a real-world application to urban hotel profits, demonstrating superior performance over myopic and naive policies.

## Method Summary
FRONT addresses online contextual bandit decision-making under interference, where current actions affect future rewards via an "interference action" κ_t. The method uses a linear model with basis map φ(x) and homogeneous interference: y_t = (1-a_t)φ(x_t)ᵀβ_0 + a_tφ(x_t)ᵀβ_1 + κ_t γ + e_t. Parameters are estimated using online least squares updates, and the policy decision incorporates the Interference Effect on Subsequent Outcome (ISO) term ζ_t γ. The extended ϵ-Greedy algorithm includes force pulls triggered by minimum eigenvalue conditions to ensure robust parameter inference. The method balances exploration and exploitation while considering both immediate and consequential impacts of decisions.

## Key Results
- FRONT achieves sublinear regret under two distinct definitions, capturing both immediate and consequential impacts of decisions.
- The method attains valid statistical inference for interference parameters through a novel force-pull mechanism.
- Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate superior performance over myopic and naive policies.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The inclusion of an "Interference effect on Subsequent Outcome" (ISO) term in the policy decision rule allows the agent to optimize for long-term cumulative rewards rather than just immediate gains, provided the interference structure is known.
- **Mechanism:** The policy decision threshold at time t is shifted by ζ_t γ, where ζ_t = Σ_{s=t+1}^∞ w_{st} represents the total future influence of the current action. If the interference effect γ is positive, the policy is more likely to take the active action (a_t=1) even if the immediate contextual benefit is slightly negative, effectively "investing" in future network performance.
- **Core assumption:** The weight array {w_{ts}} (who influences whom) is known and fixed; the interference effect γ is homogeneous (constant across individuals).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "explicitly incorporates the long-term influence of current actions through an interference action κ_t."
  - [section 2.2] Proposition 1 defines the optimal policy a*_t as a function of the ISO term.
  - [corpus] "Scalable Policy Maximization Under Network Interference" addresses similar interference challenges, though FRONT focuses on sequential foresight.
- **Break condition:** If the weight array is misspecified or the assumption of homogeneous interference effects is violated, the ISO calculation will be biased, potentially leading to suboptimal "foresighted" decisions that incur unnecessary immediate regret.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Valid statistical inference for the interference parameter γ requires an exploration strategy that specifically forces variance in the interference action κ_t, preventing it from converging too quickly.
- **Mechanism:** Standard ϵ-Greedy exploration randomizes actions but may fail to sufficiently vary the interference action κ_t (which is a weighted average of history). The algorithm triggers "consecutive force pulls" (Step 7) when the minimum eigenvalue of the design matrix drops below a threshold. This forces κ_t to fluctuate, ensuring the design matrix remains invertible (satisfying the "clipping" assumption) and allowing consistent estimation of γ.
- **Core assumption:** The interference action κ_t must not stagnate; the Clipping Assumption (4.2) holds.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "extended ϵ-Greedy strategy with force pulls to ensure robust parameter inference."
  - [section 3] "To enhance exploration efficiency... particularly for the interference-related parameter γ, we further design the force pulling step."
  - [corpus] "Design-Based Bandits Under Network Interference" explores the trade-off between regret and inference, supporting the need for specific design mechanisms for valid inference.
- **Break condition:** If the "force pull" threshold parameters (C, K) are set too loosely, κ_t may converge to a constant without sufficient exploration, causing the variance estimator for γ to fail (singularity in the design matrix).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Sublinear regret is achievable by balancing the growth of exploration regret against the diminishing error of the online estimator, even under two distinct definitions of cumulative cost.
- **Mechanism:** The authors decompose regret into immediate (R_1) and consequential (R_2) impacts. They theoretically show that as t → ∞, the estimation error decreases at a rate (e.g., Õ(t^{-1/2})) faster than the accumulation of exploration costs (Σ ε_t), provided the exploration rate decays appropriately (tε_t^2 → ∞).
- **Core assumption:** A "Margin Condition" (Assumption 4.3) restricting the probability of covariates landing exactly on the decision boundary; the convergence of the interference action κ_t.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "FRONT attains sublinear regret under two distinct definitions... with and without statistical inference."
  - [section 4.3] Theorems 8 and 9 explicitly bound R_1(T) and R_2(T).
  - [corpus] General bandit literature supports sublinear regret bounds under margin conditions, which this paper extends to the interference setting.
- **Break condition:** If the exploration rate ε_t decays too fast (tε_t^2 ≯ ∞), the estimator may not converge, causing regret to accumulate linearly due to persistent decision errors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contextual Bandits (SUTVA violation)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard bandits assume an individual's outcome depends only on their own context and action (SUTVA). This paper specifically addresses the failure of this assumption.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a standard UCB algorithm would fail if the reward for user t depended on the action taken for user t-1?

- **Concept: Online Least Squares Estimation (Martingales)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on the convergence of an online estimator derived from sequential data. Understanding why dependent data (Martingale difference sequences) still allows for convergence is key to Theorem 2.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "Clipping Assumption" ensure the stability of the variance in an online regression setting?

- **Concept: Exposure Mapping**
  - **Why needed here:** To reduce the dimensionality of interference (which could be infinite as T → ∞), the paper maps the history of all neighbors' actions into a single scalar κ_t.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have 1000 past users, how does defining κ_t as a weighted average reduce the dimensionality of the decision problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion -> Interference Calculator -> Parameter Estimator -> Policy Evaluator -> Action Selector
- **Critical path:** The calculation of the interference action κ_t is the critical dependency. It must be updated sequentially and correctly weighted. If κ_t is not updated before the policy decision, the interference context is invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Force Pull Frequency (C, K):** A lower clipping threshold C triggers force pulls more often, ensuring better inference for γ but increasing short-term regret.
  - **Interference Scale (g(t)):** A larger neighborhood size slows the convergence of κ_t, requiring longer warm-up periods (T_0).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **κ_t Stagnation:** If κ_t converges to 0 or 1 too quickly, the parameter γ̂ will have exploding variance (singular design matrix).
  - **Linear Regret:** If cumulative average regret does not decay to zero, check if the exploration rate ε_t violates the condition tε_t^2 → ∞.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Comparison:** Run FRONT against the "Myopic" policy (ignores ISO) and "Naive" policy (ignores interference entirely) on a simulation with strong positive interference (γ > 0) to verify the "foresight" advantage.
  2. **Ablation on Force Pulls:** Disable the force-pull mechanism (Step 7) and measure the coverage probability of the confidence intervals for γ̂ to demonstrate the failure of inference without it.
  3. **Sensitivity to Weights:** Vary the decay rate of the weight array {w_{ts}} (e.g., linear vs. square root growth of neighborhood) and observe the convergence speed of κ_t and the resulting regret R_2(T).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can valid statistical inference be achieved when the interference action κ_t fails to stabilize (i.e., does not converge to a constant)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.2.2 states: "However, if κ_t fails to stabilize and continues to fluctuate, the conditions required for applying the Martingale Central Limit Theorem break down... Developing such methods lies beyond the scope of this paper and remains an important direction for future research."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current asymptotic normality result relies on κ_t converging to κ_∞, which is violated in settings like fixed-scale interference windows where κ_t = a_{t-1}.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A proof technique or alternative estimator that handles non-converging κ_t while maintaining valid inference properties.

- **Open Question 2:** How can tighter regret bounds be achieved for FRONT, particularly in the inference-free setting?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.3.2 states: "the regret bounds derived here are upper bounds and therefore conservative, as they apply to the most general cases. Tighter bounds may be achievable if sharper convergence rates for the online estimators can be obtained, which we identify as an important direction for future research."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current bounds (e.g., O_p(T^{7/10}) for R_2(T) without inference) are worst-case upper bounds derived using general techniques.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Sharper convergence rate analysis for online estimators under interference, leading to improved regret guarantees.

- **Open Question 3:** How should policy evaluation be conducted under persistent interference to determine when to stop updating the policy?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.2 states: "We plan to define policy value that aligns with the two regret definitions and develop value estimation and inference when interference persists over time."
  - **Why unresolved:** Classical policy evaluation methods assume no interference; defining appropriate policy value under the two regret definitions (R_1 and R_2) requires new theoretical frameworks.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal definitions of policy value under interference, with consistent estimators and confidence intervals.

- **Open Question 4:** Can the FRONT framework be extended to continuous action spaces while maintaining theoretical guarantees?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.2 states: "Third, our current framework assumes a binary action set, and we aim to extend it to continuous action spaces."
  - **Why unresolved:** The binary action structure simplifies the optimal policy derivation (Proposition 1); continuous actions introduce optimization challenges over unbounded action sets.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified FRONT algorithm for continuous actions with sublinear regret bounds and valid inference properties.

## Limitations

- The homogeneous interference effect (γ) and known weight array {w_{ts}} are critical assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios.
- The method's performance degrades if these assumptions are violated, as the ISO term becomes biased.
- The paper does not address how to estimate the weight array when it is unknown.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Sublinear regret bounds (Theorems 8 and 9) under the stated assumptions, validated through simulations showing improved performance over myopic policies.
- **Medium Confidence:** The force-pull mechanism's effectiveness in ensuring valid inference, as demonstrated by empirical coverage rates, though the theoretical conditions for its necessity are strict.
- **Low Confidence:** Performance under misspecified interference structure (unknown or heterogeneous γ), as the paper does not provide theoretical guarantees or empirical results for this scenario.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Interference Misspecification:** Run FRONT on simulated data where the true interference effect is heterogeneous (varies across individuals) rather than homogeneous. Compare regret and inference quality to the baseline case.

2. **Force-Pull Ablation Study:** Systematically vary the force-pull parameters (C, K) and measure their impact on both regret (immediate and consequential) and the coverage probability of confidence intervals for γ̂. Identify the Pareto-optimal trade-off.

3. **Weight Array Estimation:** Implement a method to estimate the weight array {w_{ts}} from data (e.g., using exposure mappings or network structure) and evaluate FRONT's performance when this estimation is imperfect. Compare against the oracle case with known weights.
