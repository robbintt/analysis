# Intertextual Parallel Detection in Biblical Hebrew: A Transformer-Based Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.24117
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24117
- Reference count: 24
- Transformer embeddings distinguish parallel from non-parallel Biblical Hebrew passages with E5 (0.966 mean cosine) and AlephBERT (0.638 non-parallel mean) showing complementary strengths

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks transformer-based language models for detecting intertextual parallels in Biblical Hebrew, comparing traditional manual methods with computational approaches. Using known parallel passages between Samuel/Kings and Chronicles, the research evaluates E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE models based on cosine similarity and Wasserstein Distance metrics. E5 achieved the highest parallel detection with 75% of passages exceeding 95% similarity (mean cosine 0.966) but struggled with false positives (non-parallel mean 0.882). AlephBERT demonstrated better non-parallel differentiation (mean 0.638) with strong precision (0.92) and recall (0.82). The models significantly distinguished parallel from non-parallel passages (p-values < 1e-100), with E5 and AlephBERT emerging as most effective for intertextual analysis in ancient Hebrew texts.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four pre-trained transformer models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) for detecting intertextual parallels in Biblical Hebrew. Using the BHSA corpus with 558 known parallel verse pairs between Chronicles and Samuel/Kings, the research generates verse-level embeddings and computes pairwise cosine similarities. Parallel passages are labeled based on Enders et al. (1998), with all other comparisons classified as non-parallel. Performance is measured through mean cosine similarity scores, Wasserstein Distance between parallel/non-parallel distributions, and classification metrics (precision, recall, F1) via nearest-neighbor matching. Models are evaluated "off-the-shelf" without fine-tuning on BH-specific data.

## Key Results
- E5 achieved highest parallel similarity (mean cosine 0.966, 75% exceeding 95%) but poor non-parallel separation (mean 0.882, Wasserstein 0.0812)
- AlephBERT showed better specificity with cleaner non-parallel distribution (mean 0.638, Wasserstein 0.2764) and strong precision (0.92) and recall (0.82)
- All models significantly distinguished parallel from non-parallel passages (p-values < 1e-100)
- MPNet and LaBSE performed poorly on Hebrew, confirming E5 and AlephBERT as most effective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Transformer embeddings capture semantic similarity sufficient to distinguish parallel from non-parallel Biblical Hebrew passages. Pre-trained models generate high-dimensional vector representations where semantically related passages cluster closer in embedding space, enabling cosine similarity to quantify textual relationships beyond surface-level lexical matching. Core assumption: Models trained primarily on non-BH corpora (modern Hebrew, multilingual text) transfer sufficiently to ancient Hebrew's morphological complexity. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "pre-trained transformer-based language models...distinguishing parallel from non-parallel passages"; [section 5.2] "models can consistently achieve similarity scores distinguishing parallel and non-parallel passages, despite not being optimized for BH" (p-values < 1e-100). Break condition: If BH-specific morphological features (verbal chains, construct states) are systematically misencoded, similarity scores will degrade for reworked/paraphrased parallels.

### Mechanism 2
Wasserstein Distance reveals model-specific tradeoffs between sensitivity and false positive rates. By measuring distributional separation between parallel and non-parallel cosine score distributions, Wasserstein Distance quantifies a model's discriminative capacity—higher values indicate cleaner separation, reducing false positive risk. Core assumption: The known parallel set (Sam/Kgs–Chronicles) is representative of broader intertextual patterns in BH. Evidence anchors: [section 5.3] E5: Wasserstein 0.0812 (poor separation) vs. AlephBERT: 0.2764 (better separation); [section 5.5] "AlephBERT shows a slight edge in avoiding false positives...This makes AlephBERT particularly suitable when minimizing incorrect matches is a priority". Break condition: If non-parallel distribution has high variance (genre mixing), Wasserstein becomes unreliable as a single metric.

### Mechanism 3
Combining high-sensitivity (E5) and high-specificity (AlephBERT) models yields complementary detection coverage. E5's high recall on parallels (0.85) catches explicit matches, while AlephBERT's tighter non-parallel distribution (mean 0.638 vs. E5's 0.882) filters false positives—ensemble-style usage leverages both strengths. Core assumption: False positives and false negatives are independently distributed across models. Evidence anchors: [section 5.4] Both models achieve precision 0.92; E5 recall 0.85, AlephBERT recall 0.82; [section 5.5] "using both the E5 and AlephBERT models as a check and balance of one another offers a promising solution". Break condition: If both models fail on the same parallel type (e.g., heavy paraphrase), combination provides no improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cosine similarity for text embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Primary metric for quantifying passage similarity; interprets vector angle rather than magnitude
  - Quick check question: If passage A has cosine 0.97 to passage B and 0.89 to passage C, what does this suggest about their relationships?

- **Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance)**
  - Why needed here: Measures how much "work" is needed to transform one distribution into another—key for assessing model discriminative quality
  - Quick check question: Two models have identical mean cosine scores for parallels; Model X has Wasserstein 0.05, Model Y has 0.40. Which better separates parallel from non-parallel?

- **Transfer learning limitations for ancient languages**
  - Why needed here: All evaluated models were pre-trained on non-BH corpora; understanding the gap informs fine-tuning needs
  - Quick check question: AlephBERT was trained on modern Hebrew. Name two morphosyntactic features that differ between modern and Biblical Hebrew.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BHSA corpus (BH text) → Pre-trained transformer (E5/AlephBERT/MPNet/LaBSE) → Verse embeddings (per-passage vectors) → Cosine similarity matrix (Chr × Sam/Kgs comparisons) → Parallel score distribution / Non-parallel score distribution → Wasserstein Distance + t-test + classification metrics

- Critical path: 1. Obtain BHSA corpus with parallel verse annotations (558 Chr–Sam/Kgs pairs) 2. Generate embeddings for all verses using each model 3. Compute pairwise cosine similarity between each Chr verse and all Sam/Kgs verses 4. Label known parallels as "parallel" and others as "non-parallel" for evaluation 5. Calculate mean scores, Wasserstein Distance, precision/recall/F1

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **E5**: Highest sensitivity (catches more parallels) but ~15% of true parallels missed as closest match; higher false positive rate due to compressed distribution
  - **AlephBERT**: Better specificity (cleaner non-parallel separation) but lower raw similarity scores may miss subtle allusions
  - **MPNet/LaBSE**: Not recommended—lower optimization for Hebrew limits effectiveness (per section 5.5)

- Failure signatures: Mean non-parallel cosine > 0.85 (indicates model cannot distinguish; see E5 at 0.882); Wasserstein Distance < 0.10 (distribution overlap too high); Precision < 0.85 on closest-match classification (too many false positives); Performance degrades on genre shift (e.g., poetry vs. narrative—untested per section 7)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Load E5 and AlephBERT via HuggingFace, generate embeddings for 50 Chr verses, compute cosine similarity to their known Sam/Kgs parallels and 50 random non-parallel verses. Verify mean parallel > 0.90 for E5 and non-parallel separation > 0.20 for AlephBERT.
  2. **Threshold calibration**: Plot ROC curves for each model by varying cosine similarity threshold; identify optimal threshold per model for F1 maximization on the 558-verse test set.
  3. **Ensemble prototype**: For each Chr verse, require both E5 and AlephBERT to exceed respective thresholds; measure precision/recall change vs. single-model baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can E5 and AlephBERT effectively detect intertextual parallels in non-narrative biblical genres, such as poetry, legal codes, and prophetic literature?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that performance on "poetic parallelism in the Psalter, the covenant code in Exodus, or prophetic sayings of Jeremiah remains untested," limiting generalizability.
  - Why unresolved: The current benchmark was restricted to narrative texts (Samuel/Kings/Chronicles).
  - What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark evaluation using known parallels from poetic and legal corpora within the Hebrew Bible.

- **Does fine-tuning pre-trained models specifically on Biblical Hebrew improve the differentiation between true parallels and false positives?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "fine-tuning models like AlephBERT or E5 for textual similarity on BH remains a productive avenue for future research" to maximize complementary strengths.
  - Why unresolved: This study evaluated models "off-the-shelf" without domain-specific fine-tuning.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative metrics (Wasserstein Distance, precision/recall) of fine-tuned models versus the baseline pre-trained models.

- **Do these transformer-based approaches generalize effectively to intertextual detection in other ancient languages such as Syriac, Greek, or Latin?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "expanding this research to other ancient languages... could provide further insights," hypothesizing generalizability.
  - Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on Biblical Hebrew, leaving cross-linguistic validity untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same benchmark methodology to parallel corpora in other ancient languages.

## Limitations

- Models were evaluated without fine-tuning on Biblical Hebrew, creating uncertainty about generalizability to broader BH intertextuality
- The binary parallel/non-parallel framing may oversimplify the spectrum of intertextual relationships (allusion vs. quotation)
- Fixed verse segmentation could artificially fragment or merge passages that ancient readers would have processed differently

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that transformer embeddings significantly distinguish parallel from non-parallel passages (p < 1e-100) is well-supported by the statistical analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: The Wasserstein Distance interpretation as a reliable discriminator measure has theoretical justification but limited direct corpus validation for BH applications
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about ensemble effectiveness lack empirical support beyond theoretical suggestion

## Next Checks

1. **Genre Robustness Test**: Evaluate model performance separately on poetic passages (Psalms, Proverbs) versus narrative prose (Genesis, Samuel) within the known parallel set to reveal whether embedding quality degrades for morphologically complex or structurally different BH genres.

2. **Fine-tuning Impact Assessment**: Fine-tune AlephBERT on a small annotated BH parallel corpus (e.g., 100 manually verified parallel pairs) and compare performance against the pre-trained baseline to quantify the transfer learning gap.

3. **Multi-passage Context Experiment**: Generate embeddings for 3-verse windows (including context) rather than isolated verses for a subset of parallels to measure whether contextual embeddings improve detection of paraphrased or heavily reworked parallels.
