# The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Introduces a framework comparing semantic models through latent geometries, showing Procrustes distance and Pearson correlation highly agree (-0.99) as structural comparison metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how semantic modeling decisions (like choosing model architecture or hyperparameters) structurally affect the latent geometries of symbol representations. Grounded in Peircean semiotics, the framework abstracts complex model outputs into networks of symbol relationships, enabling formal comparison of model semantics through structural relation measures. The work demonstrates that semantic models impose latent geometries on symbol types that can be compared by treating representations as networks where vertices are symbols and edges represent relationships. Empirical illustrations using LDA models on Pitchfork reviews validate the framework's utility for analyzing model stability and semantic differences.

## Method Summary
The framework compares semantic models by abstracting their latent representations into networks where vertices are symbols and edges represent pairwise relationships. It introduces representation maps (modeling decisions like architecture/hyperparameters) and structural maps (converting representations into relation networks). The method computes pairwise distances (e.g., JSD) between documents to create distance matrices, then compares these matrices using structural relation measures like Procrustes distance. The approach enables analyzing how different modeling decisions affect the inferred "sign geometry" without requiring deep understanding of model mechanics. Code is available at https://github.com/zacharykstine/differential_meaning_of_models.

## Key Results
- Procrustes distance and Pearson correlation show -0.99 agreement when comparing LDA model structures across different dimensionalities
- LDA model stability varies dramatically with dimensionality: k=5 shows high within-k variance (0.16-0.99) while k=1000 shows much lower variance (0.03-0.14)
- The framework successfully isolates the structural consequences of modeling decisions (e.g., dimensionality choice) from random initialization effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structural Abstraction via the Structural Map
Semantic models can be compared "apples-to-apples" by abstracting their latent representations into a shared geometry of symbol relationships, independent of the models' internal mechanics. A structural map converts a representation into a network structure where vertices are symbols and edge weights are pairwise relationship measures, collapsing complex, high-dimensional latent spaces into a common metric space allowing direct comparison via structural relation measures. Core assumption: Computational "meaning" is fully captured by the geometry between symbol types, regardless of the coordinate system.

### Mechanism 2: Contrastive Interpretation (Computational Hermeneutics)
A model's specific interpretive "lens" becomes visible only when contrasted with alternative models, revealing the structural consequences of specific modeling decisions. By holding the symbol set and initial representation constant while varying the representation map (e.g., model architecture or hyperparameters), the resulting differences in structure isolate the effect of the modeling decision. Core assumption: Modeling decisions impose constraints that systematically alter the inferred "sign geometry," and these alterations are measurable.

### Mechanism 3: Metric Validation via Structural Correlation
Procrustes distance and Pearson correlation act as reliable structural relation measures for comparing model outputs, showing high agreement (-0.99 correlation in experiments). The framework validates comparison metrics by checking if two distinct measures of structural difference (one distance-based, one correlation-based) yield consistent rankings of model similarity. High negative correlation suggests they capture the same underlying structural variance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Distributional Hypothesis & Structuralism**: The framework relies on the assumption that meaning is relational (Saussurean) and derived from "differences." Understanding that the "shape" of data *is* the meaning is the bedrock of the structural map. Quick check: Can you explain why two models with identical accuracy metrics might still produce different "structures" of meaning?

- **Peircean Semiotics (Sign Relations)**: The paper grounds its theory in Peirce (Sign, Object, Interpretant). It treats the model as the "Interpretant" (the perspective) that resolves the ambiguity of the "Sign" (data) into a structure. Quick check: In this framework, does the "meaning" inhere in the data, the model, or the relationship between them?

- **Procrustes Analysis**: Used as the primary structural relation measure. It determines the optimal alignment between two sets of points (structures) and measures the residual error, allowing comparison of geometries regardless of rotation or translation. Quick check: Why is Procrustes distance suitable for comparing two distance matrices derived from different model dimensionalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Space (R, S) -> Representation Maps (θ) -> Structural Map (f) -> Meta-Structural Layer (δ)
- **Critical path**: 1) Fix S and R, 2) Generate θR (train models), 3) Compute G (distance matrices), 4) Compute δ(Gi, Gj) (compare structures)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Relation Measure (d) choice affects resulting geometry; Symbol Sampling (S) balances computational cost vs. stochasticity
- **Failure signatures**: Dimensional Mismatch (attempting Procrustes on vectors of different dimensions), Inconsistent Preprocessing (confounding variables), Random Seed Noise (obscuring true structural differences)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Seed Stability Test (baseline structural noise), 2) Dimensionality Sweep (clustering resulting structures), 3) Metric Cross-Check (verifying δ alignment)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Are the relationships between semantic models consistent across different datasets, or are they context-dependent?
- **Basis in paper**: Page 9 asks, "Are the semantics of Θ fixed across representations, or are they particular to each representation?"
- **Why unresolved**: The empirical illustration analyzes only a single dataset (Pitchfork reviews), so the generalizability of model relationships remains unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative analysis of model geometries across diverse corpora to check if relational patterns between models persist.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How semantically distinct are different performance measures in terms of the latent structures they imply?
- **Basis in paper**: Page 16 asks, "how semantically distinct different performance measures are, which we can describe as the distinctness of the idealized structures they entail."
- **Why unresolved**: The framework currently focuses on unsupervised semantic structures rather than linking them to optimization targets.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Mapping the idealized structures entailed by various loss functions and comparing their geometries using the framework.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent do analytical results reflect the underlying data versus the specific modeling choices?
- **Basis in paper**: Page 17 highlights the need to determine "the extent to which any results... are a reflection of our data versus the models through which we 'read' those data."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates comparison methods but does not provide a method for decomposing the variance of the final structure.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A quantitative decomposition of structural variation into components attributable to the data and the modeling decisions.

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on Peircean semiotics as applied to computational models, which lacks extensive empirical validation in machine learning literature
- The conclusions depend on specific structural relation measures (Procrustes distance, Pearson correlation) being appropriate for all semantic modeling contexts
- The framework requires consistent symbol sets across models being compared but doesn't fully address handling fundamentally different vocabularies or modalities

## Confidence

- **High**: The structural abstraction mechanism (mapping representations to relation networks) is well-defined and empirically demonstrated
- **Medium**: The contrastive interpretation mechanism and metric validation claims are supported but could benefit from broader testing across different model types
- **Medium**: The claim that structural differences reveal interpretive "lens" of models is theoretically sound but requires more diverse empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model architecture validation**: Apply the framework to compare fundamentally different model types (e.g., LDA vs. BERT) rather than just varying hyperparameters within LDA to test robustness
2. **Relation measure sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the pairwise relation measure (d) beyond JSD to test if structural conclusions remain stable across different semantic distance metrics
3. **Multi-modal extension test**: Apply the framework to non-text data (e.g., image embeddings from CNN vs. ViT) to validate if the structural comparison approach generalizes beyond text-based semantic models
