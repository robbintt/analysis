core_contribution: This paper proposes a novel framework for high-dimensional time
  series forecasting by integrating textual data with time series models. The key
  idea is to leverage the dual-tower structure commonly used in multimodal models,
  where a time series model extracts features from numerical data and a large language
  model processes textual information.

- Primary Result: TextFusionHTS framework improves high-dimensional time series forecasting by integrating textual data with time series models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TextFusionHTS, a novel framework that combines textual data with traditional time series models to enhance forecasting accuracy in high-dimensional settings. The approach leverages a dual-tower architecture where time series features and textual representations are extracted separately and then fused through a cross-attention mechanism. The framework is evaluated on Wiki-People and News datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting performance, especially for longer prediction horizons.

## Method Summary
The TextFusionHTS framework employs a dual-tower structure where numerical time series data is processed by a dedicated time series model while textual information is handled by a large language model. These separate representations are then combined using a cross-attention mechanism to produce the final forecast. The approach is specifically designed for high-dimensional time series where multiple related series are available, and textual data can provide additional context for the predictions.

## Key Results
- Incorporating textual data significantly improves forecasting performance on tested datasets
- Improvements are particularly notable for longer forecasting horizons
- Performance gains are measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the complementary strengths of time series models and language models. Time series models excel at capturing temporal patterns and dependencies in numerical data, while language models can extract contextual information and semantic meaning from text. The cross-attention mechanism allows these two information sources to interact dynamically, enabling the model to use textual context to inform temporal predictions and vice versa.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dual-tower architecture**: Separates feature extraction for different modalities, allowing specialized processing for each data type
  - Why needed: Different data types require different processing approaches
  - Quick check: Verify that each tower can independently produce meaningful representations

- **Cross-attention mechanism**: Enables dynamic interaction between time series and textual representations
  - Why needed: To combine complementary information sources effectively
  - Quick check: Confirm that attention weights meaningfully align related features

- **High-dimensional forecasting**: Addresses scenarios with multiple related time series simultaneously
  - Why needed: Many real-world applications involve forecasting multiple related series
  - Quick check: Validate performance across different dimensionalities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Time Series Model -> Cross-Attention -> Text Representation -> Fusion Layer -> Forecast Output

**Critical Path**: Numerical Time Series → Time Series Model → Cross-Attention → Final Forecast

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual-tower approach allows specialized processing but introduces complexity in the fusion stage. Cross-attention provides rich interactions but increases computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may arise from temporal misalignment between text and time series data, or when textual information lacks relevance to the target series.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test the framework on a simple synthetic dataset where textual context clearly influences numerical patterns
2. Perform ablation studies removing either the text or time series components to measure their individual contributions
3. Evaluate performance across different forecasting horizons to verify the claimed advantage for longer-term predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dual-tower architecture may face scalability challenges with very high-dimensional data or large textual datasets
- Evaluation is limited to two specific datasets, limiting generalizability to other domains
- The framework doesn't address potential issues with temporal misalignment between text and time series data

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of time series and text processing components
2. Evaluate the framework on additional datasets from diverse domains (financial markets, climate data)
3. Investigate the impact of temporal misalignment by introducing controlled delays between text and time series data
