# HINTS: Extraction of Human Insights from Time-Series Without External Sources

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.23755
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23755
- **Authors**: Sheo Yon Jhin; Noseong Park
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: Self-supervised extraction of human behavioral signals from time-series residuals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 28.9% on traffic data without external data.

## Executive Summary
HINTS introduces a self-supervised framework that extracts latent human behavioral signals directly from time-series residuals without relying on external data sources. The method uses Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics as a structural inductive bias to model social influence, memory, and bias patterns within residuals. These extracted Human Factors are integrated into forecasting models via an attention mechanism, consistently improving prediction accuracy across nine real-world datasets while providing interpretable insights aligned with real-world events.

## Method Summary
HINTS operates in two stages: First, STL decomposition isolates residuals from trend and seasonality, which are then transformed by a neural network into latent Human Factors guided by a Friedkin-Johnsen constraint that models social influence, self-memory, and dynamic bias. Second, these factors are passed through a Conv1D-based attention network to create a modulation map that is applied to the original input before feeding it to any backbone forecaster (DLinear, PatchTST, or TimeMixer). The entire framework is trained self-supervised, requiring no external labels or data sources.

## Key Results
- HINTS achieves up to 28.9% improvement on PEMS traffic data and 12.7% on Exchange data compared to baselines.
- Performance consistently exceeds methods using external data sources like news or social media.
- Case studies confirm extracted Human Factors align with real-world events, demonstrating practical utility.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Time-series residuals encode structured human behavioral patterns rather than pure stochastic noise. STL decomposition leaves residuals $R_i(t)$, which a neural network transforms into latent Human Factors $\hat{H}_i(t)$ capturing delayed reactions, herding, and sentiment shifts invisible to structural decomposition. This works when human-driven influences are embedded in time-series signals at generation time, leaving recoverable traces in residuals.

### Mechanism 2
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics provides a valid structural inductive bias for modeling latent human factors. The FJ constraint forces $\hat{H}_i(t)$ to evolve via Social Influence (weighted neighbor signals), Self-Memory (temporal inertia), and Dynamic Bias (rolling mean baseline). This works when residual dynamics follow sociologically plausible opinion evolution patterns where variables influence each other while retaining self-memory and bias.

### Mechanism 3
Attention-based modulation of forecasting inputs improves accuracy by selectively amplifying human-relevant signals. Extracted Human Factors pass through Conv1D-Tanh-Softmax network producing attention map $A^T_D$. The modulated input $\tilde{X}^T_D = X^T_D + \gamma \cdot (X^T_D \odot A^T_D)$ is fed to any backbone forecaster. This works when not all residual-derived behavioral signals are equally relevant at each timestep; soft attention selects the most predictive patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: STL Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 requires isolating residuals from trend/seasonality before Human Factor extraction.
  - Quick check question: Given a time series with strong weekly seasonality and upward trend, what remains after STL decomposition?

- **Concept: Opinion Dynamics Models (DeGroot vs. Friedkin-Johnsen)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why FJ (with stubbornness/intrinsic beliefs) is chosen over consensus-seeking DeGroot for human behavior modeling.
  - Quick check question: Why would a consensus-seeking model fail to capture polarized market sentiment?

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Learning with Constraint Losses**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 trains without labels using $L_{FJ}$ as a structural constraint, not a prediction target.
  - Quick check question: How does minimizing $\|H^T_D - \hat{H}^T_D\|^2$ differ from standard MSE forecasting loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: STL Decomposition -> Residuals $R^T_D$ -> Human Factor Extractor (linear layer $f_\theta$) -> $\hat{H}^T_D$ (trained with $L_{FJ}$) -> Attention Network (Conv1D-Tanh-Softmax) -> Modulated Input $\tilde{X}^T_D$ -> Backbone Forecaster (DLinear/PatchTST/TimeMixer) -> Prediction

- **Critical path**: 1. Compute correlation matrix $W = [w_{ij}]$ between variables for social influence weights; 2. Implement Eq. 4-6: aggregate neighbor influence, self-memory, and dynamic bias; 3. Train Stage 1 until $L_{FJ}$ converges (extractor frozen thereafter); 4. Train Stage 2 with forecasting loss $L_{forecast}$ while modulating inputs

- **Design tradeoffs**: Lightweight extractor (single linear layer) vs. deeper networks; window size $W$ for dynamic bias $B_i(t)$ controls how slowly bias adapts; $\gamma$ range tunes modulation strength

- **Failure signatures**: $L_{FJ}$ not decreasing suggests check that correlation matrix $W$ is properly normalized and residual extraction is correct; Stage 2 underperforms backbone alone indicates $\gamma$ may be too aggressive or FJ constraint learned irrelevant patterns; attention map shows uniform weights suggests Conv1D attention may need capacity increase

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce ablation (Table 4) on PeMS08 with h=720: validate that removing each FJ component degrades performance; 2. Sweep $\gamma \in \{0.1, 0.5, 1.0\}$ on Exchange dataset: confirm sensitivity pattern from Figure 4; 3. Visualize attention map $A^T_D$ for a known market event (e.g., earnings announcement): verify semantic alignment per Figure 3

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the extracted "Human Factors" be causally validated against ground-truth psychological or sociological metrics, rather than relying solely on post-hoc temporal alignment with news events? The framework is self-supervised and label-free; without external validation data, the "human" nature of the factor is an assumption supported by correlation but not proven by causation.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of HINTS vary when using alternative time-series decomposition techniques (e.g., Wavelet or Empirical Mode Decomposition) instead of STL? The framework relies on the residual component obtained via STL decomposition as the primary signal for extraction, assuming this residual contains the relevant latent dynamics.

### Open Question 3
Does the structural inductive bias of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model hinder performance on time-series domains driven primarily by physical laws rather than social interaction? While the paper tests on Traffic and Electricity datasets, it assumes these systems fit the "opinion dynamics" paradigm; it does not test on purely physical systems where such sociological constraints might be invalid.

## Limitations
- Core hypothesis relies heavily on structural assumptions (FJ dynamics) not validated against ground-truth human factors
- Limited qualitative validation of what extracted Human Factors actually represent
- Key unknowns include exact architecture of attention network and critical hyperparameters

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: HINTS improves forecasting accuracy over baselines without external data. This is demonstrated across nine datasets with multiple evaluation metrics and is reproducible given the detailed methodology.
- **Medium Confidence**: Residuals encode structured human behavioral patterns recoverable through FJ-constrained extraction. While performance gains support this, direct evidence linking extracted factors to actual human behavior is limited to case studies without rigorous validation.
- **Low Confidence**: FJ opinion dynamics is the optimal structural bias for all time-series domains. The paper provides no comparative validation against alternative structural constraints.

## Next Checks

1. **Ground Truth Validation**: Conduct a controlled experiment where synthetic time series with known human behavioral components (generated via FJ or similar opinion dynamics) are mixed with noise, then test whether HINTS can recover these ground-truth factors.

2. **Alternative Structural Constraints**: Replace FJ dynamics with alternative structural biases (e.g., ARIMA residuals, GARCH volatility patterns) and compare Human Factor extraction quality and forecasting performance on the same datasets.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: Systematically vary critical hyperparameters (λ, window W, attention network capacity) and correlation matrix computation methods to identify which components are essential versus performance-stable.
