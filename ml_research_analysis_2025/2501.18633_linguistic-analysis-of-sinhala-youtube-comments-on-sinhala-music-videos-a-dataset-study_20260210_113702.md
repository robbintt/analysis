# Linguistic Analysis of Sinhala YouTube Comments on Sinhala Music Videos: A Dataset Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.18633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18633
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Comprehensive dataset of 63,471 Sinhala comments from 27 videos, identifying 54,834 unique words and 328,922 word pairs, with applications in Music Information Retrieval and Emotion Recognition

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive linguistic analysis of Sinhala YouTube comments on Sinhala music videos, creating a dataset of 63,471 comments from 27 videos. The research focuses on Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER) applications, employing preprocessing, transliteration, and filtering techniques to refine the data. The analysis reveals rich emotional expressions and linguistic patterns unique to this domain, identifying 54,834 unique Sinhala words and 328,922 word pairs. The study also derives 964 Sinhala stop words and compares the YouTube comment corpus with general Sinhala corpora, finding 36% overlap.

## Method Summary
The researchers collected 63,471 Sinhala comments from 27 music videos on YouTube. They applied preprocessing techniques including transliteration and filtering to refine the dataset. The study involved identifying unique words and word pairs, deriving stop words, and comparing the comment corpus with general Sinhala language corpora. The methodology focused on capturing emotional expressions and linguistic patterns specific to music-related comments.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains 63,471 Sinhala comments from 27 music videos
- Identified 54,834 unique Sinhala words and 328,922 word pairs
- Derived 964 Sinhala stop words, with 182 matching English stop words
- Found 36% overlap between YouTube comment corpus and general Sinhala corpora

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study works by leveraging the rich emotional content in YouTube comments about music videos, which provides valuable data for MIR and MER applications. The transliteration and preprocessing steps ensure the data is in a usable format for linguistic analysis, while the filtering process removes noise and irrelevant content. The comparison with general Sinhala corpora helps identify domain-specific linguistic features and emotional expressions unique to music discussions.

## Foundational Learning
- Transliteration importance: Why needed - Converts non-Latin scripts to Latin for analysis; Quick check - Verify accuracy of transliterated words against original script
- Stop word derivation: Why needed - Identifies common words that don't carry significant meaning; Quick check - Compare derived stop words with established lists
- Corpus comparison: Why needed - Highlights domain-specific linguistic features; Quick check - Calculate overlap percentages with other domain corpora

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Transliteration -> Filtering -> Analysis -> Comparison
Critical path: The preprocessing and transliteration steps are critical as they directly affect the quality and usability of the data for subsequent analysis.
Design tradeoffs: The study balances between comprehensive data collection and manageable analysis scope, choosing 27 videos as a representative sample.
Failure signatures: Incomplete transliteration could lead to inaccurate word counts and analysis errors.
First experiments: 1) Validate transliteration accuracy on a subset of comments, 2) Test stop word derivation algorithm on known datasets, 3) Perform preliminary emotional expression analysis on a small sample

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset may not be fully representative due to limited number of videos (27)
- Transliteration process may introduce biases or errors
- Focus on emotional expressions might overlook other linguistic features
- Comparison with general corpora limited by availability and scope of existing resources

## Confidence
- High confidence in dataset size and preprocessing methodology
- Medium confidence in emotional expression analysis
- Low confidence in broader MIR and MER implications

## Next Checks
1. Expand the dataset to include a more diverse range of Sinhala music videos to ensure broader representativeness
2. Conduct a comparative analysis with other language datasets to validate the transliteration process and its impact on linguistic analysis
3. Perform a longitudinal study to assess the stability and consistency of emotional expressions in Sinhala YouTube comments over time
