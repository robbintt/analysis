# A Generalizable Rhetorical Strategy Annotation Model Using LLM-based Debate Simulation and Labelling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15081
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15081
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: LLM-based framework generates high-quality synthetic debate data for rhetorical strategy detection, validated against human annotations and improving persuasiveness prediction by ~8% relative.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a scalable framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data for detecting rhetorical strategies. Using a four-part typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral), the approach produces topic-controlled, high-quality synthetic arguments, labeled via persona-simulated LLMs and validated against human annotations. Fine-tuned RoBERTa models demonstrate strong performance across diverse topics and domains, with rhetorical strategy features improving persuasiveness prediction by ~8% (relative). Analysis of U.S. Presidential debates reveals a significant shift toward emotional over empirical strategies. The framework offers a generalizable, low-cost alternative to human annotation for rhetorical analysis.

## Method Summary
The framework generates synthetic debate data using multi-agent LLM simulation with controlled rhetorical constraints, followed by a detect-and-revise loop to ensure strategy adherence. Each argument is labeled by multiple persona-conditioned LLMs reflecting demographic diversity, with scores averaged to produce continuous labels. A fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model performs multi-label regression to detect the four rhetorical strategies. The system achieves strong performance (Spearman correlations 0.850–0.939) and demonstrates improved persuasiveness prediction when rhetorical features are incorporated. The approach is validated against human annotations and tested across diverse topics and domains.

## Key Results
- Strong Spearman correlations (0.850–0.939) between rhetorical classifier predictions and LLM-generated labels
- LLM-generated labels show strong agreement with human annotations (ρ = 0.599–0.716)
- Rhetorical strategy features improve persuasiveness prediction by ~8% (relative) within and across datasets
- Analysis reveals significant shift toward emotional strategies in U.S. Presidential debates (1960–2020)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-generated debate dialogues with controlled rhetorical constraints can produce high-quality, topic-diverse synthetic training data at scale.
- Mechanism: Multi-agent LLM simulation generates arguments by prompting agents to adopt or avoid specific strategies (causal, empirical, emotional, moral), with a detect-and-revise loop ensuring adherence to strategy constraints before data enters the training pipeline.
- Core assumption: The LLM (GPT-4o) can reliably follow explicit rhetorical instructions and that the detect-and-revise process corrects deviations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a four-part rhetorical typology..."
  - [section 4.2] "Agents were prompted to either adopt or avoid one of four rhetorical strategies... ensuring a balanced distribution of strategies across topics..."
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., *AgenticSimLaw*, arXiv:2601.21936) shows LLM-based multi-agent debate simulation can produce coherent, role-structured outputs, supporting the feasibility of controlled generation.
- Break condition: If LLM-generated arguments systematically fail to adhere to strategy prompts even after revision cycles, or if the generated text exhibits topic-strategy confounding that persists after dataset balancing, the synthetic data quality degrades and model performance would drop.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Persona-conditioned LLM annotators can approximate human annotation quality for rhetorical strategy scoring with higher internal consistency and lower cost.
- Mechanism: Multiple LLM instances are assigned personas reflecting U.S. demographic distributions and independently rate each argument on strategy presence. Their scores are averaged to produce a continuous label, reducing individual annotator noise.
- Core assumption: (1) The persona-prompting method captures meaningful interpretive diversity; (2) Averaging across multiple persona-LLMs approximates human consensus better than a single LLM or human annotator.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...labeled via persona-simulated LLMs and validated against human annotations."
  - [section 5.1.1] LLM scoring shows strong Spearman correlations with human annotations (ρ = 0.599–0.716, all p < 0.001).
  - [section 5.1.2] Individual LLM annotators align more closely with human consensus (avg. ρ = 0.514) than individual human annotators do (avg. ρ = 0.330).
  - [corpus] Work on LLM-based qualitative analysis (e.g., arXiv:2512.04121) discusses potential and limitations; however, direct evidence for persona-based annotation remains limited in the corpus. Corpus evidence for this specific mechanism is weak.
- Break condition: If persona-conditioned LLMs exhibit systematic bias (e.g., over-labeling emotional content) not present in human annotations, or if inter-LLM consistency does not translate to human alignment, the labels will mislead the downstream classifier.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating predicted rhetorical strategy scores as features improves the performance of persuasiveness prediction models.
- Mechanism: A fine-tuned BERT model encodes text into embeddings; these are concatenated with a projected vector of the four predicted strategy scores (from the rhetorical classifier) before final prediction. This provides explicit signals about argumentative form.
- Core assumption: Rhetorical strategy use is causally relevant to persuasiveness, and the classifier provides sufficiently accurate strategy signals to be useful as features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Rhetorical strategy features improve persuasiveness prediction by ~8% (relative) within and across datasets."
  - [section 6.1] Shows consistent improvements in Spearman correlation (relative +8.40% within-domain, +7.77% cross-domain) and RMSE reduction when strategy features are added.
  - [corpus] Related work on persuasion (e.g., *Decoding Human and AI Persuasion...*, arXiv:2512.12817) connects rhetorical principles to persuasiveness, providing conceptual support but not direct evidence for this feature-integration mechanism.
- Break condition: If the rhetorical classifier makes systematic errors (e.g., confuses moral and emotional strategies), or if persuasiveness in a target domain relies on factors orthogonal to these four strategies, the feature augmentation could introduce noise and degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Rhetorical Strategy Typology (Causal, Empirical, Emotional, Moral)**
  - Why needed here: This four-part typology is the target label space for all annotation, generation, and classification. Without understanding these definitions, you cannot validate data quality or debug model predictions.
  - Quick check question: Given an argument that says "We must act now because it's our moral duty to protect future generations," which strategy or strategies would you assign, and why?

- **LLM-Based Synthetic Data Generation & Annotation**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on using LLMs as both data generators and annotators. Engineers must understand the prompts, the detect-and-revise cycle, and the persona-based scoring to assess data validity.
  - Quick check question: What are two potential failure modes when using an LLM to generate data with a specific rhetorical constraint (e.g., "use only causal arguments")?

- **Transfer Learning with Transformer-based Models (RoBERTa)**
  - Why needed here: The core model is a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier. Understanding the regression setup, the train/validation/test splits, and the evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation, RMSE) is essential for reproducing and extending the work.
  - Quick check question: The paper uses Spearman correlation to evaluate the classifier. Why is this more appropriate than accuracy for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Topic & Stance Generator -> Debate Simulator (with Detect-Revise) -> Persona-based Annotator -> Label Aggregator -> Rhetorical Classifier -> Downstream Application Head
- **Critical path**: Topic Generation -> Debate Simulation (with Detect-Revise) -> Persona Annotation -> Label Aggregation -> Rhetorical Classifier Training -> Downstream Task Integration
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Synthetic vs. Human Data**: Trading off human annotation cost and scalability against potential domain shift and LLM biases in synthetic data
  - **Persona Diversity vs. Consistency**: Using multiple personas increases label robustness but also computational cost
  - **Classifier Choice (RoBERTa vs. LLaMA)**: RoBERTa-base was chosen for better performance and efficiency; LLaMA with QLoRA was less effective in the paper's tests
  - **Granularity of Labels**: Continuous (0-1) scores preserve uncertainty but are harder for humans to annotate reliably, as shown by low inter-rater agreement
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Low correlation between classifier predictions and human labels on new domains**: Indicates poor generalization; may require domain-adaptive training or more diverse synthetic topics
  - **High RMSE in persuasiveness prediction when strategy features are added**: Suggests the rhetorical classifier is providing noisy or irrelevant features for that specific dataset
  - **LLM-generated debates are off-topic or repetitive**: Points to a failure in the debate simulator or the round-level refinement prompts
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Validate Synthetic Data Quality**: Before training, manually inspect a sample of generated arguments from the "use" and "avoid" conditions for each strategy. Check if the detect-and-revise process is working as intended.
  2. **Ablate Persona Annotator Count**: Train the rhetorical classifier with labels from 1, 3, and 5 persona-LLMs to quantify the impact of averaging on label quality and model performance.
  3. **Test Downstream Impact**: Replicate the persuasiveness prediction experiment on a held-out dataset not used in the paper (e.g., a different online debate forum). Compare the "vanilla" model against the "strategy-augmented" model to confirm the ~8% relative improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the framework generalize to non-English languages and cultural contexts with different rhetorical norms (e.g., individualist vs. collectivist)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state future research is needed to "extend our framework to multiple languages and cross-cultural comparisons."
- Why unresolved: The current study was restricted to English data generated by LLMs likely biased toward Western argumentation styles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful validation of the annotation model on non-English debate corpora with distinct cultural rhetorical traditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Are specific rhetorical strategies, particularly affective ones, significantly correlated with the dissemination of misinformation or disinformation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note, "Future research is needed to... compare rhetorical strategies used in arguments that are truthful, intentionally misleading, or misinformed."
- Why unresolved: The study explicitly orthogonalized strategy from veracity, ignoring truthfulness to focus solely on persuasive form.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dataset linking rhetorical labels to fact-checked truth values to analyze correlations between strategies (e.g., emotional vs. causal) and veracity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating synthetic data from non-debate contexts (e.g., advertising, fundraising) improve the model's transferability to those domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "we can potentially improve transferability by incorporating simulations from other persuasive contexts such as advertising or fundraising."
- Why unresolved: The current model was fine-tuned exclusively on data from a debate simulation framework, potentially limiting its robustness in less structured contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks showing improved accuracy on external advertising or fundraising datasets after mixed-domain training.

## Limitations
- Framework tested primarily on U.S. political debates, raising questions about cross-cultural and cross-domain generalization
- Detect-and-revise cycle assumes perfect strategy adherence after two rounds, which may not hold for complex or ambiguous strategies
- Topic diversity constrained to U.S. political issues, limiting applicability to scientific debates, marketing copy, or other domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework achieves strong Spearman correlations (0.850–0.939) for rhetorical strategy detection within the synthetic data domain
- **Medium confidence**: Persona-LLM annotations correlate well with human labels (ρ = 0.599–0.716) but are not a perfect substitute for human annotation in all contexts
- **Low confidence**: Cross-domain robustness of the framework and the causal link between rhetorical features and persuasiveness improvement in all datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Test strategy classifier on held-out human-annotated debates** from a different domain (e.g., academic arguments) to assess cross-domain performance and identify potential strategy misalignment
2. **Ablate persona diversity**: Train the classifier using labels from 1, 3, and 5 persona-LLMs to quantify the impact of averaging on label quality and downstream performance
3. **Analyze strategy-shift in non-political debates**: Apply the framework to datasets like product reviews or scientific arguments to see if emotional dominance persists or if other strategies dominate
