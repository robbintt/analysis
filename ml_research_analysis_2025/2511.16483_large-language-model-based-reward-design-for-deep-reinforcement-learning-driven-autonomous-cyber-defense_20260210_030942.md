# Large Language Model-Based Reward Design for Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Autonomous Cyber Defense

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16483
- Authors: Sayak Mukherjee; Samrat Chatterjee; Emilie Purvine; Ted Fujimoto; Tegan Emerson
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: LLM-guided reward designs lead to effective defense strategies with up to 95th percentile delays of 18 time steps against stealthy attackers

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of designing effective reward structures for autonomous cyber defense agents using large language models (LLMs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks. The authors propose using an LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) to generate context-aware reward designs for attack and defense agents based on their behavioral characteristics. These LLM-generated rewards are then used to train DRL-based autonomous cyber defense policies in a high-fidelity simulation environment called Cyberwheel. The approach creates diverse agent personas (aggressive/stealthy attackers, proactive defenders) with corresponding reward structures that enable more effective cyber defense strategies.

## Method Summary
The core methodology involves using LLM-generated rewards to guide the training of DRL agents in a cyber defense simulation environment. The process begins with defining attack and defense agent personas through prompt engineering with Claude Sonnet 4. The LLM generates reward structures tailored to each persona's behavioral characteristics, including aggressive and stealthy attackers as well as proactive defenders. These generated rewards are then used to train DRL policies in the Cyberwheel simulation environment, which provides a high-fidelity representation of network security scenarios. The trained agents are evaluated against different attacker types, and the results demonstrate that LLM-guided reward designs produce superior defense performance compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- Proactive-v2 defender showed superior performance against both stealthy and aggressive attackers
- Effective policy involves switching between baseline and proactive-v2 defender personas based on encountered attacker type
- Achieved up to 95th percentile delays of 18 time steps against stealthy attackers
- LLM-guided reward designs demonstrated clear performance advantages over baseline approaches in the Cyberwheel simulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-based approach works by leveraging the model's ability to understand complex behavioral patterns and translate them into effective reward structures. By prompting the LLM with specific agent personas and behavioral goals, the system can generate nuanced reward designs that capture the strategic nuances of cyber defense scenarios. This allows the DRL agents to learn more sophisticated and contextually appropriate behaviors compared to manually designed reward functions. The LLM's natural language understanding capabilities enable it to incorporate strategic considerations and behavioral subtleties that might be overlooked in traditional reward engineering approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Prompt -> LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) -> Reward Design -> DRL Agent Training -> Cyberwheel Simulation -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
Prompt engineering for agent personas → LLM reward generation → DRL policy training → Cyberwheel simulation → Performance evaluation → Policy refinement

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational overhead of LLM-based reward generation vs. manual reward design
- Generalization capability of LLM-generated rewards vs. domain-specific customization
- Interpretability of LLM-generated reward structures vs. traditional hand-crafted rewards
- Real-time applicability of LLM-based approaches vs. offline reward design

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor agent performance indicating inadequate reward design
- Agents exploiting loopholes in LLM-generated rewards
- Overfitting to specific simulation scenarios rather than generalizable behaviors
- Computational bottlenecks in LLM reward generation process

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare performance of LLM-generated rewards vs. manually designed baseline rewards
2. Evaluate agent performance across different attacker persona types
3. Test adaptability of trained policies to novel attack scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on a single LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) without exploring variations across different models
- Evaluation confined to a single high-fidelity simulation environment (Cyberwheel)
- No discussion of computational overhead for real-time reward generation scenarios
- Lack of mechanisms for human oversight of critical reward design decisions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Experimental results demonstrating superior performance of LLM-guided reward designs within the Cyberwheel simulation environment

**Medium Confidence:**
- Generalizability of the LLM-based reward design approach to other cyber defense scenarios and real-world environments

**Low Confidence:**
- Long-term effectiveness and robustness of LLM-generated rewards in dynamic, evolving cyber threat landscapes without continuous human oversight and refinement

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive validation across multiple diverse simulation environments and real-world network testbeds to assess generalizability and robustness of LLM-generated reward structures.
2. Perform ablation studies comparing reward quality and agent performance across different LLMs, prompting strategies, and human-designed reward baselines to quantify the value added by the LLM approach.
3. Implement a longitudinal study tracking the performance of LLM-guided agents over extended periods with evolving attack patterns to evaluate adaptability and potential degradation of effectiveness over time.
