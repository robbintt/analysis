# Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13362
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: CP-Traj achieves improved calibration scores with tighter prediction intervals compared to state-of-the-art baselines like ACI, demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets including the Cyclone dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CP-Traj, a novel framework for generating calibrated prediction intervals around sampled trajectories in online settings. The method addresses the challenge of producing reliable uncertainty estimates for trajectory forecasting by introducing an adaptive online update mechanism that maintains long-term coverage guarantees. CP-Traj captures inter-step dependencies across forecast horizons through a sophisticated optimization approach, enabling it to produce sharper and more adaptive uncertainty estimates compared to existing methods.

The framework is evaluated across both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in calibration scores while producing tighter prediction intervals than state-of-the-art baselines. On the Cyclone dataset, CP-Traj achieves a calibration score of 0.064 compared to 0.133 for ACI, while maintaining competitive prediction interval widths. The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to dynamically adjust calibration thresholds in response to changing data distributions while preserving theoretical coverage guarantees.

## Method Summary
CP-Traj operates by generating a set of candidate calibration thresholds during each online update step, which are then optimized to capture inter-step dependencies across forecast horizons. The framework maintains a sliding window of recent observations to estimate the data distribution and adaptively updates the calibration parameters. A key innovation is the optimization step that explicitly models dependencies between different time steps in the trajectory, allowing for more coherent uncertainty quantification across the entire forecast horizon. The method produces prediction intervals that are both well-calibrated (achieving the desired coverage probability) and tight (minimizing unnecessary width), addressing the fundamental trade-off in conformal prediction for sequential data.

## Key Results
- On the Cyclone dataset, CP-Traj achieves a calibration score of 0.064 compared to 0.133 for the ACI baseline
- CP-Traj produces prediction intervals with width of 1.777 compared to 1.219 for ACI on the same dataset
- The method demonstrates consistent improvements across both synthetic and real-world trajectory datasets
- Long-term coverage guarantees are maintained while achieving sharper uncertainty estimates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CP-Traj's effectiveness stems from its ability to dynamically adapt calibration thresholds based on observed data patterns while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees. The framework captures temporal dependencies across forecast horizons through its optimization step, which allows it to produce coherent uncertainty estimates that reflect the true structure of trajectory data. By maintaining a set of candidate thresholds and updating them online, the method can respond to changing data distributions without sacrificing calibration accuracy. The inter-step dependency modeling ensures that prediction intervals are consistent across time, preventing the accumulation of uncertainty that can occur with independent interval construction at each time step.

## Foundational Learning
**Conformal Prediction** - A framework for producing statistically rigorous prediction intervals by calibrating against holdout data; needed to ensure valid coverage guarantees in online settings; quick check: verify marginal coverage holds at desired confidence level.
**Online Learning** - Sequential update mechanisms that adapt to streaming data; needed to handle non-stationary data distributions in trajectory forecasting; quick check: measure adaptation speed to distribution shifts.
**Trajectory Forecasting** - Predicting sequences of spatial positions over time; needed as the primary application domain; quick check: evaluate forecast accuracy on held-out trajectories.
**Calibration Metrics** - Quantitative measures of prediction interval quality (e.g., calibration score); needed to compare method performance objectively; quick check: ensure calibration scores align with visual inspection of interval coverage.
**Inter-step Dependencies** - Statistical relationships between predictions at different time horizons; needed to produce coherent uncertainty estimates across trajectories; quick check: verify correlation structure is preserved in prediction intervals.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Stream -> Online Update Module -> Candidate Threshold Generator -> Optimization Module -> Prediction Intervals -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:** The core inference loop consists of receiving new trajectory data, updating the calibration model through the online update module, generating candidate thresholds, optimizing for inter-step dependencies, and producing final prediction intervals for the next forecast horizon.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method balances computational complexity (through efficient candidate threshold generation) against prediction quality (through comprehensive optimization). The sliding window approach trades memory usage for adaptability to non-stationary distributions. The number of candidate thresholds represents a hyperparameter controlling the granularity of the calibration search space versus computational cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor calibration in highly non-stationary environments where distribution shifts occur faster than the update frequency. Suboptimal performance when trajectory dependencies are weak or when data contains extreme outliers that violate conformal assumptions. Computational bottlenecks may arise when the optimization step becomes expensive for high-dimensional trajectory spaces.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify marginal coverage on synthetic data with known ground truth to confirm calibration guarantees
2. Test adaptation speed by introducing controlled distribution shifts and measuring recovery time
3. Compare prediction interval widths against baseline methods while maintaining coverage to assess sharpness improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of the optimization step may become prohibitive for very high-dimensional trajectory ensembles or real-time applications with strict latency requirements
- Evaluation focuses primarily on specific domains (e.g., Cyclone dataset), leaving open questions about generalization to other trajectory prediction scenarios with different characteristics
- Limited discussion of failure modes or edge cases, such as highly non-stationary environments or datasets with extreme outliers where the method might struggle

## Confidence
High: Theoretical framework and empirical improvements over baselines are well-supported with rigorous evaluation setup and statistical guarantees
Medium: Scalability claims have limited computational complexity analysis and may not generalize to all deployment scenarios
Low: Generalizability beyond tested domains is uncertain given the narrow scope of evaluated datasets and specific application focus

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark CP-Traj against state-of-the-art methods on additional trajectory datasets with different temporal and spatial characteristics to assess robustness across domains
2. Conduct a scalability analysis measuring runtime and memory usage as trajectory ensemble size and forecast horizon increase to quantify practical limitations
3. Design stress tests exposing CP-Traj to non-stationary data distributions and outlier scenarios, documenting failure modes and robustness compared to baselines
