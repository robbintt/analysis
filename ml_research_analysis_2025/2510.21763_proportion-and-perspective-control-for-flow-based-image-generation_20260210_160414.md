# Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763
- Reference count: 11
- The paper introduces two ControlNet modules for FLUX.1-dev to enable artistic control over image generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two ControlNet modules for FLUX.1-dev to enable artistic control over image generation. The Proportion ControlNet uses bounding boxes to guide object placement and scale, while the Perspective ControlNet employs vanishing lines to control 3D geometry and viewpoint. Both modules were trained using automated data pipelines that process unannotated datasets. The Proportion ControlNet effectively places objects within bounding boxes but exhibits a stylistic bias toward "pictorial" styles. The Perspective ControlNet successfully handles 1- and 2-point perspectives but fails on 3-point perspectives due to data distribution limitations. When both ControlNets are applied simultaneously, high guidance strengths cause color artifacts and texture degradation, requiring reduced guidance (approximately 0.5 each) for stable results.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two ControlNet modules for FLUX.1-dev: Proportion ControlNet and Perspective ControlNet. Proportion ControlNet uses bounding boxes to guide object placement and scale, while Perspective ControlNet employs vanishing lines to control 3D geometry and viewpoint. Both modules were trained using automated data pipelines that process unannotated datasets (WikiArt for proportions, OpenImages for perspective). The Proportion ControlNet effectively places objects within bounding boxes but exhibits a stylistic bias toward "pictorial" styles. The Perspective ControlNet successfully handles 1- and 2-point perspectives but fails on 3-point perspectives due to data distribution limitations. When both ControlNets are applied simultaneously, high guidance strengths cause color artifacts and texture degradation, requiring reduced guidance (approximately 0.5 each) for stable results.

## Key Results
- Proportion ControlNet effectively places objects within bounding boxes but exhibits stylistic bias toward "pictorial" styles
- Perspective ControlNet successfully handles 1- and 2-point perspectives but fails on 3-point perspectives due to data distribution limitations
- Combined ControlNets require reduced guidance (approximately 0.5 each) to prevent color artifacts and texture degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ControlNet modules work by conditioning the FLUX.1-dev diffusion process on auxiliary spatial information. The Proportion ControlNet injects bounding box coordinates at multiple layers, constraining the spatial distribution of generated objects. The Perspective ControlNet uses vanishing line information to guide the 3D geometry and viewpoint by conditioning on geometric constraints. Both approaches leverage the denoising process to progressively refine images while respecting the imposed spatial constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- ControlNet architecture: A neural network module that conditions diffusion models on auxiliary inputs; needed for understanding how external constraints are integrated into generation
- FLUX.1-dev diffusion model: A flow-based image generation model; needed as the base model being controlled
- Vanishing points and perspective geometry: Fundamental concepts for 3D spatial understanding; needed to interpret the Perspective ControlNet's geometric constraints
- Bounding box parameterization: How spatial regions are encoded; needed to understand how the Proportion ControlNet defines object placement areas

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: FLUX.1-dev base model -> ControlNet encoder (proportion/pespective) -> Cross-attention fusion -> Denoising blocks

Critical path: Input noise → Cross-attention with ControlNet features → Denoising blocks → Output image

Design tradeoffs: The ControlNet approach adds computational overhead but provides precise spatial control. The choice of conditioning layers affects both control strength and computational cost.

Failure signatures: Proportion ControlNet shows stylistic bias toward pictorial art. Perspective ControlNet fails on 3-point perspectives. Combined ControlNets produce color artifacts and texture degradation at high guidance strengths.

First experiments: 1) Test object placement accuracy with various bounding box sizes, 2) Evaluate perspective accuracy across 1-, 2-, and 3-point perspectives, 3) Measure artifact severity when combining both ControlNets at different guidance strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions beyond the identified limitations regarding 3-point perspective handling and combined ControlNet stability.

## Limitations
- Proportion ControlNet exhibits stylistic bias toward "pictorial" art styles that may limit applicability across diverse artistic domains
- Perspective ControlNet fails on 3-point perspectives due to data distribution limitations, indicating incomplete coverage of real-world perspective scenarios
- Combined ControlNets require reduced guidance (approximately 0.5 each) to prevent artifacts, which reduces control precision

## Confidence
- Object placement accuracy within bounding boxes: High
- Perspective handling for 1- and 2-point perspectives: Medium
- Combined ControlNet stability at reduced guidance: Medium
- Generalization beyond "pictorial" art styles: Low
- 3-point perspective capability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test Proportion ControlNet on diverse artistic datasets beyond WikiArt to quantify stylistic bias across different art movements and genres
2. Evaluate Perspective ControlNet on curated 3-point perspective images to identify specific failure modes and assess whether architectural modifications could address these limitations
3. Conduct
