# Before the Clinic: Transparent and Operable Design Principles for Healthcare AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01902
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01902
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes Transparent and Operable Design principles to operationalize pre-clinical AI development requirements for healthcare applications

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap between explainable AI (XAI) theory, clinician needs, and governance requirements in healthcare AI by proposing two foundational design principles. The authors argue that current AI development approaches lack practical guidance for the pre-clinical phase, where validation artifacts must be created before clinical evaluation can begin. Their framework bridges this gap by mapping technical requirements to established XAI frameworks, clinician needs, and EU governance requirements, providing actionable guidance for development teams.

The Transparent and Operable Design principles aim to accelerate clinical evaluation, reduce translation friction, and establish shared vocabulary between technical and clinical stakeholders. The framework explicitly scopes pre-clinical requirements while acknowledging that clinical evaluation remains essential for validating usability, usefulness, and clinical impact. The authors emphasize that their approach is intentionally flexible to accommodate diverse implementation contexts while providing concrete validation methods.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework consisting of two design principles: Transparent Design and Operable Design. Transparent Design encompasses interpretability (case-level explanations like feature attribution, modality attribution, and temporal explanations) and understandability (system traceability like transparent fusion mechanisms and architecture documentation). Operable Design addresses calibration (aligning predictions with observed frequencies), uncertainty (communicating prediction uncertainty, including aleatoric and epistemic types), and robustness (predictable behavior under missing data, subgroup performance disparities, and temporal/geographic shifts).

The framework operationalizes pre-clinical technical requirements by mapping them to established XAI frameworks (Combi et al. [10]), clinician needs (Tonekaboni et al. [49]), and EU governance requirements (EU White Paper [16]). The authors provide actionable guidance for development teams to generate validation artifacts and perform sanity checks during the pre-clinical phase. The framework emphasizes the importance of creating interpretable and understandable AI systems while ensuring they are calibrated, communicate uncertainty appropriately, and behave predictably under various conditions.

## Key Results
- Identifies critical gap between XAI theory, clinician needs, and governance requirements in healthcare AI with little practical pre-clinical guidance
- Proposes two foundational design principles: Transparent Design (interpretability and understandability) and Operable Design (calibration, uncertainty, and robustness)
- Provides actionable framework that maps technical requirements to established XAI frameworks, clinician needs, and EU governance requirements
- Offers concrete validation methods including faithfulness tests, stability checks, calibration metrics, and robustness assessments
- Establishes shared vocabulary between technical and clinical stakeholders to accelerate clinical evaluation and reduce translation friction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by operationalizing abstract XAI concepts into concrete, testable requirements that development teams can implement during the pre-clinical phase. By distinguishing between interpretability (case-level explanations) and understandability (system traceability), the authors address both the "what" and "how" of AI decision-making. The Operable Design principle ensures that AI systems not only make predictions but also communicate their reliability and behave predictably under various clinical conditions, which is essential for clinical trust and safety.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transparent Design**: Combines interpretability (case-level explanations) and understandability (system traceability); needed to bridge the gap between technical implementation and clinical comprehension; quick check: Can clinicians trace how input features influence predictions through the model?
- **Operable Design**: Encompasses calibration, uncertainty communication, and robustness; needed to ensure AI systems behave predictably and reliably in clinical settings; quick check: Does the system maintain performance when faced with missing data or subgroup variations?
- **Pre-clinical Validation**: Focuses on technical artifacts and sanity checks before clinical evaluation; needed to establish baseline reliability and interpretability; quick check: Are feature attributions stable across similar patients and do they align with clinical expectations?
- **Faithfulness Metrics**: Measures how well explanations reflect the model's actual decision process; needed to validate that post-hoc explanations accurately represent model behavior; quick check: Do feature deletion tests show significant prediction probability drops for important features?
- **Calibration Requirements**: Ensures predicted probabilities align with observed frequencies; needed for clinical decision-making where probability estimates inform treatment choices; quick check: Does the Expected Calibration Error remain below clinically acceptable thresholds across all subgroups?
- **Uncertainty Types**: Distinguishes between aleatoric (data noise) and epistemic (model uncertainty); needed to provide complete picture of prediction reliability; quick check: Can the system differentiate between uncertain predictions due to missing data versus inherent data variability?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Data Input -> Model Training -> Transparent Design Artifacts (Interpretability, Understandability) -> Operable Design Validation (Calibration, Uncertainty, Robustness) -> Pre-clinical Sanity Checks -> Clinical Evaluation

**Critical Path:** The essential sequence is data preprocessing → model training → generation of transparent design artifacts → operability validation → clinical readiness assessment

**Design Tradeoffs:** Balance between model complexity (for performance) and interpretability (for clinical trust); between comprehensive uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency; between subgroup-specific calibration and overall system simplicity

**Failure Signatures:** Unstable explanations across similar patients; poor calibration on specific demographic subgroups; performance degradation under missing data patterns; temporal drift in model performance

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Train baseline model on clinical dataset and generate feature attributions using SHAP, validate faithfulness through deletion tests
2. Apply temperature scaling to calibrate predictions and measure Expected Calibration Error across demographic subgroups
3. Stress-test robustness by introducing MCAR/MNAR missing data patterns and measuring performance relative to calibrated baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** Do development teams utilizing Transparent and Operable Design principles achieve faster clinical translation or higher adoption rates compared to standard development practices? The paper explicitly states that empirical validation through longitudinal studies tracking multiple AI development projects would strengthen understanding of how these principles affect clinical translation outcomes and adoption patterns.

**Open Question 2:** How should development teams prioritize specific artifacts (e.g., feature attribution vs. modality attribution) when resources are constrained? The authors note that prioritization guidance for smaller teams or resource-constrained settings could enhance practical applicability, as they intentionally avoid rigid prescriptiveness to maintain flexibility across diverse implementations.

**Open Question 3:** To what extent do technical validation metrics (faithfulness and stability) in Transparent Design correlate with clinician-rated usability and usefulness? While the framework defines pre-clinical validation techniques, the authors acknowledge these technical metrics do not guarantee the system will be usable or useful to humans, requiring correlation analysis with qualitative human-centered design study results.

## Limitations
- The framework lacks quantitative thresholds for when a system is "transparent enough" or "operable enough" for clinical evaluation
- Assumes access to high-quality, representative data for pre-clinical validation which may not reflect real-world clinical data constraints
- Does not fully address emerging AI paradigms like large language models and generative AI which are increasingly relevant to healthcare
- Emphasis on interpretability may not capture the complexity of clinical decision-making where utility and clinical impact ultimately matter most

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The framework correctly identifies the gap between XAI research and clinical implementation needs, and the distinction between interpretability and understandability is well-founded
- **Medium confidence**: The specific technical requirements for Operable Design (calibration, uncertainty, robustness) are appropriately mapped to established metrics and methods
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed framework will reduce friction in clinical translation, though this remains largely theoretical without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation Study**: Conduct a controlled study applying the Transparent and Operable Design principles to a real clinical AI system (e.g., sepsis prediction in MIMIC-IV) and measure whether this pre-clinical validation reduces time to clinical deployment compared to standard practices

2. **Clinician Usability Assessment**: Evaluate whether the artifacts produced through these design principles (feature attributions, calibration curves, uncertainty estimates) actually improve clinician trust and understanding when reviewing AI-assisted decisions, using both quantitative metrics and qualitative interviews

3. **Threshold Definition Exercise**: Establish evidence-based thresholds for key metrics (e.g., ECE < 0.05, stability correlation > 0.7) through expert consensus or empirical studies of successful clinical AI systems, converting the framework from conceptual guidance to actionable standards
