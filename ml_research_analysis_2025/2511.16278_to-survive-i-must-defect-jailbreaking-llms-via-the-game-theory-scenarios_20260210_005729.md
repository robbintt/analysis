# "To Survive, I Must Defect": Jailbreaking LLMs via the Game-Theory Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16278
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GTA achieves over 95% ASR on GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1, outperforming 12 baselines with fewer queries per success.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GTA, a game-theoretic jailbreak attack framework that models black-box jailbreaking as a sequential stochastic game. The core innovation is the "template-over-safety flip" conjecture: game-theoretic scenarios can override safety preferences, making risky responses more likely. Using a disclosure-variant Prisoner's Dilemma and an LLM-based attacker agent, GTA achieves over 95% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 while using fewer queries than baseline methods. The framework generalizes to other game-theoretic scenarios, scales via LLM-generated templates, and maintains high ASR with optional prompt-guard evasion techniques.

## Method Summary
GTA formalizes jailbreak as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game with two players: an Attacker Agent and a Target LLM. The core attack template is a Mechanism-Induced Graded Prisoner's Dilemma where disclosure intensity maps to jailbreak severity. The Attacker Agent uses game-theoretic strategies (Extreme Punishment, Tit-for-Tat, Evidence Fabrication, False Confession Trap, Ultimatum, Plea Bargaining, Protection Assurance) to adaptively escalate pressure. An optional Harmful-Words Detection Agent evades prompt-guard models by inserting zero-width characters. The system uses quantal response modeling to approximate the target's behavior and employs LLM-based judges for evaluation using ASR1/2/3 protocols.

## Key Results
- GTA achieves over 95% ASR on GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1, outperforming 12 baseline methods
- Uses significantly fewer queries per success (EQS) compared to baselines, demonstrating efficiency
- Successfully generalizes to other game-theoretic scenarios beyond Prisoner's Dilemma
- Maintains high ASR across different target models including Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0, and various HuggingFace LLMs
- Optional prompt-guard evasion techniques maintain effectiveness while bypassing detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Game-theoretic scenario templates can cause an LLM to flip its behavioral preference from safety-first to template-aligned objectives under certain conditions.
- Mechanism: By embedding harmful queries within a structured game (e.g., a disclosure-variant Prisoner's Dilemma), a new payoff term $T_g(s,x,y)$ weighted by $\lambda_g$ is added to the model's effective objective. If the template-aligned utility gain from a risky response exceeds the safety utility loss ($\lambda_g \Delta_{templ} > \Delta_{safe}$), the model's response distribution shifts toward the riskier, jailbreaking behavior.
- Core assumption: An LLM's black-box response kernel can be approximated as a quantal response (softmax over an effective utility), and its effective utility is malleable via prompt context shaping.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modeling the jailbreak interaction as a finite-horizon sequential stochastic game enables systematic, adaptive, and early-stoppable attack strategies.
- Mechanism: The interaction is formalized as a game $\mathcal{G}$ with players (Attacker A, Target LLM B), states (dialogue history), actions (queries, responses), and a stochastic transition kernel. Early stopping (absorbing states) allows efficient termination upon success or failure.
- Core assumption: The black-box LLM's behavior can be treated as a fixed stochastic policy $\sigma_B$ within a game-theoretic framework, and the interaction is Markovian with respect to the defined state.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: An LLM-based Attacker Agent, guided by game-theoretic strategy priors, can adaptively increase jailbreak success rates by escalating pressure based on interaction feedback.
- Mechanism: The Attacker Agent (using a separate LLM) observes the target's responses and selects subsequent strategies from a library (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, False Confession Trap). This amplifies the template's effect on the target's objective $T_g$, steering it toward higher disclosure.
- Core assumption: The attacker agent's core LLM can effectively reason about game-theoretic strategies and map them to natural language prompts that influence the target LLM.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequential Stochastic Games
  - Why needed here: This is the core mathematical framework used to model the multi-turn, state-dependent interaction between the attacker and the target LLM.
  - Quick check question: How does the "early stopping" condition in this game formulation differ from a standard fixed-horizon game, and why is it practical for jailbreaking?

- Concept: Quantal Response / Multinomial Logit Model
  - Why needed here: It provides the theoretical lens for interpreting the LLM's probabilistic outputs as rational (but noisy) choices over an implicit utility function, which is key to the "template-over-safety flip" conjecture.
  - Quick check question: In the quantal response model (Equation 3), what does a higher inverse temperature ($\beta$) imply about the LLM's choice behavior?

- Concept: Game-Theoretic Solution Concepts (Nash Equilibrium, Dominant Strategies)
  - Why needed here: The design of scenario templates (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma) relies on creating incentive structures with predictable equilibria (e.g., mutual defection/disclosure) that the attacker can exploit.
  - Quick check question: In the disclosure-variant PD (Equation 10), why is (D, D) – mutual disclosure – the unique pure Nash equilibrium, and how does this help the attacker?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Template Generator -> Interaction Engine -> Attacker Agent -> Optional Harmful-Words Detection Agent -> Evaluation/Judge
- Critical path: Template design -> Template application (query embedding) -> Multi-turn interaction (Attacker Agent adapts) -> Response scoring -> Early stop or continue -> Post-hoc evasion (optional)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Template complexity vs. scalability: Hand-crafted templates are effective but manual; LLM-generated variants improve scalability but may have slightly lower ASR
  - Agent capability vs. cost: Using a stronger model as the Attacker Agent increases ASR and efficiency but raises API costs
  - Attack stealth vs. success rate: Using the Harmful-Words Detection Agent adds complexity but is necessary for real-world deployments
- Failure signatures:
  - Explicit refusal: Target model triggers safety alignment (e.g., "I will not...")
  - Low detail / task drift: Model does not refuse but provides vague or off-topic responses
  - Detection by prompt-guard: Input is flagged and blocked before reaching the target model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline component ablation: Test GTA with (a) role-play only, (b) role-play + Graded PD template, (c) full system with Attacker Agent
  2. Template scalability test: Compare original Graded PD template vs. 5 LLM-generated variants using embedding similarity
  3. Cross-model agent evaluation: Run GTA using different core models for the Attacker Agent and compare ASR and EQS

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the "template-over-safety flip" behavioral conjecture be formally proven using model-internal analyses or interpretability methods?
- Basis in paper: The authors state a formal proof based on model internals or interpretability methods remains open for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current work validates the conjecture empirically through ASR experiments but does not investigate whether LLMs' internal representations actually exhibit the theorized utility trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mechanistic interpretability studies showing that game-theoretic templates systematically alter activation patterns associated with safety refusal circuits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do specific safety-alignment defense mechanisms perform against GTA?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates only intrinsic model alignment and prompt-guard detection, not defenses that modify model behavior or outputs.
- Why unresolved: A rigorous comparison of different defense configurations is left for future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks comparing GTA's ASR against models with various defense configurations like adversarial safety training or response filtering.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can GTA be effectively combined with other jailbreak paradigms to achieve even higher success rates?
- Basis in paper: GTA is an extensible framework that could be combined with encryption/encoding-based techniques or role-play templates, but these combinations are not analyzed.
- Why unresolved: The modular design suggests composability, but potential interference between game-theoretic shaping and obfuscation techniques remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies measuring ASR when GTA is combined with methods like CipherChat or DeepInception compared to each method alone.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What explains the systematic differences in compatibility between Attacker Agent core models and target LLMs?
- Basis in paper: Different core models exhibit varying compatibility with target models, leading to different attack success rates, but a systematic exploration of such pairings is left for future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows EQS varies from 2.06 to 4.84 depending on the attacker core model, but underlying factors are not analyzed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic grid evaluation across multiple attacker-target pairs coupled with analysis of shared training data or alignment protocol similarities.

## Limitations
- The "template-over-safety flip" mechanism relies on unverified assumptions about LLM internal representations and quantal response modeling
- Attacker Agent effectiveness decreases significantly with open-source alternatives, creating uncertainty about scalability to truly black-box scenarios
- Real-world applicability is limited by focus on single-turn interactions and controlled scenarios rather than multi-turn conversational contexts

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The sequential stochastic game formulation is mathematically sound; ASR results on GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 are reproducible; efficiency gains compared to baselines are demonstrable
- **Medium Confidence**: The "template-over-safety flip" mechanism is theoretically plausible but requires further empirical validation; generalization to other scenarios works but with variable effectiveness; evasion techniques are effective but may not be universally applicable
- **Low Confidence**: The exact threshold of attacker agent capability needed for consistent success across all target models; long-term robustness against adaptive defense mechanisms; generalizability to safety domains beyond tested illegal/immoral activities

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Safety Testing**: Evaluate GTA's effectiveness on safety domains not covered in the original AdvBench subset, such as political misinformation, medical misinformation, and privacy violations.

2. **Attacker Agent Capability Threshold**: Systematically test the GTA framework with attacker agents of decreasing capability (Mistral-7B, Llama-3B, Qwen2.5-7B) to identify the minimum threshold for effective jailbreaking.

3. **Adaptive Defense Evaluation**: Implement a simple adaptive defense mechanism where the target LLM maintains conversation context and applies escalating scrutiny to suspicious patterns. Test whether GTA can still achieve high ASR against this defense.
