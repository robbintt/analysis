# Semantic-Aware Cooperative Communication and Computation Framework in Vehicular Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09621
- Reference count: 31
- Core method: MAPPO-PDN+LP achieves 20-30% lower task delay than baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses task offloading optimization in vehicular networks by proposing a Tripartite Cooperative Semantic Communication (TCSC) framework that integrates Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. The framework uses a novel MAPPO-PDN algorithm combined with Linear Programming to jointly optimize semantic symbol counts and offloading ratios, minimizing task latency while ensuring semantic similarity. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods across varying vehicle densities.

## Method Summary
The method decomposes a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem into two tractable subproblems: MAPPO-PDN for discrete semantic symbol optimization and LP for continuous offloading ratio optimization. MAPPO-PDN models policy parameters as Gaussian distributions with parametric distribution noise to improve convergence in non-stationary vehicular environments. The LP module analytically solves for optimal task partitioning between local execution, RSU offloading, and SV assistance by assuming tight constraint satisfaction at optimality.

## Key Results
- MAPPO-PDN+LP achieves 20-30% lower average task delay compared to MADQN, standard MAPPO, and random baselines
- Convergence performance shows MAPPO-PDN stabilizes faster with higher rewards than traditional MARL algorithms
- The framework maintains semantic similarity above 0.9 threshold while reducing transmission delay through semantic compression
- Performance gains scale with vehicle density, demonstrating robustness across different network loads

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decomposing the MINLP problem into discrete symbol optimization (MAPPO-PDN) and continuous offloading ratio optimization (LP) reduces solution complexity while maintaining joint optimization benefits. The original problem couples discrete semantic symbol counts $k_{i,j} \in \{1, \ldots, k_{max}\}$ with continuous offloading ratios $\rho \in [0,1]$. By fixing one variable class while optimizing the other, the problem becomes tractable: MAPPO-PDN handles the combinatorial action space of symbol selection, while LP exploits the linear structure of delay constraints to solve for $\rho$ analytically via tight constraint satisfaction.

### Mechanism 2
Parametric Distribution Noise (PDN) regularization improves MAPPO convergence and generalization in non-stationary multi-agent vehicular environments by explicitly modeling policy parameter uncertainty. Instead of point estimates for policy parameters $\theta_k$, MAPPO-PDN models them as Gaussian distributions $q(\theta_k) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma_k^2)$. Agents sample $\theta_k^{(n)} = \mu_k + \sigma_k \xi_k^{(n)}$ independently, enabling diverse exploration. The PDN upper bound constraint $\Omega_k = |\mu_k|/\sigma_k \leq \Omega_{max}$ prevents excessive uncertainty while maintaining exploration diversity, reducing overfitting to transient channel conditions.

### Mechanism 3
Tripartite cooperation (local, RSU via V2I, SV via V2V) with semantic compression reduces transmission delay by exploiting proximity for V2V and capacity for V2I, while semantic encoding reduces data volume. Tasks are partitioned across three execution venues. Semantic communication reduces raw bits $y_i$ to semantic symbols $k_{i,j} \cdot L_{i,j}$ sentences, lowering transmission burden. V2V links to nearby SVs offer lower path loss ($d_{i,j}^{-2}$) but limited computing; V2I links to RSU offer higher computing capacity but longer distances. The framework selects $k$ to maintain semantic similarity $\delta_{i,j} \geq \delta_{th}$ while minimizing the max-delay bottleneck across parallel execution paths.

## Foundational Learning

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: MAPPO-PDN builds directly on PPO's clipped objective. Understanding the importance sampling ratio $\rho_t$, clipping mechanism, and advantage estimation $\hat{A}_t$ is prerequisite to grasping how PDN modifies the loss. *Quick check*: Explain why PPO clips the importance sampling ratio and how this affects policy update magnitude.

- **Semantic Communication (task-oriented)**: The framework uses DeepSC for encoding text into semantic symbols with variable $k$ affecting similarity $\delta$. Understanding the distinction between bit-rate and semantic rate (suts/s) is essential. *Quick check*: How does semantic rate $R_{i,j} = BS_{i,j} / (L_{i,j} k_{i,j} / \delta_{i,j})$ differ from traditional Shannon capacity, and what does $k_{i,j}$ represent?

- **Linear Programming with Tight Constraints**: Section III-B derives optimal $\rho$ values by assuming constraints are tight (active) at optimality. This is a standard LP technique but critical for understanding why $\rho$ has closed-form solutions. *Quick check*: Why can we assume $\rho_i^{local} A_L = D_i^{max*}$ at optimality, and what condition must hold for this to be valid?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VUs (task generators) -> MAPPO-PDN (selects $k_{i,j}$) -> DeepSC (semantic encoding) -> LP module (computes $\rho$) -> Execution layer (parallel local/RSU/SV processing)

- **Critical path**:
  1. At slot $t$, observe state $s_t = \{\gamma_{i,j}, \hat{d}_{i,j}, y_i, F_\gamma\}$ for each VU
  2. MAPPO-PDN Actor samples action $a_t = k_{i,j}$ from policy with parameter noise
  3. Lookup semantic similarity $\delta_{i,j}$ from pre-trained table given $(k_{i,j}, \gamma_{i,j})$
  4. LP module computes $\rho^{local*}, \rho^{RSU*}, \rho^{SV*}$ using Eq. 16-19
  5. Execute task partition, measure delay, compute reward $r_t = T_{min}/T_i$
  6. Update Actor-Critic via loss $L = L_\pi + c_v L_V + \beta_t L_H + \omega L_{SNR}$

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **$\Omega_{max}$ (PDN bound)**: Higher values increase exploration but risk instability; paper uses $\Omega_{max} = 20$ for complex vehicular environment
  - **SV capacity threshold $M$**: Limits concurrent VUs per SV; too low wastes SV capacity, too high degrades per-VU compute performance
  - **Semantic similarity threshold $\delta_{th}$**: Higher threshold requires more symbols $k$, increasing transmission delay but improving task accuracy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Constraint infeasibility**: If computed $D_i^{max*}$ from Eq. 19 exceeds actual $D_i^{max}$, LP solution violates delay constraints—check if $1/A_L + 1/A_R + 1/A_S$ yields feasible values
  - **SV selection thrashing**: If vehicles frequently switch between primary and secondary SVs, $M$ threshold may be misconfigured relative to vehicle density
  - **Semantic similarity collapse**: If $\delta_{i,j}$ drops below $\delta_{th} = 0.9$, the action $k$ selected by MAPPO-PDN is infeasible—verify lookup table covers the SINR-action space adequately

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sanity check—semantic symbol selection**: Fix $\rho^{local} = \rho^{RSU} = \rho^{SV} = 1/3$, run MAPPO-PDN only. Verify selected $k_{i,j}$ decreases as SINR increases (high SINR needs fewer symbols for same $\delta$), matching Figure 2's convergence to higher rewards.
  2. **LP validation**: Given fixed $k_{i,j}$ values and channel conditions, manually compute $\rho$ using Eq. 16-19 and verify $\sum \rho = 1$ and all delay constraints are tight. Compare against simulation-reported $\rho$ values.
  3. **Ablation—PDN impact**: Train MAPPO (no PDN) vs MAPPO-PDN on the same scenario. Plot reward curves over episodes; expect MAPPO-PDN to show more stable convergence per Figure 2. Then test both on held-out vehicle density (e.g., 30 VUs instead of training 20) to assess generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Extending to multimodal semantic communication**: The paper explicitly states future work will explore multimodal semantic communication in IoV scenarios. The current implementation relies specifically on DeepSC for text, utilizing a pre-trained mapping between semantic symbols and SINR designed for text data, which does not directly translate to the bandwidth and semantic requirements of video or audio. *What evidence would resolve it*: A study or simulation extending the MAPPO-PDN+LP algorithm to optimize symbol counts for multimodal data streams while maintaining latency and similarity thresholds.

- **Performance under high-dynamic channels**: The simulation setup assumes vehicle speeds are "initialized by uniform sampling... and assumed constant thereafter," and the channel is "quasi-static." Real-world highway scenarios involve significant speed variance and rapid channel fluctuations; the current "quasi-static" assumption may not validate the algorithm's robustness against the fast-fading characteristics inherent in high-speed IoV environments. *What evidence would resolve it*: Simulation results demonstrating the convergence and delay performance of MAPPO-PDN under time-varying vehicle velocities (e.g., acceleration/deceleration profiles) and non-static channel models.

- **Impact of downlink transmission delay**: Section II-C explicitly states "Since the result size is negligible, downlink transmission delay is ignored." While semantic encoding reduces uplink load, complex inference results (e.g., HD maps or detailed object detection logs) in V2X may not be negligible. Ignoring this delay creates an optimistic bound on the "total delay" objective. *What evidence would resolve it*: A comparative analysis of the total system delay when incorporating a variable downlink transmission model versus the current uplink-only model.

## Limitations

- **Model specification gaps**: The neural network architecture (layer dimensions, activation functions) for both Actor and Critic networks is not specified, making exact reproduction impossible without assumptions.
- **Hyperparameter ambiguity**: Key MAPPO-PDN training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, clip threshold, entropy coefficient, batch size) are not provided, which significantly impacts performance reproducibility.
- **Semantic model access**: The paper references a pre-trained DeepSC model for semantic similarity lookup but does not provide access details or specify the k_max range used in experiments.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core optimization decomposition strategy (MAPPO-PDN for k + LP for ρ) is clearly articulated and logically sound. The theoretical framework for constraint tightening in the LP solution is well-established.
- **Medium confidence**: The PDN mechanism's effectiveness is supported by Figure 2 showing improved convergence, but the specific Ω_max=20 value appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis. The semantic similarity lookup table construction is described but not validated.
- **Low confidence**: Without access to the DeepSC model or complete hyperparameters, reproducing the exact performance metrics (delay reduction percentages) is not feasible. The paper's ablation studies on PDN impact would be difficult to replicate.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture validation**: Implement the MAPPO-PDN framework with reasonable default network architectures (e.g., 2 hidden layers of 128 units each). Test on a simplified scenario with fixed SINR conditions to verify the semantic similarity constraint enforcement mechanism works as intended.

2. **LP feasibility verification**: For a given set of k values and channel conditions, manually compute the A_L, A_R, A_S terms and verify the LP solution produces feasible offloading ratios that satisfy all constraints, checking for potential infeasibility scenarios.

3. **PDN ablation study**: Train two versions of the framework—one with PDN regularization (Ω_max=20) and one without—on identical scenarios. Measure and compare reward convergence curves and final performance metrics to quantify the PDN contribution to stability and performance.
