# Origin-Conditional Trajectory Encoding: Measuring Urban Configurational Asymmetries through Neural Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03755
- Reference count: 18
- This paper introduces a conditional trajectory encoding framework that decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives through contrastive learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the methodological fragmentation in urban analytics by introducing a conditional trajectory encoding framework that jointly learns spatial and temporal representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries. The core method uses a bidirectional LSTM to process visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives through contrastive learning. The framework demonstrates that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities, with grid cities showing 62% variation in origin divergence across height distributions (1.32-2.14) while radial cities maintain more consistent asymmetry levels (1.85-2.41, 30% variation). Real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District reveals complex mixed-morphology characteristics with locally clustered asymmetries and high-contrast boundaries. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity and offers origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.

## Method Summary
The framework employs bidirectional LSTM networks to process visibility ratio and curvature features extracted from urban street networks, conditioned on learnable origin embeddings that capture starting location characteristics. The neural decomposition approach separates shared cognitive patterns from origin-specific spatial narratives using contrastive learning, allowing the model to identify systematic asymmetries in how different origin points experience urban navigation. The method processes trajectory data through multiple stages: feature extraction from urban morphology, conditional encoding based on origin characteristics, and contrastive representation learning that preserves configurational asymmetries while identifying common navigation patterns across different urban forms.

## Key Results
- Grid cities exhibit 62% variation in origin divergence across height distributions (1.32-2.14), while radial cities maintain more consistent asymmetry levels (1.85-2.41, 30% variation)
- Urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities that can be quantified through neural decomposition
- Beijing's Xicheng District validation reveals complex mixed-morphology characteristics with locally clustered asymmetries and high-contrast boundaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by conditioning trajectory encoding on origin-specific embeddings, which allows the model to capture how different starting locations experience urban navigation differently. The bidirectional LSTM processes both forward and backward trajectory information, while contrastive learning separates shared cognitive patterns from origin-dependent spatial narratives. This dual approach enables the decomposition of urban navigation into universal cognitive principles and location-specific configurational effects, revealing how urban form creates systematic asymmetries in navigation experience.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bidirectional LSTM processing**: Captures temporal dependencies in trajectory data from both forward and backward directions, essential for understanding complete navigation patterns
- **Contrastive learning framework**: Enables separation of shared cognitive patterns from origin-specific narratives by learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar navigation experiences
- **Visibility ratio and curvature features**: Quantify the configurational properties of urban spaces that influence navigation decisions and cognitive load
- **Origin-conditioned embeddings**: Learn location-specific characteristics that modify how trajectories are processed and interpreted
- **Neural decomposition**: Separates universal cognitive patterns from context-specific spatial narratives, revealing systematic asymmetries in urban navigation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Urban Morphology -> Feature Extraction -> Origin-Embedding Conditioning -> Bidirectional LSTM Processing -> Contrastive Learning -> Asymmetry Decomposition

**Critical Path**: Feature extraction and origin conditioning feed into bidirectional LSTM, which then passes representations to contrastive learning for decomposition into shared patterns and origin-specific narratives

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model balances computational complexity against representation accuracy, using bidirectional processing for comprehensive trajectory understanding while maintaining efficient contrastive learning for pattern separation

**Failure Signatures**: Poor feature extraction leads to inadequate representation of configurational properties, while insufficient contrast learning fails to properly separate shared from origin-specific patterns

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test feature extraction accuracy on synthetic urban morphologies with known configurational properties
2. Validate origin-embedding conditioning by comparing trajectory representations across different starting locations
3. Assess contrastive learning effectiveness by measuring separation quality between shared and origin-specific patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity may constrain scalability to larger urban areas or real-time applications
- Reliance on specific feature sets (visibility ratios, curvature metrics) may not capture all cognitive dimensions across different cultural contexts
- Quantitative comparisons represent only two morphological archetypes (grid and radial) and may not capture hybrid urban forms
- Beijing validation case study provides single geographic instance, limiting broader applicability claims
- Contrast learning effectiveness depends heavily on quality and representativeness of training trajectories

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation of conditional trajectory encoding and neural decomposition framework
- Medium confidence in urban morphology-asymmetry relationship patterns, pending broader geographic validation
- Medium confidence in practical implications for urban planning, requiring field validation of cognitive predictions

## Next Checks
1. Test framework across multiple cities with varying morphological characteristics (medieval European, organic Asian, planned American grid systems)
2. Conduct user studies comparing predicted asymmetry patterns with actual navigation experiences and cognitive load measurements
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and accuracy trade-offs when scaling to metropolitan-level analyses with millions of potential origin-destination pairs
