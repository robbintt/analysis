# A Comprehensive Survey of Electronic Health Record Modeling: From Deep Learning Approaches to Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.12774
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12774
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive taxonomy of deep learning and LLM approaches for EHR modeling addressing heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specificity

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of deep learning and large language model approaches for electronic health record modeling. It addresses the unique challenges posed by EHR data, including heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specificity, which differ fundamentally from tasks in vision and natural language processing. The survey introduces a unified taxonomy spanning five key dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. It reviews representative methods for improving data quality, capturing temporal and structural dependencies, self-supervised learning, and integrating clinical knowledge. Emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation are highlighted. The survey also discusses open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews EHR modeling approaches through a five-dimensional taxonomy: data-centric strategies (data quality improvement, feature engineering), neural architecture design (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GNNs, tree-based models), learning objectives (supervised, self-supervised, multi-task), multimodal integration (vision, text, EHR), and LLM-based systems (EHR-to-text translation, retrieval-augmented generation). It analyzes representative methods across these dimensions, focusing on mechanisms that handle EHR-specific challenges like irregular temporal sampling and hierarchical code structures. The survey synthesizes findings from 40+ references to establish a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

## Key Results
- **Unified Taxonomy:** Establishes a comprehensive five-dimensional framework organizing EHR modeling approaches from data preprocessing to LLM-based clinical agents
- **Temporal Mechanisms:** Identifies explicit and implicit time-aware approaches (GRU-D, continuous-time Transformers) as critical for handling irregular EHR sampling patterns
- **LLM Integration:** Demonstrates how EHR-to-text serialization and retrieval-augmented generation enable LLMs to perform clinical reasoning while mitigating hallucination risks
- **Clinical Knowledge Integration:** Shows how structure-aware architectures (tree-based, graph-based) incorporate medical ontologies to reduce data sparsity and improve interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structure-Aware Inductive Bias
- **Claim:** If a model aligns its architecture with the inherent topology of medical data (hierarchies, graphs, or irregular time), it mitigates the sparsity and semantic ambiguity of raw EHR codes
- **Mechanism:** "Structure-aware architecture design" works by injecting domain knowledge directly into the model's connectivity patterns. Tree-based models exploit ICD code hierarchies to share statistical strength between rare and common conditions, while Graph-based models treat visits or medical codes as nodes, allowing reasoning over co-occurrence relationships rather than treating codes as independent inputs
- **Core assumption:** Medical knowledge is structured (ontologies, temporal sequences), and this structure is predictive of outcomes
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature" as unique challenges requiring specific architectures; Section 4.2 discusses tree-based modeling offering "powerful inductive bias to incorporate clinical knowledge, reduce data sparsity"
- **Break condition:** Likely fails if EHR data is extremely sparse or ontology mappings (e.g., ICD hierarchy) are noisy or irrelevant to the specific clinical outcome being predicted

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Dynamics via Explicit Time-Modeling
- **Claim:** Standard sequence models fail on EHR data because they assume regular intervals; mechanisms that explicitly model time irregularity (decay, interpolation, or continuous-time attention) restore predictive fidelity
- **Mechanism:** EHRs are "irregularly sampled." Two approaches: Implicit (GRU-D uses time decay in hidden states) and Explicit (interpolating missing values or using continuous-time Transformers). These mechanisms work by preventing the model from confusing "no observation" with "normal value" and by weighting recent observations more heavily based on actual elapsed time
- **Core assumption:** The time gap between observations carries diagnostic information, and missingness is informative, not random
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract highlights "temporal irregularity" as a fundamental challenge; Section 4.3.1 states "Irregular sampling is a core challenge... GRU-D augments recurrent units with decay terms"
- **Break condition:** If missingness is completely random (MCAR) rather than informative (MNAR), or if temporal resolution is too coarse, these complex mechanisms may overfit to noise

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Driven Reasoning via EHR-to-Text Translation
- **Claim:** Large Language Models can perform complex clinical reasoning on structured EHR data if the tabular data is serialized into a text format and grounded with retrieval mechanisms
- **Mechanism:** "EHR-to-text translation" and "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" work by converting numerical/categorical codes into natural language descriptions, allowing the LLM to apply its pre-trained medical knowledge. RAG enhances this by retrieving "clinical guidelines" or "similar patient records" to reduce hallucinations and align with current medical standards
- **Core assumption:** The medical knowledge encoded in an LLM's pre-training is applicable to specific patient data, and serializing structured data preserves critical numerical relationships
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning"; Section 7.1 discusses "Zero/Few-Shot Prompting" where LLMs infer feature correlations
- **Break condition:** LLMs may hallucinate or fail at precise arithmetic (e.g., calculating exact clinical scores like CHA2DS2-VASc) even with serialization; "quantitative clinical calculations" remain a challenge

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Medical Code Hierarchies (Ontologies)**
- **Why needed here:** EHR models must handle high dimensionality (thousands of codes). Understanding that ICD-10 or CCS codes are organized in trees allows you to understand why Graph Neural Networks or hierarchical Transformers are used
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a generic MLP might struggle to predict a rare disease compared to a Graph-based model?

**Concept: Multimodal Alignment (Vision-Language)**
- **Why needed here:** The survey discusses integrating clinical notes (text) and medical imaging (vision). You need to understand that "Alignment" means mapping pixel patches and text tokens into a shared vector space where related concepts are close
- **Quick check question:** If a model sees a chest X-ray and generates a report, what loss function ensures the word "pneumonia" in the report aligns with the visual features of the lung opacity?

**Concept: Missingness Patterns (MNAR vs MCAR)**
- **Why needed here:** In EHR, data is often missing not at random (MNAR)—e.g., a lab test is only ordered if a doctor suspects a problem. Models must distinguish between "not measured" and "normal"
- **Quick check question:** In a standard LSTM, how is a missing lab value usually handled, and why is this problematic for EHR data?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Static Demographics -> Dynamic Time-Series (Labs/Vitals) -> Embeddings (Structured/Tree/Graph) -> Encoder (GNN/Transformer/Hybrid) -> Prediction Head (Classification/Regression)

**Critical path:** The transition from raw codes to embeddings. If you simply one-hot encode thousands of medical codes, the model will suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The critical step is using pre-trained embeddings (e.g., from ClinicalBERT or GraphCare) or learning them via end-to-end training

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:** Rule-based/Tree models are highly interpretable but may underfit compared to Deep Transformers
- **Regular vs. Irregular Time:** Using standard Transformers assumes regular sampling; switching to Time-Aware Transformers (e.g., ChronoFormer) adds complexity but handles real-world EHR timestamps better

**Failure signatures:**
- **Label Leakage:** Using future data (e.g., discharge summaries) to predict admission
- **Class Imbalance:** Predicting the majority class (e.g., "No Readmission") for all patients because the dataset is 99% negative
- **Hallucination:** LLM-based agents inventing symptoms not present in the record

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline Establishment:** Implement a simple LSTM or Transformer using MIMIC-III/IV data with basic mean-imputation for missing values to establish a baseline AUROC for a standard task (e.g., Mortality Prediction)
2. **Time-Aware Ablation:** Replace the LSTM with a time-aware variant (e.g., GRU-D or a Time-Aware Attention layer) to measure the performance gain from explicitly modeling time gaps
3. **Structure Injection:** Integrate a Knowledge Graph or hierarchical tree structure into the embedding layer to verify if domain knowledge improves performance on rare disease prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- **Lack of Comparative Benchmarks:** Survey provides taxonomy but lacks quantitative comparisons showing which architectural choices consistently outperform others across different clinical tasks
- **Standardization Gaps:** Absence of standardized benchmarking protocols across EHR datasets means reported performance metrics may not be directly comparable
- **Evaluation Framework Deficiency:** While mentioning challenges like explainability and clinical alignment, the survey does not provide concrete evaluation frameworks for these critical aspects

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Identification of core challenges (temporal irregularity, data heterogeneity, domain-specificity) is well-supported by both the survey and related literature; taxonomy organization appears systematic and comprehensive
- **Medium Confidence:** Proposed mechanisms (structure-aware architectures, temporal modeling, LLM-driven reasoning) are theoretically sound based on cited works, but their relative effectiveness across diverse clinical settings remains unclear without direct comparative studies
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about specific performance gains from particular architectural choices (e.g., "Graph-based models reduce data sparsity") lack the quantitative evidence needed to establish generalizable best practices

## Next Checks
1. **Comparative Benchmarking:** Implement 2-3 representative architectures (e.g., tree-based, graph-based, transformer) on the same EHR dataset (MIMIC-IV) using identical preprocessing and evaluation protocols to directly compare performance
2. **Temporal Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically evaluate the impact of different time-aware mechanisms (GRU-D vs. Time-Aware Attention vs. Neural ODE) on the same task to determine which approach is most robust to varying levels of data irregularity
3. **Clinical Alignment Study:** Develop a framework to measure the clinical validity of model predictions (e.g., consistency with clinical guidelines) and apply it to both traditional deep learning models and LLM-based approaches to quantify hallucination rates
