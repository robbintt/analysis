core_contribution: The paper introduces a new approach for generating CAD profiles
  using a sequence of ruler, compass, and protractor construction steps. Instead of
  directly mapping geometric prompts to final profiles, the method builds up the profile
  step by step using intermediate construction geometry, inspired by chain-of-thought
  reasoning in language models.

# Draw it like Euclid: Teaching transformer models to generate CAD profiles using ruler and compass construction steps

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09428
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Ruler-and-compass construction sequences enable CAD profile generation with higher geometric validity and parametric editing capability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for generating CAD profiles through ruler, compass, and protractor construction steps rather than direct geometric mapping. Inspired by chain-of-thought reasoning in language models, the method builds up profiles incrementally using intermediate construction geometry encoded in a domain-specific language. The construction sequences can be replayed with floating point precision, enabling parametric editing of generated shapes. The approach combines supervised learning on extracted construction sequences with reinforcement learning that penalizes self-intersecting geometry, resulting in significantly improved profile quality compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The method encodes geometric profiles as sequences of ruler-and-compass construction steps using a domain-specific language. Profiles are generated incrementally through intermediate construction geometry rather than direct mapping from prompts. Training involves supervised learning on extracted construction sequences from CAD profiles, followed by reinforcement learning with reward functions that penalize self-intersecting geometry. The parametric nature of construction sequences enables post-generation editing by adjusting driving parameters, providing practical advantages for design workflows.

## Key Results
- Construction sequence approach significantly improves generated profile quality with higher syntactic validity
- Reinforcement learning further enhances performance across multiple metrics including reduced self-intersections
- Generated profiles demonstrate better adherence to design requirements compared to baseline direct generation methods
- Construction sequences enable parametric editing capabilities not available with direct generation approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by breaking down complex geometric profile generation into simpler, sequential construction steps that mirror human design thinking. By encoding profiles as ruler-and-compass construction sequences, the model can build up geometry incrementally with guaranteed syntactic validity at each step. The intermediate construction geometry provides a natural way to capture geometric relationships and constraints, while the reinforcement learning component optimizes for functional properties like self-intersection avoidance. The parametric nature of construction steps enables flexible post-generation editing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ruler-and-compass constructions**: Geometric constructions using only straightedge and compass tools, providing a formal system for creating precise geometric relationships
  - Why needed: Enables systematic, verifiable geometric operations that guarantee syntactic validity
  - Quick check: Can all target profiles be represented through finite sequences of these operations?

- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Breaking down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at final answer
  - Why needed: Provides framework for decomposing profile generation into manageable construction steps
  - Quick check: Does intermediate step generation improve final output quality?

- **Domain-specific languages (DSL)**: Custom programming languages designed for specific problem domains
  - Why needed: Provides precise encoding for construction sequences that can be parsed and executed
  - Quick check: Is the DSL expressive enough to capture all required geometric relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Construction Profile Encoder -> Transformer Decoder -> Construction Sequence Generator -> Reinforcement Learning Optimizer

**Critical Path:**
Input geometric prompt → Construction profile encoding → Sequential step generation → Syntax validation → Self-intersection checking → Final profile output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Supervised learning vs. reinforcement learning: Balance between following extracted sequences vs. optimizing for geometric quality
- Construction sequence granularity: Finer steps provide more control but increase complexity
- Parametric vs. fixed constructions: Parametric enables editing but requires more complex encoding

**Failure Signatures:**
- Syntax errors in construction sequences
- Self-intersecting geometry despite RL training
- Incomplete profile generation due to sequence truncation
- Loss of geometric precision during encoding/decoding

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Generate simple geometric profiles (squares, circles) and verify construction sequence replayability
2. Test parametric editing by modifying construction parameters and observing profile changes
3. Evaluate self-intersection rates across different complexity levels of target profiles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on availability of extracted construction sequences for supervised training
- Reward function focuses primarily on self-intersection avoidance without addressing other geometric artifacts
- Effectiveness demonstrated mainly on simple profiles; scalability to complex/freeform shapes uncertain
- Evaluation metrics are internal to construction domain and don't directly assess real CAD workflow integration

## Confidence
- Supervised learning improvements: High
- Reinforcement learning enhancements: Medium-High
- Parametric editing practical utility: Medium
- Scalability to complex geometries: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on a more diverse benchmark including complex, freeform, and organic shapes to assess scalability beyond simple geometric primitives
2. Conduct user studies with CAD professionals to validate the practical utility of generated construction sequences in real design workflows
3. Test the generalization capability by evaluating model performance on out-of-distribution prompts and comparing editing efficiency with traditional CAD tools
