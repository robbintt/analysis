# An Interpretability-Guided Framework for Responsible Synthetic Data Generation in Emotional Text

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16132
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16132
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** SHAP-guided synthetic data achieved F1-scores of 0.48-0.53, matching real data expansion performance and outperforming naïve generation (0.45)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for synthetic data generation in emotional text classification that leverages SHAP-based interpretability to guide prompt engineering for LLMs. The approach constructs prompts using emotion-relevant keywords and exemplar tweets identified through feature importance analysis, resulting in synthetic data that performs comparably to real data expansion. The framework particularly benefits minority emotion classes, with optimism classification improving from 0.25 to 0.34 F1. While synthetic data shows reduced vocabulary richness compared to real data, it maintains higher lexical overlap and emphasizes emotion-discriminative syntactic patterns that benefit classification performance.

## Method Summary
The framework uses SHAP-derived feature importance to identify emotion-relevant keywords and exemplar tweets from real data, which are then incorporated into LLM generation prompts. The system generates synthetic tweets incrementally from 1,000 to 2,000 samples, with the SHAP-guided approach showing superior performance compared to naïve generation. The method balances lexical richness with emotion-discriminative patterns through careful prompt construction that emphasizes specific syntactic structures and emotion-relevant vocabulary. Classification performance is evaluated using F1-scores across different emotion classes, with particular attention to minority class performance.

## Key Results
- SHAP-guided synthetic data achieved F1-scores of 0.48-0.53, matching real data expansion performance
- Optimism classification improved from 0.25 to 0.34 F1, demonstrating effectiveness for minority emotion classes
- Synthetic data exhibited reduced vocabulary richness (TTR: 0.133-0.143 vs. 0.241 for real data) but maintained higher lexical overlap with real data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by using SHAP interpretability to identify which linguistic features most strongly contribute to emotion classification in real data. These features are then incorporated into generation prompts to guide LLMs toward producing synthetic data that emphasizes the same emotion-discriminative patterns. This approach ensures that synthetic data maintains the essential characteristics needed for accurate emotion classification while reducing the computational cost and privacy concerns associated with real data collection.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHAP interpretability**: Needed to identify emotion-relevant features in real data; quick check: verify feature importance rankings align with domain expertise
- **Prompt engineering**: Required to guide LLM generation toward desired emotional patterns; quick check: test prompt variations with small synthetic datasets
- **Emotion lexicons**: Essential for mapping linguistic features to emotional categories; quick check: validate lexicon coverage across target emotions
- **Lexical richness metrics**: Important for quantifying vocabulary diversity differences; quick check: compare TTR and lexical overlap across datasets
- **Syntactic pattern analysis**: Critical for understanding structural differences between real and synthetic data; quick check: examine POS tag distributions
- **Minority class handling**: Necessary for ensuring balanced emotion classification performance; quick check: evaluate F1 scores across all emotion categories

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Real data -> SHAP analysis -> Feature importance ranking -> Prompt construction -> LLM generation -> Synthetic data -> Classification evaluation
**Critical Path:** SHAP analysis -> Prompt construction -> LLM generation -> Classification evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Balancing lexical richness vs. emotion-discriminative patterns; computational cost of SHAP analysis vs. generation efficiency
**Failure Signatures:** Poor minority class performance indicates inadequate prompt construction; low lexical overlap suggests insufficient feature selection
**First Experiments:** 1) Test SHAP feature selection on small dataset subsets; 2) Evaluate prompt variations with different emotion lexicons; 3) Compare classification performance across incremental synthetic data volumes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across different emotion lexicons and domains remains uncertain
- Focus on Twitter data may limit applicability to other social media platforms
- Relatively modest F1-score improvements suggest incremental rather than transformative gains
- Trade-off between lexical richness and emotion-discriminative patterns requires further investigation

## Confidence
- **Core methodology**: High confidence - well-established SHAP and prompt engineering techniques
- **Comparative performance results**: Medium confidence - consistent patterns but limited statistical validation
- **Linguistic analysis**: Medium confidence - provides useful insights but may not capture full complexity of emotional expression

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across multiple social media platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram) to assess domain transferability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the relative contributions of SHAP features, emotion keywords, and exemplar tweets
3. Implement longitudinal analysis to evaluate how well synthetic data generated from historical patterns performs on contemporary social media content
