# LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20952
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces LBS, a novel architecture for multimodal time-series forecasting that integrates a Bayesian state space model with a pretrained large language model (LLM)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LBS, a novel architecture for multimodal time-series forecasting that integrates a Bayesian state space model with a pretrained large language model (LLM). The framework addresses two key challenges: encoding textual observations into compressed summaries for posterior state estimation, and generating text conditioned on latent states. LBS enables joint numeric and textual forecasting with principled uncertainty quantification and flexible prediction horizons. Evaluated on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark, LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% on average and generates coherent, temporally-grounded textual forecasts.

## Method Summary
LBS combines a Bayesian state space model (SSM) with a pretrained LLM to enable joint multimodal forecasting. The model encodes textual observations into a compressed summary vector using the LLM, which is then used for posterior state estimation. During forecasting, the same LLM generates text conditioned on latent states sampled from the posterior distribution. This tight integration allows for principled uncertainty quantification and flexible prediction horizons. The architecture is trained end-to-end, with the LLM serving dual roles in both encoding and generation.

## Key Results
- LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% on average on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark
- The model generates coherent, temporally-grounded textual forecasts
- LBS demonstrates robustness to long forecasting horizons and interpretable latent dynamics
- LLM scaling yields diminishing returns, suggesting potential bottlenecks in the integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of SSMs and LLMs creates a powerful framework for multimodal forecasting by leveraging the probabilistic modeling strengths of SSMs with the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs. The Bayesian framework provides principled uncertainty quantification, while the LLM enables rich textual understanding and generation. The tight coupling ensures that textual information is properly integrated into the state estimation process, and that generated text is grounded in the underlying time-series dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian State Space Models**: Probabilistic models for time-series that capture uncertainty in state transitions and observations. Needed for principled uncertainty quantification in forecasting. Quick check: Verify the model can generate proper predictive distributions.
- **Large Language Models**: Pretrained models for understanding and generating text. Needed for encoding textual observations and generating coherent text forecasts. Quick check: Test LLM's ability to compress and generate relevant text.
- **Multimodal Forecasting**: Joint prediction of multiple data types (numeric and textual). Needed for real-world scenarios where events have both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quick check: Validate performance on mixed numeric/text targets.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM Encoder -> SSM Posterior -> Latent States -> SSM Prior -> LLM Decoder -> Forecasts

Critical Path:
1. Encode text observations with LLM
2. Compute posterior over latent states
3. Sample from posterior for forecasting
4. Generate text predictions with LLM conditioned on sampled states

Design Tradeoffs:
- Fixed-dimensional summary vs. variable-length encoding of text
- End-to-end training vs. frozen LLM components
- Computational efficiency vs. forecasting accuracy

Failure Signatures:
- Poor numeric forecasting when textual information is crucial
- Generated text that is temporally inconsistent or irrelevant
- High uncertainty estimates even for confident predictions

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study: Remove LLM and compare to pure SSM baseline
2. Quantitative evaluation: Compare numeric and text forecasting metrics
3. Qualitative analysis: Examine generated text for temporal coherence and relevance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LLM scaling yields diminishing returns, suggesting potential bottlenecks in the integration
- The compression of textual observations into fixed-dimensional summaries may discard crucial information
- Computational overhead of LLM integration for each time step is not thoroughly characterized
- Benchmark may not capture complexity of real-world multimodal forecasting scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Joint forecasting of numeric and textual modalities, benchmark improvements
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness to long horizons, interpretable latent dynamics
- **Low Confidence**: Claim of being first to "tightly couple" SSMs and LLMs

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LBS on real-world multimodal datasets with longer time-series and diverse textual events
2. Characterize computational overhead of LLM integration for different scales
3. Conduct ablation study to quantify information loss from text compression
