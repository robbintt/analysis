# Suicidal Comment Tree Dataset: Enhancing Risk Assessment and Prediction Through Contextual Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14395
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14395
- Authors: Jun Li; Qun Zhao
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Including comment trees improved LLM suicide risk prediction F1 scores by 2.46% (Gemini-2.5-Flash)

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical need for early suicide detection by investigating how contextual comment information enhances machine learning performance. The researchers constructed a high-quality annotated dataset of 500 Reddit cases, incorporating users' posting history and comments using a refined four-label annotation framework based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Through statistical analysis and experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs), they demonstrated that including comment trees significantly improves both suicidal risk label identification and LLM predictive performance.

The research provides evidence that contextual data from comment trees enhances models' performance, offering valuable foundation for early suicide intervention strategies. Specifically, Gemini-2.5-Flash showed a 2.46% improvement in F1 score when incorporating comment information, while Qwen3-4B recovered significantly with historical risk labels.

## Method Summary
The researchers constructed a high-quality annotated dataset of 500 Reddit cases, incorporating users' posting history and comments using a refined four-label annotation framework based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Through statistical analysis and experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs), they demonstrated that including comment trees significantly improves both suicidal risk label identification and LLM predictive performance.

## Key Results
- Including comment trees improved Gemini-2.5-Flash F1 score by 2.46%
- Qwen3-4B showed significant recovery with historical risk labels
- Statistical analysis confirmed contextual comment information enhances machine learning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on capturing conversational context and historical posting patterns that provide richer behavioral signals than isolated posts. Comment trees reveal escalation patterns, community responses, and temporal progression of suicidal ideation that single posts cannot capture.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)** - Standardized risk assessment framework needed for consistent labeling across cases; quick check: verify all annotations align with C-SSRS severity criteria
2. **Reddit comment tree structure** - Hierarchical conversation data essential for understanding contextual escalation; quick check: confirm comment parent-child relationships are preserved
3. **Historical posting analysis** - Longitudinal behavioral patterns indicate risk trajectory; quick check: validate time-series features capture meaningful changes

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Reddit data -> Preprocessing -> Annotation (C-SSRS) -> Comment Tree Extraction -> Feature Engineering -> LLM Classification

**Critical Path:** Raw Reddit posts → Comment tree construction → Historical context integration → Risk label prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:** Single-platform focus (Reddit) vs. generalizability; moderate dataset size (500 cases) vs. annotation quality; complex context features vs. computational efficiency

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance when comment trees are sparse; reduced accuracy with missing historical data; label ambiguity in borderline cases

**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline model without comment trees, 2) Model with comment trees only, 3) Full model with historical context integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to 500 Reddit cases may constrain generalizability
- 2.46% F1 improvement represents modest enhancement
- Single-platform focus (Reddit) limits external validity

## Confidence
- **Dataset Size**: Medium - 500 cases with careful annotation
- **Performance Improvement**: Medium - 2.46% F1 gain is statistically meaningful but modest
- **Generalizability**: Low-Medium - Reddit-specific findings may not transfer to other platforms

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments across multiple social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, specialized forums)
2. Conduct longitudinal validation to assess model performance over time
3. Perform clinical validation with mental health professionals to determine real-world impact of performance improvements
