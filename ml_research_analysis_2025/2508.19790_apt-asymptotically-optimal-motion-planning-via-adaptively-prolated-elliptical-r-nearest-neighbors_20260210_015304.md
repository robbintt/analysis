# APT*: Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning via Adaptively Prolated Elliptical R-Nearest Neighbors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19790
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19790
- Reference count: 26
- Extends FDIT* with adaptive batch sizing and elliptical r-nearest neighbor modules for improved convergence in high-dimensional motion planning

## Executive Summary
APT* introduces a sampling-based motion planner that combines adaptive batch sizing and elliptical r-nearest neighbor modules to achieve faster convergence and lower solution costs in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The method dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on informed set hypervolume and uses Coulomb's law to define virtual forces for refining neighbor selection through non-linear prolation methods. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing planners in dimensions from R⁴ to R¹⁶, with validation through real-world robot manipulation tasks.

## Method Summary
APT* extends FDIT* by integrating an adaptive batch-size module that scales sample batches inversely with the hypervolume of the informed set, and an elliptical r-nearest neighbors module that uses Coulomb's law to define virtual forces for biasing neighbor selection. The planner employs non-linear prolation via Tanh Taylor expansion to optimize vertex electric charges, improving convergence rates. Implementation is available in OMPL at https://github.com/Liding-Zhang/ompl-apt.git.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing planners in dimensions R⁴ to R¹⁶ with higher success rates and lower median path costs
- Achieves 29% faster initial solution time compared to FDIT*/FIT* in Dividing Wall benchmarks
- Validated through real-world robot manipulation tasks demonstrating effectiveness in complex environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Elliptical R-Nearest Neighbors via Coulomb Force
Deforms isotropic neighbor search into anisotropic ellipsoid by treating vertices as electric charges. Valid samples exert attractive forces and invalid samples exert repulsive forces via Coulomb's law, elongating search toward low-cost directions and compressing it near obstacles. This biases exploration toward promising regions.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Batch Sizing via Informed Set Hypervolume
Dynamically scales batch size inversely with informed set volume by tracking the Lebesgue measure of the prolated hyperellipsoid. Larger batches when informed ratio approaches 1 (initial phase), smaller when approaching 0 (optimization phase). Balances exploration speed against optimization granularity.

### Mechanism 3: Non-linear Charge Prolation via Tanh Taylor Expansion
Maps batch size to vertex charge through saturating non-linearity using Tanh-based prolation with Taylor series expansion. Prevents premature convergence early (low eccentricity) while enabling aggressive search shaping late (high eccentricity). Provides computational efficiency through approximation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Random Geometric Graphs (RGG) and Asymptotic Optimality**: Essential for understanding APT*'s theoretical foundation guaranteeing solution cost convergence as sample count → ∞. Quick check: Explain why RGG radius includes (log(B)/B)^(1/n) term and consequences of incorrect radius.

- **Informed Sampling and the Prolated Hyperellipsoid**: Critical for understanding how APT* restricts sampling to informed sets defined by current best cost. The hypervolume drives adaptive batching. Quick check: In 8D space with cmin = 2.0 and ci = 5.0, does informed set expand or contract if ci drops to 4.0?

- **Coulomb's Law in N Dimensions**: Necessary for correctly implementing the force formulation using q²/rⁿ⁻¹ scaling. Using wrong exponent breaks elliptical deformation. Quick check: Why does force formula use rn-1i rather than ri² in denominator?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Adaptive Batch-size Module (Alg. 2) -> Charge Calculation (Alg. 3) -> Elliptical-RNN Module (Alg. 1) -> Vertex expansion
- **Critical path**: Initialize with mmax samples → Alg. 3 computes qi → Alg. 1 gets elliptical neighbors → edge evaluation → Alg. 2 updates Badapt on cost improvement → iterate
- **Design tradeoffs**: α (Taylor order) balances accuracy vs overhead (α = 100-1000 sweet spot); (mmin, mmax) range affects adaptation stability; k (eccentricity scaling) sensitivity not explicitly tuned
- **Failure signatures**: Zero force indicates dense obstacles where deformation cannot escape; batch size stuck at mmax suggests solution cost not improving; excessive per-iteration time indicates large α overhead
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Table I in R⁴ DW environment comparing APT*-T vs EIT* vs FDIT*; 2) Ablate charge prolation by setting q = constant vs adaptive; 3) Test break condition with symmetric obstacles to measure force cancellation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Human awareness and safety constraints**: Future research could integrate human awareness and safety constraints for planning in dynamic scenarios via local motion planners. The current framework is designed for static environments and requires time-varying constraints for dynamic scenarios.

- **SIMD parallelism**: Utilizing single instruction/multiple data parallelism methods could reduce computational effort and enhance planning efficiency. While batch processing suggests parallelization potential, sequential dependencies may create bottlenecks.

- **Tanh prolation robustness**: The Tanh-based prolation method's performance may vary across environment topologies different from tested benchmarks. Performance is heuristically tuned and uncertain for environments where force analogy might mislead search.

## Limitations

- Benchmark environments and collision checker implementation details are not fully specified, critical for faithful reproduction
- Adaptive batch-size mechanism assumes monotonic cost improvement, which may not hold in discontinuous cost landscapes
- Tanh-based charge prolation lacks external validation beyond authors' ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High**: APT* improves over baseline planners in high-dimensional spaces based on reported success rates and cost metrics
- **Medium**: Elliptical RNN deformation via Coulomb forces accelerates convergence, supported by FDIT* predecessor but limited ablation
- **Medium**: Adaptive batch sizing via informed volume ratio effectively balances exploration/exploitation, though only tested in paper's scenarios
- **Low**: Tanh charge prolation is optimal for this application, as no comparative non-linear mappings are presented

## Next Checks

1. **Break Condition Validation**: Construct environments with radially symmetric obstacles around start state and measure force magnitude distribution to verify APT* degrades to standard RNN when Coulomb forces cancel

2. **Hypervolume Assumption Test**: Implement discontinuous cost landscapes where solution cost improvements do not monotonically decrease informed volume, observing batch size stability

3. **Cross-Environment Generalization**: Test APT* on problems where directional obstacle gradients are minimal (e.g., uniform clutter) to assess force-based neighbor selection utility beyond reported benchmarks
