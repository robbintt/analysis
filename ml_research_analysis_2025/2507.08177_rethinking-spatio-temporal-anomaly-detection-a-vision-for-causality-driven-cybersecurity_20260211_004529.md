## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a causality-driven framework for spatio-temporal anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems (CPS), addressing the limitations of black-box deep learning models. The approach leverages causal graph learning to model system states, detect structural deviations, and enable interpretable root-cause attribution. Three key directions are introduced: divergence-aware causal graph profiling, multi-view causal graph fusion reasoning, and continual causal graph learning. Experiments on SWaT and WADI datasets demonstrate that causal methods achieve competitive F1-scores (up to 0.85) while offering interpretability and robustness to drift. Future work includes scaling to high-dimensional systems, handling causal sufficiency violations, and integrating generative AI for improved adaptability.

## Method Summary
The framework treats anomalies as structural deviations in causal relationships rather than statistical outliers. It employs causal graph learning algorithms (constraint-based, score-based, or neural) to construct Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) representing normal system behavior. The detection engine monitors for topological changes—edge additions, deletions, or strength variations—between the baseline "normal" profile and current observations. The approach is extended through multi-view fusion of heterogeneous data sources and continual learning to adapt to system evolution. The methodology is validated on water treatment CPS datasets (SWaT, WADI) against deep learning baselines.

## Key Results
- Causal graph methods achieve F1-scores up to 0.85 on SWaT dataset, competitive with deep learning baselines
- Structural divergence detection provides interpretable root-cause attribution versus black-box models
- Continual causal graph learning maintains performance under distribution drift without catastrophic forgetting
- Multi-view fusion improves detection accuracy for complex, multi-component cyber-attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Divergence-Aware Causal Graph Profiling
- **Claim:** Anomalies in CPS manifest as structural deviations in causal relationships rather than statistical outliers.
- **Mechanism:** SCM represents normal operation as DAG; detection engine monitors edge appearances/disappearances or strength changes to flag structural divergence.
- **Core assumption:** System operates under stable physical laws during normal conditions, resulting in invariant causal graph topology.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states approach leverages causal graph learning to detect structural deviations; Section 2.1 defines anomalies as structural deviations in causality.
- **Break condition:** High false positives if environment has frequent benign topology changes.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-View Causal Graph Fusion
- **Claim:** Fusing causal graphs from heterogeneous data sources improves detection of complex attacks.
- **Mechanism:** Separate causal graphs for different modalities (sensors + logs) are integrated via joint learning to uncover cross-modal dependencies.
- **Core assumption:** Different data modalities capture complementary aspects with shared consistency or latent correlations.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions multi-view causal graph fusion reasoning; Section 2.2 describes holistic understanding from multiple views.
- **Break condition:** Fusion introduces noise if modalities are desynchronized or semantically disjoint.

### Mechanism 3: Continual Causal Graph Learning (CCGL)
- **Claim:** Incremental updates to causal graphs adapt to system drift without full retraining.
- **Mechanism:** Causal graph treated as dynamic entity; new data triggers sparse updates (e.g., Laplacian regularization) rather than complete rebuilding.
- **Core assumption:** System evolution is gradual, allowing incremental topological adjustments.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions continual causal graph learning advantages; Section 2.3 envisions causal graph as dynamic entity evolving with system state.
- **Break condition:** Catastrophic forgetting causes loss of knowledge about rare but dangerous previous attack vectors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) & DAGs**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper defines normal behavior by causal topology; understanding DAGs is prerequisite to interpreting structural deviations.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a correlation-based GNN might fail to detect an anomaly that a DAG-based SCM would catch?

- **Concept: Causal Sufficiency & Confounders**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper lists "handling causal sufficiency violations" as challenge; engineers must understand missing sensors create spurious causal edges.
  - **Quick check question:** If a sensor fails (becoming unobserved), how might the causal graph incorrectly infer a direct link between two remaining sensors?

- **Concept: Concept Drift vs. Covariate Shift**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper critiques black-box models for brittleness to "distribution shifts"; distinguishing structural topology changes from input drift is key to CCGL value.
  - **Quick check question:** Does water pressure change (covariate shift) affect causal graph differently than valve hack (structural change)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion -> Causal Discovery Engine -> Graph State Manager -> Divergence Calculator -> Alert & Root Cause Interface
- **Critical path:** The Causal Discovery Engine; if too slow or inaccurate, downstream divergence scores and root cause attributions are invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretability vs. Scalability: Scaling to high-dimensional systems is difficult; trade full graph complexity for modularity or sparse approximations.
  - Stability vs. Adaptability (CCGL): Frequent updates capture drift but risk instability; infrequent updates improve stability but miss evolving threats.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High False Alarm Rate: Likely caused by causal sufficiency violations or inability to distinguish benign updates from attacks.
  - Silent Failures (Low Recall): Likely caused by acyclicity assumption being violated by feedback loops in control systems.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Profiling (SWaT Dataset): Run static causal discovery algorithm on SWaT training set; measure F1-score to verify structural divergence detection (F1 ~0.82) is reproducible versus deep learning baselines.
  2. Drift Stress Test: Inject gradual benign concept drift into data stream to test if CCGL module maintains stability without false positive alerts.
  3. Root Cause Localization: Execute specific attack scenario (e.g., "equipment malfunction"); verify system identifies specific edge/node disruption correctly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Approach depends on assumption of stable causal structures during normal operation, which may not hold in highly dynamic CPS environments
- Performance claims based on specific datasets (SWaT, WADI) with controlled attack scenarios, limiting generalizability to real-world deployments
- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional systems remain theoretical without quantitative computational complexity analysis

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core insight that anomalies manifest as structural causal graph deviations is well-grounded in causal inference literature and supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence:** Theoretical advantages of multi-view fusion and continual learning are plausible but require additional empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** Scalability limitations are acknowledged but not quantified; paper correctly identifies this as research direction

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline Profiling Validation:** Replicate SWaT dataset experiments using standard causal discovery algorithms to verify claimed F1-score of 0.82-0.85 for structural divergence detection versus traditional deep learning baselines
2. **Drift Stress Test:** Implement gradual concept drift scenario in SWaT/WADI data to evaluate whether continual causal graph learning maintains detection accuracy without triggering false alarms
3. **Root Cause Attribution Test:** Execute specific attack scenario and verify if system correctly identifies affected causal edges/nodes, demonstrating interpretability advantage over black-box methods
