# Fair-GNE : Generalized Nash Equilibrium-Seeking Fairness in Multiagent Healthcare Automation

## Quick Facts

- One-line result: Fair-GNE achieves 168% improvement in workload balance (JFI 0.89 vs 0.33) while maintaining 86% task success in a resuscitation simulator.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Fair-GNE, a method for enforcing fairness in multi-agent healthcare worker automation through adaptive constraint enforcement. The approach models fairness-constrained MARL as a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game, where agents share resources and their decisions affect each other. A key contribution is the dual-ascent algorithm that enforces a Jain's Fairness Index-based constraint during learning, allowing the Lagrange multiplier to adapt based on workload imbalance. The method is evaluated in a high-fidelity resuscitation simulator with three specialized agents. Fair-GNE achieves a 168% improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (JFI 0.89 vs. 0.33, p < 0.01) while maintaining 86% task success, demonstrating that adaptive constraint enforcement can substantially improve fairness without sacrificing performance.

## Method Summary
Fair-GNE formulates multi-agent reinforcement learning with fairness constraints as a generalized Nash equilibrium game. The method introduces a shared constraint based on Jain's Fairness Index (JFI) that couples agent action spaces. An adaptive dual-ascent algorithm updates the Lagrange multiplier based on fairness violations, creating a dynamic penalty that scales with workload imbalance. The algorithm converges to a stationary point satisfying KKT conditions, ensuring both task completion and workload balance. The method is evaluated using QMIX as the MARL backbone in a resuscitation simulator with three specialized agents.

## Key Results
- 168% improvement in workload balance (JFI 0.89 vs 0.33, p < 0.01) over fixed-penalty baselines
- Maintains 86% task success rate while enforcing high fairness threshold (τ = 0.85)
- Achieves ≥95% KKT satisfaction rates, empirically validating convergence
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (WFL, WSR, ACT) across all fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Constraint-Induced Coupling via Generalized Nash Equilibrium
The formulation elevates MARL from a standard game to a Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) game. In a GNE, one agent's feasible action set depends on the actions of others through the shared fairness constraint. This coupling makes fairness self-enforceable against individual defection, as violating the constraint removes the solution from equilibrium.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Penalty Scaling via Dual Ascent
The algorithm introduces a Lagrange multiplier λ that updates via gradient ascent based on fairness violations. When the fairness index drops below threshold τ, λ grows, scaling the penalty term in the reward. This forces the policy to correct imbalances, with λ decaying once balance is restored.

### Mechanism 3: Stationarity via KKT Conditions
The algorithm seeks a saddle point of the Lagrangian, converging to a solution that satisfies Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. This ensures the policy is locally optimal and fair, with empirical validation showing ≥95% KKT satisfaction rates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)**
  - Why needed: Unlike standard Nash Equilibrium, GNE is required when one agent's actions determine what is feasible for others through shared constraints.
  - Quick check: If Agent A violates a shared safety constraint, does that change the feasible action set for Agent B in a standard game vs. a GNE?

- **Concept: Primal-Dual Optimization**
  - Why needed: The core mechanics rely on updating two sets of variables: the policy (primal) and the penalty weight (dual).
  - Quick check: In the Lagrangian L = J(π) - λg(π), does λ increase when g(π) is satisfied or violated?

- **Concept: Jain's Fairness Index (JFI)**
  - Why needed: This metric quantifies fairness with specific mathematical properties (convexity, scale invariance) suitable for gradient-based optimization.
  - Quick check: If all agents have equal workload, what is the JFI value? (Answer: 1).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment -> Workload Tracker -> Constraint Module -> Dual Controller -> Reward Shaper -> MARL Backbone
- **Critical path:** Workload Tracker → Dual Controller → Reward Shaper forms the Fair-GNE layer that shapes rewards based on fairness violations
- **Design tradeoffs:** Strictness (τ) vs. success rate - setting τ=0.85 drops success to 86%, while τ=0.55 allows 92% success
- **Failure signatures:** λ saturation indicates impossible constraints, zero λ suggests loose thresholds, oscillating success points to high dual learning rates
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline comparison (QMIX vs Fair-GNE) to replicate JFI gap, 2) Threshold sweep from 0.55 to 0.85 to find fairness-efficiency trade-off, 3) Ablation on update frequency (every step vs every 50 steps) to validate stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability untested in environments with >3 agents or heterogeneous task types
- Real-world transfer to noisy, communication-delayed, human-in-the-loop scenarios unknown
- Self-enforceability claims assume team-reward structures, may not hold in competitive settings

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Adaptive dual-ascent mechanism effectively improves JFI over static baselines (p < 0.01, KKT ≥95%)
- Medium Confidence: 168% workload balance improvement is context-specific to resuscitation simulator
- Low Confidence: "Self-enforceability" claims assume team-reward structures may fail in mixed-motive settings

## Next Checks
1. Test Fair-GNE in multi-room hospital environment with varying agent capabilities to assess scalability
2. Evaluate with human supervisors providing dynamic fairness thresholds for real-world applicability
3. Systematically induce infeasible constraint scenarios to measure robustness to impossible fairness requirements
