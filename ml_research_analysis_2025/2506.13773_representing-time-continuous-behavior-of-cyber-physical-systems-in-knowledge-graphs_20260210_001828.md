# Representing Time-Continuous Behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems in Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.13773
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13773
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** A semantic model and method for representing time-continuous dynamics of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in knowledge graphs using OpenMath and standards-based ontology design patterns.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a semantic model and method for representing time-continuous dynamics of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in knowledge graphs. The approach uses OpenMath to encode differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) and integrates them with CPS functions and structure using standards-based ontology design patterns (VDI 3682, VDI 2206, DIN EN 61360). A recursive mapping method translates OpenMath XML to RDF for efficient knowledge graph generation. Validation in aviation maintenance demonstrates the formal representation of complex Electro-Hydraulic Servoactuator dynamics within a unified lifecycle context. The solution addresses key gaps in semantically representing continuous system behavior and enables interoperability across CPS lifecycle phases.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a recursive tree-traversal algorithm implemented in Python using rdflib to convert OpenMath XML representations of differential equations into RDF graphs. The method maps OpenMath nodes (OMA, OMS, OMV) to RDF structures (om:Application, rdf:List) while maintaining semantic links to CPS structural components and functions through the CPSMod ontology. The approach combines mathematical operators from OpenMath content dictionaries with CPS lifecycle standards to create a unified semantic context for system behavior representation.

## Key Results
- Successfully represents complex differential equations (e.g., pressure continuity equations) as semantic data in knowledge graphs
- Establishes formal links between mathematical variables and CPS structural components through standards-based ontologies
- Demonstrates automated conversion of nested mathematical XML to linear RDF graphs using recursive traversal
- Validates approach through aviation maintenance case study with Electro-Hydraulic Servoactuator dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Aligning differential equations with structural and functional standards creates a unified semantic context for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
- **Mechanism:** The `CPSMod` ontology aligns OpenMath (mathematical operators) with VDI 3682 (process/functions) and VDI 2206 (structure). This transforms a purely mathematical variable (e.g., "x") into a `DINEN61360:DataElement` linked to a specific `VDI2206:Component` (e.g., an actuator ram), enabling the knowledge graph to serve not just as a calculation script but as an interoperable system model.
- **Core assumption:** Engineers consistently map variables to the correct standard data elements; the underlying standards (VDI, OpenMath) sufficiently capture the domain complexity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...differential equations... must be contextualized and integrated with further CPS information."
  - [section IV-A] "Each VDI3682:ProcessOperator is additionally linked to a VDI3682:TechnicalResource... enabling the assignment of CPS functions to specific structural components."
  - [corpus] Evidence is weak/tangential; corpus focuses on high-level CPS safety/LLMs but does not validate this specific ontological alignment.
- **Break condition:** If the standard definitions (e.g., VDI 3682 process operators) do not match the actual system architecture, the semantic link between the equation and the physical component will be invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Recursive tree traversal enables the automated conversion of nested mathematical XML into linear RDF graphs.
- **Mechanism:** OpenMath represents equations as deeply nested trees (`<OMA>` applications). Standard mapping languages like RML struggle with this structural recursion. The proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) recursively visits nodes, identifying operators and arguments to flatten the hierarchy into RDF lists (`rdf:first`, `rdf:rest`), preserving the mathematical logic in a triple store.
- **Core assumption:** The complexity of the equation tree does not exceed the recursion depth limits of the implementation environment; the OpenMath XML is well-formed.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...recursive mapping method translates OpenMath XML to RDF for efficient knowledge graph generation."
  - [section IV-B] "Standard RDF mapping mechanisms... lack native capabilities for structural recursion... To address these limitations, we apply a recursive tree traversal algorithm."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence validates this specific XML-to-RDF mapping algorithm.
- **Break condition:** If an equation relies on ambiguous symbols not defined in the OpenMath Content Dictionaries (`weylalgebra1`), the mapper cannot generate valid URIs, breaking the semantic link.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Decoupling the representation of dynamics from the simulation solver allows for tool-agnostic interoperability.
- **Mechanism:** By storing the differential equations as semantic data (RDF) rather than executable code (e.g., MATLAB scripts), the system separates the *model definition* from the *model execution*. The knowledge graph acts as a neutral interchange format that can be queried and exported to various simulation tools rather than serving as the computation engine itself.
- **Core assumption:** Target simulation tools can interpret the semantics of the graph structure correctly; latency introduced by the translation layer is acceptable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section VI] "It does not support direct computation or numerical simulation... Computation and numerical solution methods remain external tasks."
  - [section V] "The information stored in this knowledge graph could subsequently be queried to create models in Matlab/Simulink..."
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors mention "interoperability" generally in CPS, supporting the need for this decoupling, but do not validate this specific storage mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If specific solver constraints (e.g., stiffness requirements, step-size dependencies) are not captured in the semantic model, the exported model may fail to simulate or produce incorrect results in the target tool.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper constructs `CPSMod` not from scratch, but by composing existing patterns (VDI 3682, OpenMath). Understanding ODPs is required to extend or modify the model without breaking standard compliance.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you identify which ODP in the paper handles the distinction between a generic "Process" and a specific "Technical Resource"?

- **Concept:** **OpenMath Content Dictionaries**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on `weylalgebra1` for differential operators (`diff`, `partialdiff`). A user must understand that these are standardized semantic definitions, not just string labels, to correctly instantiate equations.
  - **Quick check question:** What specific OpenMath operator would you use to represent the time-derivative of pressure ($\partial p / \partial t$) as shown in Table I?

- **Concept:** **RDF Lists vs. Tree Structures**
  - **Why needed here:** The core technical challenge solved in the paper is mapping the tree-structure of XML math to the graph-structure of RDF. You must understand how `rdf:first` and `rdf:rest` represent ordered sequences to debug the mapping process.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper reject standard RML (RDF Mapping Language) in favor of a custom recursive algorithm for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Data (Engineering knowledge, OpenMath XML) -> Transformation Layer (Python-based Recursive Mapper) -> Storage Layer (Knowledge Graph with CPSMod ontology) -> Application Layer (SPARQL query interface, Exporter to simulation tools)

- **Critical path:** Defining `DINEN61360:DataElement` instances -> Generating OpenMath XML for equations -> Running the Recursive Mapper -> Linking the resulting `OM:Application` to the `VDI3682:ProcessOperator`

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Expressiveness vs. Computability:** The model can represent complex PDEs semantically but *cannot* solve them natively; it trades execution capability for interoperability.
  - **Standardization vs. Completeness:** Relying on `weylalgebra1` ensures standard compliance but limits the range of mathematical operators available (vs. a custom schema).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Orphaned Variables:** Variables exist in the equation (`OM:Variable`) but lack the `CPSMod:isDataFor` link to a `DataElement`, making the physics semantically ambiguous.
  - **Malformed Lists:** The RDF list representing equation arguments is broken (missing `rdf:rest` or `rdf:nil`), preventing correct parsing by simulation tools.
  - **Experimental Dictionary Errors:** Usage of operators from `weylalgebra1` causes validation errors in tools that require stable (non-experimental) OpenMath definitions.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Simple ODE Instantiation:** Manually map a basic first-order ODE (e.g., $\frac{dx}{dt} = -ax$) from XML to RDF and query it back to verify the recursive structure is intact.
  2. **Semantic Context Query:** Write a SPARQL query to "Find all differential equations assigned to the `ActuatorMainRam` component" to test the function-structure-behavior links.
  3. **Round-Trip Export:** Attempt to generate a valid block diagram definition (e.g., for Simulink) *solely* from the graph data to test the interoperability claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the semantic model be extended to represent hybrid CPS behaviors by combining automata-based discrete states with continuous differential equations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states that future research will extend the semantic model to represent hybrid behaviors "by combining automata-based techniques with differential equations."
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation focuses primarily on mapping continuous dynamics via OpenMath. Integrating discrete state transitions (event-driven dynamics) with continuous flows within a unified knowledge graph structure requires a new semantic layer to handle mode switches and state invariants.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A unified ontology schema that formally links discrete state classes (e.g., State Machines) with continuous OpenMath applications, validated against a hybrid system use case.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the knowledge graph representation be integrated with established simulation tools to automatically generate executable models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify a key focus on "exploring integration with established simulation tools, supporting the automatic generation of executable models from the knowledge graph."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper successfully maps mathematical equations to RDF, it explicitly notes that the knowledge graph acts as an information transfer mechanism rather than a computational engine. The translation from passive RDF data back into active, solvable simulation code is not yet automated.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A software pipeline capable of parsing the proposed OpenMath RDF serialization and exporting a functional simulation file (e.g., for Matlab/Simulink) that yields numerical results identical to the original mathematical model.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent can Large Language Models (LLMs) automate the instantiation of behavioral models from engineering data?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper lists "automating the model instantiation process by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured representations" as a specific avenue for future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method reduces manual effort via recursive mapping but still relies on engineers to formulate and structure the equations. The reliability of LLMs in accurately translating unstructured specifications into formal, standards-based OpenMath RDF is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study demonstrating an LLM-based framework that converts text-based system descriptions into valid OpenMath XML/RDF instances with measurable accuracy regarding semantic correctness and structural integrity.

## Limitations

- The semantic accuracy of OpenMath-to-RDF mapping remains theoretical without validation against gold standards or empirical demonstration of cross-tool compatibility
- Dependency on specific VDI and DIN standards may limit adoption in regions or industries using different standards
- The claim of enabling "unified lifecycle context" is currently an assertion without demonstrated integration across multiple lifecycle phases in a single case study

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of recursively mapping nested OpenMath XML to RDF lists is technically sound and directly implementable from the provided Algorithm 1 pseudocode.
- **Medium Confidence:** The ontological alignment between OpenMath operators and VDI/DIN standards is plausible and addresses a documented gap, but its practical effectiveness depends on the consistency of standard implementations across engineering teams.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that this representation enables "unified lifecycle context" is currently an assertion without demonstrated integration across multiple lifecycle phases (design, operation, maintenance) in a single case study.

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Round-Trip Test:** Export the generated RDF graph to a simulation environment (e.g., MATLAB/Simulink) and verify that the recreated model produces mathematically equivalent results to the original OpenMath representation.

2. **Standard Compliance Audit:** Validate that all OpenMath Content Dictionary URIs used in the case study are from stable (non-experimental) releases to ensure long-term interoperability.

3. **Scalability Benchmark:** Test the recursive mapping algorithm on increasingly complex PDEs (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) to identify recursion depth limits and performance bottlenecks in the knowledge graph generation process.
