# Interpreting Social Bias in LVLMs via Information Flow Analysis and Multi-Round Dialogue Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.21106
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21106
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Key outcome:** This paper addresses social bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by proposing an explanation framework combining information flow analysis and multi-round dialogue evaluation. The method identifies high-contribution image tokens during neutral reasoning and quantifies reliance on sensitive information through a fairness scoring mechanism. Experiments on the FACET dataset show that LVLMs exhibit systematic disparities in information usage across demographic groups, with dominant groups receiving higher fairness scores. Additionally, textual modality analysis reveals embedded gender stereotypes in semantic representations. These findings demonstrate that social bias in LVLMs stems from imbalanced internal reasoning dynamics rather than surface-level artifacts.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for interpreting social bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through information flow analysis and multi-round dialogue evaluation. The approach identifies which image tokens contribute most to biased reasoning and quantifies reliance on sensitive demographic information during neutral reasoning tasks. The framework combines token contribution analysis with fairness scoring mechanisms to reveal systematic disparities in how LVLMs process information across different demographic groups.

The authors evaluate their framework on the FACET dataset using LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-v1.6 models, demonstrating that bias emerges from imbalanced internal reasoning dynamics rather than surface-level artifacts. The research also extends to textual modality analysis, uncovering gender stereotypes embedded in semantic representations. The work provides both an explanation framework for understanding bias mechanisms and offers insights for building fairer multimodal systems.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a two-phase approach: information flow analysis and multi-round dialogue evaluation. During information flow analysis, the model identifies high-contribution image tokens during neutral reasoning tasks by measuring their impact on model outputs. A fairness scoring mechanism quantifies how much the model relies on sensitive demographic information versus neutral attributes. The multi-round dialogue evaluation tests consistency of reasoning across multiple interaction rounds to assess bias persistence.

For the textual modality analysis, the researchers examine how semantic representations encode gender stereotypes. The framework uses token pruning techniques to isolate sensitive information and measure its impact on model accuracy across different demographic groups. The fairness score is calculated by comparing accuracy disparities when sensitive tokens are present versus when they are removed, revealing whether models disproportionately rely on demographic attributes for certain groups.

## Key Results
- LLaVA models show systematic disparities in information usage across demographic groups, with dominant groups receiving higher fairness scores
- Gender stereotypes are embedded in semantic representations, detectable through textual modality analysis
- Social bias in LVLMs stems from imbalanced internal reasoning dynamics rather than surface-level artifacts
- The framework successfully identifies high-contribution sensitive tokens that drive biased reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by mapping the information flow within LVLMs to identify which image tokens drive biased reasoning. By analyzing token contributions during neutral tasks, the method reveals that models rely on different information pathways depending on demographic attributes. The fairness scoring mechanism quantifies this reliance by measuring accuracy disparities when sensitive tokens are removed. This approach exposes how internal reasoning dynamics create systematic biases rather than attributing them to superficial patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Flow Analysis** - Why needed: To trace how information propagates through the model during reasoning. Quick check: Verify that high-contribution tokens align with known bias patterns.
- **Token Contribution Measurement** - Why needed: To quantify the impact of individual tokens on model outputs. Quick check: Confirm that removing high-contribution tokens significantly affects accuracy.
- **Fairness Scoring Mechanism** - Why needed: To provide a quantitative metric for measuring bias reliance. Quick check: Validate that fairness scores correlate with observed accuracy disparities.
- **Multi-Round Dialogue Evaluation** - Why needed: To assess bias persistence across multiple reasoning steps. Quick check: Ensure consistency metrics reflect expected bias patterns.
- **Feature Overlap Problem** - Why needed: To understand limitations of current token pruning approaches. Quick check: Verify that accuracy disparities persist even with selective token removal.
- **Textual Modality Analysis** - Why needed: To uncover embedded stereotypes in semantic representations. Quick check: Confirm that gender associations emerge in word embeddings.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Image Encoder -> Vision-Language Projector -> Language Model -> Information Flow Analyzer -> Fairness Scorer

**Critical Path:** Image input → CLIP-based feature extraction → LLaVA projection → LLM reasoning → Token contribution analysis → Fairness score calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes interpretability over computational efficiency, using comprehensive token analysis rather than lightweight bias detection methods. This provides detailed insights but increases computational overhead.

**Failure Signatures:** Low fairness scores may indicate over-reliance on sensitive information, while high accuracy disparities suggest systematic bias in information usage patterns. Inconsistent multi-round dialogue results may reveal unstable reasoning dynamics.

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply information flow analysis to a neutral reasoning task and identify top 10% high-contribution tokens
2. Calculate fairness scores across demographic groups and compare accuracy disparities
3. Conduct multi-round dialogue evaluation to test bias persistence across interaction sequences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can feature-level decomposition techniques effectively disentangle neutral and sensitive attributes within individual image tokens to improve the precision of fairness scoring?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section states that current sequence-level token pruning fails to address "Feature Overlap," where single tokens encode both neutral and sensitive information, causing fairness scores to correlate with accuracy disparities only in sign but not magnitude.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method identifies high-contribution tokens ($I_{key}$) but must prune them entirely to test sensitivity, lacking the granularity to separate mixed features within a token.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A framework utilizing vector decomposition or disentangled representation learning that isolates sensitive features from neutral ones, resulting in fairness scores that linearly correlate with the magnitude of accuracy disparities.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the high-contribution sensitive tokens identified by this framework be targeted for specific intervention strategies (e.g., attention penalization) to mitigate bias without degrading task performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors conclude that their findings offer "new insights for building fairer multimodal systems," but the paper only proposes an explanation framework rather than a remediation method.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper establishes that models rely on imbalanced information pathways, it does not test whether suppressing the influence of the identified sensitive tokens ($I_{key}$) during inference effectively reduces bias or simply lowers overall accuracy.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments demonstrating that selectively masking or penalizing attention weights associated with sensitive $I_{key}$ tokens reduces $Acc_{Diff}$ while maintaining stable performance on neutral tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the correlation between imbalanced internal information flow and model bias persist across different LVLM architectures, specifically encoder-decoder models or those with non-CLIP visual backbones?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental settings are restricted to the LLaVA family (LLaVA-v1.5 and v1.6), which share similar architectural principles (decoder-only LLM with CLIP visual encoder).
- **Why unresolved:** The observed "systematic disparities in information usage" might be an artifact of how CLIP embeddings or the LLaVA projection layer align modalities, rather than a universal property of all LVLMs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of the information flow and multi-round dialogue framework to architectures like Flamingo (encoder-decoder) or models using different vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP), showing similar fairness score distributions.

## Limitations
- Current token pruning techniques cannot disentangle neutral and sensitive features within individual tokens, limiting fairness score precision
- The framework has only been validated on LLaVA models with CLIP visual backbones, limiting generalizability
- The fairness scoring mechanism correlates with accuracy disparities in sign but not magnitude due to feature overlap issues

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The observation that LVLMs exhibit systematic disparities in information usage across demographic groups (supported by quantitative fairness scores and statistical significance)

**Medium Confidence:** The conclusion that social bias stems from imbalanced internal reasoning dynamics rather than surface-level artifacts (plausible but requires additional causal validation)

**Medium Confidence:** The finding that gender stereotypes are embedded in semantic representations (methodologically sound but limited to observed patterns)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing high-contribution image tokens to measure impact on biased outputs, establishing causal relationships between token contributions and fairness scores
2. Test the framework across diverse real-world datasets and applications to evaluate generalization beyond controlled FACET conditions
3. Implement cross-modal interventions targeting identified biased reasoning patterns and measure changes in fairness metrics to validate the explanatory framework's utility for bias mitigation
