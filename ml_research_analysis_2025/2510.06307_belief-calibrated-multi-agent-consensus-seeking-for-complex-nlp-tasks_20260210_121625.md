# Belief-Calibrated Multi-Agent Consensus Seeking for Complex NLP Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06307
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BCCS improves accuracy by 2.23% on MATH and 3.95% on MMLU benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS), a theoretical framework for selecting optimal collaborators in multi-agent systems to maximize consensus stability. The method incorporates belief calibration into consensus judgment and integrates collaborator assignment and leader selection modules. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements on challenging mathematical reasoning (MATH) and general knowledge (MMLU) benchmarks, showing robustness across different model sizes and adversarial scenarios.

## Method Summary
BCCS operates through iterative consensus seeking among multiple agents. The framework uses Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone model with 7 agents, 3 maximum rounds, and 2 leaders. Belief is calculated as the product of token probabilities for the final answer sentence. The method employs KMeans clustering with TF-IDF vectors to identify opinion groups and classifies consensus states as Full (dominant group > 2/3 AND belief > 0.8), Partial (dominant group >= 2/n AND belief > 0.5), or None. Based on the consensus state, the system either assigns conflicting collaborators to uncertain agents or selects top-belief agents as leaders for the next round.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.23% accuracy improvement on MATH benchmark compared to existing best results
- Demonstrates 3.95% accuracy improvement on MMLU benchmark
- Shows consistent performance improvements across different model sizes and adversarial scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining belief calibration with structured consensus seeking. By calculating belief as the product of token probabilities for final answers, the system quantifies confidence in responses. The clustering-based opinion grouping allows identification of diverse perspectives, while the consensus state classification enables adaptive collaboration strategies. When partial consensus exists, conflicting collaborators are assigned to uncertain agents to resolve disagreements. In the absence of consensus, high-belief agents are selected as leaders to guide the group toward agreement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Belief Calibration**: Quantifying confidence in model responses by calculating token probabilities - needed to measure reliability of different answers and required for consensus stability metrics
- **Multi-Agent Consensus**: Coordinating multiple agents toward agreement - essential for collaborative problem-solving and requires understanding of group dynamics
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text responses to numerical vectors for clustering - needed to identify opinion groups and can be checked by examining vector dimensions
- **KMeans Clustering**: Grouping similar responses - required for identifying opinion clusters and should be validated by checking cluster coherence
- **Consensus State Classification**: Determining agreement levels based on group size and belief thresholds - critical for decision-making and verified through threshold calculations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Belief Extraction -> Clustering -> Consensus Check -> Update Assignment -> Response Generation -> Consensus Check (loop)

**Critical Path**: The core loop involves belief extraction from responses, clustering to identify opinion groups, consensus state classification, and assignment of collaborators or leaders based on the consensus state.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses temperature 0.7 for decoding to ensure response diversity while maintaining coherence. Employs 3 KMeans clusters to balance between identifying distinct opinions and computational efficiency. Limits iterations to 3 rounds to prevent excessive computation while allowing sufficient convergence time.

**Failure Signatures**: Probability underflow when multiplying many token probabilities, degenerate clustering when agents converge quickly, and incorrect answer sentence extraction leading to wrong belief calculations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test belief calculation on single responses with known probabilities to verify extraction logic
2. Validate clustering implementation by checking if similar responses group together
3. Verify consensus state classification by testing boundary cases (exactly at thresholds)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Belief calculation through token probability multiplication is prone to underflow with long reasoning chains
- The method requires careful tuning of consensus thresholds and clustering parameters
- Performance depends heavily on the quality of the underlying language model and its ability to generate diverse responses

## Confidence
High: The method shows consistent improvements across benchmarks and model sizes
Medium: Some implementation details like exact answer sentence extraction are not fully specified
Low: No significant limitations identified in the confidence assessment

## Next Checks
1. Verify belief calculation handles underflow by testing with log-probabilities and checking if values remain reasonable
2. Validate clustering produces meaningful groups by examining response similarity within clusters
3. Test consensus state classification with synthetic data at threshold boundaries to ensure correct categorization
