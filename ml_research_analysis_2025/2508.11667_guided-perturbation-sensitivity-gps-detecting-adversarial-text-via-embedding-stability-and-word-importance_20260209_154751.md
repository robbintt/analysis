# Guided Perturbation Sensitivity (GPS): Detecting Adversarial Text via Embedding Stability and Word Importance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11667
- Authors: Bryan E. Tuck; Rakesh M. Verma
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GPS detects adversarial text by measuring embedding sensitivity when important words are masked, achieving >85% accuracy across three datasets, three attack types, and two models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Guided Perturbation Sensitivity (GPS), a method for detecting adversarial text by measuring how embedding representations change when important words are masked. GPS ranks words using importance heuristics, measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a BiLSTM detector. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two models, GPS achieves over 85% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational cost.

## Method Summary
GPS detects adversarial text by computing embedding sensitivity scores through strategic word masking. The method ranks words using importance heuristics (gradient attribution, attention, or hybrid), then sequentially masks the top-K words and measures the resulting embedding shift via cosine distance. These sensitivity and importance scores form a 2-feature trace processed by a BiLSTM classifier. The approach requires white-box access for gradient computation but can use surrogate models for black-box scenarios. GPS uses a 2-layer BiLSTM with attention, trained on balanced datasets with early stopping based on validation F1.

## Key Results
- GPS achieves over 85% detection accuracy across three datasets, three attack types, and two models
- Adversarial examples exhibit approximately 2× higher embedding sensitivity to strategic word masking compared to benign text
- Gradient-based ranking significantly outperforms attention, hybrid, and random selection approaches (ρ=0.65) for word-level attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial text exhibits higher embedding instability under targeted masking than benign text.
- Mechanism: Adversarial examples are constructed near decision boundaries, making their embeddings intrinsically less stable; masking key words causes disproportionately larger shifts compared to naturally important words in benign inputs.
- Core assumption: Embedding instability generalizes across architectures and attacks, and is not an artifact of specific datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Adversarially perturbed words exhibit disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words."
  - [section] Table 1 shows adversarial examples have ~1.9× higher sensitivity.
  - [corpus] Related work in "Sharpness-Aware Geometric Defense for Robust Out-Of-Distribution Detection" links adversarial geometry to instability, supporting the theory.
- Break condition: If adversarial examples on a new domain show equal or lower sensitivity than benign text, the core assumption fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gradient-based word ranking more accurately identifies perturbed words for word-level attacks than attention-based or random ranking.
- Mechanism: Gradient attribution captures words that most influence the loss, aligning with how word-level attacks select substitutions; attention rollout can reflect spurious correlations.
- Core assumption: Gradient signals are accessible (white-box) or can be approximated via surrogates in black-box settings without major accuracy loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Gradient-based ranking significantly outperforms attention, hybrid, and random selection approaches (ρ=0.65)."
  - [section] Figure 3 and Table 6 show strong correlation between gradient ranking quality (NDCG) and detection for word-level attacks.
  - [corpus] Limited directly comparable corpus on gradient vs. attention for adversarial ranking; most related work focuses on detection performance, not ranking.
- Break condition: If a new attack paradigm masks gradient signals or uses character-level noise, gradient ranking may degrade (as hinted by DeepWordBug results).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A BiLSTM processing sensitivity-importance traces can classify adversarial vs. benign inputs with competitive accuracy.
- Mechanism: The BiLSTM learns sequential patterns in how sensitivity and importance co-vary across words, capturing attack signatures without requiring explicit attack-specific features.
- Core assumption: The sensitivity-importance trace (Z) provides sufficient signal for the BiLSTM, and training data is representative of deployment conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPS...processes the resulting patterns with a BiLSTM detector."
  - [section] Appendix A details the BiLSTM architecture and training.
  - [corpus] Related methods like TextShield also use LSTMs on gradient-based features, but GPS uses a single BiLSTM on a compact trace.
- Break condition: If the trace dimension (2 features per word) is too limited for a new domain, or if OOD attacks produce unlearned patterns, detection will fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cosine distance between embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Measures embedding shift when a word is masked; core to sensitivity scoring.
  - Quick check question: Can you compute cosine distance between two vectors of different dimensions?

- **Concept: Gradient attribution (saliency)**
  - Why needed here: Ranks words by their contribution to the model's loss; primary heuristic for GPS.
  - Quick check question: Does a higher gradient norm always mean a word is more important for the model's decision?

- **Concept: BiLSTM sequence modeling**
  - Why needed here: Processes the sensitivity-importance trace as a sequence, learning patterns across word positions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference in receptive field between a unidirectional LSTM and a BiLSTM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Reference embedding computation → Importance heuristic ranking → Sequential masking and sensitivity calculation → Trace construction → BiLSTM detector

- **Critical path:** Importance ranking → Masking & sensitivity → Trace construction → BiLSTM prediction. Errors in ranking or sensitivity computation propagate directly to detection.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher K (more masked words) improves detection up to a point but increases cost linearly. The paper recommends K=5-10 as optimal (Section 7).
  - Gradient ranking is most accurate for word-level attacks but requires white-box access; attention can be used for black-box but is less effective (Section 3.2, 6).
  - BiLSTM detector is lightweight (~257k parameters) but may underfit complex domains; larger models could improve accuracy at higher cost (Appendix A).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Random or attention-based ranking for word-level attacks (lower accuracy per Table 3).
  - Large drop in detection when transferring from weaker to stronger attacks (e.g., DWB → BA in Table 4).
  - No correlation between NDCG and accuracy for IMDB or DeepWordBug (Tables 5-6), suggesting domain or attack-specific mechanisms not captured by current heuristics.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate core mechanism: On a held-out validation set, compare mean sensitivity of adversarial vs. benign samples; expect ~1.9× ratio as in Table 1. If not observed, re-examine data generation or model access.
  2. Ranking ablation: Compare gradient vs. attention vs. random ranking on NDCG@20 and detection accuracy for each attack type; expect gradient to dominate for word-level attacks (Figures 3, 8-13).
  3. Transfer test: Train BiLSTM on one dataset/attack/model and test on another; verify generalization gaps align with Table 4. Large drops indicate need for diversified training or heuristic adaptation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the number of masked words ($K$) be dynamically adapted based on input characteristics to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and computational cost?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work should explore adaptive selection of K based on input characteristics."
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a fixed $K=20$ after ablation studies, but the optimal number likely varies by text length or complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that adjusts $K$ per sample and demonstrates maintained accuracy with reduced average computation time compared to fixed-$K$ baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do ensemble strategies combining gradient and attention heuristics improve detection performance across both word-level and character-level attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes "ensemble strategies combining gradient and attention heuristics to capture both word-level and character-level attack signatures."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluated heuristics individually, finding gradients best for word-level attacks but attention sometimes competitive for character-level attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A fused model that weights gradient and attention signals differently based on the attack type or dataset, showing superior aggregate performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does GPS performance degrade when relying on surrogate models for gradient estimation in strictly black-box settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology notes that gradient attribution requires "white-box access" and mentions "surrogate-based saliency can substitute in black-box settings," but all experiments utilized white-box access.
- Why unresolved: The efficacy of the best-performing heuristic (Gradient Attribution) is unproven without direct model access, a common constraint in real-world deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of GPS detection accuracy when gradients are derived from a surrogate model (e.g., DistilBERT) rather than the target victim model.

## Limitations

- The core assumption that adversarial examples exhibit consistently higher embedding instability may not generalize to novel attack paradigms or domains with different embedding geometries
- The reliance on gradient-based word ranking assumes white-box access or effective surrogate modeling; performance degrades for character-level attacks like DeepWordBug
- The 2-feature trace processed by the BiLSTM may be insufficient to capture complex attack signatures in some domains, limiting detection accuracy

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Detection accuracy claims (>85%) are well-supported by multiple datasets and attack types (Table 1, Table 3). The ranking superiority of gradient over attention is clearly demonstrated (Figure 3, Table 6, ρ=0.65).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that adversarial examples are ~2× more sensitive than benign text (Table 1) is robust within tested conditions but may not generalize to unseen domains or stronger attacks.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization to unseen attacks or models without retraining is asserted but only tested for a limited set of configurations; no ablation on training set diversity or size is provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Embedding Stability Cross-Domain Test**: Generate adversarial examples on a novel domain (e.g., biomedical text) and measure the sensitivity ratio between adversarial and benign samples. Verify that the ~2× sensitivity gap persists; if not, investigate embedding geometry or attack strategy differences.

2. **Gradient Ranking Robustness**: Apply GPS to character-level attacks (e.g., TextBugger) and compare gradient-based vs. random ranking for perturbation identification. If gradient ranking degrades significantly, assess whether a hybrid or alternative ranking heuristic is needed.

3. **Trace Dimensionality Ablation**: Replace the 2-feature trace (sensitivity, importance) with a higher-dimensional variant (e.g., include attention weights or embedding norms) and retrain the BiLSTM. Measure any accuracy gains, especially on complex or OOD domains, to test the sufficiency of the current trace design.
