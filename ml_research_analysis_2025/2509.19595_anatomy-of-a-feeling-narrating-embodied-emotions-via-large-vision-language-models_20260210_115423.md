# Anatomy of a Feeling: Narrating Embodied Emotions via Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.19595
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19595
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Zero-shot LVLM framework ELENA generates multi-layered embodied emotion narratives, outperforming naive prompts by up to 15.6 F1-points under face-masking.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ELENA, a zero-shot framework that uses structured prompting with large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate multi-layered narratives describing embodied emotions in images. The approach produces emotion labels, explicit bodily descriptions, implicit sensations, and a narrative, going beyond standard classification. Experiments across three datasets show ELENA consistently outperforms naive emotion prompts, achieving up to 15.6 F1-point gains under face-masking conditions. Attention analysis reveals that LVLMs exhibit persistent facial bias and fail to adaptively redirect attention to informative body regions when faces are obscured. The method demonstrates robust embodied emotion recognition, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LVLMs in capturing non-facial emotional cues.

## Method Summary
ELENA employs a single, unified structured prompt that generates emotion labels, explicit bodily descriptions, implicit sensations, narratives, and body part lists simultaneously from images. The framework uses state-of-the-art LVLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) with face masking via YuNet (int8 quantized OpenCV, 0.5 confidence threshold). Outputs are parsed as JSON containing Label, Explicit, Implicit, Narrative, and Body Parts fields. The method operates in zero-shot mode without fine-tuning, relying on the model's pre-trained knowledge of body-language semantics activated through structured output constraints.

## Key Results
- ELENA achieves 15.6 F1-point gains over naive prompts when faces are masked on face-masked datasets
- Unified generation outperforms two-stage pipelines (description + classification) across all metrics
- LVLMs exhibit persistent facial attention bias, failing to adaptively focus on body regions when faces are obscured
- "Disgust" emotions are frequently misclassified or refused due to safety filters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Structured, multi-layered prompting forces LVLMs to activate latent knowledge of non-facial cues that are otherwise ignored by generic classification prompts.
- **Mechanism:** The ELENA framework constrains the output space to specific components (Explicit bodily descriptions, Implicit sensations, Body Parts). By forcing the model to generate text describing *why* a body part signals emotion (e.g., "slumped shoulders"), the model effectively performs a Chain-of-Thought process that grounds the final emotion label in physical evidence rather than superficial facial recognition.
- **Core assumption:** LVLMs possess pre-trained knowledge of body-language semantics but fail to prioritize these features without explicit instructions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA)... [comprising] descriptions that focus on the salient body parts."
  - [Section 3.2] "In the narrative response... we use words like 'scene' or 'story' to encourage a portrayal-style explanation... allowing the model to come up with the reasoning."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Face masking acts as a stress test that reveals a "visual rigidness" in LVLMs, which structured prompting can only partially compensate for via textual reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** When faces are masked, the LVLM's visual attention mechanism fails to adapt; it continues attending to the masked region (attention sink) rather than redistributing focus to limbs. The ELENA prompt compensates not by fixing the visual attention, but by forcing the language model to rely on whatever peripheral visual signals are available to fulfill the complex structured output requirement.
- **Core assumption:** The performance gain comes from the text decoder's ability to infer emotion from limited bodily context, overriding the vision encoder's failure to find features.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.3] "...the model either continues to direct attention toward the masked facial region... or it diverts attention away from the face entirely without increasing focus on alternative emotional indicators."
  - [abstract] "...LVLMs exhibit persistent facial bias and fail to adaptively redirect attention to informative body regions when faces are obscured."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Unified, single-pass generation yields better embodied recognition than separating description and classification.
- **Mechanism:** Generating the narrative and the label simultaneously allows the model to maintain semantic consistency between the physical description and the abstract emotion label. If the description "hands trembling" is generated, the probability of the label "Fear" increases in the same forward pass.
- **Core assumption:** Joint optimization of the output tokens creates a self-reinforcing signal between the visual evidence and the emotion taxonomy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section C] "ELENA achieves notably higher prediction metrics than the two-stage pipeline... unified structured generation outperforms sequential processing."
  - [Section 3.2] "ELENA employs a single, unified prompt that generates emotion labels, descriptions, and narratives simultaneously... ensuring a coherent and jointly reasoned output."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Embodied Cognition (in Vision)
  - **Why needed here:** Standard emotion recognition is face-centric. You must understand that "posture, gesture, and physiological change are integral to emotional meaning" (Section 1) to interpret ELENA's outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish a "happy" body from a "sad" body when the head is removed from the image?

- **Concept:** Attention Sinks / Facial Bias in Transformers
  - **Why needed here:** To diagnose why ELENA outperforms naive baselines. You need to know that models like Llama "exhibit a pronounced bias toward facial features" (Section 4.3) to understand why masking creates such a performance drop.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a vision model look at a black mask instead of a visible arm?

- **Concept:** Structured Prompting (JSON/Schema enforcement)
  - **Why needed here:** ELENA relies on strict output formatting (Label, Explicit, Implicit, Narrative).
  - **Quick check question:** Why is enforcing a JSON schema better for evaluation than asking for an open-ended story?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Processor -> Prompt Constructor -> LVLM Engine -> Output Parser
- **Critical path:** The prompt design. The system prompt must explicitly define the task as "embodied emotion recognition" and forbid relying on facial cues to achieve the specific gains seen in the paper.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Gemini 2.5 Flash vs. Llama-3.2**: Gemini shows higher F1 (Table 2), but Llama is open-weight, allowing for attention map visualization (Section 3.4). You trade performance for interpretability if you choose Llama.
  - **YuNet Masking**: Complete occlusion is more rigorous but leaves "little to no information" in some datasets (Section 4.2), leading to "Neutral" classification collapse.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Disgust" Collapse:** The model frequently misclassifies "Disgust" as Fear or Surprise (Section 4.4) or refuses to answer due to safety filters.
  - **Context Ambiguity:** In datasets like EMOTIC, if the subject is distant, masking the face causes the model to predict "Neutral" because the body is too small to provide distinct posture cues (Section 4.2).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline vs. Structured:** Run the Naive Prompt (Figure 9) vs. ELENA Prompt (Figure 11) on HECO subset to verify the 3.9-14.6 F1 gap.
  2. **Face Masking Ablation:** Run inference on BESST (face-masked dataset) to confirm that ELENA maintains >50 F1 while naive prompts crash.
  3. **Attention Visualization:** Use Llama-3.2-11B to generate heatmaps on a masked image. Verify that the model attends to the mask (failure mode) versus the body, proving the need for the text-based workaround.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can fine-tuning with redirected attention mechanisms effectively correct the facial bias identified in LVLMs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors conclude that the "attention adaptation failure" documented in their analysis "warrants further investigation" and suggests "fine-tuning with redirected attention mechanisms" as a specific solution.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study uses zero-shot structured prompting to compensate for model limitations, but it does not alter the model's intrinsic architecture or training to fix the underlying attention deficit.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study fine-tuning LVLMs with specific loss functions that penalize facial attention, demonstrating improved adaptive focus on body regions when faces are obscured.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do ELENA-generated narratives benefit downstream applications like human-robot interaction?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The limitations section states, "ELENA-generated narratives could benefit downstream applications such as emotion recognition, conversational agents, or human-robot interaction. We view this as an important direction for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses solely on the generation quality and classification accuracy of the narratives themselves, without integrating them into external systems to test utility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integration of ELENA outputs into a conversational agent or robot, showing improved user satisfaction or task success rates compared to standard emotion labels.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does evaluation on a dataset strictly curated for embodied expressions improve the reliability of model assessments?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors argue that current datasets contain "ambiguous or unsuitable examples" where emotions are inferred from context rather than bodily cues, leading to "unreliable" performance metrics.
- **Why unresolved:** Without a dataset that isolates embodied expressions from contextual cues, it remains difficult to distinguish genuine model failures from data ambiguity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluating models on a qualitatively filtered dataset containing only clear bodily expressions, resulting in higher, more consistent correlation between predicted and ground-truth embodied emotions.

## Limitations

- Performance degrades significantly when body parts are small or occluded, with models defaulting to "Neutral" classifications
- Safety filters cause systematic refusal to label "Disgust" emotions, creating data gaps
- The approach assumes bodies carry sufficient emotional signal, which may not hold across cultures or ambiguous contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Structured prompting outperforms naive baselines (15.6 F1-point gains on face-masked data) and unified generation beats sequential processing
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism claim that LVLMs possess latent body-language knowledge but need explicit prompting to access it
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that attention sinks are the primary cause of performance degradation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Cultural Generalization Test:** Evaluate ELENA on datasets from cultures with different body-emotion mapping norms (e.g., East Asian vs. Western body language patterns) to verify that the approach generalizes beyond the primarily Western datasets used here.

2. **Attention Intervention Experiment:** Implement a visual attention intervention that explicitly forces the model to attend to body regions when faces are masked, then compare whether this improves performance beyond structured prompting alone.

3. **Safety Filter Bypass Validation:** Test whether fine-tuning on "Disgust" examples or using alternative LVLM architectures can overcome safety filter refusals, determining if this is a fundamental limitation or implementation artifact.
