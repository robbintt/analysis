core_contribution: This paper identifies a critical limitation in multimodal large
  language models (MLLMs) called "Contextual Blindness," where models fail to perceive
  fine-grained visual details due to structural disconnect between isolated high-fidelity
  regions and broader global context. The authors propose Visual Funnel, a training-free
  two-step approach that first performs contextual anchoring to identify regions of
  interest, then constructs an entropy-scaled portfolio that preserves hierarchical
  context through dynamically determined crop sizes based on attention entropy.

# Visual Funnel: Resolving Contextual Blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10362
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10362
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Visual Funnel resolves Contextual Blindness by constructing hierarchical context portfolios, achieving up to +16.4 points over baselines on detail-oriented tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies "Contextual Blindness" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where fine-grained visual details are missed due to structural disconnect between isolated high-fidelity regions and broader global context. The authors propose Visual Funnel, a training-free two-step approach that first identifies regions of interest through contextual anchoring, then constructs entropy-scaled portfolios preserving hierarchical context through dynamically determined crop sizes. Experiments across seven benchmarks show significant improvements over naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines, with the most substantial gains on detail-oriented tasks. The results validate that hierarchical structure, rather than simply adding more unstructured crops, is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

## Method Summary
Visual Funnel addresses Contextual Blindness through a two-step process: (1) Contextual Anchoring extracts attention maps from the MLLM using a localization prompt, then normalizes these maps to identify regions of interest; (2) Entropy-Scaled Portfolio Generation creates three hierarchical crops (focal, immediate, broader context) with sizes determined by attention entropy, ensuring graduated contextual bridges between detail and global context. The method is training-free and applies to any MLLM with accessible cross-attention weights, though implementation details vary by architecture.

## Key Results
- Visual Funnel achieves up to +16.4 points improvement over baselines on detail-oriented tasks
- Hierarchical portfolios outperform both single-crop and unstructured multi-crop approaches
- K=3 crops is optimal; K=4 triggers "redundancy penalty" degrading performance
- Method shows consistent gains across seven benchmarks (TextVQA, DocVQA, InfoVQA, GQA, POPE, A-OKVQA, VQAv2)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Context Bridging
The paper argues Contextual Blindness arises from structural disconnect between focal detail and global context. Visual Funnel constructs a three-level portfolio (focal → immediate context → broader context) that provides intermediate-scale representations, with each crop hierarchically refined based on attention within the parent region. MLLMs require graduated contextual bridges to integrate information across disparate scales when intermediate context is absent.

### Mechanism 2: Attention Entropy as Contextual Uncertainty Signal
Attention entropy directly correlates with contextual requirements—low entropy indicates confident localization needing minimal context; high entropy suggests ambiguity requiring broader context. The method computes normalized Shannon entropy over spatial attention, then maps it to expansion factors α₁ ∈ [1.2, 1.8] and α₂ ∈ [1.6, 2.8], ensuring minimal expansion even for confident attention while allowing aggressive expansion for uncertain cases.

### Mechanism 3: Redundancy Penalty from Unstructured Information
Adding more unstructured crops provides limited or detrimental benefits because MLLM attention mechanisms can be overwhelmed by repetitive, non-hierarchical information. The paper demonstrates that ViCrop (Top-3) selecting three non-overlapping high-attention regions actually degrades performance, confirming that information structure matters more than quantity for compositional reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cross-attention extraction from MLLMs** - Why needed: Visual Funnel extracts attention weights A(I,q) from the backbone LLM's final layer. Quick check: Given an MLLM with a Q-Former connector, how would you establish spatial correspondence between LLM attention and image patches?

- **Concept: Shannon entropy over probability distributions** - Why needed: The method normalizes attention maps to probability distributions then computes entropy to quantify uncertainty. Quick check: What does H_norm → 1 indicate about the attention distribution, and how should crop expansion respond?

- **Concept: Vision token compression in MLLMs** - Why needed: The paper identifies that MLLMs inherently compress visual information into fixed tokens, creating structural bottlenecks for fine-grained perception. Quick check: How many visual tokens does LLaVA-1.5-7B produce from a 336×336 input, and why does this bottleneck small detail perception?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Image + Question) → Step 1: Contextual Anchoring → Step 2: Entropy-Scaled Portfolio Generation → Final Input: Original image + 3 crops → MLLM → Answer

- **Critical path:** The attention extraction correctness determines everything downstream. If A_norm mislocalizes the region, all subsequent crops will be off-target.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Latency vs. accuracy: ~2× inference time for ~10% accuracy gain on detail-oriented tasks. Fixed vs. adaptive expansion: Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis shows stable performance across reasonable ranges. Portfolio size K=3 is optimal; K=4 triggers redundancy penalty.

- **Failure signatures:** Complete mislocalization if MLLM fails to localize ROI in Step 1; multi-focal queries not handled; attention map noise leads to unreliable entropy scaling.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce attention extraction pipeline: Run Contextual Anchoring on GQA subset and visualize A_norm overlays to verify localization accuracy.
  2. Ablate entropy sensitivity: Compare static (γ=0) vs. adaptive on DocVQA subset to validate entropy-guided scaling provides measurable gain.
  3. Quantify redundancy penalty: Compare ViCrop (Top-3) vs. Visual Funnel with identical token budgets on TextVQA to confirm structural hierarchy matters more than quantity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can Visual Funnel be extended to handle queries requiring simultaneous reasoning across multiple spatially distinct focal regions? The current approach is designed for single regions of interest and may not suit complex queries requiring synthesis from multiple, spatially distinct focal points.

**Open Question 2:** What mechanisms could reduce the 2× inference latency overhead while preserving accuracy gains? The method requires two forward passes and processes multiple visual tokens, creating latency concerns in time-sensitive scenarios.

**Open Question 3:** How robust is Visual Funnel when the initial attention map incorrectly localizes the region of interest? The effectiveness is predicated on reasonably accurate initial attention maps, and complete failure to localize compromises portfolio quality.

## Limitations

- Method is designed for single-region queries and may not handle complex questions requiring synthesis from multiple spatially distinct focal points simultaneously
- 2× inference latency overhead could be problematic in latency-sensitive scenarios
- Effectiveness depends on reasonably accurate initial attention maps; complete failure to localize compromises portfolio quality

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The hierarchical portfolio structure demonstrably improves performance over single-crop baselines with consistent gains across seven benchmarks.

**Medium confidence:** The entropy-based adaptive scaling provides measurable improvements over static cropping, but benefits may vary with attention map quality and task characteristics.

**Low confidence:** Claims about the redundancy penalty being a fundamental limitation of unstructured multi-crop approaches are not well-supported, with limited validation beyond ViCrop comparisons.

## Next Checks

1. **Attention extraction verification:** Implement the attention extraction pipeline on a small validation set (e.g., 100 GQA samples) and visualize the resulting attention maps. Verify that A_norm correctly localizes regions relevant to the question before implementing portfolio generation.

2. **Entropy sensitivity ablation:** Systematically compare static cropping (γ=0, fixed expansion factors) against the proposed adaptive entropy scaling on DocVQA subset. Vary the entropy sensitivity parameter γ to identify ranges where entropy-based expansion provides consistent gains versus when it overfits to noise.

3. **Multi-task redundancy analysis:** Conduct experiments varying crop counts (K=2,3,4,5) across different task types (detail-oriented vs. compositional reasoning) to test whether the redundancy penalty is universal or task-dependent, and identify optimal portfolio sizes for different VQA categories.
