- This paper addresses brand bias in text-to-image models by introducing CIDER, a model-agnostic framework that refines prompts at inference time to reduce commercial brand dominance without requiring costly retraining.

## Executive Summary
CIDER addresses the pervasive problem of brand bias in text-to-image (T2I) models, where commercial brands often dominate image generation even for generic prompts. The authors propose a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that operates at inference time, refining prompts to reduce brand dominance without the need for expensive retraining. CIDER leverages a detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives, achieving significant reductions in both explicit and implicit brand bias across four leading T2I models while maintaining image quality.

## Method Summary
CIDER introduces a novel approach to mitigate brand bias in T2I models through prompt refinement at inference time. The framework consists of a lightweight branded content detector that identifies potential brand references in prompts, and a VLM that generates stylistically divergent alternatives to reduce brand dominance. A key innovation is the Brand Neutrality Score (BNS), a quantitative metric designed to measure brand bias in generated images. CIDER operates as a plug-in solution, requiring no modifications to the underlying T2I models, and demonstrates effectiveness across multiple state-of-the-art models including Imagen 4, FLUX, SDXL, and Seedream 3.0.

## Key Results
- CIDER achieves up to 63.4% improvement in Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) across four leading T2I models
- Outperforms negative prompting baselines in reducing both explicit and implicit brand bias
- Maintains image quality while effectively mitigating brand bias at inference time without requiring model retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CIDER's effectiveness stems from its causal intervention approach at the prompt level. By detecting branded content early and generating stylistically divergent alternatives through a VLM, the framework breaks the causal chain that leads to brand-dominated outputs. The lightweight detector ensures minimal computational overhead, while the VLM's ability to understand and generate stylistically diverse content allows for nuanced prompt refinement. This approach addresses both explicit brand mentions and implicit brand associations that might otherwise go undetected.

## Foundational Learning

**Brand Bias Detection**: Understanding how commercial brands dominate T2I outputs even for generic prompts. Why needed: Establishes the scope and severity of the problem being addressed. Quick check: Compare brand frequency in generic vs. brand-specific prompts.

**Vision-Language Models**: Models that can understand visual concepts and generate text descriptions. Why needed: Core component for generating stylistically divergent alternatives. Quick check: Evaluate VLM's ability to rephrase prompts while preserving semantic meaning.

**Prompt Refinement**: The process of modifying text prompts to achieve desired generation outcomes. Why needed: Central mechanism for CIDER's intervention. Quick check: Measure prompt similarity before and after refinement.

**Brand Neutrality Scoring**: Quantitative metrics to measure brand bias in generated images. Why needed: Provides objective evaluation of CIDER's effectiveness. Quick check: Validate BNS against human judgment of brand presence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Prompt -> Brand Detector -> VLM Refiner -> Modified Prompt -> T2I Model

**Critical Path**: The brand detector must accurately identify branded content, the VLM must generate appropriate alternatives, and the modified prompt must successfully reduce brand bias in the final image.

**Design Tradeoffs**: CIDER prioritizes inference-time efficiency over comprehensive bias elimination, accepting potential false positives/negatives from the detector to maintain real-time performance. The framework trades model accuracy for computational efficiency and deployment flexibility.

**Failure Signatures**: False positives from the detector lead to unnecessary prompt modifications; false negatives allow brand bias to persist; VLM failures result in semantically broken prompts; T2I model resistance may limit effectiveness of refined prompts.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test brand detector accuracy on a diverse set of prompts with known brand references
2. Evaluate VLM's ability to generate stylistically divergent alternatives for branded prompts
3. Measure BNS improvements on a benchmark dataset before and after CIDER application

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness bounded by accuracy of branded content detector and VLM's generation capabilities
- Generalizability to other T2I models and domains remains untested
- BNS metric may not capture all aspects of brand bias, particularly subtle or context-dependent associations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: CIDER effectively reduces explicit and implicit brand bias while maintaining image quality, supported by quantitative improvements across multiple models and metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: CIDER outperforms negative prompting baselines, though comparison is based on limited experiments and may not generalize to all prompting strategies.

**Low Confidence**: Long-term robustness of CIDER against evolving brand bias patterns in T2I models, as temporal stability and adaptability to new brands were not evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Test CIDER's performance on additional T2I models and domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct user studies to evaluate perceptual impact of CIDER's modifications on image quality and brand neutrality
3. Benchmark CIDER against broader range of bias mitigation techniques, including those involving fine-tuning or retraining, to establish relative efficacy
