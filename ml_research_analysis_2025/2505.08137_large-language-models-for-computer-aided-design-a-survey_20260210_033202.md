# Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.08137
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08137
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First comprehensive review of LLM applications in CAD workflows

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines the emerging intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD), documenting how LLMs are being integrated into CAD workflows across six primary application areas. The review reveals that while LLMs show promise for automating and enhancing CAD processes, most current approaches generate intermediate representations like Python scripts or JSON files rather than direct 3D models. GPT-4o and GPT-4 dominate the landscape, with manufacturing as the primary industry focus, though applications in home design, building compliance, and fashion are gaining traction.

## Method Summary
The survey conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on English-language publications from the past five years, identifying 40 relevant references that document LLM applications in CAD contexts. The authors systematically classified approaches based on their primary application areas (data generation, code generation, parametric CAD generation, image generation, model evaluation, and text generation), the types of multimodal inputs used, the models employed, and the target industries. This classification framework enables systematic comparison across different approaches and highlights both current trends and future research opportunities in the field.

## Key Results
- LLMs predominantly generate intermediate representations (Python scripts, JSON) rather than direct 3D models in CAD workflows
- GPT-4o and GPT-4 are the most frequently used models in LLM-CAD applications
- Manufacturing is the primary industry focus, with growing applications in home design, building compliance, and fashion design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LLMs in CAD workflows stems from their ability to process multimodal inputs (text, images, 3D models) and generate structured outputs that can be translated into CAD operations. LLMs excel at understanding natural language specifications and converting them into executable code or configuration files that drive CAD software. Their pattern recognition capabilities enable automation of repetitive tasks like dimension checking, code generation, and model evaluation. The multimodal nature of modern LLMs allows them to interpret design requirements from various input formats and generate appropriate intermediate representations that bridge the gap between human intent and CAD software requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal LLM architectures**: Why needed - To process diverse input types (text, images, 3D models) common in CAD workflows; Quick check - Verify model supports vision and image input capabilities
- **Intermediate representation generation**: Why needed - Current LLMs cannot directly output executable 3D models; Quick check - Confirm approach generates Python scripts, JSON, or similar structured outputs
- **CAD software APIs and scripting**: Why needed - To understand how generated code interfaces with existing CAD tools; Quick check - Review documentation for target CAD software's automation capabilities
- **Parametric modeling concepts**: Why needed - Many CAD tasks involve parameter-based design variations; Quick check - Verify understanding of constraint systems and parameter relationships
- **Natural language processing for technical specifications**: Why needed - Converting human requirements into CAD instructions requires precise language understanding; Quick check - Test model's ability to parse technical dimensions and specifications

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: User Input -> Multimodal LLM -> Intermediate Representation -> CAD Software -> 3D Model

**Critical path**: The flow from user specification through the LLM to intermediate representation generation represents the most critical path, as errors here propagate through the entire pipeline. The quality of multimodal understanding and the precision of generated code determine success.

**Design tradeoffs**: Direct 3D generation versus intermediate representation generation represents a fundamental tradeoff. While direct generation would be more elegant, intermediate representations offer better compatibility with existing CAD tools and more predictable output formats. Model choice involves balancing capability (GPT-4) against cost and accessibility.

**Failure signatures**: Common failures include misinterpretation of technical specifications, generation of syntactically correct but semantically invalid code, inability to handle complex geometric constraints, and poor performance on domain-specific terminology. Visual hallucination and incorrect dimension scaling are particularly problematic in CAD contexts.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Test LLM's ability to generate Python scripts for basic geometric primitives (cubes, cylinders) from text descriptions
2. Evaluate multimodal understanding by providing sketches and asking for dimensioned CAD specifications
3. Assess code generation quality by comparing LLM-generated scripts against manually written equivalents for parametric models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Literature review focuses on English-language publications from the past five years, potentially missing relevant work in other languages or earlier foundational research
- Classification scheme may oversimplify nuanced differences between approaches, particularly in multimodal input handling
- Emphasis on GPT-4o and GPT-4 usage may reflect recency bias rather than true prevalence across all LLM-based CAD research

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LLMs predominantly generate intermediate representations rather than direct 3D models - well-supported by surveyed literature and represents clear technical pattern
- **Medium Confidence**: Manufacturing is the primary industry focus - reasonable but may underrepresent emerging applications lacking published case studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Identified future research opportunities are based on current gaps but may not anticipate rapid field evolution

## Next Checks
1. Validate completeness of literature search by checking for significant LLM-CAD publications outside selected timeframe and language scope
2. Conduct systematic analysis of intermediate representation generation methods to quantify prevalence and compare effectiveness
3. Survey CAD practitioners to assess which identified future opportunities align with actual industry needs and implementation challenges
