# HIKMA: Human-Inspired Knowledge by Machine Agents through a Multi-Agent Framework for Semi-Autonomous Scientific Conferences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21370
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21370
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI-generated scholarly conference with 30 accepted papers, automated review, revision, and avatar presentations

## Executive Summary
HIKMA introduces a semi-autonomous scholarly communication framework that automates the full research lifecycle from dataset intake to archival dissemination. The system integrates AI agents across manuscript generation, dual peer review, revision, and presentation creation while maintaining transparency through audit trails and version control. An experiment with 60 AI-generated manuscripts demonstrated operational efficiency with 30 papers accepted, though quality assessments relied on automated scoring rather than independent human validation.

## Method Summary
HIKMA uses AI Scholar Frontier to orchestrate a sequential pipeline: dataset registration with metadata extraction, prompt reverse-engineering from metadata for manuscript generation, dual AI reviewer evaluation using complementary prompts, automated LaTeX revision with change highlighting, and dissemination via slide synthesis and avatar narration. The framework emphasizes traceability through centralized governance workbooks, cryptographic hashing at archival, and structured prompts to control output quality. Evaluation tracks throughput, turnaround times, and human-in-the-loop requirements while acknowledging limitations in measuring scholarly value and interpretability.

## Key Results
- 30 of 60 AI-generated manuscripts accepted through automated review process
- Operational pipeline achieved complete automation from dataset intake to avatar-based presentation
- Implementation of traceable audit trails, version control, and reproducible governance mechanisms
- Demonstrated efficiency in throughput and turnaround time while maintaining scholarly rigor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Prompt Derivation from Dataset Metadata
- Claim: Manuscript quality improves when generation prompts are reverse-engineered from dataset metadata rather than generated freely.
- Mechanism: The system parses dataset metadata (title, description, variable names, documentation) → extracts semantic cues → constructs section-specific prompt templates (abstract, methodology, results) → locks prompts before execution → generates manuscript with structural constraints.
- Core assumption: Dataset metadata contains sufficient semantic information to infer meaningful research questions and methodological approaches.
- Evidence anchors: "For each dataset, the metadata fields—such as title, description, variable names, column headers, and accompanying documentation—were parsed to extract semantic and contextual cues. These extracted features were then reverse-engineered into prompt templates."
- Break condition: Datasets with minimal or uninformative metadata produce incoherent methodological narratives.

### Mechanism 2: Complementary Dual-Reviewer Architecture
- Claim: Two AI reviewers with opposing evaluation philosophies produce more balanced assessments than single-reviewer configurations.
- Mechanism: Reviewer 1 uses "comprehensive scientific peer review" prompt (constructive, methodological focus) → Reviewer 2 uses "rigorous critical review" prompt (skeptical, adversarial stance) → both executed on independent model instances → scores aggregated for accept/revise/reject decision.
- Core assumption: Prompt diversity translates to evaluation diversity; independent instantiation prevents cross-contamination.
- Evidence anchors: "Reviewer 1 emphasized a in-depth, constructive analysis grounded in methodological correctness and clarity, while Reviewer 2 provided adversarial, conceptually skeptical feedback aimed at uncovering weaknesses and overstated claims."
- Break condition: Automated reviewers converge toward "formulaic commentary without periodic recalibration."

### Mechanism 3: Traceability Through Centralized Governance Ledger
- Claim: A structured tracking workbook spanning all pipeline stages enables post-hoc auditing and reproducibility verification.
- Mechanism: Each artifact (dataset, manuscript, review, revision, presentation) receives unique identifier → logged in multi-sheet tracking workbook with timestamps, model versions, license status → cryptographic hashes computed at archival → release manifest enables integrity verification.
- Core assumption: Manual logging discipline is maintained; workbook schema captures all relevant provenance attributes.
- Evidence anchors: "The tracking workbook, organized into thematic sheets corresponding to conference tracks, acted as the governance ledger that tied together datasets, manuscripts, reviews, revisions, presentations, and final archival outputs."
- Break condition: Human logging errors break traceability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-Agent Role Specialization**
  - Why needed here: HIKMA assigns distinct roles (author, reviewer, reviser, presenter) to different agent configurations rather than using a single monolithic agent
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 use different prompts rather than running the same prompt twice?

- Concept: **LLM Prompt Constraint Engineering**
  - Why needed here: The system uses section-specific directives, formatting constraints (no bullet lists, continuous prose), and locked prompts to control output structure
  - Quick check question: What happens to output quality if prompts are not locked before execution?

- Concept: **Provenance Chains in Automated Workflows**
  - Why needed here: Every output must be traceable to its input (dataset → manuscript → review → revision → presentation) for audit integrity
  - Quick check question: If a manuscript's dataset source is lost, which governance properties break?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Registry → Prompt Synthesis → Manuscript Generator → Dual Reviewers → Revision Engine → Response Letter Generator → Camera-Ready Formatter → Slide Synthesizer → Avatar Renderer (HeyGen) → Hash Registry → Archival → Public Release

- Critical path: Dataset registration → prompt synthesis → manuscript generation → dual review → revision loop → camera-ready → presentation → archival. Any failure in this chain prevents final acceptance.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Automation depth vs. interpretive quality: Full automation risks "loss of interpretive depth and contextual understanding that define scholarly judgment"
  - Fictional authorship vs. attribution clarity: Using fictional names preserves narrative consistency but doesn't "establish intellectual responsibility or accountability"
  - Closed platform (AI Scholar Frontier) vs. reproducibility: External reproducibility "remains limited by differences in model configurations, dataset licensing, and system dependencies"

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucination in revisions (content not grounded in registered dataset)
  - Reviewer convergence to formulaic feedback (detected through homogenized commentary patterns)
  - Metadata incompleteness propagation (poor dataset documentation → weak methodological sections)
  - License/privacy compliance gaps (automated checks cannot "detect all possible misuse of sensitive material")

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-dataset end-to-end run: Register one well-documented Kaggle dataset, trace its progression through all stages, verify hash integrity at archival
  2. Reviewer convergence test: Generate 10 manuscripts, run dual reviewers, measure score variance and feedback distinctiveness across iterations
  3. Metadata quality sensitivity: Compare manuscript quality (via hallucination checks) for datasets with rich vs. minimal documentation to quantify break condition thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can evaluation frameworks for AI-generated research capture "scholarly value" and "interpretive quality" rather than just structural compliance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that current measures like readability and citation integrity are "insufficient for measuring interpretive quality or scholarly value."
- Why unresolved: Longitudinal metrics, such as citation uptake and community validation, are difficult to simulate in an automated pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated rubric or automated tool capable of scoring the novelty and conceptual contribution of a manuscript independent of human peer review.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What governance frameworks are required to establish intellectual ownership and accountability for fully AI-generated manuscripts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while transparency mechanisms exist, "determining ownership of AI-generated manuscripts... remains a policy-level issue."
- Why unresolved: Current academic standards rely on human legal responsibility, which AI agents cannot fulfill.
- What evidence would resolve it: The adoption of a standardized policy by a major indexing service or publisher defining liability and credit for autonomous agents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific interventions in model calibration are necessary to mitigate cultural and linguistic bias in automated scholarly outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors admit that "linguistic and cultural biases inherent in large language models" influence outputs and that ensuring equitable representation is "still unresolved."
- Why unresolved: The underlying training data distributions of LLMs naturally favor dominant cultural norms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing statistically equivalent quality and cultural representation in AI papers generated across diverse linguistic datasets versus standard corpora.

## Limitations

- Major dependency on AI Scholar Frontier, a proprietary system whose internal architecture and hallucination detection mechanisms are not publicly specified
- Quality assessment relies on automated scoring without independent human validation
- Claims about automated hallucination detection lack sufficient methodological detail for independent verification

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The structured governance framework with audit trails, version control, and cryptographic hashing is well-specified and implementable independently
- **Medium Confidence**: The dual-reviewer architecture with complementary evaluation philosophies is clearly described, though effectiveness of prompt diversity remains empirically unproven
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about automated hallucination detection and verification against source datasets lack sufficient methodological detail

## Next Checks

1. Implement the dual-reviewer prompt architecture on publicly available LLM APIs to measure convergence patterns and feedback distinctiveness across 10+ manuscripts
2. Conduct a metadata quality sensitivity analysis comparing manuscript outputs from datasets with rich versus minimal documentation to quantify break condition thresholds
3. Develop a standalone hallucination detection module that verifies statistical claims and figure descriptions against raw dataset values, then validate against the paper's methodology
