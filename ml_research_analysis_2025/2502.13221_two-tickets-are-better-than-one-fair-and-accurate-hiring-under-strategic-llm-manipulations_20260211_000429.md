# Two Tickets are Better than One: Fair and Accurate Hiring Under Strategic LLM Manipulations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.13221
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13221
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes "two-ticket" scheme where hirer applies own LLM manipulation to resumes, improving fairness and accuracy by reducing TPR disparities between groups with different LLM access.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness and accuracy issues in hiring when candidates use generative AI to improve resumes, leading to unequal outcomes due to different access to LLM models. The authors propose a "two-ticket" scheme where the hiring algorithm applies its own LLM manipulation to each resume and considers both the original and manipulated versions, improving both fairness and accuracy. They also generalize this to an n-ticket scheme, proving convergence to a group-independent decision. Experiments with real resumes and an open-source ATS tool show improved true positive rates and reduced disparities between groups using the two-ticket method.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses hiring fairness when candidates strategically manipulate resumes using LLMs, creating disparities between privileged (better LLM access) and unprivileged groups. The proposed two-ticket scheme has the hirer apply their own LLM manipulation to each submitted resume and consider both original and manipulated versions. They generalize to n-ticket schemes proving exponential convergence to group-independent outcomes. The method is validated using 520 real resumes, multiple LLM quality tiers, and an open-source ATS scorer across 500 train-test splits.

## Key Results
- TPR disparity reduced from 0.10 to 0.05 (PM role) and from ±0.27 to 0.01 (UX role) when comparing traditional vs. two-ticket schemes
- Theoretical proof that n-ticket scheme converges exponentially to group-independent outcomes with rate O(k^n)
- Both TPR and TPR disparity improve simultaneously under two-ticket scheme when threshold remains stable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stochastic LLM Manipulation Creates Unequal Access
Unequal access to higher-quality LLMs creates disparities in hiring outcomes between privileged and unprivileged groups. Premium LLMs stochastically dominate cheaper models, producing resume manipulations that yield higher expected scores. Candidates with better LLM access systematically achieve better outcomes even when qualifications are identical.

### Mechanism 2: Hirer-Side LLM Manipulation Reduces Group Disparities
When the hirer applies their own LLM manipulation to every submitted resume and takes the maximum score, true positive rates improve for both groups and TPR disparity decreases. The two-ticket scheme provides all candidates with an additional "ticket" via the hirer's LLM, helping unprivileged candidates more than privileged candidates who already accessed strong LLMs.

### Mechanism 3: N-Ticket Scheme Converges to Group-Independent Outcomes
As n → ∞, hiring outcomes converge exponentially to a fixed decision independent of group membership. Each additional hirer-applied LLM manipulation acts as a contraction operator on the acceptance probability space, by Banach's Fixed Point Theorem converging to a unique fixed point that depends only on the resume's fundamental features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Strategic Classification (Stackelberg Game)**: Models hiring as a game where candidates manipulate inputs and the hirer deploys a classifier. Essential for understanding utility functions, best responses, and strategy-proof design.
- **Multivariate Stochastic Dominance**: Orders LLM quality via stochastic dominance to prove better LLMs yield better outcomes. Mathematical backbone for disparity analysis.
- **Banach Fixed Point Theorem and Contraction Operators**: The n-ticket convergence proof relies on showing the ticket-application operator is a contraction on [0,1] with coefficient k_x = 1 - h_x.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Resume Scorer (s: X → R) -> Candidate LLM Layer (L_g) -> Hirer LLM Layer (L_H) -> Threshold Classifier (f_τ) -> Ticket Aggregator
- **Critical path**: Resume arrives → Candidate optionally applies L_g(x) → Submit best version x' → Hirer applies L_H to x' → Score all tickets via s(·) → Apply threshold: accept if max(scores) ≥ τ
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hirer LLM strength vs. threshold stability; number of tickets vs. computational cost; hallucination risk vs. improvement gains
- **Failure signatures**: Threshold drift between schemes; stagnation failure when L_H produces minimal score changes; hallucination contamination adding fabricated qualifications
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline disparity measurement across LLM quality tiers; 2) Two-ticket validation with threshold stability check; 3) N-ticket convergence test measuring exponential decay

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the effectiveness of the two-ticket scheme change when candidates utilize highly prescriptive or job-tailored prompts instead of general resume improvement prompts? The authors note that future work should address variable behavior of LLMs arising from different or more prescriptive prompts.

### Open Question 2
Can the two-ticket scheme provide fairness guarantees without the constraint that the optimal hiring threshold remains constant between traditional and two-ticket schemes? The Discussion suggests relaxing this condition could help establish stronger guarantees.

### Open Question 3
Do the theoretical and empirical improvements in fairness and accuracy transfer to proprietary black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) or human-in-the-loop hiring processes? The Conclusion states that future audits should test black-box and human-in-the-loop systems.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework assumes stochastic dominance relationships between LLMs that may not hold empirically across all model families and domains
- Convergence proof for n-ticket schemes relies on hirer's LLM being stronger than all candidate LLMs, which may not reflect real-world distributions
- Empirical evaluation uses only two job roles and a single ATS tool, limiting generalizability to other hiring contexts

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Stochastic LLM disparity)**: High confidence - well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evidence
- **Mechanism 2 (Two-ticket fairness improvement)**: Medium confidence - experimental results show consistent TPR disparity reduction, but threshold stability assumption has limited validation
- **Mechanism 3 (N-ticket convergence)**: Low confidence - theoretical proof is sound but lacks empirical validation beyond two-ticket case

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Stability Verification**: Systematically measure τ* differences between traditional and two-ticket schemes across all 500 train-test splits, calculating proportion where |τ*(1) - τ*(2)| > 0.05

2. **Cross-Domain Generalizability Test**: Apply two-ticket scheme to non-technical domains (marketing, finance, healthcare) using same methodology to measure TPR disparity reduction patterns

3. **N-Ticket Convergence Experiment**: Implement iterative hirer LLM application (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for two job roles, measuring acceptance probability convergence rates and empirically estimating k_x to validate O(k_x^n) bound
