# Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Phase Information on Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15344
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Phase-aware preprocessing improves rotating machinery fault diagnosis accuracy by up to 5.4% (96.2% accuracy), with architecture-independent gains across six deep learning models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of fault diagnosis in rotating machinery by explicitly leveraging phase information in multi-axis vibration signals. The authors propose two preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in segmented time-series data: three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase, and single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset with synchronized three-axis vibration sensors and a two-stage learning framework, the methods were evaluated across six deep learning architectures. Results show architecture-independent improvements, with the single-axis reference approach achieving up to 96.2% accuracy (+5.4% improvement) by preserving spatial phase relationships, while the three-axis independent method achieved consistent gains (+2.7% for Transformer).

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage framework for fault diagnosis. First, vibration signals are segmented into fixed-length windows (512 samples) with a stride of 32 samples. Phase-aware preprocessing is then applied using either three-axis independent adjustment (each axis shifted to zero phase) or single-axis reference adjustment (uniform shift applied to all axes to preserve inter-axis relationships). Next, an unsupervised pre-training stage trains a time-series prediction model (seq_len=512, pred_len=3) to learn encoder representations. Finally, an SVM classifier is trained on frozen encoder features with grid-searched hyperparameters (γ, C). The approach is evaluated on a dataset with 6 fault classes (normal + 5 unbalance conditions) using three-axis synchronized vibration sensors at 3 kHz sampling rate.

## Key Results
- Phase-aware preprocessing improved fault diagnosis accuracy by 2.7% to 5.4% across all six tested architectures
- Single-axis reference adjustment achieved the highest accuracy of 96.2%, outperforming three-axis independent adjustment (93.5%)
- FEDformer and Autoformer showed anomalous behavior with 14+ point accuracy improvements, suggesting frequency-domain architectures interact differently with phase-shifted signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aligning segmentation onset to a consistent phase reference reduces intra-class feature variance.
- Mechanism: Arbitrary segmentation start points introduce random phase offsets at the dominant frequency (rotation rate). By computing the phase φ at dominant frequency f_d via DFT and applying time shift Δt = -φ/(2πf_d), all segments from identical machine states begin at the same phase, yielding consistent feature vectors.
- Core assumption: The dominant frequency is stationary and identifiable (constant RPM operation).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data"
  - [section III] "signal features extracted from identical machine conditions exhibit random phase variations, causing feature vectors to be scattered across the feature space"
  - [corpus] Weak — corpus neighbors focus on fault diagnosis methods (wavelet transforms, GNNs, transfer learning) but do not explicitly address phase alignment mechanisms.
- Break condition: Variable-speed machinery where dominant frequency shifts; multi-frequency signals without clear single dominant tone.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Preserving inter-axis relative phase relationships improves multi-axis fault discrimination.
- Mechanism: Single-axis reference adjustment applies one uniform time shift (computed from reference axis) to all three axes. This preserves φ_jk = φ_j - φ_k for all axis pairs (Equation 23), maintaining spatial vibration patterns that characterize fault-specific 3D motion.
- Core assumption: Fault signatures manifest as spatial vibration patterns across axes, not just single-axis amplitude features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "single-axis reference approach achieving up to 96.2% accuracy (+5.4% improvement) by preserving spatial phase relationships"
  - [section III-B] "by applying the same time shift to all axes, the method ensures that the relative phase relationships are completely preserved"
  - [corpus] No direct validation — corpus papers do not systematically compare phase-preservation strategies.
- Break condition: Applications where single-axis signals are sufficient; scenarios where inter-axis phase varies non-deterministically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Three-axis independent alignment improves accuracy but is suboptimal because it destroys inter-axis phase.
- Mechanism: Each axis is shifted independently to zero phase, eliminating random onset variation per axis but setting all relative phases to zero (φ'_xy = 0 - 0 = 0 ≠ φ_xy). Improves over no adjustment but loses spatial discriminability.
- Core assumption: Reducing intra-axis phase variance alone provides benefit, even without inter-axis information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "three-axis independent method achieved consistent gains (+2.7% for Transformer)"
  - [section IV-B] "three-axis independent adjustment showed notable improvement from 90.8% to 93.5%"
  - [corpus] No direct comparison in corpus literature.
- Break condition: When inter-axis phase carries no discriminative information (unlikely for rotating machinery).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) phase extraction**
  - Why needed here: Phase adjustment requires computing arg(X[k_d]) at the dominant frequency bin to determine alignment offset.
  - Quick check question: Given a 512-sample segment sampled at 3 kHz, what frequency resolution does the DFT provide?

- Concept: **Multi-axis coordinate systems for rotating machinery**
  - Why needed here: Understanding radial (X, Z) vs. axial (Y) vibration patterns informs reference axis selection and spatial feature interpretation.
  - Quick check question: Why might radial axes (X, Z) carry more fault information than axial (Y) for unbalance conditions?

- Concept: **Time-domain circular shift vs. resampling for phase adjustment**
  - Why needed here: Implementing Δt shifts requires either interpolation or circular buffer operations; understanding tradeoffs prevents signal artifacts.
  - Quick check question: If Δt = 2.5 samples, how should you handle non-integer sample shifts without introducing spectral leakage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data acquisition -> Preprocessing -> Stage 1 (Unsupervised encoder pre-training) -> Stage 2 (SVM classifier)
- Critical path: Phase adjustment accuracy → encoder feature quality → SVM classification. Errors in phase alignment compound through the pipeline; sensor synchronization errors < 10 µs are required.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Three-axis independent: Simpler conceptually, always improves over baseline, but loses inter-axis phase (+2.7% gain).
  - Single-axis reference: Best accuracy (+5.4%), requires choosing reference axis (theoretically invariant, but validate per setup).
  - No adjustment: Baseline; high variance across windows.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy with high variance across runs → phase not aligned (random segmentation onset).
  - Three-axis independent outperforms single-axis reference → inter-axis phase may be noise-dominated; check sensor mounting.
  - FEDformer/Autoformer show anomalous behavior → frequency-domain architectures may interact differently with phase-shifted signals (Table IV shows 14+ point jumps).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run pipeline with no phase adjustment; confirm ~90% accuracy and high std dev (±3.2%). Establish reproducibility.
  2. **Phase method comparison**: Compare three-axis independent vs. single-axis reference (X, Y, Z) on held-out test set. Expect hierarchy: none < independent < reference.
  3. **Reference axis ablation**: Systematically vary reference axis (X, Y, Z) to verify theoretical invariance (φ''_jk = φ_jk holds regardless of choice).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the single-axis reference phase adjustment strategy be adapted for variable-speed rotating machinery where the dominant frequency is non-stationary?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Future Work that they plan to "study automatic dominant-frequency detection and multi-frequency phase synchronization for machines with multi-band or variable-speed operation."
- Why unresolved: The proposed method relies on identifying a single "dominant frequency" ($f_d$) to calculate phase and apply time shifts ($\Delta t = -\phi / 2\pi f_d$). This assumes a constant rotational speed (e.g., 1200 RPM), but variable speed operation causes $f_d$ to fluctuate, potentially invalidating the fixed-frequency alignment logic.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the algorithm that tracks instantaneous frequency to apply dynamic time-shifts, validated on a dataset with varying RPM profiles.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the performance gain from preserving inter-axis phase relationships hold for complex fault modes like bearing defects or misalignment, which differ significantly from the unbalance conditions tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes the need to "extend the dataset to diverse fault modes (bearing defects, misalignment, looseness)."
- Why unresolved: The study relies on washer-based unbalance, which primarily manifests as 1X (rotational frequency) vibration. It is unclear if aligning the "dominant frequency" is sufficient for faults like bearing defects, where critical information resides in high-frequency harmonics or modulations rather than the fundamental rotational phase.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets containing bearing faults or misalignment showing that the single-axis reference method maintains its performance advantage over the baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can end-to-end neural architectures learn to model relative phase dependencies natively, eliminating the need for explicit phase adjustment preprocessing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list as a future direction the intent to "evaluate end-to-end phase-aware neural encoders that inherently model relative phase without external alignment."
- Why unresolved: The current study treats phase alignment as a distinct preprocessing step. It remains unknown if this inductive bias is better hard-coded via signal processing or if a neural network could learn a more optimal, adaptive alignment or phase-invariant representation internally.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison showing that a specifically designed "phase-aware" deep learning model trained on raw, unaligned data achieves accuracy comparable to or better than the proposed preprocessing pipeline.

## Limitations
- The approach assumes stationary dominant frequency, limiting applicability to variable-speed machinery
- Superior performance relies on inter-axis phase relationships being fault-discriminative, which may not hold for all fault types
- Results are based solely on unbalance faults; generalization to bearing defects, misalignment, and other fault modes remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Architecture-independent improvement from phase adjustment (verified across six models with consistent directional gains)
- **Medium confidence**: Single-axis reference superiority over three-axis independent (statistically significant but architecture-dependent magnitude)
- **Medium confidence**: Phase alignment reduces intra-class feature variance (mechanistically sound but correlation not explicitly validated)
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to non-unbalance faults and variable-speed conditions (untested in current work)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-fault validation**: Test phase adjustment methods on bearing fault and misalignment datasets to verify architecture-independent benefits extend beyond unbalance conditions
2. **Speed variation robustness**: Evaluate performance degradation under ±10% RPM variation to quantify sensitivity to dominant frequency drift
3. **Sensor synchronization analysis**: Measure classification accuracy sensitivity to synthetic time offsets (0-50 μs) between axes to establish practical synchronization requirements
