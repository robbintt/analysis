# Hallucination Benchmark for Speech Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.16567
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16567
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces SHALLOW, first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in speech foundation models across four complementary dimensions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SHALLOW, the first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating hallucinations in speech foundation models. The authors decompose ASR errors into four complementary dimensions: lexical fabrications (unrelated content), phonetic fabrications (phonetically similar but incorrect words), morphological errors (structural/grammatical distortions), and semantic errors (meaning alterations). They define targeted metrics within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior. Evaluation across various architectures and speech domains reveals that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with WER under high-quality recognition conditions but this relationship weakens substantially as WER increases.

## Method Summary
SHALLOW implements four error metrics: LF (lexical fabrications) using JiWER edit distances, PF (phonetic fabrications) using metaphone encoding with Hamming/Levenshtein distances, ME (morphological errors) using dependency parsing and grammar checking, and SE (semantic errors) combining local BERT embeddings with global NLI-based contradiction detection. The framework evaluates 12 ASR models across 10 speech datasets, using synthetic validation data to verify metric specificity. ME and SE metrics require substantial computational resources, with LibriSpeech evaluation taking approximately 90 minutes on a single A100 GPU.

## Key Results
- SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with WER in high-quality recognition (low WER) but decouple substantially as WER increases
- The framework reveals architectural biases, showing encoder-transducers minimize phonetic errors while decoder-based models excel at morphological coherence
- SHALLOW captures dangerous semantic hallucinations that WER misses, such as negation flips that preserve lexical similarity
- At WER > 50%, some SHALLOW metrics show negative correlations with WER, indicating fundamentally different error patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Error Decoupling in Degraded Conditions
WER aggregates all error types into a single scalar, but SHALLOW treats them as distinct dimensions. The paper demonstrates that while lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic errors correlate with WER in low-error regimes, this correlation breaks down—often becoming negative—as noise/error rates increase. This reveals that high-WER models make qualitatively different errors that WER cannot disentangle.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Contradiction Detection via NLI
The Semantic Error dimension moves beyond simple embedding similarity by explicitly incorporating an NLI model to classify relationships as Entailment, Neutral, or Contradiction. It applies a heavy penalty to contradictions, allowing it to flag "I can rotate" vs. "I cannot rotate" as severe errors despite high string similarity.

### Mechanism 3: Architectural Trade-off Profiling
SHALLOW exposes inherent architectural biases by comparing profiles across model families. Encoder-Transducers (e.g., Parakeet) optimize for monotonic alignment, minimizing phonetic fabrications, while Decoder-based Speech LLMs (e.g., Phi-4) leverage stronger language model priors, minimizing morphological errors but sometimes generating phonetically plausible hallucinations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Word Error Rate (WER) & Levenshtein Distance**
  - **Why needed here:** WER is the baseline metric that SHALLOW aims to decompose; understanding what WER misses (treating all errors as equally "bad") is crucial to grasping SHALLOW's value.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model transcribes "The patient is not sick" as "The patient is sick," what is the WER, and does it reflect the severity of the error?

- **Concept:** **Phonetic Encoding (Metaphone)**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand Phonetic Fabrications, which differentiates between random typos and phonetically plausible substitutions (e.g., accent-induced errors).
  - **Quick check question:** How does Metaphone encode "night" vs. "knight," and would SHALLOW treat this substitution as high or low phonetic fabrication?

- **Concept:** **Natural Language Inference (NLI) & Entailment**
  - **Why needed here:** The Semantic Error dimension relies on NLI (Entailment vs. Contradiction) rather than just string similarity to detect "hallucinated content" that is grammatically fluent but logically false.
  - **Quick check question:** Would an NLI model classify (Ref: "The door is closed", Hyp: "The door is open") as Entailment, Neutral, or Contradiction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input text -> JiWER for LF -> Jellyfish for PF metaphone encoding -> SpaCy parser for ME dependency trees -> LanguageTool for grammar errors -> BERT embeddings for SE local scores -> BART-MNLI for SE global coherence -> Output 4D vector [LF, PF, ME, SE]

- **Critical path:** 1) Text normalization (critical for meaningful edit distances), 2) NLI inference (computationally heaviest; requires GPU batching), 3) Score aggregation (weighted averages per Eq. 1-7)

- **Design tradeoffs:** ME and SE require large NLP models, significantly increasing evaluation time vs WER; sensitivity to paraphrasing vs contradiction distinction; be aware metrics strongly correlate with WER at very low WER (<10%)

- **Failure signatures:** High PF, Low SE = acoustic/phonetic struggle but meaning preserved; Low WER, High SE = "silent hallucination" (fluent but factually wrong); High ME = syntax/grammar struggles

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Synthetic validation: verify PF metric triggers on phonetic samples; 2) Medical case study: look for Low WER (<15%) but High SE (>50%) to identify dangerous failures; 3) Noise stress test: plot PF vs ME divergence between Parakeet vs Phi-4 on noisy data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can SHALLOW metrics be extended to multilingual ASR evaluation given dependence on English-specific semantic embedding models?
- **Basis:** Limitations section states current focus on English evaluation with constraints in semantic error dimension.
- **Why unresolved:** Semantic error metrics rely on BERT-based embeddings and NLI models trained for English, with uncertain availability for other languages.
- **Evidence needed:** Multilingual SHALLOW benchmark demonstrating metric validity across diverse languages with comparable discriminative power.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are optimal weighting schemes for SHALLOW's composite metrics across different application domains and error severity levels?
- **Basis:** Authors acknowledge weights reflect relative importance assessment that cannot be universally optimal across all ASR applications.
- **Why unresolved:** Current weights validated on specific datasets but may not generalize to domains with different error tolerance profiles.
- **Evidence needed:** Systematic ablation studies across domains showing how weight adjustments affect correlation with human judgments of error severity.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can SHALLOW metrics be incorporated into ASR training objectives to directly optimize for reduced hallucinations?
- **Basis:** Paper demonstrates diagnostic value for post-hoc evaluation but does not explore using metrics as training signals.
- **Why unresolved:** SHALLOW metrics rely on reference transcriptions and external models, making them difficult to integrate as differentiable loss components.
- **Evidence needed:** Proof-of-concept showing models trained with hallucination-aware objectives achieve lower SHALLOW scores without degrading overall WER.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** What causal mechanisms explain why SHALLOW metrics decouple from WER as recognition quality degrades?
- **Basis:** Figure 3 shows correlations drop sharply above 30-50% WER, sometimes becoming negative, but underlying cause unexplained.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper characterizes phenomenon empirically but doesn't investigate whether this reflects model architecture failures, data distribution shifts, or fundamental limitations of edit-distance metrics.
- **Evidence needed:** Controlled experiments isolating specific degradation factors to determine which conditions most strongly drive metric decoupling.

## Limitations
- Substantial computational overhead for ME and SE metrics, with LibriSpeech evaluation taking approximately 90 minutes on a single A100 GPU
- Effectiveness depends on NLI model's ability to capture domain-specific semantic nuances, limiting generalization to specialized domains
- Correlation with clinical impact remains correlational rather than proven causal

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Decoupling mechanism (WER vs. SHALLOW metrics diverging at high error rates) is well-supported by quantitative evidence across multiple datasets and architectures
- **Medium Confidence:** Architectural trade-off profiling is demonstrated through comparative analysis but generalizability requires further validation
- **Medium Confidence:** NLI-based semantic contradiction detection is theoretically sound and demonstrated on synthetic examples but needs real-world validation in critical domains

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transfer Test:** Evaluate SHALLOW on a medical speech dataset to verify whether NLI-based semantic error detection captures clinically significant hallucinations that WER misses
2. **Resource Efficiency Analysis:** Profile computational overhead of ME and SE metrics across different hardware configurations and dataset sizes to identify practical scaling limits
3. **Human Evaluation Correlation:** Conduct human annotator studies to validate whether high SE scores correspond to perceived severity of transcription errors in real-world deployment scenarios
