# What Can You Do When You Have Zero Rewards During RL?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03971
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03971
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Mixing easier samples into training data enables learning with only outcome rewards when base model never produces correct answers.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates the challenge of reinforcement learning when no correct solutions are ever generated, resulting in zero gradients and stalled learning. The authors benchmark recent sparse-reward RL methods—including VinePPO, Progress Rewards, and Best-of-N aware fine-tuning—on a controlled graph search task. Surprisingly, all methods fail to overcome the zero-reward barrier when the base model never produces a correct answer. The study finds that a simple data-centric intervention—mixing easier samples into the training set—enables the model to learn the harder task using only outcome rewards, without modifying the RL algorithm. However, not all easy samples are equally effective; only those of appropriate difficulty facilitate transfer. The research also highlights practical challenges in reward shaping and stability issues in existing methods.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct controlled experiments on a graph search task where the base model never produces correct answers, resulting in zero outcome rewards. They benchmark several recent RL methods designed for sparse rewards (VinePPO, Progress Rewards, Best-of-N aware fine-tuning) and demonstrate their failure to learn under these conditions. The key intervention involves mixing easier samples into the training data, which surprisingly enables learning of the harder task using only outcome rewards. The study systematically examines which difficulty levels of easy samples are most effective for transfer learning.

## Key Results
- All benchmarked RL methods (VinePPO, Progress Rewards, Best-of-N) fail when base model never produces correct answers
- Data mixing with appropriately difficult samples enables learning the hard task using only outcome rewards
- Not all easy samples are equally effective; difficulty level matters for successful transfer
- Reward shaping is challenging to instantiate in practice and existing methods show stability issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
When a model never produces correct answers, standard RL algorithms receive zero gradients and cannot learn. By introducing easier samples into training, the model can occasionally receive non-zero rewards, generating informative gradients. These easier samples act as stepping stones, allowing the model to gradually improve and eventually tackle the harder task. The mechanism relies on the principle that learning from easier tasks can transfer to more difficult ones when the difficulty gap is appropriately sized.

## Foundational Learning
- **Outcome rewards**: Binary feedback indicating success/failure; needed because traditional RL fails with only zero rewards, quick check: verify reward signal is truly binary
- **Zero-gradient problem**: Occurs when all rewards are zero, preventing weight updates; needed to understand why learning stalls, quick check: monitor gradient norms during training
- **Transfer learning from easier to harder tasks**: Core mechanism enabling learning from mixed difficulty data; needed to understand how simpler samples help, quick check: measure performance on hard task after training on mixed data
- **Reward shaping challenges**: Difficulty in designing effective shaped rewards; needed to explain why algorithmic solutions alone don't work, quick check: attempt to implement shaped rewards and document failures
- **Curriculum learning principles**: Gradually increasing task difficulty can improve learning; needed to contextualize data mixing approach, quick check: compare performance with ordered vs. mixed difficulty samples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Base model -> RL algorithm -> Reward signal -> Policy update -> Graph search task

**Critical path**: Data generation → Reward computation → Gradient calculation → Parameter update → Policy improvement

**Design tradeoffs**: Algorithm modification vs. data intervention; shaped rewards vs. outcome rewards; sample difficulty selection; stability vs. performance

**Failure signatures**: All-zero reward distributions, stagnant policy performance, vanishing gradients, unstable training curves

**First experiments**:
1. Verify zero-reward condition by running base model on task and confirming no correct outputs
2. Test individual easy samples to identify difficulty thresholds for effective transfer
3. Measure gradient norms with and without mixed data to confirm zero-gradient problem resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in source material.

## Limitations
- Study limited to single graph search task, limiting generalizability to other RL domains
- Data mixing intervention not thoroughly characterized for optimal difficulty distribution
- Claim that no RL algorithm modification is needed may be overstated without exploring hybrid approaches
- Does not investigate scalability to larger, more complex tasks or real-world applications

## Confidence
High: Core finding that current methods fail under zero rewards is well-supported by controlled experiments and clear baselines.
Medium: Data mixing solution is demonstrated but only in one narrow setting, without systematic exploration of optimal mixing strategies.
Low: Broader implications for real-world RL applications remain speculative without validation across diverse environments.

## Next Checks
1. Test data-mixing intervention on diverse RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, language tasks) to assess generalizability
2. Systematically vary difficulty distribution of mixed samples to identify optimal mixing ratios and difficulty ranges
3. Explore hybrid approaches combining data mixing with lightweight algorithmic modifications (reward shaping, curriculum learning) to compare performance against single interventions
