core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of "geometric blindness" in multimodal
  large language models (MLLMs) for medical perception, where models generate linguistically
  fluent but geometrically inconsistent outputs. The authors propose Med-Scout, a
  geometry-aware RL post-training framework that cures this blindness by leveraging

  Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection) derived from unlabeled

# Med-Scout: Curing MLLMs' Geometric Blindness in Medical Perception via Geometry-Aware RL Post-Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.23220
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23220
- Authors: Anglin Liu; Ruichao Chen; Yi Lu; Hongxia Xu; Jintai Chen

- Key outcome: Med-Scout improves geometric awareness by over 40% on proposed benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of "geometric blindness" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) used for medical perception, where models produce linguistically fluent but geometrically inconsistent outputs. The authors propose Med-Scout, a geometry-aware reinforcement learning post-training framework that leverages three intrinsic geometric proxy tasks derived from unlabeled medical images to enhance geometric consistency in medical image understanding.

The approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary and open-source models on radiological and comprehensive medical visual question answering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art generalization capabilities. The proposed Med-Scout-Bench benchmark provides a standardized way to quantify geometric perception in medical MLLMs.

## Method Summary
Med-Scout employs a geometry-aware RL post-training framework that addresses geometric blindness through three proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. These tasks are designed to capture intrinsic geometric properties from unlabeled medical images. The framework uses a dense geometric reward mechanism within the GRPO framework to provide stable optimization signals during training. The method focuses on improving geometric consistency without requiring additional labeled data, making it scalable and practical for medical applications.

## Key Results
- Geometric awareness improved by over 40% on the Med-Scout-Bench benchmark
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks
- Outperforms both proprietary and open-source MLLM models in geometric consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a geometric reward signal that directly addresses the mismatch between linguistic fluency and spatial accuracy in medical MLLMs. The three proxy tasks target different aspects of geometric understanding: scale relationships between anatomical structures, spatial arrangement and connectivity, and identification of geometric anomalies. The dense reward mechanism provides continuous feedback rather than binary success/failure signals, enabling more stable and effective optimization of geometric consistency properties.

## Foundational Learning

**Geometric perception in medical imaging**: Understanding spatial relationships, scales, and topological arrangements in medical images is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Without geometric awareness, models may generate plausible-sounding but spatially incorrect descriptions.

**Reinforcement learning for fine-tuning**: RL-based post-training allows targeted improvement of specific capabilities without catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. The GRPO framework provides stable optimization through proximal policy optimization techniques.

**Proxy task design**: Creating effective training tasks from unlabeled data requires identifying intrinsic properties that correlate with the target capability. The three proxy tasks were specifically designed to capture fundamental geometric relationships in medical imagery.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Raw medical images → Proxy task generators → Geometric reward computation → GRPO fine-tuning loop → Improved MLLM

**Critical path**: The geometric reward computation serves as the critical feedback mechanism that enables the RL agent to learn geometric consistency. This requires efficient calculation of spatial relationships and topological properties from both the proxy tasks and the model's outputs.

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach trades off between the computational cost of generating and evaluating proxy tasks against the benefit of improved geometric awareness. Using unlabeled data reduces labeling costs but requires careful task design to ensure meaningful geometric signal.

**Failure signatures**: Models may overfit to specific geometric patterns present in the proxy tasks, leading to poor generalization. Alternatively, the geometric reward may not adequately capture clinically relevant spatial relationships, resulting in improved benchmark performance but limited practical utility.

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline geometric awareness evaluation on Med-Scout-Bench to establish performance without fine-tuning
2. Individual proxy task ablation to determine which geometric properties contribute most to overall improvement
3. Cross-domain generalization test using medical imaging modalities not present in the proxy task training set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Limited qualitative analysis of how geometric improvements translate to actual diagnostic utility in clinical settings
- Potential overfitting to specific proxy tasks without validation of broader geometric generalization
- Implementation details and hyperparameter sensitivity not thoroughly explored for reproducibility

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The claim that Med-Scout improves geometric awareness by over 40% on the proposed benchmark, as this is directly measured and reported.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of achieving state-of-the-art generalization on radiological and medical VQA tasks, as this depends on the comprehensiveness of the comparison datasets and evaluation protocols.

**Medium confidence**: The assertion that the geometric proxy tasks effectively address the "geometric blindness" problem, as the clinical relevance of these improvements requires further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each geometric proxy task to overall performance improvements.

2. Perform cross-domain generalization tests using medical imaging modalities not included in the training proxy tasks.

3. Design and execute a user study with medical professionals to assess whether geometric improvements translate to enhanced diagnostic utility and clinical workflow integration.
