# Template-Based Text-to-Image Alignment for Language Accessibility: A Study on Visualizing Text Simplifications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11314
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11314

- Primary result: Template-based image generation for text simplifications with CLIPScore and expert human evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a template-based framework for generating cognitively accessible images from text simplifications, addressing the need for structured visual support for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The authors designed five prompt templates with enforced accessibility constraints—such as object count limits, spatial separation, and exclusion of text—and evaluated them using 400 simplified sentences from four datasets. Automatic evaluation via CLIPScore showed the Basic Object Focus template achieved the highest semantic alignment, and expert annotation of 2,000 images across ten visual styles revealed Retro as the most accessible style and Wikipedia-sourced simplifications as most effective. Inter-annotator agreement was strong for text simplicity but weak for image quality and ethics, and CLIPScore correlated only weakly with human judgments (r=0.17, p<0.001). These findings highlight the importance of structured prompting and human-centered evaluation in developing inclusive, AI-generated visual accessibility tools.

## Method Summary
The study employed a template-based approach to generate images from text simplifications using five distinct prompt templates with enforced accessibility constraints. The templates included Basic Object Focus, Simplified Focus, Basic Composition, Improved Composition, and Artistic Expression, each with specific limitations on object count, spatial relationships, and exclusion of text. Researchers generated 400 images using a controlled evaluation pipeline across four simplification datasets (Newsela, OneStopEnglish, Wiki-Audio, Wiki-Large) and ten visual styles (e.g., Retro, Cyberpunk, 3D). Automatic evaluation used CLIPScore to measure semantic alignment between generated images and input sentences, while human evaluation involved expert annotators rating 2,000 images across four criteria: text simplicity, image quality, accessibility, and ethicality. The study emphasized structured prompt engineering to address accessibility constraints rather than relying on post-hoc filtering.

## Key Results
- The Basic Object Focus template achieved the highest CLIPScore (0.1468), indicating superior semantic alignment with input sentences
- Retro visual style was rated most accessible by expert annotators, while 3D style received the lowest accessibility scores
- Wikipedia-sourced simplifications produced images rated highest for both simplicity and accessibility across all evaluation criteria
- CLIPScore correlation with human judgments was weak (r=0.17, p<0.001), suggesting automatic metrics inadequately capture accessibility quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The template-based approach succeeds by embedding accessibility constraints directly into image generation prompts rather than attempting to filter or modify outputs afterward. By limiting object counts, enforcing spatial separation between objects, and excluding text elements, the templates prevent the generation of cognitively overwhelming or confusing imagery that could hinder comprehension for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The structured prompts guide text-to-image models to produce semantically aligned visual representations that support rather than compete with simplified text content. This proactive constraint design addresses the core challenge that standard image generation models prioritize visual appeal over accessibility, which can result in cluttered, text-heavy, or contextually inappropriate outputs for cognitive support applications.

## Foundational Learning

**Prompt engineering for accessibility**: Why needed - Standard image generation models lack built-in accessibility constraints; quick check - Verify template constraints prevent text generation and limit object complexity

**CLIPScore for semantic alignment**: Why needed - Measures how well generated images match text descriptions; quick check - Compare CLIPScore values across different prompt templates to identify semantic alignment differences

**Expert annotation protocols**: Why needed - Human judgment essential for accessibility evaluation; quick check - Assess inter-annotator agreement using Cohen's Kappa or similar metrics

**Visual style impact on accessibility**: Why needed - Different artistic styles affect cognitive load and comprehension; quick check - Compare accessibility ratings across multiple visual styles using same prompt templates

**Dataset diversity for simplification**: Why needed - Different simplification sources may vary in quality and effectiveness; quick check - Evaluate image quality across multiple simplification datasets using same templates

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text simplification -> Prompt template selection -> Text-to-image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) -> Image generation -> CLIPScore evaluation -> Human expert annotation -> Accessibility assessment

Critical path: Input text → Template application (with constraints) → Image generation → CLIPScore scoring → Human evaluation → Final accessibility rating

Design tradeoffs: The template approach trades flexibility for accessibility by enforcing strict constraints, which may limit creative visual expression but ensures cognitive accessibility. Using expert annotators rather than end-users introduces potential representational gaps in accessibility assessment.

Failure signatures: Low CLIPScore values indicate poor semantic alignment; low human accessibility ratings suggest template constraints are insufficient; weak correlation between automatic and human metrics indicates metrics may not capture accessibility criteria; high object counts or text generation indicate constraint violations.

3 first experiments:
1. Generate images using Basic Object Focus template across all four simplification datasets and compare CLIPScore values
2. Test Retro style with Artistic Expression template and measure accessibility ratings against other styles
3. Compare image quality and accessibility scores between Wikipedia-sourced and Newsela simplifications using the same prompt template

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focused exclusively on English-language simplifications, limiting cross-linguistic applicability
- Expert annotators rather than individuals with intellectual disabilities conducted accessibility evaluations, potentially missing authentic user perspectives
- Weak correlation (r=0.17) between CLIPScore and human judgments indicates automatic metrics inadequately capture accessibility quality
- Limited testing of only ten visual styles and five prompt templates leaves uncertainty about optimal combinations for different disability types

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The methodology for prompt template design and constraint specification is well-documented and reproducible
**Medium confidence**: The finding that Retro style achieved highest accessibility ratings, given moderate inter-annotator agreement and limited style diversity
**Medium confidence**: The conclusion that Wikipedia-sourced simplifications produced the most effective images, though this may reflect dataset characteristics rather than simplification quality
**Low confidence**: The generalizability of CLIPScore as an evaluation metric for accessibility, given its weak correlation with human judgments

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with individuals with intellectual disabilities to validate expert-based accessibility assessments and refine template constraints based on direct feedback
2. Test cross-linguistic applicability by translating templates and evaluating image generation quality for non-English simplifications across multiple languages
3. Expand evaluation to include additional visual styles and prompt templates while testing for accessibility across different types of intellectual disabilities and cognitive support needs
