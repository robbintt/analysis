# Cross-Fusion Distance: A Novel Metric for Measuring Fusion and Separability Between Data Groups in Representation Space

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.22036
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22036
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD) isolates fusion-altering geometric displacement from fusion-preserving variations through variance decomposition, achieving 0.887 correlation with cross-domain performance degradation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of measuring fusion and separability between data groups in representation space, especially under domain shift. Existing distributional distances conflate fusion-altering geometric displacements with fusion-preserving variations like global scaling and structural deformations, limiting interpretability. The authors propose Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), which isolates geometric displacement while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors through a variance decomposition-based approach. CFD has linear computational complexity and requires no kernel or hyperparameter choices. In synthetic experiments, CFD responds sensitively to geometric displacement and dispersion changes while remaining stable to scaling, topological deformations, and outliers. On real histopathology datasets, CFD achieves near-zero distances for within-dataset splits (ground truth) and shows the highest correlation with cross-domain performance degradation (0.887) compared to alternatives like Wasserstein (0.742), MMD (0.814), Hausdorff (0.697), and Chamfer (0.613).

## Method Summary
Cross-Fusion Distance measures fusion between two latent representation sets through variance decomposition. Given two groups Z_A and Z_B, CFD computes weighted centroids, within-group dispersions, and fused dispersion, then calculates CFS = (w_A·σ²_A + w_B·σ²_B)/σ²_AB. The final metric CFD = −log(CFS) increases with separation while remaining invariant to global scaling and structural deformations. The method requires only O(n·d) computation and no hyperparameters, making it efficient for large-scale applications.

## Key Results
- CFD maintains near-constant values under global scaling while alternatives scale proportionally
- CFD shows highest correlation (0.887) with cross-domain performance degradation among compared metrics
- CFD achieves near-zero distances for within-dataset splits (ground truth calibration) while detecting cross-domain differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CFD isolates fusion-altering geometric displacement from fusion-preserving variations through variance decomposition.
- Mechanism: The fused representation space's total variance decomposes into within-group dispersion terms and inter-group centroid displacement terms. By taking the ratio of pooled within-group variance to total fused variance (Cross-Fusion Score), displacement contributions are implicitly isolated in the denominator. The logarithmic transformation yields a distance metric that increases monotonically with separation.
- Core assumption: Within-group dispersion reflects intrinsic data structure (task-relevant) rather than nuisance variation; only inter-group centroid shifts meaningfully alter fusion extent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "isolates geometric displacement while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors through a variance decomposition-based approach"
  - [section 3, equation 8-10] Formal decomposition: σ²_AB = w_Aσ²_A + w_Bσ²_B + w_A||μ_A − μ_AB||² + w_B||μ_B − μ_AB||²; CFD = −log(CFS)
  - [corpus] Weak connection—neighbor papers use "cross-fusion" for multimodal feature fusion, not distributional distance metrics. "Measuring the Measures" (arXiv 2509.04622) evaluates representational similarity metrics but focuses on discriminative capacity rather than invariance properties.
- Break condition: When within-group dispersion changes reflect domain shift (e.g., one domain has intrinsically higher variance), CFD may conflate this with fusion changes. Assumes dispersion structure is domain-invariant.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ratio-based normalization achieves scale invariance without explicit preprocessing or hyperparameter selection.
- Mechanism: Global scaling multiplies both within-group and total fused variance by the same squared factor (σ² → α²σ²), canceling in the CFS ratio. This differs from Wasserstein/Hausdorff distances where scaling directly increases the metric value proportionally.
- Core assumption: Scaling is uniform (isotropic) across both groups; non-uniform per-group scaling breaks the cancellation property.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "requires no kernel or hyperparameter choices"
  - [section 4.4, figure 3c] "CFD and MMD remain largely stable across scaling levels... CFD maintains near-constant values"
  - [corpus] Not directly addressed in neighbor papers—most focus on fusion architectures rather than metric invariance properties.
- Break condition: Non-isotropic scaling (different per dimension) or per-group differential scaling violates invariance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dispersion sensitivity enables detection of overlap changes even with fixed centroid separation.
- Mechanism: When within-group dispersion increases while centroids remain fixed, the numerator (pooled within-group variance) grows faster than displacement terms, reducing CFS and thus CFD. This captures that increased spread → greater overlap → less separation.
- Core assumption: Overlap is the meaningful quantity for fusion; metrics that remain constant under dispersion changes (like Wasserstein with fixed displacement) fail to capture fusion dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "existing distributional distances is their inability to identify dispersion-induced changes in cross-group fusion"
  - [section 4.3, figure 3b] "CFD decreases sharply with a substantially steeper slope, capturing fine-grained reductions in separability"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper on Z-Gromov-Wasserstein (arXiv 2408.08233) addresses structural comparison but doesn't explicitly handle dispersion-sensitivity as a design criterion.
- Break condition: High-dimensional spaces where dispersion increases don't meaningfully change overlap due to concentration of measure effects.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Optimal Transport / Wasserstein Distance**
  - Why needed here: CFD is explicitly motivated as a solution to Wasserstein's displacement-deformation conflation. Understanding WD's transport formulation clarifies what CFD avoids.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why WD increases under pure structural deformation even when centroids coincide?

- Concept: **Variance Decomposition (ANOVA-style)**
  - Why needed here: CFD's mathematical foundation is a variance partition: total variance = within-group variance + between-group variance. Familiarity with this decomposition makes CFD's derivation transparent.
  - Quick check question: In a two-group setting, what happens to within-group vs. between-group variance components when group means move apart while individual variances stay fixed?

- Concept: **Domain Shift and Batch Effects in Medical Imaging**
  - Why needed here: The paper's primary validation uses histopathology data where staining/scanner variations induce domain shift. Understanding why this matters grounds the metric's practical utility.
  - Quick check question: Why would a distance metric that penalizes structural deformation be problematic for comparing histopathology representations across institutions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ```
  Input: Two latent representation sets Z_A (n_A samples), Z_B (n_B samples)
     ↓
  Centroid Computation: μ_A, μ_B, μ_AB (weighted fused centroid)
     ↓
  Dispersion Computation: σ²_A, σ²_B (within-group), σ²_AB (fused)
     ↓
  Cross-Fusion Score: CFS = (w_A·σ²_A + w_B·σ²_B) / σ²_AB
     ↓
  Output: CFD = -log(CFS)
  ```
  Key state: All computations are streaming-friendly; requires only running sums.

- Critical path: Centroid computation → variance accumulation → ratio → log transform. The variance decomposition (equation 8) is the theoretical linchpin; verify numerical stability in the CFS ratio when σ²_AB approaches the numerator (near-perfect overlap).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Ratio formulation vs. additive decomposition**: Ratio provides scale invariance but loses absolute magnitude information. Use case dependent: if absolute separation matters, consider using displacement terms directly.
  - **Log transform vs. raw CFS**: Log provides unbounded distance scale and monotonic sensitivity. Alternative: 1 - CFS for bounded [0,1) distance.
  - **Single distance value vs. component reporting**: CFD aggregates into one scalar. For debugging, report CFS, displacement terms, and dispersion terms separately.

- Failure signatures:
  - CFD ≈ 0 for clearly separated groups: Check for numerical overflow in variance computation (high-dimensional, large-magnitude features).
  - CFD increases unexpectedly after normalization: The normalization altered relative within-group dispersion, not just scale.
  - High variance across random splits: Sample size too small; dispersion estimates unstable. Increase n_A, n_B.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check on synthetic Gaussians**: Generate two Gaussian clouds with controlled centroid distance and variance. Verify CFD increases monotonically with distance and decreases monotonically with variance inflation. Compare against Wasserstein trajectory.
  2. **Scale invariance test**: Apply uniform scaling (×2, ×4, ×8) to both groups. Confirm CFD remains constant while Wasserstein/Hausdorff scale proportionally.
  3. **Ground-truth calibration on your data**: Randomly split a single-domain dataset into two subsets (expected CFD ≈ 0). Compare against cross-domain pairs. Compute Relative Distance Ratio (RDR) following Section 5.1 protocol.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Cross-Fusion Distance be generalized to quantify fusion across multi-group and hierarchical representation settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states: "Future work may extend CFD to multi-group and hierarchical settings..."
- Why unresolved: The current mathematical formulation (Eqs. 8–10) is derived strictly for the binary case, decomposing variance between exactly two groups ($z_A$ and $z_B$).
- What evidence would resolve it: A generalized variance decomposition formula applicable to $k > 2$ groups that preserves the scale invariance and sensitivity properties of the binary metric.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CFD be effectively utilized as a differentiable loss function to regularize representation learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion proposes to "integrate it into representation learning objectives to directly regularize inter-group separation while preserving within-group structures."
- Why unresolved: While the authors demonstrate CFD's utility as an evaluation metric, they have not validated its stability or effectiveness as an optimization objective for training neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that minimizing CFD as a training loss improves domain generalization performance without causing gradient instability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Cross-Fusion Distance behave under temporal representation drift?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion identifies the need to "study its behavior under temporal representation drift."
- Why unresolved: The paper's validation relies on static cross-sectional datasets (histopathology batches), leaving the metric's response to dynamic, time-dependent distribution shifts uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of CFD on time-series representation data to determine if it reliably tracks gradual concept drift or sudden distribution changes.

## Limitations

- CFD's assumption that within-group dispersion reflects only fusion-preserving variation may break when domain shift causes genuine dispersion changes
- The metric's invariance to structural deformations relies on specific variance decomposition that may not generalize to all deformation types
- Current validation is limited to histopathology datasets, limiting generalizability across domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: CFD's computational efficiency (O(n·d)), scale invariance mechanism, and synthetic experiment results demonstrating insensitivity to global scaling while maintaining sensitivity to geometric displacement
- **Medium confidence**: CFD's invariance to structural deformations and outliers relies on the specific variance decomposition approach, which may not generalize to all deformation types or outlier distributions
- **Medium confidence**: The correlation (0.887) with cross-domain performance degradation is promising but based on a single model family (Virchow) and two histopathology datasets, limiting broader generalizability

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-domain robustness test**: Apply CFD across multiple histopathology datasets with varying staining protocols to assess whether CFD remains stable to domain-specific dispersion changes while maintaining sensitivity to genuine fusion alterations

2. **High-dimensional behavior analysis**: Evaluate CFD's performance in very high dimensions (d > 1000) where concentration of measure effects might diminish the metric's sensitivity to dispersion changes, potentially invalidating Mechanism 3

3. **Alternative normalization impact**: Test CFD with various normalization schemes (L1, L2, whitening) to determine whether the claimed invariance holds across preprocessing pipelines or if results depend critically on specific normalization choices
