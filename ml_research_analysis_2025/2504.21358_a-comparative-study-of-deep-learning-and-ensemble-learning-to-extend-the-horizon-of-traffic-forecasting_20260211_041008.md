# A comparative study of deep learning and ensemble learning to extend the horizon of traffic forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21358
- Reference count: 0
- XGBoost with time embedding performs competitively with deep learning models for long-horizon traffic forecasting

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates machine learning methods for long-term traffic forecasting, extending up to 30 days ahead. It compares ensemble learning (XGBoost) with deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, Informer) on real-world arterial and freeway datasets. Time embedding is used to improve model understanding of periodicity and events. The research finds that for long forecasting horizons, periodicity modeling becomes more important than capturing temporal dependencies, with time embedding enabling simpler models like XGBoost and RNN to outperform the more complex Informer.

## Method Summary
The research employs a comparative experimental design using multiple machine learning approaches for traffic forecasting. Time embedding techniques are integrated to capture periodicity and temporal patterns in traffic data. The study evaluates performance across arterial and freeway datasets, testing various forecasting horizons up to 30 days. Key factors examined include input length, holiday effects, data granularity, and training data size. The experimental framework systematically compares model performance under different conditions to identify optimal approaches for long-horizon forecasting.

## Key Results
- For long forecasting horizons, periodicity modeling becomes more important than temporal dependencies
- Time embedding enables simpler models like XGBoost and RNN to outperform more complex Informer
- XGBoost performs competitively with DL methods while offering superior efficiency
- Time embedding helps RNN outperform Informer by 31.1% for 30-day-ahead forecasting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Time embedding allows models to explicitly capture periodic patterns in traffic data, which become increasingly dominant at longer forecasting horizons. By incorporating temporal features such as day-of-week, month, and holiday indicators, the models can better represent the underlying traffic dynamics. This approach reduces the burden on model architecture to implicitly learn these patterns, allowing simpler models like XGBoost to compete effectively with complex deep learning architectures. The mechanism works by providing explicit temporal context that aligns with known traffic behavior patterns.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Time Embedding** - A technique for representing temporal information as features that capture periodicity and temporal relationships
   - Why needed: Traffic patterns exhibit strong periodic behavior (daily, weekly, seasonal) that must be captured for accurate forecasting
   - Quick check: Verify that time features like day-of-week and holiday indicators improve baseline model performance

2. **Ensemble Learning (XGBoost)** - A gradient boosting framework that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model
   - Why needed: Provides competitive accuracy with lower computational complexity compared to deep learning
   - Quick check: Confirm that ensemble methods can match or exceed single-model performance on benchmark datasets

3. **Deep Learning for Sequences (RNN/LSTM/Informer)** - Neural network architectures designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data
   - Why needed: Traffic data exhibits temporal dependencies that traditional models may struggle to capture
   - Quick check: Validate that sequence models improve forecasting accuracy over static models on temporal data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Feature Engineering (Time Embedding) -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves generating time-embedded features from raw traffic data, then using these features as input to various forecasting models. The performance bottleneck typically occurs during model training for deep learning approaches, particularly at longer forecasting horizons.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study balances model complexity against forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Deep learning models offer strong performance but require significant computational resources and data, while ensemble methods like XGBoost provide competitive accuracy with lower resource requirements. Time embedding serves as a middle ground, enabling simpler models to achieve deep learning-level performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may fail when traffic patterns deviate significantly from historical norms (e.g., during unprecedented events), when time embedding fails to capture relevant periodic patterns, or when training data is insufficient to learn meaningful temporal relationships. Deep learning models may also overfit to noise in smaller datasets.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline model performance without time embedding to establish the contribution of temporal features
2. Compare model performance across different forecasting horizons to identify the optimal horizon for each approach
3. Evaluate model robustness to missing data and anomalies to assess real-world applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental focus on arterial and freeway traffic data from limited geographic regions constrains generalizability
- Comparison operates within a specific time embedding framework, unclear how results translate to alternative temporal representations
- Single metric focus and potential sensitivity to hyperparameter choices may affect performance advantage claims

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| XGBoost with time embedding performs competitively with deep learning models | High |
| Periodicity modeling becomes more important than temporal dependencies at extended horizons | Medium |
| RNN outperforms Informer by 31.1% for 30-day-ahead forecasting | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments across additional traffic datasets from different geographic regions and traffic types to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of time embedding from model architecture
3. Evaluate model robustness to various data quality issues including missing values, sensor failures, and anomalies common in real-world traffic monitoring systems
