- Agents collaboratively optimize under heterogeneous objectives, budgets, and input spaces

## Executive Summary
ARCO-BO introduces a framework for multi-agent Bayesian optimization under heterogeneity in objectives, evaluation budgets, and partially shared input spaces. It employs a similarity- and optima-aware consensus mechanism to adaptively weight information sharing, a budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy to allocate evaluations proportionally to agent resources, and a partial input space sharing scheme to enable collaboration on common variables while preserving private ones. Experiments on synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems demonstrate that ARCO-BO consistently outperforms both independent Bayesian optimization and static-consensus baselines, achieving faster convergence and lower final regret across all tested scenarios. The method is particularly effective in scenarios with limited budgets or incomplete information sharing, enabling agents to benefit from targeted knowledge transfer while avoiding negative transfer from dissimilar tasks.

## Method Summary
The ARCO-BO framework integrates three key mechanisms to address heterogeneous multi-agent Bayesian optimization. First, a similarity- and optima-aware consensus mechanism adaptively weights information sharing between agents based on task similarity and the quality of shared optima. Second, a budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy allocates evaluation resources proportionally to each agent's available budget, enabling efficient resource utilization across agents with different computational constraints. Third, a partial input space sharing scheme allows agents to collaborate on common variables while maintaining privacy over task-specific variables. These components work together to enable effective collaboration while minimizing negative transfer between dissimilar tasks.

## Key Results
- ARCO-BO achieves faster convergence and lower final regret compared to independent BO and static-consensus baselines
- The method excels in low-budget and partial-sharing scenarios, demonstrating efficient resource utilization
- Targeted knowledge transfer enables agents to benefit from relevant information while avoiding
