# FinTrust: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Trustworthiness Evaluation in Finance Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15232
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Introduces a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 11 LLMs across seven trustworthiness dimensions in finance using 15,680 instances

## Executive Summary
FinTrust addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation of LLM trustworthiness in financial applications by introducing a comprehensive benchmark spanning seven dimensions: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, transparency, and knowledge discovery. The benchmark features 15,680 instances across text, tabular, and time-series data formats with fine-grained tasks and real-world scenarios. Experiments with 11 leading LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in fiduciary alignment and conflict of interest disclosure, highlighting the need for improved legal and ethical alignment in financial applications.

## Method Summary
The FinTrust benchmark employs a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM trustworthiness across seven dimensions using 15,680 carefully curated instances. The methodology incorporates diverse data formats including text, tabular data, and time-series data to reflect real-world financial scenarios. Each dimension is evaluated through task-specific prompts and evaluation criteria, with results aggregated to provide a holistic assessment of model performance. The benchmark includes both proprietary and open-source models, enabling comparative analysis across different model families and development approaches.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models like o4-mini generally outperform in safety-related tasks, while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 excel in fairness metrics
- All evaluated models show significant performance gaps in fiduciary alignment and conflict of interest disclosure tasks
- Models exhibit a "transparency backfire effect" where privacy alignment requirements conflict with transparency obligations for conflict disclosure
- Reasoning-based models perform worse on personal-level fairness, suggesting the reasoning process may overemphasize sensitive attributes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of financial trustworthiness dimensions, realistic task scenarios, and systematic evaluation methodology. By incorporating multiple data formats and task types, it captures the complexity of real-world financial decision-making while maintaining consistent evaluation standards across different model architectures.

## Foundational Learning

**Financial Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of financial concepts, regulations, and terminology is essential for evaluating model performance in context. Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret financial statements and regulatory requirements.

**Trustworthiness Metrics**: Familiarity with fairness, safety, privacy, and transparency evaluation criteria specific to financial applications. Quick check: Does the model appropriately handle PII versus material disclosure requirements.

**Multimodal Data Processing**: Ability to work with text, tabular, and time-series financial data formats. Quick check: Can the model accurately process and reason across different data representations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Task Design -> Prompt Engineering -> Model Evaluation -> Result Aggregation

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline follows a sequential flow from data preparation through task-specific prompt generation to final trustworthiness scoring, with each dimension building upon the foundational data and task structures.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark balances comprehensive coverage against evaluation complexity, opting for detailed task-specific prompts that may limit generalizability but ensure precise measurement of model capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Models consistently fail fiduciary alignment tasks, suggesting fundamental gaps in understanding financial responsibility and disclosure requirements. Safety performance varies significantly between model families.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate baseline model performance across all seven dimensions. 2) Compare reasoning versus non-reasoning model variants on fairness tasks. 3) Test model responses to edge cases in conflict of interest scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can targeted instruction tuning or reinforcement learning using the FinTrust dataset improve domain-specific alignment without causing catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state in the Limitations section: "Investigating how instruction tuning or reinforcement learning with our dataset affects model trustworthiness would be a valuable direction for future work."
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited to the evaluation of static, pre-trained models; it does not experiment with using the benchmark data to train or align models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from fine-tuning experiments showing improved FinTrust scores while maintaining performance on general financial benchmarks (e.g., FinQA).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can models be trained to distinguish between information that must be protected (PII) and information that must be disclosed (conflicts of interest) to satisfy fiduciary duties?
- Basis in paper: The Discussion notes that models fail fiduciary alignment because they likely misclassify ownership details as sensitive information to be hidden, rather than material facts to be disclosed.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this "transparency backfire effect" but does not propose a mechanism to resolve the conflict between privacy alignment and transparency requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training objective or prompting strategy that successfully increases conflict-of-interest disclosure rates in the Transparency subset without compromising PII protection in the Privacy subset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism inherently exacerbate bias in financial decision-making tasks?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.4 finds that reasoning-based models perform worse on personal-level fairness, suggesting the reasoning process "overemphasizes sensitive attributes" like age or gender.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes the correlation between reasoning and lower fairness scores but does not determine if the reasoning process itself is the cause of the bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of bias levels in standard CoT outputs versus "silent" reasoning or non-reasoning model outputs on the Fairness subset.

## Limitations
- Benchmark focus on English-language content may not generalize to other financial contexts and regulatory environments
- Dataset construction process may contain inherent biases from source materials used for annotation
- Evaluation framework may not fully capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and evolving regulatory requirements

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Methodological design and dataset construction, identification of fiduciary alignment gaps, transparency backfire effect findings

**Medium Confidence**: Comparative analysis between proprietary and open-source models due to potential variations in model versions and implementation details

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability across different languages and regional financial regulations, capture of all possible edge cases in financial decision-making

## Next Checks
1. Cross-linguistic validation: Evaluate the benchmark's effectiveness and fairness across multiple languages and regional financial regulations to assess generalizability beyond English-language contexts.

2. Longitudinal stability assessment: Conduct repeated evaluations over time to measure how well the benchmark captures evolving financial scenarios and whether model performance remains consistent as market conditions change.

3. Real-world deployment correlation: Compare benchmark performance metrics with actual user outcomes in deployed financial applications to validate the predictive value of the evaluation framework for practical use cases.
