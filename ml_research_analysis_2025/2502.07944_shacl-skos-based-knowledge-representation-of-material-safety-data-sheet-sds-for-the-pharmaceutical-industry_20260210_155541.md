# SHACL-SKOS Based Knowledge Representation of Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the Pharmaceutical Industry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.07944
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07944
- Reference count: 39
- Developed SHACL-SKOS knowledge representation for SDS regulatory compliance in pharmaceutical industry

## Executive Summary
The authors present a knowledge representation system for Material Safety Data Sheets (SDS) in the pharmaceutical industry using SHACL-SKOS standards. The system decouples data shapes from taxonomies, enabling standardized annotation of SDS information using vocabularies like DPG-GHS and validation via SHACL constraints. Implemented as "Crucible," the approach automates hazard statement extraction and pictogram aggregation for composite packing sheets, reducing manual SDS processing from hours to minutes. The architecture supports interoperability and scalable deployment across platforms.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a SHACL-SKOS-based knowledge representation system that decouples data shapes from taxonomies for SDS validation. The approach uses standardized vocabularies like DPG-GHS to annotate SDS information, which is then validated through SHACL constraints. The system architecture enables consistent integration of heterogeneous SDS documents from multiple vendors. The implementation, named "Crucible," automates the extraction of hazard statements and pictograms, aggregating them into composite packing sheets to replace manual compilation processes.

## Key Results
- Reduced SDS-based cover sheet generation from hours to minutes through automation
- Successfully implemented system within single pharmaceutical company for regulatory compliance
- Achieved consistent integration of heterogeneous SDS documents from multiple vendors using standardized vocabularies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SHACL-SKOS approach works by separating the structural validation rules (SHACL shapes) from the controlled vocabularies (SKOS taxonomies). This decoupling allows the system to validate SDS content against evolving regulatory vocabularies while maintaining consistent data structures. The architecture enables automated extraction and aggregation of hazard information through constraint-based validation, reducing manual intervention in regulatory compliance workflows.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHACL validation**: Constraint-based RDF validation using SHACL shapes is needed for ensuring SDS data conforms to regulatory standards. Quick check: Verify SHACL shapes properly validate sample SDS RDF triples.
- **SKOS vocabularies**: Standardized controlled vocabularies for hazard communication (like DPG-GHS) are essential for consistent regulatory compliance. Quick check: Confirm vocabulary terms map correctly to SDS hazard categories.
- **RDF data modeling**: Semantic web technologies enable structured representation of SDS information for automated processing. Quick check: Test RDF serialization of sample SDS documents.
- **Decoupled architecture**: Separating data shapes from taxonomies allows independent evolution of validation rules and vocabularies. Quick check: Validate system works when vocabularies are updated without shape modifications.
- **Automated extraction**: Rule-based extraction of hazard statements from unstructured SDS documents requires robust parsing. Quick check: Measure extraction accuracy on diverse SDS formats.
- **Composite aggregation**: Combining multiple SDS documents into unified safety sheets requires conflict resolution mechanisms. Quick check: Test aggregation logic with overlapping hazard information.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: SDS Documents -> Parser -> RDF Triples -> SHACL Validator -> Composite Generator -> Safety Sheets

Critical Path: SDS Document Ingestion → Semantic Annotation → Constraint Validation → Hazard Aggregation → Composite Sheet Generation

Design Tradeoffs: The decoupled architecture provides flexibility for evolving taxonomies but requires synchronization mechanisms. Automated extraction trades precision for speed and scalability.

Failure Signatures: Invalid RDF triples cause validation failures; missing vocabulary terms prevent hazard identification; conflicting hazard information creates aggregation ambiguities.

First Experiments:
1. Validate sample SDS documents against SHACL shapes to verify constraint enforcement
2. Test vocabulary-based hazard extraction on structured SDS data
3. Evaluate composite sheet generation with multiple SDS inputs containing overlapping hazards

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on qualitative demonstration rather than quantitative performance metrics
- Validation limited to single use case within one pharmaceutical company, questioning generalizability
- Decoupling of data shapes from taxonomies introduces complexity in maintaining synchronization

## Confidence
High: The architectural approach of using SHACL-SKOS for SDS validation and separating data shapes from taxonomies is technically sound and aligns with established semantic web practices.

Medium: The automation claims regarding hazard statement extraction and composite packing sheet generation are plausible given the described methodology, but lack empirical verification through controlled testing or user studies.

Low: The scalability and interoperability claims are largely untested beyond the single deployment case, and the system's performance with diverse, real-world SDS documents from multiple global vendors remains unverified.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled timing experiments comparing manual vs. automated SDS cover sheet generation across 50+ diverse pharmaceutical SDS documents from multiple vendors.
2. Perform cross-industry testing with regulatory-compliant SDS documents from chemical manufacturing, cosmetics, and biotechnology sectors to assess generalizability.
3. Implement A/B testing with safety officers using both traditional and SHACL-SKOS-based systems to measure error rates, compliance accuracy, and user satisfaction.
