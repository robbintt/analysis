# Sparse Polyak with optimal thresholding operators for high-dimensional M-estimation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18167
- Reference count: 0
- This paper extends Sparse Polyak method to use general thresholding operators while maintaining rate invariance in high-dimensional M-estimation problems.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces an extension of the Sparse Polyak framework that allows for general thresholding operators beyond hard thresholding, maintaining rate invariance in high-dimensional M-estimation. The authors develop an adaptive step-size rule and prove that using operators with favorable relative concavity properties (such as reciprocal thresholding) can reduce the required support size from O(s*κ²) to O(s*κ). The method achieves near-optimal statistical precision at rates independent of ambient dimension without requiring knowledge of restricted smoothness constants. Experiments on sparse logistic regression demonstrate improved convergence and solution accuracy compared to standard approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper extends the Sparse Polyak method by replacing the hard thresholding operator with general sparsifying operators Φ_s that satisfy specific relative concavity properties. An adaptive step-size rule is introduced that depends on the norm of the thresholded gradient, enabling rate invariance with respect to ambient dimension. The key innovation is the use of thresholding operators like reciprocal thresholding that have better relative concavity properties (η_{s*}(Φ_s) ≤ 1/4), which improves the sparsity-accuracy tradeoff. The method is analyzed under weak restricted smoothness and strong convexity conditions, with theoretical guarantees extending to both linear regression and generalized linear models.

## Key Results
- Reciprocal thresholding (RT) operator reduces required support size from O(s*κ²) to O(s*κ)
- Achieves near-optimal statistical precision at rates independent of ambient dimension
- For linear regression, requires s ≥ 320κs* support under weak RSC (vs O(κ²s*) previously)
- Numerical experiments show faster convergence and more accurate solutions than standard approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improvement stems from using thresholding operators with favorable relative concavity properties that enable better contraction factors in the convergence analysis. The adaptive step-size rule ensures that the algorithm automatically adjusts to the geometry of the problem, avoiding the need to tune parameters based on unknown restricted smoothness constants.

## Foundational Learning
- Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC): Ensures unique solution recovery in high dimensions; needed to establish convergence; check by verifying RIP-like conditions hold
- Relative Concavity Properties: Characterizes how well a thresholding operator preserves convexity-like behavior; needed to bound error propagation; check by computing η_{s*}(Φ_s)
- Weak vs Strong RSC: Weak RSC is sufficient for statistical accuracy but requires larger support; check by comparing required s to s*
- Adaptive Step-Size Rules: Automatically adjust to problem geometry; needed to avoid parameter tuning; check by verifying step-size satisfies theoretical bounds

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Gradient computation → Thresholding operator Φ_s → Adaptive step-size calculation → Parameter update
- Critical Path: θ_t → ∇f(θ_t) → ΦHT_s(∇f(θ_t)) → step-size → θ_{t+1}
- Design Tradeoffs: General operators vs computational complexity, rate invariance vs parameter requirements
- Failure Signatures: If relative concavity condition violated, convergence degrades; if step-size too large, stability issues
- First Experiments: 1) Verify RT operator satisfies η_{s*}(Φ_s) ≤ 1/4, 2) Test linear convergence rate on synthetic sparse regression, 3) Compare support recovery vs standard IHT variants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the improved O(κs*) support requirement for the RT operator be extended to GLMs under weak RSC, or is the O(κ²s*) requirement in Corollary 3 fundamental?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Corollary 3 for GLMs requires s ≥ 640R₀κ²s*, whereas Corollary 2 for linear regression achieves s ≥ 320κs* with RT. The gap suggests the RT improvement may not fully transfer to the weak RSC setting.
- Why unresolved: The proof technique for GLMs uses different step-size rules and convergence modes that may interact differently with relative concavity bounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified analysis showing O(κs*) suffices for GLMs, or a counterexample demonstrating that O(κ²s*) is necessary under weak RSC.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Sparse Polyak with RT perform in stochastic or finite-sum settings where only minibatch gradient information is available?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The algorithm requires computing ∇f(θ_t) at each iteration, which may be prohibitive for large-scale problems. Related work on stochastic IHT variants [10, 11, 12] is cited but not extended to the adaptive step-size framework.
- Why unresolved: The adaptive step-size relies on ∥ΦHT_s(∇f(θ_t))∥², whose behavior under gradient noise is uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical guarantees for a stochastic variant showing rate invariance is preserved, with explicit sample complexity bounds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can other thresholding operators with favorable relative concavity properties (e.g., firm thresholding, SCAD-inspired operators) further improve the sparsity-accuracy tradeoff?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "introduce a variant of Sparse Polyak that allows for alternative sparsifying operators Φ_s" and demonstrate RT, but do not explore the full space of operators satisfying η_{s*}(Φ_s) ≤ 1/4.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the framework but only analyzes RT in detail; the optimality of RT among all thresholding operators remains open.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis identifying operator properties that minimize the constant in the contraction factor (1 - 1/(40κ) + 4η_{s*}(Φ_s)).

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies heavily on specific relative concavity assumptions that may not hold for all thresholding operators
- Rate invariance claims depend on restrictive assumptions about loss function properties that may not be practically verifiable
- Numerical experiments are limited to synthetic sparse logistic regression data
- Comparison with state-of-the-art sparse optimization methods is narrow in scope

## Confidence
- Theoretical extension of Sparse Polyak with general thresholding operators: **High**
- Rate invariance and statistical precision guarantees: **Medium**
- Numerical superiority claims: **Low** (due to limited experimental scope)

## Next Checks
1. Verify the relative concavity conditions for alternative thresholding operators beyond reciprocal thresholding
2. Test the method on additional high-dimensional M-estimation problems (e.g., Poisson regression, Cox proportional hazards models)
3. Conduct experiments with real-world datasets to assess practical performance against established sparse optimization algorithms
