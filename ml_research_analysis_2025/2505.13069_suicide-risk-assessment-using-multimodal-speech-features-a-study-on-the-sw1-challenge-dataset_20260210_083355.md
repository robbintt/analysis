# Suicide Risk Assessment Using Multimodal Speech Features: A Study on the SW1 Challenge Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13069
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieved 69% accuracy on development set and 56% on test set for adolescent suicide risk classification using multimodal speech analysis

## Executive Summary
This study presents a multimodal approach to adolescent suicide risk assessment using speech recordings from the SW1 Challenge dataset. The method combines automatic Mandarin transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, audio embeddings from WavLM, and handcrafted acoustic features including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch statistics. Three fusion strategies were explored, with weighted attention and mixup regularization achieving the best generalization performance. The approach demonstrates the potential of multimodal speech analysis for suicide risk assessment while highlighting challenges in model generalization and the need for more diverse datasets.

## Method Summary
The approach integrates automatic transcription (WhisperX large-v2 for Mandarin), WavLM Large audio embeddings (10s chunks with 50% overlap), Chinese RoBERTa text embeddings, and handcrafted acoustic features (MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch statistics via librosa). Three fusion strategies were tested: early concatenation, modality-specific processing with attention, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. The weighted attention approach achieved 69% accuracy on the development set and 56% on the test set, representing the best generalization among the tested approaches.

## Key Results
- Weighted attention fusion with mixup regularization achieved 69% accuracy on the development set
- Test set performance reached 56% accuracy, indicating generalization challenges
- Incorporation of handcrafted acoustic features improved balanced classification and reduced biases
- Early fusion approaches overfit, showing 70% dev accuracy but only 45% test accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Learned modality weights improve generalization by dynamically emphasizing informative features while downweighting less relevant ones. The attention mechanism learns contribution weights for each modality (audio, text, acoustic), applying these weights to transformed embeddings before fusion, rather than treating all modalities equally. Optimal modality contributions vary across samples; audio may be more discriminative for some subjects while text is more informative for others. Evidence shows weighted attention achieved the highest test accuracy of 56%, though with a 13% gap from dev accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
Mixup regularization reduces overfitting to dataset-specific biases by interpolating embeddings between training samples. During training, embeddings from different samples are linearly interpolated, creating synthetic training examples that encourage smoother decision boundaries and reduce sensitivity to idiosyncratic training patterns. The embedding space is assumed to be locally linear enough that interpolated samples represent plausible intermediate states. The approach incorporated mixup regularization during training, though optimal interpolation strength remains to be determined.

### Mechanism 3
Handcrafted acoustic features complement self-supervised embeddings by explicitly modeling prosodic characteristics that may be implicit or under-emphasized in learned representations. MFCCs capture spectral envelope and articulation patterns; spectral contrast measures energy differences between peaks and valleys (phonation stability); pitch statistics capture intonation and prosody variations linked to psychological distress. Suicide risk manifests in paralinguistic markers (pitch variation, articulation, prosody) that are partially orthogonal to what WavLM captures. Integration of spectral and prosodic characteristics helped mitigate biases present in previous approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-supervised speech representations (WavLM)**: Provides high-level speech features relevant to emotion and speaker characteristics without requiring labeled mental health data. Quick check: Can you explain why mean pooling over chunked embeddings is used rather than processing the full audio as one sequence?

- **Transformer text embeddings with pooling strategies**: Chinese RoBERTa encodes semantic and syntactic structure; the choice between [CLS] token vs. mean pooling affects how sentence-level meaning is represented. Quick check: What information might be lost when using [CLS] token extraction compared to mean pooling over all tokens?

- **Attention-based multimodal fusion**: Different modalities contribute differently; attention allows the model to learn which modality to weight more heavily per sample rather than fixed concatenation. Quick check: How does the attention mechanism in Submission 3 differ from simply concatenating and letting the classifier learn importance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio recordings → WhisperX transcription (Mandarin) → WavLM Large embeddings (10s chunks, 50% overlap) + Chinese RoBERTa embeddings + handcrafted acoustic features (MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch statistics) → Modality-specific FC layers → Learned attention weights → Weighted concatenation → Classifier → 2-class softmax

- **Critical path**: Transcription quality (WhisperX) → text embedding quality → WavLM chunk size/overlap → temporal resolution vs. context tradeoff → Attention weight learning → final representation quality → Mixup interpolation strength → generalization vs. underfitting

- **Design tradeoffs**: WavLM Base+ vs. Large: Paper found Large improved test accuracy despite lower dev accuracy; Early fusion vs. attention: Early fusion achieved 70% dev but only 45% test; attention fusion sacrificed dev (69%) for better test (56%); Adding handcrafted features: Reduced dev accuracy but improved test generalization; Chunk size: 10s windows (context) vs. 1s windows (temporal detail)

- **Failure signatures**: Dev-test accuracy gap >15%: Strong overfitting signal (Submission 1: 70%→45%); High false negative rate: At-risk subjects misclassified as non-risk; Poor class separation in raw embedding t-SNE: Pretrained features alone insufficient; Test accuracy near 50%: Model learned training-specific patterns, not generalizable markers

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Modality ablation: Run audio-only, text-only, and acoustic-only baselines to quantify individual contributions; 2) Attention weight analysis: Log and visualize learned attention weights across dev set to identify which modality dominates and whether weights vary meaningfully across samples; 3) Mixup sensitivity: Sweep mixup alpha parameter (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) to find regularization sweet spot; monitor both dev-test gap and calibration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Fusion mechanisms for generalization gap**: What fusion mechanisms can close the substantial generalization gap between development and test performance in multimodal suicide risk assessment? Authors state "future work should focus on... developing fusion mechanisms that generalize well" after observing test accuracy drop from 69% (dev) to 45-56% (test). Early concatenation overfit; attention-based fusion improved test accuracy but still left a ~13% gap. Evidence needed: Fusion architectures achieving comparable dev/test accuracy on held-out cohorts, plus ablation studies isolating which modalities drive overfitting.

2. **Cross-cultural generalizability**: Do suicide risk markers from Chinese adolescent speech generalize across languages, cultures, and age groups? "Expanding the dataset to more diverse linguistic and cultural contexts would enhance model reliability." The SW1 dataset is monolingual (Mandarin) and age-restricted (10-18 years). Linguistic markers like absolutist words and paralinguistic features may be language- or culture-specific. Evidence needed: Cross-validation on multilingual suicide risk datasets with demographic stratification showing consistent feature importance.

3. **Labeling methodology improvements**: Can expert consensus labeling or multi-informant assessment reduce the noise introduced by MINI-KID self-report limitations? "More reliable labeling, incorporating expert consensus or enhanced clinical metrics, would address the known limitations of self-reported data." MINI-KID relies on adolescent self-report, which is prone to underreporting. Evidence needed: Re-annotation of a subset using consensus panels, with model performance compared against both single-rater and consensus labels.

## Limitations

- **Dataset representativeness**: Small sample size (600 subjects) with binary labels from MINI-KID clinical evaluations may limit generalizability to real-world clinical settings
- **Architecture transparency**: Critical implementation details remain unspecified, including attention mechanism configuration, training hyperparameters, and ensemble fold count
- **Clinical validation gap**: Study focuses on algorithmic performance without comprehensive clinical validation of continuous risk stratification

## Confidence

- **Modality fusion effectiveness**: Medium - Supported by dev-test accuracy patterns but significant generalization gap remains
- **Acoustic feature contribution**: High - Well-supported by results and corpus evidence of acoustic analysis in suicide risk assessment
- **Self-supervised embeddings utility**: High - Standard practice in multimodal learning with sufficient implementation detail

## Next Checks

1. **Attention weight analysis**: Log and visualize the learned attention weights across the development set to determine whether the model meaningfully differentiates modality contributions across samples, or if weights converge to fixed values that suggest the attention mechanism isn't learning sample-specific importance.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Test the trained model on an independent speech dataset with mental health annotations (if available) to assess whether the 56% test accuracy reflects true generalization or dataset-specific learning, particularly given the significant dev-test gap.

3. **Calibration and uncertainty analysis**: Evaluate model calibration curves and uncertainty estimates to determine if confidence scores align with prediction accuracy, which is critical for clinical deployment where false negatives carry severe consequences.
