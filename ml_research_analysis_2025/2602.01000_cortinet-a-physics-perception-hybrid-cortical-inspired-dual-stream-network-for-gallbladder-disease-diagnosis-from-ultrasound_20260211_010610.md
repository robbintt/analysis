# CortiNet: A Physics-Perception Hybrid Cortical-Inspired Dual-Stream Network for Gallbladder Disease Diagnosis from Ultrasound

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01000
- Reference count: 39
- 98.74% diagnostic accuracy on 10,692 expert-annotated ultrasound images

## Executive Summary
CortiNet introduces a cortical-inspired dual-stream neural network architecture for automated gallbladder disease diagnosis from ultrasound images. The system separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details through specialized encoding streams, processing them with late-stage fusion while maintaining computational efficiency. With only 1.32 million parameters, CortiNet achieves 98.74% diagnostic accuracy across nine gallbladder disease categories while demonstrating robustness to ultrasound speckle noise.

## Method Summary
The CortiNet architecture implements a physics-perception hybrid framework that decomposes ultrasound images into structural and perceptual streams based on multi-scale signal decomposition principles. Low-frequency components capture anatomical structures while high-frequency components preserve textural and perceptual details. The dual-stream encoding processes these complementary information channels through specialized convolutional networks, followed by a late-stage fusion mechanism that integrates both streams for final disease classification. A structure-aware explainability framework applies Grad-CAM exclusively to the structural branch to enhance interpretability and reduce noise sensitivity.

## Key Results
- 98.74% diagnostic accuracy across nine gallbladder disease categories
- Only 1.32 million parameters, enabling resource-constrained deployment
- Superior performance compared to conventional deep convolutional models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-stream architecture leverages cortical processing principles by separating structural and perceptual information pathways. Low-frequency structural components capture essential anatomical features necessary for disease classification, while high-frequency perceptual details preserve diagnostic texture information. Late-stage fusion allows both streams to maintain their specialized processing advantages before integration. The structure-aware explainability framework improves robustness by focusing interpretability tools on the more stable structural stream, reducing susceptibility to ultrasound speckle noise artifacts.

## Foundational Learning
- Ultrasound image characteristics: Why needed - Understanding speckle noise and frequency decomposition for effective preprocessing; Quick check - Verify signal decomposition correctly separates noise from diagnostic information
- Dual-stream neural network architecture: Why needed - Enables specialized processing of complementary information types; Quick check - Confirm each stream maintains distinct feature representations
- Grad-CAM explainability: Why needed - Provides clinically interpretable visualizations for diagnostic validation; Quick check - Validate Grad-CAM outputs align with known anatomical landmarks
- Cortical processing principles: Why needed - Guides architectural design for biological plausibility; Quick check - Assess whether design choices reflect actual cortical mechanisms
- Multi-scale signal decomposition: Why needed - Enables separation of structural and perceptual information; Quick check - Verify decomposition preserves diagnostic information in both streams

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Image -> Structural stream + Perceptual stream -> Fusion module -> Classification

Critical path: Input image passes through frequency decomposition filters, splits into structural and perceptual streams, each undergoes specialized convolutional processing, streams merge through fusion mechanism, final classification layer produces diagnosis

Design tradeoffs: Dual-stream architecture increases model complexity but improves specialization and interpretability; structure-aware explainability limits visualization to structural branch but reduces noise interference; late fusion preserves stream independence but may miss early cross-stream interactions

Failure signatures: Over-reliance on perceptual stream may amplify speckle noise; inadequate frequency decomposition could blur diagnostic features; premature fusion might reduce stream specialization benefits

First experiments:
1. Baseline single-stream comparison with equivalent parameter count
2. Ablation study removing structure-aware explainability to measure noise sensitivity
3. Cross-validation across different ultrasound acquisition protocols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Exceptionally high accuracy claims (98.74%) require external validation given ultrasound interpretation complexity
- Biological plausibility of cortical-inspired processing remains conceptual without physiological validation
- Explainability improvements lack systematic comparison with alternative denoising approaches or quantitative noise resilience measures

## Confidence

High confidence: Architectural design and parameter efficiency claims are verifiable through model inspection and standard benchmarking protocols. Dual-stream framework represents novel technical contribution with clear implementation details.

Medium confidence: Performance metrics appear robust given large dataset size (10,692 images), but clinical validation beyond expert annotation is needed. Computational efficiency claims align with parameter count, though real-world deployment may vary with hardware constraints.

Low confidence: Biological plausibility of cortical-inspired processing remains primarily conceptual. Explainability claims are qualitative without systematic human-in-the-loop validation or comparison with established interpretability methods.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct external validation on independent ultrasound dataset from different clinical sites to verify generalizability across imaging protocols and acquisition conditions
2. Perform ablation studies isolating contributions of dual-stream architecture versus single-stream baselines with equivalent parameter counts
3. Implement quantitative noise injection experiments comparing CortiNet's robustness against standard denoising pipelines and single-branch architectures
