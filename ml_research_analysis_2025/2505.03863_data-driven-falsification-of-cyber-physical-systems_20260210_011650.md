# Data-Driven Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.03863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03863
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Decision tree-based falsification achieved 10/10 falsification rate on most instances with significantly fewer simulations compared to finding a single counterexample

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a data-driven falsification framework for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that leverages machine learning models as surrogates. The framework employs two complementary strategies: a neural network-based approach using adversarial attack algorithms and DNN verification tools, and a decision tree-based approach guided by explanations of safety violations. The decision tree method shows superior performance in finding multiple counterexamples efficiently. The framework, implemented as a tool called FLEXI FAL, successfully falsified 33 out of 37 benchmark instances from the ARCH-COMP 2024 competition, including challenging cases with low falsifying trajectory density that other tools failed to solve.

## Method Summary
The framework uses machine learning surrogates to approximate CPS behavior and guide falsification. For the decision tree approach (DTFAL), a CART regressor is trained on input trajectories mapped to robustness scores. The tree is traversed to identify leaf nodes predicting violations (robustness < 0), and the decision path forms "explanations" - linear constraints on inputs. Random sampling within these constraint polytopes generates candidate counterexamples for simulation. The neural network approach (NNFAL) uses fully-connected ReLU networks trained on input-state mappings, with violations found via adversarial attacks or DNN verification. The framework is implemented as FLEXI FAL and evaluated on 37 benchmarks from ARCH-COMP 2024.

## Key Results
- FLEXI FAL falsified 33 out of 37 benchmark instances from ARCH-COMP 2024
- Decision tree-based falsification achieved falsification rate of 10/10 for most instances
- DTFAL found multiple counterexamples with significantly fewer simulations compared to finding a single counterexample
- Successfully solved challenging cases with low falsifying trajectory density that other tools failed to solve

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by replacing expensive CPS simulations with faster ML surrogate models. The decision tree approach is particularly effective because it provides interpretable "explanations" (decision paths) that directly suggest input regions likely to cause violations. By iteratively sampling within these regions and retraining the surrogate with new counterexamples, the method efficiently explores the input space to find multiple violations. The tree structure naturally handles non-linear relationships and discontinuities in CPS behavior that pure sampling methods struggle with.

## Foundational Learning
- **Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness**: Measures how strongly a trajectory satisfies/violates a specification; needed to quantify falsification. Quick check: Can compute robustness for simple safety constraints.
- **Surrogate modeling for CPS**: Using ML to approximate expensive system simulations; needed for scalability. Quick check: Can train a simple regressor on CPS input-output pairs.
- **Decision tree interpretation**: Understanding how tree splits form linear constraints; needed to extract "explanations." Quick check: Can identify decision path conditions for a given leaf.
- **Polytope sampling**: Generating points within constraint-defined regions; needed for counterexample generation. Quick check: Can sample uniformly within a 2D box defined by linear bounds.
- **Falsification vs verification**: Falsification seeks counterexamples, not proofs; needed to understand the problem scope. Quick check: Can distinguish between finding a violation and proving safety.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CPS Simulator -> Robustness Monitor -> Surrogate Trainer -> Falsification Engine -> Counterexample Validator -> (Update Dataset)

**Critical Path**: The decision tree is trained on (Input → Robustness), traversed to find near-violating leaves, explanations extracted as constraints, inputs sampled from the polytope, and counterexamples validated on the actual CPS.

**Design Tradeoffs**: DTFAL trades the potentially higher accuracy of NNs for interpretability and efficient multi-counterexample search. The tree depth controls between underfitting (shallow) and overfitting/slow traversal (deep).

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Spurious counterexamples: Surrogate predicts violation but actual robustness ≥ 0
- Sampling failure: No valid inputs found within explanation constraints
- Slow convergence: Retraining doesn't improve falsification rate

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement DTFAL on a 2D linear system with a simple safety constraint, measuring acceptance rate of sampled inputs.
2. Compare falsification rate and simulation count when using different sampling strategies (uniform vs. Latin Hypercube) for a single benchmark.
3. Verify the claimed falsification rate on a subset of published benchmarks by requesting access to simulators.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Can NNFAL be extended to support generic STL specifications?** The current method is limited to reachability properties, and the reduction to robustness properties for complex temporal operators like "eventually" or "until" is not yet established.
- **How can the framework effectively falsify non-deterministic CPS?** The current approach determinizes non-deterministic choices, potentially missing rare behaviors inherent in non-deterministic systems.
- **What is the theoretical relationship between surrogate fidelity and spurious counterexamples?** The paper lacks a formal bound on how approximation errors in the surrogate translate to false positives in high-dimensional CPS.

## Limitations
- The sampling strategy for generating inputs from decision tree explanations is not specified, creating uncertainty in practical implementation
- The framework relies on external tools (Breach, Nnenum) for robustness calculation and DNN verification without providing alternative implementations
- Lack of public access to benchmarks and simulator configurations prevents independent validation of the claimed results

## Confidence
- **Method Description**: Medium - The overall framework is well-described, but critical implementation details are missing
- **Results Validation**: Low - Cannot independently verify results due to lack of benchmark access
- **Framework Applicability**: Medium - The approach seems sound, but practical success depends on unspecified sampling strategies

## Next Checks
1. Implement a basic version of the decision tree falsification using uniform random sampling within the polytope defined by the decision path, and measure the acceptance rate and falsification success on a simple benchmark (e.g., a 2D linear system with a safety constraint).
2. Conduct an ablation study comparing the falsification rate and number of simulations when using different sampling strategies (e.g., uniform vs. Latin Hypercube vs. constraint-aware sampling) for the decision tree explanations.
3. Attempt to reproduce the results on a subset of the published benchmarks (e.g., AT, AC, PI) by requesting access to the simulators and verifying the claimed falsification rates and simulation counts.
