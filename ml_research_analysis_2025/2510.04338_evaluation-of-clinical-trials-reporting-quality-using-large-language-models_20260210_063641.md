# Evaluation of Clinical Trials Reporting Quality using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04338
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: 85% accuracy achieved using Mixtral-8x22B with 5-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting for CONSORT-ABSTRACT checklist verification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first evaluation of large language models for assessing clinical trial abstract reporting quality against CONSORT-ABSTRACT standards. The authors create CONSORT-QA, a new evaluation corpus combining expert annotations from COVID-19 intervention and depression prevention trials. They systematically evaluate different LLMs (general and biomedical variants) using various in-context learning strategies, finding that Mixtral-8x22B with 5-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting achieves 85% accuracy. The study reveals that larger general models outperform biomedical-specific models for this task, and that Chain-of-Thought prompting improves performance while providing transparency into model reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors construct CONSORT-QA by combining expert annotations from two existing datasets: COVID-19 interventions and depression prevention trials. They evaluate multiple LLMs (including general models like Mixtral-8x22B and Llama-3-70B, and biomedical models like BioMedLM and PubMedBERT) using in-context learning strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting with varying shot counts. The models answer 13 CONSORT-ABSTRACT checklist questions about abstract completeness. Explanations are auto-generated using Llama-3-70B and verified by the authors. Performance is measured using micro-average accuracy across all criteria.

## Key Results
- Mixtral-8x22B with 5-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting achieves 85% accuracy
- Larger general models consistently outperform smaller models and biomedical variants
- Chain-of-Thought prompting improves accuracy by forcing reasoning steps
- Biomedical fine-tuning does not consistently enhance results for structural reporting checks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Scaling in-context examples with reasoning steps (Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought) improves accuracy in verifying reporting standards.
- **Mechanism:** Providing 5 examples establishes a task distribution, while forcing the model to generate an explanation before the final answer allocates compute to "reasoning" tokens, reducing the weight of immediate but incorrect pattern matching.
- **Core assumption:** The model has sufficient context window to handle multiple full-abstract examples and the internal reasoning capabilities to validate its own logic.
- **Evidence anchors:** Figure 4 shows accuracy rising with the number of examples; Section 5.1 confirms 5-shot-CoT outperforms other strategies.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** General-domain instruction-tuned models outperform biomedical-specific models for structural reporting checks.
- **Mechanism:** The task of CONSORT verification relies heavily on strict instruction following and information retrieval ("Is X present?") rather than deep pathophysiological knowledge. Biomedical fine-tuning may over-specialize the model to domain content at the expense of general instruction adherence.
- **Core assumption:** The reporting standards (CONSORT) are linguistically consistent across general and medical text, and do not require deep domain inference for basic checks.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.1 states "biomedical equivalent... performs less than its general counterpart" and notes the task does not necessarily require specific biomedical knowledge.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Generative explanations expose reasoning consistency but are vulnerable to hallucination.
- **Mechanism:** The model generates a textual rationale (explanation) post-hoc or interleaved. While this allows for error analysis (verifying if the model "understood" the question), the generation process can invent text spans not present in the source abstract to justify a predefined answer.
- **Core assumption:** The model's ability to retrieve text spans is distinct from its ability to synthesize a justification.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.5 (Error Analysis) identifies that models sometimes "quote passages... that do not exist" (hallucination) or show inconsistency between explanation and answer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **CONSORT Standards (Abstract Extension)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire architecture relies on formulating these reporting guidelines (e.g., "Is the study identified as randomized?") as questions. Without understanding the criteria, one cannot validate the model's "Yes/No" outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between "eligibility criteria" (who is in the study) and "settings" (where it happened) in a clinical abstract?

- **Concept:** **In-Context Learning (Few-Shot)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary driver of performance in the paper. You must understand how to construct prompts with examples to guide the model without weight updates.
  - **Quick check question:** If you provide 5 examples of "bad" reporting and 0 examples of "good" reporting in a prompt, how might the model's behavior skew?

- **Concept:** **Hallucination vs. Grounding**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights that models invent quotes. Understanding that LLMs generate plausible text rather than retrieving facts is critical for designing the verification layer.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model says "The authors explicitly state X" but provides no direct quote, is that a hallucination or an inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Processor -> Prompt Constructor -> LLM Engine -> Output Parser -> Evaluator
- **Critical path:** The construction of the 5-shot examples. The paper notes these explanations were auto-generated by an LLM (Llama-3-70B) and verified. You must replicate this "auto-annotation" step for your specific dataset before running the final evaluation.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Use general models (Mixtral/Llama) for better adherence to the specific checklist logic; avoid biomedical fine-tunes unless the criterion requires deep domain knowledge
  - Skip sentence filtering (using classifiers like BioBERT). The paper found it provided minimal improvement and introduced potential retrieval errors
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Logic Drift: Model answers "Yes" but explanation lists missing elements (Inconsistency)
  - Quote Hallucination: Explanation cites a sentence not found in the provided abstract
  - Majority Bias: For criteria that are usually "Yes", the model may be biased toward "Yes" even when the abstract is non-compliant
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Zero-Shot Baseline: Run the Prompt Constructor with only the Instruction and Target Question on a sample of 20 abstracts to establish a lower bound
  2. Few-Shot Ablation: Compare 1-shot vs. 5-shot performance on a single difficult criterion (e.g., "Allocation Concealment") to measure sensitivity to examples
  3. Explanation Consistency Check: Run the 5-shot-CoT method and manually review 10 random "Correct" answers to see if the explanation actually supports the verdict (detecting confident but invalid reasoning)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Corpus Size and Generalization: CONSORT-QA contains only 139 abstracts (97 COVID-19 trials + 42 depression prevention trials), limiting confidence in generalization across all clinical trial domains
- Evaluation Methodology Gaps: The study focuses primarily on accuracy metrics without reporting precision, recall, or F1-scores for individual CONSORT criteria
- Hallucination and Consistency Issues: Models sometimes generate explanations containing fabricated quotes or show inconsistency between explanations and answers, but automated consistency checking is not implemented

## Confidence
- **High Confidence Claims:**
  - Larger general-domain models (Mixtral-8x22B) outperform smaller models for this task
  - Chain-of-Thought prompting improves accuracy compared to direct prompting
  - Biomedical fine-tuning does not consistently improve performance for structural reporting checks
- **Medium Confidence Claims:**
  - 5-shot Chain-of-Thought achieves 85% accuracy (based on limited corpus)
  - General models outperform biomedical models across all criteria
  - Explanation generation provides transparency despite hallucination risks
- **Low Confidence Claims:**
  - The 85% accuracy generalizes to broader clinical trial domains
  - Automated explanation verification is sufficient to catch all reasoning errors
  - Performance remains stable with longer or more complex CONSORT checklists

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Evaluate the best-performing configuration (Mixtral-8x22B with 5-shot CoT) on a completely different clinical trial corpus (e.g., oncology or cardiovascular trials) to test domain generalization beyond COVID-19 and depression studies.

2. **Consistency Verification Pipeline:** Implement automated cross-referencing between model explanations and source abstracts to flag hallucinated quotes and inconsistent reasoning, then re-evaluate accuracy after filtering these cases.

3. **Ablation on Individual Criteria:** Conduct per-criterion analysis to identify which CONSORT items benefit most from Chain-of-Thought prompting versus those where models struggle regardless of prompting strategy, informing targeted improvements for specific reporting requirements.
