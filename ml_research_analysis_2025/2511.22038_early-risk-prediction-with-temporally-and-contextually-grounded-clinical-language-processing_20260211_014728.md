# Early Risk Prediction with Temporally and Contextually Grounded Clinical Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22038
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22038
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: HIT-GNN achieves superior predictive performance and robustness, especially on immediate-risk horizon, while REVEAL provides interpretable predictions through verified rationales.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two complementary methods for clinical risk prediction from longitudinal notes: HIT-GNN, a temporally grounded dynamic graph neural network augmented with clinical knowledge graphs, and REVEAL, a test-time LLM scaling framework for interpretable predictions. HIT-GNN achieves superior predictive performance and robustness, especially on the immediate-risk horizon, while remaining computationally efficient, with ablations confirming the importance of both fine-grained temporal structure and external knowledge enrichment. REVEAL provides a promising balance between performance and explainability through verified rationales. Notably, even large models like GPT-4o show limited zero-shot performance on this complex clinical task. Demographic fairness analysis indicates how clinical data can encode bias without explicit sensitive attribute modeling. Our temporally realistic cohorts, created by filtering post-diagnosis notes, avoid data leakage often overlooked in prior work.

## Method Summary
The study develops HIT-GNN, which extracts temporal event graphs from clinical notes using SPANTREX for temporal relation extraction and MetaMap for entity linking to UMLS. Node representations combine BioMedBERT contextual embeddings with pre-trained UMLS knowledge graph embeddings. A 2-layer GraphSAGE with mean aggregation and layer normalization processes each note's temporal graph, followed by BiLSTM modeling across visits, with final prediction via fully connected layer and sigmoid. REVEAL uses a frozen LLaMA3.1-8B reasoner to generate multiple reasoning paths with predictions, then a fine-tuned LLaMA3.2-1B verifier scores each path's credibility, with final prediction via majority vote among top-k scored paths. The framework uses propensity-score matching for fair cohort creation and filters post-diagnosis notes to prevent data leakage.

## Key Results
- HIT-GNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk prediction, with AUC up to 0.74
- REVEAL provides interpretable predictions through verified rationales while maintaining competitive performance
- Zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4o) show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized approaches
- HIT-GNN remains computationally efficient at 44MB and 0.007s inference versus REVEAL's 17.42GB and 62s inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-grained temporal structure within and across clinical notes improves early disease risk prediction, particularly for near-term horizons.
- Mechanism: HIT-GNN extracts temporal event graphs from individual notes (before/after/overlap relations between clinical entities), then hierarchically aggregates them: intra-visit GNN encodes each note's temporal graph, BiLSTM models inter-visit progression across the patient timeline.
- Core assumption: Disease progression leaves detectable temporal patterns in event sequences (e.g., elevated glucose after corticosteroid use indicates drug-induced hyperglycemia; the same before steroid therapy may signal early T2D onset).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk"
  - [section 4] "This fine-grained temporal knowledge is crucial for understanding disease pathways"
  - [corpus] THCM-CAL paper confirms hierarchical causal modeling improves clinical risk prediction, though focuses on multimodal fusion rather than intra-note temporal graphs
- Break condition: If temporal relation extraction quality is poor (high error rates in before/after labeling), graph structure becomes noise and performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining contextual text embeddings with knowledge graph embeddings provides complementary signals for clinical entity representation.
- Mechanism: Node representations concatenate BioMedBERT span embeddings (capturing contextual semantics) with pre-trained UMLS knowledge graph embeddings (capturing ontological relationships). Ablations show text-only outperforms KG-only, but combination is best.
- Core assumption: Clinical entities benefit from both their document context and their position in medical knowledge hierarchies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ablations confirming the importance of both fine-grained temporal structure and external knowledge enrichment"
  - [section 4.3] "The final node representations are concatenated KG embeddings and text embeddings"
  - [corpus] Knowledge-augmented multimodal EHR modeling paper (arxiv:2508.01970) shows similar gains from knowledge integration, though in different architecture
- Break condition: If entity linking via MetaMap fails or returns incorrect CUIs, KG embeddings add noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Test-time verification with smaller LLMs can distill reasoning from larger models while preserving interpretability.
- Mechanism: REVEAL uses a frozen large LLM (reasoner) to generate N reasoning paths with predictions, then a fine-tuned smaller LLM (verifier) scores each path's credibility. Final prediction via majority vote among top-k scored paths.
- Core assumption: The verifier learns to identify reasoning patterns correlated with correct predictions, even without gold reasoning chains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "REVEAL provides a promising balance between performance and explainability through verified rationales"
  - [section 5] "fine-tuned verifier evaluates the credibility of these paths and assigns a score from 0-1"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific verifier-aided approach in clinical settings
- Break condition: If verifier training data lacks diversity (all reasoner paths agree), the verifier cannot learn discriminative patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Temporal Relation Extraction**
  - Why needed here: Core preprocessing step that converts unstructured clinical notes into event-temporal graphs (nodes=entities, edges=before/after/overlap relations).
  - Quick check question: Given "Patient started metformin after elevated HbA1c was noted," can you identify the two events and their temporal relation?

- Concept: **Graph Neural Networks with Heterogeneous Edges**
  - Why needed here: HIT-GNN's temporal graphs contain both temporal edges (before/overlap) and semantic edges (UMLS is-a, treats). Mean aggregation in GraphSAGE must handle this mix.
  - Quick check question: Why might standard GCN (which treats all edges identically) underperform on graphs with semantically distinct edge types?

- Concept: **Test-Time Compute Scaling**
  - Why needed here: REVEAL's verifier-aided approach scales inference compute (generating N paths) rather than model size, trading latency for improved accuracy.
  - Quick check question: If inference latency budget is 5 seconds per patient and each reasoning path takes 6 seconds, is REVEAL feasible?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Clinical notes → TREx temporal extraction → MetaMap entity linking → UMLS augmentation → Timegraph reduction → Node embeddings (BioMedBERT + KG)
  - **HIT-GNN Core**: GraphSAGE (2 layers, mean aggregation, layer norm) → Mean pooling → BiLSTM across visits → FC + Sigmoid
  - **REVEAL Pipeline**: Frozen LLaMA3.1-8B reasoner (10 paths) → Fine-tuned LLaMA3.2-1B verifier → Top-k majority vote

- Critical path: Temporal graph extraction quality is the upstream bottleneck. MetaMap API is single-threaded (~42 sec/note for PH corpus). Budget preprocessing time accordingly.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GNN requires 5 notes for best performance (structured summary); LLM requires only 2 notes (full text context window limits)
  - HIT-GNN: 44MB, 0.007s inference vs. REVEAL: 17.42GB, 62s inference (10 paths)
  - REVEAL preserves explanations; supervised fine-tuning (LLaMA3.2-1B-ft) achieves slightly higher AUC on MIMIC-IV but no interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Near-chance performance with zero-shot LLMs: LLaMA3.2-1B classifies almost all as NoD (see Table 2, Recall=0 for T2D)
  - High DPD for minority groups: Models show negative demographic parity for Hispanics, Asians, Unknown race
  - MIMIC-IV underperforms PH corpus: Single-visit records (84.5%) lack longitudinal trajectory

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline sanity check**: Run LLaMA3.1-8B zero-shot on 10 patients, verify outputs are valid True/False; if >5% invalid, check prompt formatting
  2. **Temporal extraction quality audit**: Manually review 20 extracted temporal graphs against source notes; if >30% of relations are incorrect, tune TREx thresholds before proceeding
  3. **Embedding ablation**: Train HIT-GNN with text-only embeddings, then add KG embeddings; expect 2-5 AUC improvement (Figure 4a); if degradation occurs, check CUI linking accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of text-extracted temporal graphs with structured EHR data and medical imaging impact the predictive performance of the HIT-GNN framework compared to text-only inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states, "Incorporating multimodal data by integrating text-extracted temporal graphs with structured EHR and medical imaging could further enrich the representations."
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses exclusively on unstructured clinical notes and derived knowledge graphs, leaving the potential synergy with structured codes and imaging data unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of a multimodal HIT-GNN extension against the text-only baseline on the same T2D prediction task, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in AUC or F1 scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can graph-derived temporal insights from HIT-GNN be systematically aligned with natural language rationales from the REVEAL framework to produce a unified, clinician-trusted explanation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes, "Aligning graph-derived insights with LLM-generated rationales may enhance interpretability and foster clinician trust."
- Why unresolved: While both methods offer interpretability (graph paths vs. verbal rationales), they operate as distinct, complementary approaches; their outputs are not currently integrated or reconciled.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with clinical experts measuring trust scores and decision confidence when presented with aligned explanations versus independent model outputs, alongside qualitative analysis of consistency between the two reasoning forms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific bias mitigation techniques are required to reduce the demographic parity differences (e.g., against Hispanic subgroups) observed in HIT-GNN without degrading overall predictive accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Ethics Statement and Limitations section identify "bias mitigation to ensure equitable early detection" as a necessary future step, noting that "clinical data can encode bias."
- Why unresolved: The paper analyzes fairness metrics (DPD, EOD) and identifies disparities (e.g., HIT-GNN showing negative DPD for Hispanics), but it does not implement or test algorithmic interventions to correct them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying fairness constraints (e.g., adversarial debiasing) to the model training, resulting in reduced DPD/EOD disparities while maintaining the reported AUC of ~72% on the PH corpus.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How effectively does the proposed framework generalize to cross-institutional settings with diverse entity types, vocabularies, and note formats without extensive manual re-curation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section identifies "Cross-institutional adaptation to handle diverse entity types and formats" as a "promising direction" that is not yet addressed.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses two specific datasets (PH and MIMIC-IV), and while generalizability is suggested, adaptation to significantly different EHR structures and entity schemas remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot or few-shot transfer learning results where a model trained on the PH corpus is evaluated on a structurally distinct external hospital dataset, showing minimal performance degradation compared to the source domain.

## Limitations

- Temporal graph extraction quality is critical and sensitive to TREx and MetaMap performance, with errors propagating through the entire HIT-GNN pipeline
- The framework shows demographic fairness disparities, with negative demographic parity differences for Hispanic, Asian, and Unknown race subgroups
- Generalization to cross-institutional settings with diverse entity types and formats remains untested and is identified as a key limitation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: HIT-GNN achieves superior predictive performance and robustness, especially on the immediate-risk horizon (supported by multiple ablation studies and comparative experiments)
- **Medium Confidence**: REVEAL provides a promising balance between performance and explainability through verified rationales (promising results but limited by unknown training details)
- **Low Confidence**: Demographic fairness analysis conclusions (limited to single dataset analysis with potential confounding factors)

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Extraction Audit**: Manually validate 50 random temporal graphs against source notes to quantify relation extraction accuracy; establish quality threshold before proceeding with full model training
2. **Embedding Quality Check**: Compare node embeddings generated with BioMedBERT alone versus combined with KG embeddings on a held-out set to verify the expected 2-5 AUC improvement from ablation results
3. **Cross-Cohort Robustness Test**: Train models on PH corpus and test on MIMIC-IV (and vice versa) to validate claims about temporal structure importance beyond dataset-specific patterns
