# Patient-Zero: A Unified Framework for Real-Record-Free Patient Agent Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11078
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthetic patient records are statistically indistinguishable from real records by physicians, with downstream model gains of +24.0% MedQA and +14.5% MMLU

## Executive Summary
Patient-Zero introduces a framework for generating realistic synthetic patient records without using real medical data. The system uses a Medically-Aligned Hierarchical Synthesis pipeline that decomposes patient generation into sequential conditional dependencies anchored in clinical guidelines. A Dual-Track Cognitive Memory System ensures logical consistency and persona adherence during interactive simulation. Human evaluations by licensed physicians found the synthetic data statistically indistinguishable from real human-authored records, with superior clinical quality. Downstream model training on the synthetic dataset achieved substantial performance gains, demonstrating its practical utility.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a four-stage hierarchical synthesis pipeline: disease concept outlines parsed from medical literature, stratified attribute sampling with epidemiological priors, symptom progression modeling, and quantitative examination expansion. Each stage includes verify-and-regenerate checkpoints. A Dual-Track Cognitive Memory System maintains static semantic facts and dynamic episodic dialogue logs, with a Natural Language Inference verifier gating memory updates to prevent contradictions. The system was trained on 60,000 synthetic records across six specialties using Qwen3-8B with GRPO optimization.

## Key Results
- Synthetic records achieved Perplexity of 4.89 and Entity Diversity of 0.846, outperforming baselines
- Human evaluations by 11 licensed physicians found synthetic records statistically indistinguishable from real records (p > 0.05)
- Downstream model training on synthetic data improved MedQA performance by 24.0% and MMLU by 14.5%
- Logical consistency in interactive simulation reached 94.8% with minimal hallucination rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Causal Chain Decomposition
The framework factorizes patient generation into sequential conditional dependencies, improving clinical validity and reducing error propagation. A 4-stage causal chain (c→O→B→S→E) decomposes generation from abstract disease concepts through standardized outlines to patient profiles, symptom trajectories, and quantitative examination results. Each stage operates on structured outputs from previous stages with explicit verify-and-regenerate checkpoints.

### Mechanism 2: NLI-Gated Memory Evolution
A Natural Language Inference verifier resolves responses into entailment, contradiction, or neutral categories, enabling consistent long-horizon dialogue while permitting controlled memory expansion. The Dual-Track Cognitive Memory system decomposes agent state into static semantic memory (atomic facts) and dynamic episodic memory (conversation log). Candidate responses pass through an NLI-Verifier that rejects contradictions, preserves state on entailment, and expands episodic memory on neutral new information.

### Mechanism 3: Constrained Attribute Permutation with Epidemiological Priors
The framework decouples demographic attribute selection from text generation via stratified sampling with rejection constraints. Rather than letting the LLM freely generate patient demographics, it samples attribute vectors from explicit prior distributions across four SDOH dimensions (biological, socioeconomic, behavioral, family). An indicator function performs rejection sampling to eliminate logical impossibilities before conditioning text generation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Entailment Relations:** The NLI-Verifier is the core gating mechanism for memory updates; understanding entailment/contradiction/neutral classifications is essential to debug why responses are rejected or accepted. Quick check: Given "patient has no known allergies," would "I've never had an allergic reaction" be entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

- **Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Sequential Decision-Making:** The paper explicitly frames dialogue consistency as resolving this trade-off; understanding it clarifies why two memory tracks are necessary rather than a single buffer. Quick check: In a 20-turn medical dialogue, what would happen if the agent could only update memory but had no mechanism to protect core facts?

- **Rejection Sampling with Logical Constraints:** The epidemiological attribute permutation uses rejection sampling to eliminate impossible attribute combinations before generation. Quick check: If sampling produces (Age: 8, Condition: Menopause), should this be accepted, rejected, or trigger a constraint relaxation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Disease outline standardization -> Attribute permutation -> Symptom progression -> Clinical expansion -> Dual-Track Memory (Semantic + Episodic) -> NLI-Verifier -> Verify-and-Regenerate loop
- **Critical path:** Disease outline quality (Stage I) → Attribute sampling validity (Stage II) → Symptom-disease coherence (Stage III) → Exam-symptom consistency (Stage IV). Errors in Stage I compound through all downstream stages.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The paper acknowledges "idealization bias"—synthetic records are cleaner than real EHRs, which physicians flagged as potentially unrealistic. NLI precision vs. recall: Strict contradiction rejection may over-reject plausible but ambiguously worded responses.
- **Failure signatures:** High regeneration rates at Stage I indicate noisy knowledge base sources; low episodic memory expansion suggests NLI-Verifier over-classifying neutral information as contradictions; downstream model overfitting to "idealized" patterns may fail on messy real EHRs.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablate the NLI-Verifier to measure hallucination rate vs. full system; 2) Stress-test attribute priors by skewing distributions and verifying rejection sampling; 3) Cross-distribution validation by training on synthetic data and testing on held-out real EHR data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the "idealization bias" inherent in guideline-anchored synthesis degrade the robustness of downstream models when facing the noise and incompleteness of real-world clinical environments? While synthetic data is cleaner, it is unknown if training on structurally perfect records makes models brittle to the messy, chaotic nature of actual electronic health records. Comparative robustness evaluations of models trained on Patient-Zero data versus real data when subjected to varying levels of synthetic noise would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the ab initio framework be systematically extended to generate holistic multimodal patient records that integrate visual (imaging) and signal-based (e.g., ECG) data? The current framework relies heavily on text-based hierarchical synthesis; extending this to ensure cross-modal consistency (e.g., ensuring an ECG signal matches a textual cardiac history) presents a significant technical challenge. A demonstration of the framework generating paired synthetic text and medical images/signals would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
What is the theoretical relationship between synthetic data scale and downstream reasoning performance, and what is the optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio to maximize utility without hallucinations? While the paper shows significant gains, the precise point where synthetic data scaling yields diminishing returns or increases hallucination risks compared to real data remains undetermined. A theoretical model and empirical curves mapping downstream accuracy against varying ratios of synthetic-to-real training data would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Idealization bias: Synthetic records are cleaner than real EHRs, potentially limiting robustness to noisy real-world inputs
- NLI model performance: The unspecified NLI verifier's medical domain understanding may impact logical consistency and hallucination prevention
- Small human evaluation sample: Only 11 physicians evaluated clinical validity, with limited detail on evaluation protocols and inter-rater reliability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Downstream model performance improvements (MedQA +24.0%, MMLU +14.5%) are well-supported by quantitative benchmarks and controlled training experiments
- **Medium Confidence:** Clinical validity claims from human evaluations are credible but limited by small sample size and lack of detailed evaluation protocols
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about logical consistency and hallucination prevention rely heavily on the unspecified NLI verifier without independent validation of its medical domain performance

## Next Checks

1. **NLI Verifier Validation:** Independently evaluate the NLI model's medical domain performance using a held-out set of medical fact pairs to measure precision/recall of entailment/contradiction classifications
2. **Real-World Distribution Gap:** Compare synthetic data distributions against multiple real EHR datasets to quantify idealization bias and identify systematic gaps
3. **Robustness to Noise:** Test downstream model performance when training on synthetic data versus training on synthetic data augmented with realistic EHR noise (missing values, inconsistent formatting, typos) to assess practical deployment readiness
