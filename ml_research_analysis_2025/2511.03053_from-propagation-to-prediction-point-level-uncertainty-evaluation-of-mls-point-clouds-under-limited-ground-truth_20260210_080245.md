# From Propagation to Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03053
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053
- Authors: Ziyang Xu; Olaf Wysocki; Christoph Holst
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Learning-based uncertainty prediction for MLS point clouds without ground truth, achieving R² ≈ 0.37 using geometric features.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a learning-based framework to predict point-level uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds without requiring comprehensive ground truth data. The method leverages geometric features extracted from local neighborhoods to train regression models that predict Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) distance as an uncertainty metric. Experiments using XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrate comparable accuracy with XGBoost offering approximately three times faster computation. Feature importance analysis identifies height variation, sampling density, and roughness as key predictors of uncertainty, suggesting that MLS point cloud uncertainty is learnable from geometric patterns alone.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts 26 geometric features and optimal neighborhood size for each point, using these as input to regression models (XGBoost/Random Forest) trained to predict C2C distance derived from limited ground truth. The optimal neighborhood size is determined via eigenvalue entropy minimization, which dynamically selects the number of neighbors per point to reduce variance in feature estimation. Points with C2C distances exceeding 80mm are filtered to reduce label noise. The model is evaluated using 5-fold spatial grid cross-validation to prevent data leakage, with performance measured by RMSE, MAE, R², and tolerance-aligned accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieves comparable accuracy to Random Forest (RMSE ≈ 10.9mm, R² ≈ 0.37) but with ~3x faster runtime (74.6s vs 210.5s)
- Height variation, sampling density, and roughness identified as top predictors through SHAP analysis
- Feature importance analysis reveals geometric features can predict point-level uncertainty at moderate accuracy
- Spatial cross-validation prevents overfitting by grouping points on a 3m grid

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Geometric-to-Uncertainty Mapping via Supervised Regression
The framework learns to map local geometric patterns to uncertainty by training regression models on features like density, surface roughness, and height variation. This assumes these geometric characteristics correlate strongly with scanning error magnitude. The approach achieves R² ≈ 0.37, indicating moderate but meaningful predictive capability.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Neighborhood Stabilization
By dynamically selecting optimal neighborhood size per point through eigenvalue entropy minimization, the method reduces variance in geometric feature estimation compared to fixed-radius searches. This stabilization is crucial for capturing local geometric patterns that correlate with uncertainty.

### Mechanism 3: Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-off in Gradient Boosting
XGBoost leverages histogram-based split finding and GPU acceleration to achieve similar accuracy to Random Forest while being approximately three times faster. This efficiency gain makes the approach more practical for deployment on large datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Eigenvalue-based Geometry**: Local geometric features rely on 3D/2D covariance matrices (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃) to derive metrics like linearity and planarity. Quick check: If λ₁ >> λ₂ ≈ λ₃ ≈ 0, what geometric primitive does that likely represent? (Answer: A linear feature or edge).

- **Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) Distance**: The target variable (label) the model learns to predict, acting as a proxy for "uncertainty" when Ground Truth is unavailable. Quick check: Why is C2C distance preferred over M3C2 in this study? (Answer: C2C is more responsive to noise at the individual point level and lacks user-defined scale parameters).

- **Spatial Cross-Validation**: Prevents the model from "cheating" through spatial autocorrelation by using grid-based grouping instead of random splitting. Quick check: How does the paper prevent data leakage during training? (Answer: A 5-fold grid-based strategy where groups are formed on a 3m spatial grid).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw MLS Point Cloud -> Filter C2C > 80mm -> Optimal Neighborhood Estimation (Entropy Minimization) -> Calculate 26 Geometric Features -> XGBoost Regressor -> Predicted C2C distance per point

- **Critical path**: The Feature Engine (specifically OptN calculation) is the computational bottleneck during inference, requiring eigen-decomposition for variable k-NN searches per point.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Tree ensembles offer interpretability via SHAP but achieve only modest R² (0.37), suggesting they capture general trends but miss fine-grained variance. Filtering C2C > 80mm improves training stability but may prevent learning of catastrophic outliers.

- **Failure signatures**: High residuals on slender objects, modest R² indicating >60% of variance unexplained by geometric features alone.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement entropy-minimization OptN selection on a small sample and verify eigenvalue stability against fixed k
  2. Train simple Linear Regression on the 26 features to establish lower-bound performance before XGBoost
  3. Remove "Height" and "Density" features (top predictors) to quantify accuracy drop and confirm SHAP findings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the framework generalize effectively across diverse environmental scenes and different MLS platforms? The authors note that external validation is required as experiments were limited to a single indoor industrial environment using one specific scanner.

- Is the full set of 26 geometric features necessary for optimal prediction, or can a smaller subset achieve comparable accuracy? The paper suggests systematic ablation and feature pruning as future work to determine if computational cost is justified by marginal gains.

- Can advanced learning architectures like Graph Neural Networks or physics-informed learning improve upon tree-based model performance? The study focused exclusively on ensemble methods, leaving potential benefits of deep learning unexplored for this task.

## Limitations

- Moderate predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.37) raises questions about generalizability to outdoor scenes and different error sources
- Reliance on geometric features alone may miss uncertainty sources from trajectory errors, temporal drift, or sensor calibration issues
- The 80mm C2C filtering threshold may exclude informative extreme cases while retaining systematic biases
- Optimal neighborhood estimation (eigen-decomposition per point) creates computational bottlenecks for large datasets

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Geometric features can predict point-level uncertainty at moderate accuracy (R² ≈ 0.37); XGBoost provides 3x runtime improvement with comparable accuracy; spatial cross-validation prevents data leakage
- **Medium confidence**: Framework generalizes to outdoor datasets and different error sources; 26-feature set captures most important uncertainty drivers; 80mm filtering optimizes bias-variance tradeoff
- **Low confidence**: Method can predict catastrophic outliers (>80mm C2C); optimal neighborhood significantly outperforms fixed-radius features in all scenarios; approach scales efficiently to massive point clouds without optimization

## Next Checks

1. Apply trained models to an outdoor MLS dataset with different geometric complexity to assess transferability
2. Compare prediction accuracy using fixed k vs. optimal k-neighborhood to quantify adaptive sizing benefits
3. Remove 80mm filtering threshold and retrain to evaluate outlier prediction capability
