# Natural Language Processing for Cardiology: A Narrative Review

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16708
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16708
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Systematic analysis of 265 articles (2014-2025) shows NLP rapidly expanding in cardiology, with EHRs dominating and LLMs becoming the dominant paradigm

## Executive Summary
This narrative review systematically analyzed 265 articles from 2014-2025 to examine how natural language processing (NLP) has been applied to cardiology research. The review identified substantial growth in NLP applications across cardiovascular diseases, with electronic health records dominating as data sources while other types like clinical trials and telehealth data remain underexplored. Deep learning methods, particularly large language models, have become the dominant paradigm, showing significant improvements in tasks like risk prediction and report analysis. The review highlights key challenges including model interpretability, trustworthiness for patient-facing applications, and data privacy compliance. Future directions include developing interpretable LLMs, multi-modal approaches combining text with imaging and signals, and expanding open-source tools to democratize AI access in cardiology.

## Method Summary
The review employed a 3-stage pipeline across 6 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, DBLP) using Boolean searches with cardiovascular and NLP keywords. After deduplication, RobotAnalyst or similar tools screened titles/abstracts against exclusion criteria (non-cardiology, non-text methods, reviews, corpus-only, non-English). Full-text review retained 258 articles, which were manually classified by NLP paradigm, task type, disease type, and data source using schemas in Figures 2-7 and Tables 2-4.

## Key Results
- Electronic health records dominate as data sources (82.4% of studies)
- Deep learning methods, particularly large language models, have become the dominant paradigm
- Risk prediction and information extraction are the most common application areas
- Model interpretability and data privacy remain significant challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: EHR Text Extraction Pipeline
- Claim: Unstructured clinical text can be systematically converted to structured data for cardiovascular phenotyping and risk prediction.
- Mechanism: Clinical notes/reports → NLP extraction (rule-based patterns or learned representations) → structured entities/measurements → downstream classification or prediction models.
- Core assumption: Documentation practices contain sufficiently consistent linguistic patterns that extraction methods can generalize across institutions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Electronic health records dominating as data sources"; [section] "82.4% of the data sources"; Nath's EchoInfer "accurately extracted 80 cardiac concepts from 15,116 echocardiogram reports"
- Break condition: Cross-institutional documentation variability causes extraction accuracy to drop below clinical utility threshold; no external validation performed.

### Mechanism 2: LLM Paradigm Shift via In-Context Learning
- Claim: Large language models enable unified task handling across diverse cardiology applications without task-specific architecture changes.
- Mechanism: Massive pre-training → emergent language understanding → task specification via prompting → zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to cardiology tasks (prediction, extraction, generation).
- Core assumption: Cardiovascular domain knowledge transfers from general pre-training corpus and can be elicited through prompt engineering.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Deep learning methods, particularly large language models, have become the dominant paradigm"; [section] "LLMs have become an emerging dominant paradigm in cardiology, significantly outperforming previous methods in risk prediction for cardiovascular diseases"
- Break condition: Hallucination rate exceeds acceptable threshold for clinical deployment; prompt sensitivity causes unreliable outputs.

### Mechanism 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Clinical Grounding
- Claim: Augmenting LLMs with retrieved external knowledge improves factual accuracy for cardiology question-answering and decision support.
- Mechanism: Clinical query → retrieval from structured knowledge sources (guidelines, literature) → context augmentation → grounded generation.
- Core assumption: Retrieved knowledge is current, accurate, and properly scoped to the clinical context.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Hayama et al. comprehensively evaluated RAG-based LLMs... proving external knowledge useful for QA tasks"; "retrieval-augmented generation boosts the factuality and richness of their generated text"
- Break condition: Knowledge base contains outdated clinical guidelines; retrieval retrieves irrelevant or contradictory information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition in Clinical Text
  - Why needed here: Information extraction (attribute/entity extraction at 31.6% each) underlies most downstream tasks; clinical abbreviations and negation handling are non-trivial.
  - Quick check question: How would your extraction system handle "denies chest pain" vs. "reports chest pain" in a progress note?

- Concept: Transformer Attention vs. Sequential Models
  - Why needed here: The field evolved from RNNs (LSTM/GRU) to Transformers (BERT, LLMs); understanding attention mechanisms is essential for interpreting model behavior.
  - Quick check question: Why might a transformer model capture long-range dependencies in a lengthy discharge summary better than an LSTM?

- Concept: Domain Adaptation Strategies
  - Why needed here: BioBERT and ClinicalBERT are cited as outperforming general models; understanding pre-training domain shift is critical for model selection.
  - Quick check question: When would you choose ClinicalBERT over BioBERT for analyzing echocardiogram reports?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion (EHR extracts) → preprocessing (de-identification, tokenization) → model layer (rule-based / traditional ML / PLM / LLM) → task head (classification, extraction, generation) → output validation → clinical integration
- Critical path: Gaining access to de-identified EHR data is the primary bottleneck; the review notes data privacy compliance remains under-addressed in most studies.
- Design tradeoffs: Rule-based systems offer full interpretability and auditability but fail on linguistic variation; LLMs handle variation robustly but lack transparent reasoning chains and may hallucinate.
- Failure signatures:
  - Strong performance on development institution data with >15% accuracy drop on external validation
  - Extracted ejection fraction values conflict with structured database fields
  - LLM generates cardiology advice that contradicts current clinical guidelines
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Establish rule-based extraction baseline for LVEF values from echocardiogram reports; measure precision/recall against manual annotation
  2. Compare general BERT vs. BioBERT vs. ClinicalBERT fine-tuning on a cardiac measurement classification task using held-out reports
  3. Build RAG pipeline with cardiology clinical guidelines as the knowledge base; evaluate QA accuracy against cardiology board-style questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be modified to provide transparent, interpretable reasoning for clinical decision-making in cardiology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review identifies "Interpretable Large Language Models" as a primary future direction, noting that current "black-box" reasoning remains opaque and unreliable despite high performance.
- Why unresolved: While chain-of-thought prompting exists, the paper highlights that the underlying reasoning linking text to outputs often remains flawed or coincidental, posing safety risks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of hybrid models combining LLMs with rule-based or graph-based methods that offer auditable decision pathways validated by clinicians.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does integrating text with imaging and physiological signals (multi-modal learning) improve performance on cardiology tasks compared to text-only approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "Multi-Modal Methods" as a key future direction, noting the potential to combine clinical text with ECG signals, knowledge graphs, and cardiac MRI images.
- Why unresolved: Current applications rely heavily on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as the dominant data source, with limited exploration into fusing these text sources with other modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies demonstrating statistically significant improvements in risk prediction or diagnosis when unstructured text is fused with signal/image data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What factors influence patient trust and clinical adoption of NLP tools in cardiology, particularly for patient-facing applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 notes that few studies have explored patients' perceptions or the implementation challenges (e.g., clinical workflows, costs) of NLP algorithms.
- Why unresolved: Most research focuses on technical accuracy rather than the "trustworthiness" required for widespread adoption and sustained use by patients and providers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative and quantitative user studies measuring patient confidence and clinician usability of AI-driven tools in real-world clinical settings.

## Limitations
- Review relies heavily on bibliometric trends rather than clinical outcome data
- Most cited studies focus on method development rather than prospective validation in clinical settings
- Dominance of EHR data sources creates potential selection bias due to varying documentation quality across institutions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: EHR text extraction capabilities and their role in cardiovascular phenotyping; growth trends in NLP publications for cardiology (2014-2025)
- **Medium confidence**: LLM performance improvements for cardiology tasks; identified challenges with interpretability and data privacy
- **Low confidence**: Claims about clinical impact without external validation data; generalizability of findings across different healthcare systems

## Next Checks
1. External validation study: Apply top-performing NLP models to EHR data from a different healthcare system to measure performance degradation
2. Clinical workflow integration test: Implement rule-based extraction pipeline in a clinical setting and measure time savings versus manual abstraction
3. LLM reliability assessment: Conduct prompt sensitivity analysis by varying prompts for the same clinical scenarios to measure output consistency
