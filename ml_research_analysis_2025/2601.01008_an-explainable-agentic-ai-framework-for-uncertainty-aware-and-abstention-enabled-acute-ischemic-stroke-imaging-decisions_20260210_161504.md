# An Explainable Agentic AI Framework for Uncertainty-Aware and Abstention-Enabled Acute Ischemic Stroke Imaging Decisions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01008
- Authors: Md Rashadul Islam
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Introduces explainable agentic AI framework integrating lesion-aware perception, uncertainty estimation, and abstention mechanisms for safe acute stroke imaging decisions.

## Executive Summary
This work presents a novel explainable agentic AI framework designed to enhance safety and interpretability in acute ischemic stroke imaging. The framework employs a modular agentic pipeline that enables uncertainty-driven abstention, allowing the system to withhold predictions when diagnostic confidence is insufficient. Through qualitative analyses across representative stroke imaging scenarios, the framework demonstrates its ability to identify high-uncertainty cases and defer decisions appropriately, providing visual explanations for both predictions and abstentions. The work emphasizes that selective abstention, uncertainty awareness, and explainability are essential for developing safe and trustworthy medical imaging AI systems in high-risk clinical settings.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a three-agent modular pipeline: (1) Perception agent extracts lesion-aware features from slice-level brain imaging data using deep learning; (2) Uncertainty estimation agent computes normalized slice-level epistemic uncertainty scores; (3) Decision agent applies a safety threshold τ to determine whether to output a prediction or abstention signal. The system includes a saliency-based explainability module that generates visual explanations for both predictions and abstentions. The approach is designed to align with clinical reasoning by enabling the system to naturally defer on diagnostically ambiguous regions and low-information slices.

## Key Results
- Framework demonstrates uncertainty-driven abstention in diagnostically ambiguous regions and low-information slices
- Provides visual explanations for both predictions and abstentions, improving transparency
- Qualitative analyses show system's ability to identify high-uncertainty cases and defer appropriately
- Modular agentic design mirrors clinical radiologist workflow

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Uncertainty-driven abstention reduces unsafe predictions in ambiguous imaging regions
- Mechanism: Decision agent compares normalized uncertainty score against safety threshold τ; abstains when uncertainty exceeds τ
- Core assumption: Slice-level epistemic uncertainty correlates with diagnostic ambiguity
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section III.D describe threshold-based abstention; corpus papers focus on segmentation without explicit abstention
- Break condition: Poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates lead to inappropriate abstention frequency

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Slice-wise uncertainty profiles localize diagnostic ambiguity to specific anatomical regions
- Mechanism: Uncertainty estimation agent computes normalized uncertainty per slice, capturing local factors like low contrast or partial lesion visibility
- Core assumption: Diagnostic uncertainty is spatially heterogeneous across volumetric scans
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section IV.A describe slice-level uncertainty profiling; corpus papers lack slice-level uncertainty reporting
- Break condition: Feature representations fail to capture lesion-relevant attributes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modular separation of perception, uncertainty estimation, and decision control enables interpretable reasoning
- Mechanism: Hierarchical pipeline where each agent operates on prior agent's output, enabling independent inspection
- Core assumption: Intermediate representations contain sufficient information for uncertainty estimation
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section III.A describe modular decoupling; mAIstro [18] uses agentic design without explicit abstention
- Break condition: Poor agent interfaces cause information loss and performance degradation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Framework relies on epistemic uncertainty to trigger abstention; distinguishing from aleatoric uncertainty prevents deferring on noisy but confidently handled cases
  - Quick check question: Given motion artifacts vs. unusual lesion pattern, which produces higher epistemic uncertainty in well-trained model?

- Concept: Selective Prediction / Abstention-Aware Learning
  - Why needed here: Decision agent implements selective prediction by withholding outputs when confidence is insufficient
  - Quick check question: If lowering τ from 0.3 to 0.2 increases abstention from 15% to 40%, what happens to error rate on remaining predictions?

- Concept: Agentic / Multi-Stage AI Architectures
  - Why needed here: Framework decomposes stroke imaging decisions into specialized agents rather than monolithic end-to-end model
  - Quick check question: What are advantages of separating perception agent from decision agent versus single model outputting prediction or abstention flag?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Perception Agent (feature extraction) -> Uncertainty Estimation Agent (slice-level confidence) -> Decision Agent (threshold comparison) -> Output (prediction OR abstention with explanation)

- Critical path: Acute stroke imaging input → Perception Agent → Uncertainty Estimation Agent → Decision Agent → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Safety vs. Coverage: Lower τ increases abstention (safer but less useful); higher τ increases coverage but risks unsafe predictions
  - Modularity vs. Optimization: Separating agents improves interpretability but may sacrifice joint optimization benefits
  - Qualitative vs. Quantitative Validation: Current framework emphasizes qualitative behavioral analysis; quantitative benchmarking would strengthen claims

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-abstention: System abstains on most diagnostically clear slices
  - Under-abstention: System predicts confidently on ambiguous or low-quality slices
  - Inconsistent slice behavior: Uncertainty fluctuates erratically without anatomical justification
  - Uninformative explanations: Saliency maps highlight irrelevant regions or fail to clarify abstention rationale

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Threshold calibration study: Vary τ across validation set and plot abstention rate vs. prediction error rate
  2. Slice-level uncertainty validation: Correlate uncertainty scores with expert radiologist ambiguity ratings
  3. Explanation fidelity assessment: Measure clinicians' ability to predict model behavior based on saliency visualizations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How should uncertainty threshold τ be optimally calibrated to balance sensitivity and deferral rates in acute stroke imaging?
- How do model-derived uncertainty estimates correlate with human expert uncertainty assessments in ambiguous stroke cases?
- Does the framework generalize across multi-center cohorts with diverse patho-anatomic heterogeneity and imaging protocols?
- What are measurable clinical impacts of uncertainty-aware abstention on decision-making workflows and patient outcomes?

## Limitations
- No quantitative benchmarks or performance metrics provided, limiting generalizability
- Neural network architectures and training configurations are underspecified
- Framework assumes slice-level epistemic uncertainty correlates with clinical diagnostic ambiguity without empirical validation
- Dataset details and case numbers are not disclosed

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (uncertainty-driven abstention): Medium - Conceptually sound but lacks quantitative validation of threshold calibration
- Mechanism 2 (slice-wise uncertainty profiling): Medium - Intuitively plausible but not empirically verified against expert uncertainty ratings
- Mechanism 3 (modular agentic architecture): High - Well-established design principle, though benefits vs. end-to-end optimization are not quantified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct threshold calibration study: Sweep τ across validation set and plot abstention rate vs. prediction error rate to identify optimal operating point
2. Validate uncertainty estimates: Correlate model uncertainty scores with expert radiologist ambiguity ratings on held-out cases
3. Assess explanation fidelity: Test whether clinicians can correctly predict model behavior (prediction vs. abstention) based solely on provided saliency explanations
