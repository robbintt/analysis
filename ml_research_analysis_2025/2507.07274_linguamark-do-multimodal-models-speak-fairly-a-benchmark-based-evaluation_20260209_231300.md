# LinguaMark: Do Multimodal Models Speak Fairly? A Benchmark-Based Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07274
- Reference count: 37
- Models are evaluated for bias and performance across 11 languages and five social attributes

## Executive Summary
LinguaMark introduces a benchmark for evaluating multilingual fairness in large multimodal models across diverse languages and social attributes. The benchmark comprises a multilingual Visual Question Answering dataset spanning 11 languages and five social categories, with human-verified translations and GPT-4o-based prompt evaluation. Models are assessed on three metrics: bias, answer relevancy, and faithfulness. Results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2.5 achieve the highest overall performance, while Qwen2.5 shows strong generalization across low-resource languages. Gender emerges as the most biased attribute, and languages like Tamil and Urdu exhibit the lowest performance.

## Method Summary
LinguaMark addresses the challenge of evaluating multilingual fairness and performance in large multimodal models through a comprehensive benchmark approach. The methodology introduces a multilingual Visual Question Answering dataset covering 11 languages and five social categories, utilizing human-verified translations and GPT-4o-based prompt evaluation for assessment. Models are evaluated using three distinct metrics: bias measurement to identify discriminatory patterns, answer relevancy to assess contextual appropriateness, and faithfulness to verify factual accuracy. The benchmark and evaluation code are publicly released to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in multimodal fairness assessment.

## Key Results
- Closed-source models GPT-4o and Gemini2.5 achieve highest overall performance across all evaluation metrics
- Gender emerges as the most biased social attribute across all evaluated models
- Tamil and Urdu exhibit the lowest performance scores among the 11 languages tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive approach to evaluating both performance and fairness simultaneously. By combining human-verified translations with GPT-4o-based evaluation, it creates a robust assessment framework that captures both technical accuracy and social bias. The three-metric evaluation system (bias, relevancy, faithfulness) provides a holistic view of model behavior across linguistic and social dimensions, enabling identification of specific failure modes in multilingual contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Model Architecture** - Why needed: Understanding how visual and textual information are processed together in foundation models is essential for evaluating their fairness characteristics. Quick check: Review the basic transformer architecture and attention mechanisms used in multimodal systems.

**Bias Measurement in AI Systems** - Why needed: Establishing reliable methods for quantifying bias across different social attributes and languages requires understanding both statistical methods and social science frameworks. Quick check: Examine standard bias metrics like demographic parity and equal opportunity in classification tasks.

**Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning** - Why needed: Low-resource languages present unique challenges in multimodal models, making it crucial to understand how knowledge transfers between high-resource and low-resource language pairs. Quick check: Study techniques like translation-based pretraining and multilingual embeddings for resource-constrained languages.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Translation Verification -> Model Evaluation -> Bias Assessment -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline flows from dataset preparation through GPT-4o-based assessment to final bias and performance calculations. Each stage must complete successfully for reliable results.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of GPT-4o for evaluation provides human-level assessment but introduces potential bias in the evaluation itself. The five-category social attribute framework balances comprehensiveness with practical evaluation feasibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation typically manifests as language-specific accuracy drops, with Tamil and Urdu showing the most severe issues. Gender bias appears consistently across all models, suggesting systematic rather than random failures.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Evaluate model performance on English-only subset to establish baseline
2. Compare bias scores across social attributes within a single language
3. Test cross-lingual transfer by evaluating models trained on high-resource languages on low-resource language tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on GPT-4o evaluation, which may introduce evaluation bias and miss cultural nuances
- Five social categories may not comprehensively represent all dimensions of bias in multimodal models
- United States-centric dataset limits generalizability to other cultural contexts

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) outperform open-source alternatives across multiple languages and metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: Gender exhibits highest bias levels, though sociological validation is needed. Performance disparities across languages are observed but may be influenced by dataset size variations.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-cultural validation studies with human evaluators from diverse linguistic backgrounds to verify consistency of bias measurements across different cultural contexts.

2. Implement alternative evaluation metrics using multiple automated systems beyond GPT-4o to assess answer relevancy and faithfulness, comparing results for consistency.

3. Expand social attribute coverage beyond current five categories to include socioeconomic status, disability, and intersectional identities, then re-evaluate model performance across these expanded categories.
