core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of generating causally aligned
  curricula in reinforcement learning, where the key challenge is ensuring that source
  tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task, particularly
  in the presence of unobserved confounders. The authors develop a sufficient graphical
  criterion to characterize causally aligned source tasks and provide an efficient
  algorithm to generate such tasks based on qualitative causal knowledge.

# Causally Aligned Curriculum Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16799

- Key outcome: Causally aligned curricula significantly improve RL performance in confounded environments by ensuring source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of curriculum learning in reinforcement learning when unobserved confounders are present. The authors identify that traditional curriculum generators often fail in such settings because they may produce source tasks that share surface-level similarities with the target but have different optimal decision rules due to hidden confounding variables. They introduce a novel theoretical framework based on causal inference that provides a sufficient graphical criterion for determining when source tasks can effectively transfer knowledge to a target task despite unobserved confounders. The framework leads to practical algorithms for generating causally aligned curricula and augmenting existing curriculum generators to ensure alignment with the target task's optimal policy.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a causal framework for curriculum learning that addresses the problem of unobserved confounders through graphical criteria. The core approach involves using causal graphs to characterize when source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task. The authors derive a sufficient graphical criterion that identifies causally aligned source tasks based on qualitative causal knowledge. They provide an efficient algorithm to generate such tasks and introduce a causal augmentation procedure that can be applied to existing curriculum generators to ensure alignment. The method leverages structural causal models to reason about the transfer of optimal policies across tasks with different observation spaces while maintaining invariant decision rules despite hidden confounding.

## Key Results
- Causally augmented curriculum generators significantly outperform non-causal baselines on confounded environments with pixel observations
- The method achieves successful convergence on Colored Sokoban and Button Maze tasks where traditional curriculum approaches fail
- Causal alignment ensures transfer of optimal decision rules despite unobserved confounders, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing curriculum learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by ensuring that source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task through causal alignment, rather than merely sharing surface-level similarities. By using causal graphs to characterize the relationships between variables, the method can identify when transfer of optimal policies is guaranteed despite unobserved confounders. The causal augmentation procedure modifies existing curriculum generators to preserve this alignment property, ensuring that the generated source tasks maintain the necessary causal structure for effective transfer learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Graphs**: Graphical models representing causal relationships between variables; needed to formally characterize when source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with target tasks; quick check: verify the graph correctly captures all observed and hypothesized causal relationships
- **Unobserved Confounders**: Hidden variables that influence both actions and outcomes; critical because they can create spurious correlations that break transfer learning; quick check: identify potential confounders through domain knowledge or sensitivity analysis
- **Invariant Optimal Decision Rules**: Decision policies that remain optimal across different tasks despite varying observations; essential for ensuring transfer learning works when observation spaces differ; quick check: verify that the optimal policy structure is preserved across source and target tasks
- **Structural Causal Models**: Formal framework for representing causal relationships with functional dependencies; provides the mathematical foundation for reasoning about policy transfer; quick check: validate model assumptions through conditional independence tests
- **Curriculum Alignment**: The property that source tasks effectively prepare an agent for the target task; needed to ensure learning progress rather than interference; quick check: measure transfer performance on validation tasks during curriculum generation
- **Causal Augmentation**: Procedure to modify existing curriculum generators to preserve causal alignment; enables integration with established methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees; quick check: verify augmented generator produces tasks meeting alignment criteria

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Curriculum Generator -> Causal Alignment Checker -> Source Task Generator -> Environment Interface -> Agent Training Loop

**Critical Path**
1. Define target task and causal graph
2. Apply causal alignment criterion to evaluate potential source tasks
3. Generate or filter source tasks meeting alignment requirements
4. Train agent on aligned curriculum
5. Transfer to target task

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades computational overhead from causal checking against improved transfer success rates. Requiring qualitative causal knowledge limits applicability but ensures theoretical guarantees. The approach favors correctness over generality, making strong assumptions about causal structure availability.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor transfer performance despite curriculum learning indicates misalignment
- High variance in training signals suggests confounding effects
- Failure to generate sufficient source tasks may indicate overly strict alignment criteria
- Computational bottlenecks in causal checking for complex graphs

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate causal alignment criterion on simple confounded environments with known ground truth
2. Compare transfer performance with and without causal augmentation on standard curriculum learning benchmarks
3. Test sensitivity to misspecified causal graphs by systematically varying structural assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework relies on qualitative causal knowledge that may be difficult to elicit or validate in practice
- Empirical evaluation covers a relatively narrow set of confounded pixel-based environments, limiting generalizability
- The causal augmentation procedure assumes access to modifiable curriculum generators, potentially excluding some existing methods
- The approach makes strong assumptions about the availability and accuracy of causal structures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical derivation of sufficient graphical criterion for causal alignment
- **High confidence**: Correctness of algorithm for generating causally aligned source tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of causal augmentation procedure based on limited empirical evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: Practical utility given challenges in eliciting accurate causal structures

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate causally augmented curriculum generators on broader RL benchmarks beyond pixel-based confounded environments, including continuous control and Atari games
2. Conduct user study to assess difficulty of specifying accurate causal structures and quantify impact of imperfect causal knowledge
3. Compare against wider range of curriculum learning approaches, including skill-based and state-space curricula, to better contextualize performance improvements
