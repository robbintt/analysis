core_contribution: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with
  visual observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the high-dimensional

# Medical Vision Language Models as Medical Policies for Robotic Surgery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.06064
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06064
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: Vision-based PPO struggles with surgical tasks due to high-dimensional visual input and sparse rewards; MedFlamingo integration achieves 70%+ success rates across five laparoscopic environments with 66.67% to 1114.29% improvements over baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of using vision-based reinforcement learning for robotic laparoscopic surgery by integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The authors demonstrate that standard vision-based PPO struggles with the high-dimensional nature of visual inputs and sparse rewards in surgical environments. Their approach processes task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, combining medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. MedFlamingo PPO significantly outperforms both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines across five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym.

## Method Summary
The authors propose integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for robotic laparoscopic surgery tasks. The key innovation is processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, which are then combined with real-time visual feedback during execution. This approach addresses the challenges of high-dimensional visual input and sparse rewards in surgical environments by leveraging specialized medical knowledge for planning while maintaining visual feedback for real-time control. The method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym using only endoscopic visual observations.

## Key Results
- MedFlamingo PPO outperforms both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines
- Achieves task success rates exceeding 70% across all five environments
- Improvements range from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates faster convergence compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of medical domain knowledge through MedFlamingo provides crucial context for interpreting surgical visual observations and planning appropriate actions. By processing observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, the method efficiently combines specialized medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. This approach addresses the fundamental challenges of visual observation-based robotic surgery: the high dimensionality of visual inputs makes direct learning from pixels difficult, while sparse rewards in surgical environments provide insufficient guidance for policy optimization. The medical knowledge encoded in MedFlamingo helps extract task-relevant features and generate meaningful plans that guide the PPO policy more effectively than generic visual representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: AI systems that process both visual and textual information simultaneously. Needed because surgical tasks require understanding both what is seen (visual) and what needs to be done (language/instruction). Quick check: Verify the model can correctly interpret surgical scenes and instructions.

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies while maintaining stability through conservative updates. Needed because surgical environments have sparse rewards and require careful policy updates to avoid catastrophic failures. Quick check: Confirm the policy updates remain stable during training.

- **Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating specialized medical knowledge into general AI models. Needed because generic VLMs lack the contextual understanding required for medical decision-making. Quick check: Compare performance against general-purpose VLMs on medical tasks.

- **Token-Based Planning**: Converting complex observations and instructions into discrete planning tokens. Needed because it provides a structured representation that bridges high-level goals with low-level actions. Quick check: Validate that generated tokens meaningfully capture task requirements.

- **Endoscopic Visual Observation**: Using camera-based visual feedback from surgical instruments. Needed because laparoscopic surgery relies entirely on visual information from internal cameras. Quick check: Ensure the visual processing handles the unique characteristics of endoscopic footage.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Observation Input -> MedFlamingo Processing -> Token Generation -> PPO Policy -> Action Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from visual observations through MedFlamingo to generate planning tokens, which are then used by the PPO policy to select actions. This path must efficiently process information while maintaining real-time performance constraints.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The single-shot token generation per episode trades adaptability for computational efficiency. While this reduces the computational burden during execution, it may limit the ability to respond to dynamic changes in the surgical environment. The choice of MedFlamingo over general VLMs prioritizes medical accuracy over broader visual capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Policy collapse when visual observations significantly differ from training scenarios
- Suboptimal performance on tasks requiring dynamic adaptation during execution
- Degraded performance when medical instructions contain ambiguities or novel scenarios

**First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline PPO performance on individual surgical tasks to establish performance floors
2. Evaluate MedFlamingo's ability to correctly interpret surgical scenes and generate appropriate tokens
3. Compare convergence rates between MedFlamingo PPO and baseline methods across all five environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to five simulated laparoscopic tasks in LapGym, which may not reflect real surgical complexity
- Single-shot token generation may limit adaptability to dynamic surgical environments where conditions change during execution
- Performance metrics focus on success rates but don't specify safety, precision, or efficiency dimensions
- Results are based entirely on simulation with unverified translation to physical robotic surgical systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core technical contribution of integrating MedFlamingo with PPO and the observed performance improvements over baselines are well-supported by the results presented.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that specialized medical knowledge provides value in surgical planning is supported, though the specific mechanisms and extent of this benefit require further investigation.
- **Medium confidence**: The efficiency gains from single-shot token generation are demonstrated, but the trade-offs with adaptability and performance in more complex scenarios are not fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on tasks with dynamic environmental changes to assess adaptability of the single-shot planning strategy.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing MedFlamingo to other domain-specific VLM alternatives to isolate the contribution of medical knowledge versus general VLM capabilities.
3. Test the method on a physical robotic surgical platform or higher-fidelity simulation with realistic tissue properties to validate transfer to real surgical applications.
