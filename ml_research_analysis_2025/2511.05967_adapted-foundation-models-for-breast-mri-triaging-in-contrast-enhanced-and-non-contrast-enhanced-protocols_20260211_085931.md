# Adapted Foundation Models for Breast MRI Triaging in Contrast-Enhanced and Non-Contrast Enhanced Protocols

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.05967
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05967
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: A Medical Slice Transformer achieved AUC of 0.77 for breast MRI triaging across contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated a foundation model-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for triaging breast MRI to identify suspicious lesions (BI-RADS ≥4) using abbreviated protocols. The model was tested on four MRI sequence combinations: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm² (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted, and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity thresholds using five-fold cross-validation and AUC analysis. The T1sub+T2w combination achieved the highest AUC of 0.77, with a specificity of 19% at 97.5% sensitivity, while DWI1500+T2w reached 17% specificity. External validation on the Duke dataset yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. The model demonstrated comparable performance between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols, supporting further research for clinical implementation.

## Method Summary
The study utilized a foundation model-based Medical Slice Transformer adapted for breast MRI triaging. The model was trained on 1,425 examinations (6,746 sequences) using five-fold cross-validation and tested on four MRI sequence combinations. Performance was evaluated at three sensitivity thresholds (90%, 95%, and 97.5%) using AUC analysis. External validation was performed on the Duke dataset, and attention maps were generated to assess interpretability. The model demonstrated comparable performance between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols, with the T1sub+T2w combination achieving the highest AUC of 0.77.

## Key Results
- The Medical Slice Transformer achieved an AUC of 0.77 for breast MRI triaging across contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols
- T1sub+T2w combination showed the highest AUC (0.77) with 19% specificity at 97.5% sensitivity
- External validation on Duke dataset yielded AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Medical Slice Transformer (MST)**: A transformer-based architecture adapted for medical imaging analysis, specifically designed to process sequential MRI slices
  - Why needed: Traditional CNNs struggle with capturing long-range dependencies in volumetric medical data
  - Quick check: Verify that the model can process sequential input while maintaining spatial context

- **Attention mechanisms in medical imaging**: Self-attention allows the model to focus on relevant regions across slices and sequences
  - Why needed: Helps identify suspicious lesions by weighing important features across the entire volume
  - Quick check: Evaluate attention map quality and relevance to known lesion locations

- **Contrast-enhanced vs non-contrast protocols**: Testing both protocols to assess model versatility and clinical applicability
  - Why needed: Non-contrast protocols could reduce patient discomfort and costs while maintaining diagnostic capability
  - Quick check: Compare performance metrics between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Foundation Model (MST) -> Breast MRI Sequences (T1sub, DWI1500, T2w) -> Attention Maps -> Classification Output (BI-RADS ≥4)

### Critical Path
Input sequences → Patch embedding → Transformer encoder → Attention mechanism → Classification head → BI-RADS score prediction

### Design Tradeoffs
- Using foundation models provides strong generalization but requires careful adaptation for specific medical tasks
- Abbreviated protocols reduce scan time but may sacrifice diagnostic information
- High sensitivity requirement prioritizes patient safety over specificity

### Failure Signatures
- Low specificity at high sensitivity thresholds indicates many false positives
- Attention maps failing to highlight suspicious regions suggest model misinterpretation
- Performance degradation between internal and external validation indicates overfitting

### First 3 Experiments
1. Test model performance on individual sequences before combining them
2. Evaluate attention map quality using radiologist assessment
3. Compare performance across different sensitivity thresholds to find optimal operating point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Specificity of 17-19% at 97.5% sensitivity may limit clinical utility in reducing radiologist workload
- Dataset composition with only 12% positive cases raises concerns about class imbalance effects
- External validation limited to single institution (Duke dataset) with subjective attention map assessment

## Confidence

### Confidence Assessment:
- **High confidence**: The model architecture and training methodology are sound, and the performance metrics are clearly reported
- **Medium confidence**: The comparison between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced protocols is valid, but the clinical significance of the specificity achieved remains uncertain
- **Medium confidence**: The external validation results are encouraging but based on a single dataset with limited sample size

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-institutional external validation with larger, more diverse patient populations to assess generalizability across different scanner types, protocols, and demographic groups
2. Perform prospective clinical validation to evaluate the model's impact on radiologist workflow efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings
3. Investigate methods to improve specificity while maintaining high sensitivity, such as incorporating additional clinical features or using ensemble approaches with different sequence combinations
