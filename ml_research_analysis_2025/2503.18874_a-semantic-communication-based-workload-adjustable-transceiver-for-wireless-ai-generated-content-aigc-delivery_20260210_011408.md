# A semantic communication-based workload-adjustable transceiver for wireless AI-generated content (AIGC) delivery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18874
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18874
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Combines semantic communication with diffusion-based generative AI for workload-adjustable AIGC delivery, achieving low-latency, high-quality image generation through cooperative edge-local processing under poor channel conditions (0-15 dB SNR) with 12-25 second latency.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ROUTE, a framework that addresses the challenge of delivering high-quality AI-generated content over wireless networks with unstable channels and limited resources. The framework integrates semantic communication with diffusion-based generative AI models to enable workload-adjustable, resource-aware AIGC delivery. By prioritizing semantic information and adjusting denoising steps based on resource availability and channel conditions, ROUTE achieves efficient cooperative edge-local processing that maintains image quality even under poor channel conditions.

The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over conventional methods, reducing latency to 12-25 seconds while preserving image quality with smooth textures and accurate colors at low SNR levels. The workload-adjustable mechanism allows the system to adapt dynamically to varying network conditions and resource constraints, providing a robust solution for wireless AIGC delivery in real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The ROUTE framework combines semantic communication (SemCom) with diffusion-based generative AI models to enable workload-adjustable AIGC delivery. The system prioritizes semantic information over raw pixel data, allowing for more efficient transmission over bandwidth-limited channels. The workload-adjustable aspect enables dynamic adjustment of denoising steps based on available computational resources and channel conditions. The framework employs cooperative edge-local processing, where computationally intensive tasks can be distributed between edge servers and local devices depending on resource availability. This adaptive approach allows the system to maintain high-quality AIGC delivery while optimizing for latency and resource constraints in dynamic wireless environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves low-latency AIGC delivery (12-25 seconds) while maintaining high image quality under poor channel conditions (0-15 dB SNR)
- Maintains smooth textures and accurate colors in generated images despite limited bandwidth and computational resources
- Outperforms conventional approaches through effective workload adjustment and semantic communication prioritization
- Successfully balances communication and computational resource constraints through cooperative edge-local processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ROUTE framework works by leveraging semantic communication to prioritize meaningful information over raw data transmission, reducing bandwidth requirements while preserving content quality. The workload-adjustable mechanism dynamically modifies the number of denoising steps in the diffusion process based on real-time resource availability and channel conditions. This adaptive approach allows the system to maintain acceptable quality levels even when resources are constrained. The cooperative edge-local processing distributes computational tasks between edge servers and local devices, optimizing resource utilization and reducing latency. By integrating these components, ROUTE creates a flexible system that can adapt to varying wireless conditions while maintaining high-quality AIGC delivery.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic Communication (SemCom)**: Why needed - reduces bandwidth requirements by transmitting semantic meaning rather than raw data; Quick check - verifies that semantic information preservation maintains content quality while reducing data volume
- **Diffusion-based Generative AI**: Why needed - provides high-quality image generation with controllable denoising steps; Quick check - confirms that adjustable denoising steps can balance quality and computational requirements
- **Cooperative Edge-Local Processing**: Why needed - distributes computational load to optimize resource utilization and reduce latency; Quick check - ensures effective task distribution between edge servers and local devices
- **Workload-adjustable Framework**: Why needed - enables dynamic adaptation to varying resource availability and channel conditions; Quick check - validates that adjustment mechanisms maintain acceptable performance under resource constraints
- **Channel-aware Resource Allocation**: Why needed - optimizes transmission parameters based on real-time channel conditions; Quick check - confirms that resource allocation decisions improve performance under varying SNR conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Wireless Channel -> Semantic Encoder -> Workload Adjuster -> Diffusion Model -> Edge Server/Local Device -> Image Generator

Critical path: Wireless Channel -> Semantic Encoder -> Workload Adjuster -> Diffusion Model -> Image Generator

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances between computational load distribution (edge vs local) and transmission efficiency (semantic vs raw data). Higher quality requires more denoising steps and bandwidth, while lower quality reduces resource requirements but may compromise content fidelity.

Failure signatures: Poor image quality indicates insufficient computational resources or excessive channel degradation. High latency suggests edge server unavailability or network congestion. Quality degradation under good channel conditions points to workload adjustment misconfiguration.

First experiments:
1. Test framework performance across varying SNR levels (0-30 dB) to establish baseline quality-latency tradeoffs
2. Evaluate workload adjustment effectiveness under different edge server availability scenarios
3. Compare semantic communication transmission with conventional raw data transmission under bandwidth constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on image generation tasks, leaving unclear performance for other AIGC modalities like video or audio
- Workload-adjustable aspect depends on predefined resource constraints with unspecified methodology for determining optimal adjustment thresholds
- Cooperative edge-local processing assumes reliable edge server availability, which may not hold in all deployment scenarios
- Performance impact of semantic communication layer on different AIGC content types beyond tested images remains unverified

## Confidence
- Framework effectiveness: Medium - simulation results show improved performance but lack real-world validation
- Resource adaptation capability: Medium - workload-adjustable mechanism shows promise but adaptive decision-making needs more rigorous definition
- Quality preservation under poor conditions: High - demonstrated ability to maintain image quality at low SNR levels well-supported by results

## Next Checks
1. Deploy the ROUTE framework in a real-world wireless testbed with varying channel conditions and measure end-to-end latency and quality metrics across different AIGC modalities (images, video, audio) to validate simulation results.

2. Conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the workload-adjustment algorithm under varying edge server availability scenarios, including cases with intermittent edge connectivity or resource contention.

3. Evaluate the framework's performance under extreme channel conditions (SNR below 0 dB and above 15 dB) and compare with additional baseline approaches beyond those mentioned in the paper to establish broader performance context.
