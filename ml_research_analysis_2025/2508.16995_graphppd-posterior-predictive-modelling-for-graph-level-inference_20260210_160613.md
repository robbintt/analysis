# GraphPPD: Posterior Predictive Modelling for Graph-Level Inference

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: GraphPPD improves accuracy and uncertainty estimation over standard encoders and MC dropout on graph-level tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GraphPPD, a variational framework for posterior predictive density modelling in graph-level learning. The approach uses a graph encoder (e.g., GIN, GMT, GraphGPS) to generate embeddings, then employs a cross-attention mechanism to condition predictions on a set of labeled graphs. This enables data-adaptive uncertainty estimation without requiring Bayesian inference over model parameters. Experiments on 18 graph classification/regression tasks show that GraphPPD consistently improves accuracy over baseline encoders and Monte Carlo dropout. It also achieves performance close to deep ensembles while using fewer parameters and less training time. Predictive uncertainty from GraphPPD further enhances selective prediction accuracy.

## Method Summary
GraphPPD combines a graph neural network encoder with a cross-attention mechanism to perform posterior predictive modelling for graph-level inference. The framework generates graph embeddings using standard architectures like GIN or GMT, then conditions these embeddings on a set of labeled graphs through cross-attention. This conditioning allows the model to adapt its predictions based on the characteristics of the training data, enabling uncertainty estimation without full Bayesian inference over model parameters. The method optimizes a variational lower bound on the predictive likelihood, making it computationally efficient while maintaining strong performance across various graph classification and regression tasks.

## Key Results
- GraphPPD consistently improves accuracy over baseline encoders and Monte Carlo dropout across 18 graph tasks
- Achieves performance close to deep ensembles while using fewer parameters and less training time
- Predictive uncertainty from GraphPPD enhances selective prediction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GraphPPD works by leveraging cross-attention to condition predictions on a set of labeled graphs, allowing the model to adapt its uncertainty estimates based on the characteristics of the training data. This approach avoids the computational overhead of full Bayesian inference while still providing data-adaptive uncertainty quantification. The cross-attention mechanism effectively captures relationships between the query graph and the conditioning set, enabling more informed predictions. By optimizing a variational lower bound on the predictive likelihood, GraphPPD maintains computational efficiency while achieving strong empirical performance across diverse graph-level tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Essential for generating meaningful graph embeddings; quick check: verify the base encoder can capture relevant graph structure
- **Cross-attention mechanisms**: Enable conditioning on labeled graphs; quick check: ensure attention weights meaningfully reflect graph similarities
- **Variational inference**: Provides the theoretical foundation for uncertainty estimation; quick check: confirm the variational lower bound is properly optimized
- **Posterior predictive distributions**: Core concept for uncertainty quantification; quick check: verify predictive distributions capture data uncertainty
- **Graph-level tasks**: Classification and regression at the graph level; quick check: ensure task-specific evaluation metrics are appropriate

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Graph Encoder -> Cross-Attention -> Predictive Distribution
**Critical Path**: Graph encoding → cross-attention conditioning → uncertainty estimation → prediction
**Design Tradeoffs**: Avoids full Bayesian inference (faster) vs. potentially less flexible than deep ensembles
**Failure Signatures**: Poor conditioning set selection may lead to suboptimal uncertainty estimates; GNN limitations propagate to GraphPPD
**First Experiments**:
1. Compare GraphPPD predictions against ground truth on a held-out set
2. Analyze attention weight distributions to verify meaningful conditioning
3. Evaluate uncertainty calibration using reliability diagrams

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on a fixed set of labeled graphs for conditioning may introduce sensitivity to selection and quality
- Inherits potential limitations from base GNN encoder architecture, particularly regarding graph isomorphism handling
- Experiments focus on 18 tasks, which may not capture all possible graph-level inference scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core claim that GraphPPD improves accuracy and uncertainty estimation over standard encoders and MC dropout on the tested tasks
- **Medium confidence** in the claim of competitive performance to deep ensembles, as this is benchmarked on a fixed set of tasks
- **Medium confidence** in the assertion of reduced computational cost relative to deep ensembles, as this depends on specific implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate GraphPPD on graph-level tasks with very few labeled examples per class to assess robustness to label scarcity
2. Systematically study the impact of the size, diversity, and selection strategy of the conditioning set on model performance and uncertainty quality
3. Test GraphPPD on datasets with significantly larger graphs to identify any scalability bottlenecks or architectural limitations
