# MediRound: Multi-Round Entity-Level Reasoning Segmentation in Medical Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12110
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12110
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-round entity-level reasoning segmentation framework with 177K-dialogue dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MediRound, a novel framework enabling multi-round entity-level reasoning segmentation in medical images. Unlike traditional single-round text-prompt segmentation methods, MediRound leverages conversation history and reference information across multiple dialogue turns to improve segmentation accuracy. The approach addresses a critical gap in medical imaging where complex diagnostic scenarios often require iterative refinement and clarification between clinicians and automated systems.

The authors construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset comprising 177K dialogues specifically designed to support multi-round reasoning tasks. MediRound integrates conversation history through sophisticated prompt embedding strategies and employs a lightweight Judgment & Correction Mechanism to mitigate error propagation across rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MediRound significantly outperforms existing methods on multi-round reasoning tasks while maintaining competitive performance on single-round referring segmentation benchmarks.

## Method Summary
MediRound extends traditional referring segmentation by incorporating conversation history across multiple dialogue rounds, enabling entity-level reasoning that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows. The framework processes each round by integrating historical context, reference images, and current queries through sophisticated prompt embedding mechanisms. A lightweight Judgment & Correction component actively monitors and corrects segmentation errors that may propagate across rounds. The system is trained on the newly constructed MR-MedSeg dataset containing 177K multi-turn dialogues specifically designed for medical entity segmentation tasks. This approach allows the model to refine segmentations iteratively based on clinician feedback and additional context, rather than producing static single-round outputs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 59.6% average accuracy improvement over baseline methods on multi-round reasoning tasks
- Maintains competitive performance on single-round referring segmentation benchmarks
- Demonstrates effective error mitigation through the lightweight Judgment & Correction Mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MediRound succeeds by treating medical segmentation as an interactive reasoning process rather than a one-shot prediction task. The framework's ability to incorporate conversation history allows it to build contextual understanding across rounds, similar to how clinicians refine their diagnostic reasoning through iterative questioning. The Judgment & Correction Mechanism acts as a quality control layer that prevents error accumulation, a common failure mode in multi-round systems. By training on MR-MedSeg's diverse dialogue scenarios, the model learns to handle the complex reasoning patterns typical in clinical settings where initial observations often require clarification and refinement.

## Foundational Learning

**Medical Entity Segmentation** - Why needed: Medical images contain multiple anatomical structures requiring precise identification. Quick check: Model can accurately segment liver, kidney, and tumor regions in CT scans.

**Multi-Round Dialogue Processing** - Why needed: Clinical workflows involve iterative questioning and refinement. Quick check: System maintains context across 3+ dialogue turns without performance degradation.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning** - Why needed: Medical specialists integrate visual and textual information during diagnosis. Quick check: Model correctly interprets complex medical queries combining visual descriptions with anatomical terminology.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Image Encoder -> Prompt Embedding Module -> LLM Core -> Segmentation Head -> Judgment & Correction Module

Critical Path: Input image → Feature extraction → Context integration → Entity prediction → Mask generation → Error checking → Final output

Design Tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes accuracy through iterative refinement over computational efficiency, accepting the overhead of multi-round processing for improved segmentation quality. The lightweight correction mechanism balances error mitigation with minimal latency impact.

Failure Signatures: Performance degrades when conversation history becomes too long and overwhelms the context window, when medical terminology exceeds the model's vocabulary coverage, or when visual features are ambiguous across similar anatomical structures.

First Experiments:
1. Test single-round segmentation performance to establish baseline capabilities
2. Evaluate context integration by comparing multi-round vs single-round accuracy on identical queries
3. Assess error propagation by measuring correction effectiveness across successive dialogue turns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the MediRound architecture be modified to support multi-target segmentation within a single dialogue turn?
- Basis in paper: Appendix F.1 states that the current model restricts each round to a single medical entity and outlines the goal to extend support to multi-target segmentation in future iterations.
- Why unresolved: The current design maps a single [SEG] token output from the LLM to a singular mask feature, making it structurally incapable of processing requests for multiple distinct entities simultaneously.
- Evidence to resolve: A modified architecture capable of generating multiple distinct masks from a single compound query (e.g., "Segment the liver and the kidney") without performance degradation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the model be fine-tuned for segmentation without losing the core conversational capabilities of the base MLLM?
- Basis in paper: Appendix F.3 notes that the model becomes specialized for segmentation tasks and nearly completely loses the core conversational capabilities of the MLLM due to task-specific overfitting.
- Why unresolved: Heavy fine-tuning on segmentation-specific datasets often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model optimizes for mask generation at the expense of general medical dialogue and reasoning.
- Evidence to resolve: A training methodology that maintains high performance on general medical VQA benchmarks (indicative of conversational ability) while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the multi-round reasoning framework be effectively generalized to 3D volumetric data or medical videos?
- Basis in paper: Appendix F.4 highlights the current limitation to 2D images and explicitly lists the extension to 3D data and medical videos as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: 3D volumes and video streams introduce massive computational overhead and require reasoning across spatial depth or temporal frames, which the current 2D vision encoder and prompt embedding strategy are not designed to handle.
- Evidence to resolve: Successful application of the framework on a 3D CT dataset (e.g., BraTS) or medical video dataset, demonstrating cross-round reasoning between volumetric regions of interest.

## Limitations

- Current architecture limited to single medical entity per dialogue round, restricting clinical applicability
- Task-specific fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting of general conversational capabilities
- Framework restricted to 2D images, unable to process 3D volumetric data or medical videos

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework architecture and technical implementation appear sound, with clear methodological descriptions and reasonable evaluation protocols on established benchmarks.

**Medium confidence**: The performance claims are supported by experimental results, though the absence of statistical validation and potential dataset-specific artifacts limit strong conclusions about generalizability.

**Low confidence**: Claims about error propagation mitigation and the specific mechanisms by which multi-round reasoning improves clinical outcomes require further empirical validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset validation using multiple medical imaging datasets to assess generalizability beyond the MR-MedSeg corpus.

2. Perform statistical significance testing with confidence intervals across all benchmark comparisons to establish the robustness of reported performance improvements.

3. Implement user studies with medical practitioners to evaluate whether the multi-round reasoning capabilities translate to clinically meaningful improvements in segmentation accuracy and diagnostic workflow efficiency.
