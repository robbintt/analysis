# Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: A Survey on Tasks, Approaches, and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09516
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive survey of cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis, covering tasks, datasets, and transfer methods

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first systematic review of cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), addressing the significant gap in comprehensive literature coverage for this emerging field. The paper examines the fundamental ABSA tasks that can be performed across languages, surveys the available multilingual datasets, and analyzes various cross-lingual transfer approaches including machine translation, cross-lingual word embeddings, and multilingual pre-trained language models. It identifies key challenges such as limited multilingual datasets, underexplored ABSA tasks, and the need for better integration of recent advancements from monolingual ABSA research.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves comprehensive literature review across multiple research domains including sentiment analysis, cross-lingual transfer learning, and natural language processing. The authors systematically categorize existing research based on ABSA tasks, cross-lingual transfer approaches, and evaluation methodologies. They analyze published works to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities in cross-lingual ABSA, providing a structured framework for understanding the current state of the field and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive coverage of ABSA tasks that can be performed across languages, from aspect extraction to sentiment classification
- Systematic analysis of cross-lingual transfer methods including machine translation, cross-lingual embeddings, and multilingual pre-trained models
- Identification of key challenges: limited multilingual datasets, underexplored compound ABSA tasks, and need for LLM-based data augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a structured taxonomy of cross-lingual ABSA tasks and systematically mapping existing approaches to these tasks. It bridges the gap between monolingual ABSA research and cross-lingual transfer learning by identifying commonalities and differences in methodology. The mechanism relies on comprehensive literature synthesis to reveal patterns in how researchers have approached cross-lingual challenges, highlighting successful strategies and persistent obstacles that inform future research directions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: The task of identifying aspects (features) in text and determining sentiment toward each aspect. Why needed: Core task that cross-lingual methods must support. Quick check: Can the method identify both explicit and implicit aspects across languages?
- **Cross-lingual Transfer Learning**: Techniques for adapting models trained on one language to perform well on others. Why needed: Enables leveraging rich English resources for low-resource languages. Quick check: Does transfer maintain performance across diverse language families?
- **Multilingual Datasets**: Annotated data covering multiple languages for ABSA tasks. Why needed: Essential for training and evaluating cross-lingual models. Quick check: Are datasets balanced across languages and domains?
- **Machine Translation for Cross-lingual Tasks**: Using translation as a bridge between languages. Why needed: Simple baseline that can be surprisingly effective. Quick check: Does translation quality impact downstream ABSA performance?
- **Multilingual Pre-trained Language Models**: Models like mBERT that support multiple languages. Why needed: Enable direct cross-lingual transfer without explicit alignment. Quick check: How well do these models handle language-specific sentiment expressions?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Task Definition -> Cross-lingual Transfer Method -> Model Training -> Evaluation
**Critical Path**: Source language ABSA data → Cross-lingual transfer approach → Target language model → Performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Translation quality vs. model complexity, dataset size vs. annotation cost, task specificity vs. generalisability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on morphologically rich languages, degradation with distant language pairs, sensitivity to domain mismatch
**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark machine translation baseline on aspect extraction task, 2) Compare cross-lingual embeddings vs. mPLMs on sentiment classification, 3) Evaluate zero-shot transfer across language families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions including the potential of sequence-to-sequence modeling approaches for cross-lingual ABSA, the underexplored area of compound ABSA tasks that combine multiple sub-tasks, and the role of large language models in improving cross-lingual transfer. It also questions how to effectively integrate advancements from monolingual ABSA research into cross-lingual settings and what strategies can best address the scarcity of multilingual datasets.

## Limitations
- Focus on literature up to a specific cutoff may miss recent advancements in LLMs and sequence-to-sequence models
- Analysis relies on reported results that vary in methodology and evaluation standards, making direct comparisons challenging
- Acknowledges data sparsity as a key limitation but cannot fully address its impact on generalizability across diverse languages

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Identification of key cross-lingual ABSA tasks and modeling paradigms, well-established in literature
- **Medium confidence**: Assessment of current challenges, given rapidly evolving field and potential blind spots
- **Low confidence**: Predicting future research directions, dependent on unpredictable technological developments

## Next Checks
1) Conduct systematic review of recent preprints and conference proceedings to update survey with latest LLM and sequence-to-sequence advancements
2) Perform meta-analysis of cross-lingual transfer experiments across different language pairs and domains to quantify data sparsity impact
3) Design comparative study using standardized metrics to benchmark cross-lingual transfer approaches on diverse languages and ABSA tasks
