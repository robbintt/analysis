# Edge Intelligence for Wildlife Conservation: Real-Time Hornbill Call Classification Using TinyML

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.12272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12272
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: 97.5% accuracy classifying 5 hornbill species in real-time on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates a TinyML system for real-time classification of hornbill calls using audio data from Xeno-canto and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. The system preprocesses audio, extracts Mel-Frequency Energy features, and deploys an optimized neural network trained on Edge Impulse. The model achieved 97.5% accuracy in classifying five hornbill species with 484 ms inference latency, demonstrating feasibility for ecological monitoring in remote environments.

## Method Summary
The approach involves collecting hornbill audio from Xeno-canto, preprocessing in Audacity (noise reduction, normalization), and segmenting into 10-second clips. Edge Impulse processes 2.5-second windows using MFE feature extraction with -52 dB noise floor. A 1D CNN architecture with two convolutional layers (kernel size 3, ReLU, dropout 0.25) processes the features, followed by flattening and 6-class softmax output. The model trains for 100 epochs with learning rate 0.005 and k-fold cross-validation, then optimizes via EON™ Compiler for deployment on Arduino hardware.

## Key Results
- 97.5% classification accuracy on validation set
- 484 ms total latency (DSP + inference) on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
- 6-class model (5 species + noise) with minimal memory footprint
- Real-time performance suitable for continuous monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: MFE Feature Extraction
Raw audio segments undergo FFT transformation and filtering through Mel-scale filter banks, producing energy coefficients that approximate human auditory perception. This captures species-specific spectral patterns in 7,470 features per sample. The method assumes hornbill species have acoustically distinct calls separable in Mel-frequency space.

### Mechanism 2: Lightweight 1D CNN Architecture
Two 1D convolutional layers with kernel size 3 and ReLU activation process sequential MFE features, with dropout (0.25) for regularization. The architecture assumes temporal dependencies in hornbill calls are local and learnable with shallow convolution, achieving 97.5% accuracy with 0.19 loss.

### Mechanism 3: EON™ Compiler Optimization
Model quantization and compression via Edge Impulse's EON compiler converts floating-point weights to integer representations, reducing memory footprint for Arduino deployment. The optimization assumes quantization-induced accuracy loss remains acceptable, achieving real-time predictions with 484 ms latency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mel-Frequency Energy (MFE) vs. MFCC**: MFE is preferred for TinyML due to fewer computation steps and no DCT requirement. Quick check: Can you explain why MFE may be preferred over MFCC for resource-constrained edge inference?

- **1D Convolutions for Time-Series**: Input MFE features shaped (30, 249) represent time steps and frequency bins; 1D kernels slide along the time dimension. Quick check: If your input MFE features have shape (30, 249), what does the "30" dimension represent, and how does a 1D kernel operate on it?

- **Quantization-Aware Training**: Understanding post-training quantization vs. quantization-aware training helps anticipate accuracy gaps. Quick check: What is the typical accuracy tradeoff when converting float32 weights to int8 without retraining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microphone → Noise filtering (-52 dB) → 2.5s window segmentation → MFE feature extraction (7,470 features → 30 columns) → 2× 1D Conv (ReLU, dropout 0.25) → Flatten → Dense (6 classes, softmax) → Classification output

- **Critical path**: Audio capture → DSP/MFE extraction → Neural network inference → Classification output via serial/Bluetooth

- **Design tradeoffs**: Window length vs. latency; model depth vs. memory; species count vs. separability

- **Failure signatures**: High false positives on noise (adjust noise floor); memory overflow during inference (reduce filters/quantize further); species confusion between similar calls (augment training data)

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Baseline replication: Train same architecture on Xeno-canto data, verify ~97% accuracy and ~484ms latency
  2. Noise robustness test: Add synthetic background noise to validation set, measure accuracy degradation
  3. Latency profiling: Use Edge Impulse profiler to isolate DSP vs. inference time, test shorter frame lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Training data limited to Xeno-canto recordings, not field recordings from Malaysian rainforests
- No evaluation of model performance in real-world noisy environments with overlapping biophony
- Battery life and energy consumption not characterized for continuous deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence (95%+)**: Technical methodology for preprocessing and deploying TinyML models is sound and follows established practices

**Medium Confidence (70-90%)**: 97.5% accuracy likely valid for Xeno-canto dataset but transferability to field conditions uncertain without validation

**Low Confidence (40-70%)**: Long-term robustness under varying field conditions and impact of quantization on classification accuracy not characterized

## Next Checks

1. **Field Validation Test**: Deploy model in Malaysian rainforest locations, collect real-time audio data across different weather conditions, compare predictions against expert ornithological validation

2. **Cross-Environmental Generalization**: Test model performance on hornbill recordings from different geographic regions (Borneo, Sumatra) and habitats to assess generalization beyond Xeno-canto dataset

3. **Edge Hardware Stress Testing**: Evaluate latency and memory usage when scaled to 10-15 species classes, test performance on alternative edge devices (ESP32-S3, Raspberry Pi Pico)
