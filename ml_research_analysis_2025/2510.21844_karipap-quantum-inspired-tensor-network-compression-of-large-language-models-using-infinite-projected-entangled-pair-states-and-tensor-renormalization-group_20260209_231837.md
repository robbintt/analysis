# KARIPAP: Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network Compression of Large Language Models Using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States and Tensor Renormalization Group

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21844
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Quantum-inspired tensor network compression achieves 93% memory reduction and 70% parameter compression on LLaMA-2 7B with only 2-3% accuracy loss

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2 7B face significant computational and environmental challenges due to their massive parameter scales. KARIPAP introduces a quantum-inspired compression framework using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) to address these challenges. The approach captures multi-directional entanglement in transformer layers while maintaining correlation structure, achieving substantial memory and parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss. Experimental results demonstrate 93% memory reduction, 70% parameter compression, 50% faster training, and 25% faster inference on LLaMA-2 7B, with only 2-3% accuracy degradation.

## Method Summary
KARIPAP leverages quantum-inspired tensor network techniques to compress LLMs by modeling the multi-directional entanglement patterns in transformer layers. The framework uses iPEPS to represent the tensor network structure and TRG for iterative refinement and compression. The approach targets both self-attention and feed-forward network components, preserving the correlation structure between tokens while reducing the model's parameter footprint. The method is designed to be scalable and energy-efficient, addressing both computational and environmental concerns associated with large-scale language models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93% memory reduction and 70% parameter compression on LLaMA-2 7B
- Demonstrated 50% faster training and 25% faster inference speeds
- Maintained only 2-3% accuracy loss across benchmark tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework exploits the inherent entanglement patterns in transformer architectures by using tensor network representations that naturally capture multi-directional correlations. iPEPS provides an efficient way to represent these correlations in an infinite lattice structure, while TRG enables systematic compression through renormalization procedures. This quantum-inspired approach preserves the essential information flow in transformer layers while eliminating redundant parameters, leading to significant compression without substantial performance degradation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor Networks**: Mathematical structures for representing high-dimensional data; needed to capture complex correlations in transformer layers; quick check: verify understanding of basic tensor contraction operations
- **Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS)**: Tensor network states that efficiently represent quantum many-body systems; needed to model multi-directional entanglement; quick check: understand the difference between PEPS and MPS (Matrix Product States)
- **Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG)**: Iterative algorithm for coarse-graining tensor networks; needed for systematic compression and refinement; quick check: grasp the basic TRG decimation process
- **Transformer Architecture**: Neural network structure for sequence modeling; needed as the target for compression; quick check: understand self-attention mechanism and feed-forward networks
- **Quantum-Inspired Computing**: Computational approaches borrowing concepts from quantum mechanics; needed for efficient high-dimensional data representation; quick check: differentiate between quantum computing and quantum-inspired approaches
- **Entanglement Patterns**: Correlations between different parts of a system; needed to identify compression opportunities; quick check: understand how entanglement relates to information redundancy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Tensor -> iPEPS Representation -> TRG Compression -> Compressed Model -> Output Tensor

**Critical Path**: The compression pipeline follows the sequence: original model parameters → tensor network decomposition using iPEPS → iterative TRG compression → quantized compressed model → performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances compression ratio against accuracy preservation, with the 2-3% accuracy loss representing a deliberate tradeoff for achieving 93% memory reduction. The choice of iPEPS over other tensor network formulations prioritizes capturing multi-directional entanglement, while TRG selection enables systematic iterative compression.

**Failure Signatures**: Compression may fail when attempting to preserve correlations that are inherently non-local or when the tensor network representation cannot adequately capture the complexity of certain attention patterns. Models with highly specialized or non-standard architectures may not compress as effectively due to mismatched structural assumptions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compress a small transformer layer (4-8 heads) using KARIPAP and measure parameter reduction vs accuracy retention
2. Compare KARIPAP compression against standard quantization on a single attention head
3. Test the reconstruction fidelity of compressed self-attention matrices against original implementations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Results are demonstrated only on LLaMA-2 7B, limiting generalizability to other architectures
- Speed improvements may be hardware-dependent and require verification across different systems
- Potential performance degradation in long-context scenarios or during fine-tuning is not addressed
- Scalability to larger models (70B+ parameters) remains uncertain due to computational complexity

## Confidence
- Memory and parameter reduction claims: Medium - Results are promising but limited to one model
- Speed improvements: Medium - Hardware-dependent and not extensively validated
- Accuracy preservation: Medium - Based on limited task evaluation
- Scalability claims: Low - Not demonstrated beyond LLaMA-2 7B

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce compression results on multiple LLM architectures (OPT, Falcon, GPT-2 variants) to test generalizability
2. Evaluate compressed model performance on diverse downstream tasks including long-context benchmarks and multiple domains
3. Test the compression framework on hardware configurations beyond the original setup to verify speed improvements are consistent across systems
