# Different Speech Translation Models Encode and Translate Speaker Gender Differently

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02172
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02172
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Speech translation models vary significantly in how they encode and use speaker gender information, with traditional encoder-decoder models capturing gender while newer speech+MT models with adapters show minimal encoding and masculine default bias.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether and how speech translation (ST) models encode speaker gender information and use it for accurate translation. Using probing methods, the authors find that traditional encoder-decoder ST models capture gender information in hidden states, while newer speech+MT models with adapters show minimal or no gender encoding. The study reveals that models with stronger gender encoding capabilities translate speaker-referred gender-marked words more accurately, while models with weaker encoding show a masculine default bias. Results across three language directions demonstrate that gender encoding strongly correlates with translation accuracy (R²=0.99), suggesting ST models can leverage acoustic gender cues when available.

## Method Summary
The researchers used attention-based probing classifiers to measure gender information in hidden states of three speech translation models (fairseq Enc-Dec, SeamlessM4T v2, and ZeroSwot) across three language pairs (en→es/fr/it). They trained probes on extracted encoder outputs and pre/post-adapter states using the MuST-C corpus, then evaluated translation gender accuracy on the MuST-SHE corpus. The study compared traditional encoder-decoder models against newer speech+MT models that use adapters to connect speech encoders with MT systems.

## Key Results
- Adapter-based speech+MT models show 21-32% drops in gender probing accuracy compared to traditional encoder-decoder models
- Models with stronger gender encoding capabilities translate speaker-referred gender-marked words more accurately
- Gender encoding strength correlates strongly with translation accuracy (R²=0.99, p < 0.01)
- Models with low gender encoding capabilities default to masculine translations more frequently

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adapter Information Bottlenecking
Adapters compress and project speech representations into MT embedding space, optimizing for semantic alignment while discarding acoustic features not necessary for lexical translation. This projection acts as a filter that strips paralinguistic information like speaker gender while preserving semantic content.

### Mechanism 2: Acoustic-to-Grammatical Conditional Transfer
ST models leverage acoustic gender cues encoded in hidden states to resolve grammatical gender agreement in target languages. The cross-attention mechanism accesses these states during decoding, allowing the model to condition morphological inflections on acoustic information when the cues are sufficiently salient.

### Mechanism 3: Masculine Default Fallback
In the absence of strong acoustic gender signals, models revert to a statistical linguistic prior, defaulting to masculine forms. When encoding capability is weak, the model lacks differentiation signals and converges on masculine inflection as the "safe" default prediction during training on potentially imbalanced data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Probing Classifiers**
  - Why needed here: Primary diagnostic tool to distinguish between what the model stores vs. what it uses
  - Quick check: If a probe achieves 90% accuracy on a hidden state, does that prove the downstream task uses that information? (No, but it proves the information is linearly recoverable)

- **Concept: Encoder-Decoder vs. Speech+MT Architectures**
  - Why needed here: Core finding hinges on structural difference between "End-to-End" (trained from scratch) and "Adapter-based" (connecting frozen/pre-trained components)
  - Quick check: Why would adding an adapter cause a loss of speaker information compared to a fully jointly trained model?

- **Concept: Grammatical vs. Notional Gender**
  - Why needed here: Task involves translating from English (Notional/Neutral) to Romance languages (Grammatical), requiring the model to invent gender information during decoding
  - Quick check: In "I am happy" (En) -> "Je suis content/contente" (Fr), what is the only signal the model has to choose the correct suffix?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Speech Encoder -> Adapter Module -> MT Decoder/Text Model -> Attention-Based Probe
- **Critical path:** Speaker Identity flows from Speech Encoder (high gender encoding) through Adapter (identified as "Gender Erasure" point) to Text Decoder
- **Design tradeoffs:** Translation Quality (COMET) vs. Gender Accuracy - speech+MT models achieve higher COMET scores but significantly lower gender accuracy than Enc-Dec models
- **Failure signatures:** High COMET, Low Gender Accuracy (wrong gender pronouns/adjectives); Low Probe Performance (Post-Adapter) indicating adapter deafness to speaker gender
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Probing Baseline: Extract hidden states pre-adapter and post-adapter, train probes to quantify information loss
  2. Correlation Check: Translate gender-balanced test set, plot Probe F1 vs. Gender Translation Accuracy to verify R²=0.99
  3. Temporal Analysis: Visualize probe attention weights to confirm gender information concentration in early timesteps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Which specific properties of adapters, or aspects of their training, cause the loss of gender information in speech+MT models?
- Do adapters similarly discard other acoustic and paralinguistic features (e.g., emotion, accent, speaking rate) during speech-to-text embedding mapping?
- How can adapter configurations be modified to preserve speaker gender information while maintaining translation quality?

## Limitations

- Probing methodology cannot definitively prove that models actively use encoded gender information for translation decisions
- Correlation findings may be influenced by specific architectures tested and limited number of language pairs examined
- Focus on encoder-decoder versus speech+MT architectures leaves other architectural variants and training methodologies unexplored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Adapter-based architectures show significantly reduced gender encoding compared to traditional encoder-decoder models
- **Medium Confidence:** Correlation between gender encoding strength and translation accuracy requires validation across broader model families
- **Medium Confidence:** Explanation that adapters act as information bottlenecks is plausible but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Ablation Study:** Test whether gender information can be preserved through adapters by modifying adapter architectures and measuring both probe accuracy and translation performance

2. **Cross-Lingual Validation:** Replicate correlation analysis across additional language pairs beyond en→es/fr/it, particularly including languages with different gender marking systems

3. **Controlled Gender Manipulation:** Design experiment where gender information is artificially injected or removed from hidden states at different architectural points, then measure downstream impact on gender translation accuracy
