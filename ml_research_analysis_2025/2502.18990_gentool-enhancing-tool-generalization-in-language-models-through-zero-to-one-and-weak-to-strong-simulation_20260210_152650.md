# GenTool: Enhancing Tool Generalization in Language Models through Zero-to-One and Weak-to-Strong Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18990
- Authors: Jie He; Jennifer Neville; Mengting Wan; Longqi Yang; Hui Liu; Xiaofeng Xu; Xia Song; Jeff Z. Pan; Pei Zhou
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GenTool achieves up to 90.15% tool selection accuracy, outperforming GPT-4o by 14.28% through synthetic training data simulating zero-to-one and weak-to-strong tool generalization

## Executive Summary
GenTool addresses a critical gap in large language model (LLM) tool usage capabilities by improving generalization across tool adoption scenarios. The framework tackles two fundamental challenges: selecting new tools when none exist (zero-to-one generalization) and choosing improved tools over weaker alternatives (weak-to-strong generalization). Through synthetic data generation and a two-stage fine-tuning approach, GenTool enables LLMs to better navigate tool selection decisions across diverse scenarios.

The research demonstrates that existing LLMs struggle with tool generalization, often relying on memorization rather than true understanding of tool capabilities. GenTool's innovative approach of simulating tool evolution and introduction scenarios provides targeted training that significantly enhances model performance. Evaluated across multiple model sizes (1B-8B parameters) and four distinct generalization scenarios, the framework consistently outperforms both baseline models and GPT-4o, establishing a new benchmark for tool-learning capabilities in language models.

## Method Summary
GenTool introduces a two-stage fine-tuning framework that enhances LLM tool generalization through synthetic training data generation. The first stage focuses on ranking tools by their capabilities, while the second stage refines tool selection skills through targeted training. The synthetic data simulates two key generalization dimensions: zero-to-one scenarios where models must adopt new tools when no tools previously existed, and weak-to-strong scenarios where models must identify and select improved tools over existing weaker alternatives. The framework is evaluated across four generalization scenarios using models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, with performance measured through tool selection accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 90.15% tool selection accuracy across evaluated models
- Outperforms GPT-4o by 14.28% in tool selection tasks
- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements across model sizes from 1B to 8B parameters
- Shows effectiveness across four distinct tool generalization scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GenTool's effectiveness stems from its targeted approach to addressing the fundamental challenge of tool generalization in LLMs. By simulating realistic tool evolution scenarios through synthetic data generation, the framework provides models with exposure to the decision-making processes required for tool selection. The two-stage fine-tuning approach first establishes a foundation for understanding tool capabilities, then builds upon this foundation to refine selection skills. This structured progression mirrors the natural learning process of tool adoption, where initial capability assessment precedes practical application decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tool Capability Assessment**: Understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of different tools is fundamental to making informed selection decisions. Quick check: Can the model correctly rank tools by their stated capabilities?
- **Zero-to-One Tool Adoption**: The ability to identify and adopt new tools when no existing tools are available represents a critical skill for tool generalization. Quick check: Does the model successfully select appropriate tools in scenarios with no prior tool usage?
- **Weak-to-Strong Tool Selection**: Recognizing when improved tools become available and making appropriate selection decisions is essential for maintaining optimal tool usage. Quick check: Can the model identify and prefer stronger tools over weaker alternatives?
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating realistic tool evolution scenarios through synthetic data provides targeted training for generalization challenges. Quick check: Do the synthetic scenarios accurately reflect real-world tool selection challenges?
- **Two-Stage Fine-Tuning**: The structured approach of first establishing capability understanding then refining selection skills provides a systematic path for improving tool generalization. Quick check: Does each stage contribute measurable improvements to overall performance?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Pipeline -> Tool Selection Model
- **Critical Path**: Tool capability ranking (Stage 1) -> Tool selection refinement (Stage 2) -> Generalization evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of synthetic data enables controlled training scenarios but may not fully capture real-world complexity. The two-stage approach provides structure but requires careful balancing of training objectives.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on cross-domain tools, over-reliance on tool descriptions rather than functionality, and failure to generalize beyond trained scenarios
- **Three First Experiments**: 1) Test tool selection accuracy on held-out zero-to-one scenarios, 2) Evaluate weak-to-strong generalization with progressively improved tools, 3) Assess cross-domain tool selection capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on synthetic datasets rather than real-world tool selection scenarios
- Limited exploration of cross-domain generalization where tools from different domains need to be selected
- Analysis of true tool understanding versus memorization remains inconclusive
- Reliance on tool descriptions and functionality information may create biases not reflective of practical tool discovery challenges

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Experimental methodology with clear two-stage fine-tuning procedures and well-defined evaluation metrics; rigorous comparisons against established baselines like GPT-4o
- **Medium Confidence**: Synthetic data generation approach for simulating generalization scenarios is innovative but may not fully reflect real-world challenges; two-stage fine-tuning effectiveness demonstrated but generalizability requires further validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about models relying on memorization versus true understanding lack comprehensive evidence; insufficient proof to conclusively determine the nature of tool learning versus memorization

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Validation: Test GenTool's performance on tool selection tasks spanning multiple domains (mathematical, programming, creative tools) to assess generalization beyond specific training domains.

2. Real-World Scenario Testing: Implement user study or real-world benchmark evaluating GenTool on actual tool selection tasks from platforms like API marketplaces or software documentation, comparing against human experts.

3. Ablation Study on Synthetic Data Components: Systematically remove or modify synthetic training data components (tool descriptions, functionality information) to determine which elements are most critical for tool selection performance and better understand memorization versus understanding.
