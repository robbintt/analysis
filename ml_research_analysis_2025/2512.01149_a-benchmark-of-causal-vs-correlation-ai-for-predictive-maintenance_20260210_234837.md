# A Benchmark of Causal vs Correlation AI for Predictive Maintenance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01149
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01149
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Causal AI achieves 70.2% cost reduction ($1.16M savings) vs correlation models' 65.3% ($1.08M), with 97% fewer false alarms

## Executive Summary
This study compares causal AI and correlation-based machine learning for predictive maintenance on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with 3.3% failure prevalence. While correlation models achieve 65.3% cost reduction ($1.08M annual savings), the causal inference model (L5) achieves 70.2% cost reduction ($1.16M annual savings), outperforming the best correlation model by $80K annually. The causal model matches the highest recall (87.9%) while reducing false alarms by 97% (from 165 to 5), achieving 92.1% precision. Key findings show causal AI methods combined with domain knowledge deliver superior financial outcomes and interpretability compared to correlation-based approaches. The causal model demonstrates stronger generalization with only 2.6 percentage point train-test gap versus 4.1 points for correlation models, consistent with the theoretical expectation that causal relationships are invariant under operational changes.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates eight models (L0-L7) on the UCI AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset (10,000 CNC machines, 6 features). Models are trained using 80-20 stratified splits across 5 random seeds (42-46). L3 uses a decision tree with cost-optimized thresholds via grid search. L5 employs a causal DAG encoding domain knowledge to derive features (temperature differential, power, overstrain) fed to gradient boosting with cost-optimized thresholds. All models optimize for a 50:1 cost asymmetry (missed failure = $25,000, false alarm = $500). Performance is measured by total annual cost savings, recall, precision, and train-test generalization gaps.

## Key Results
- Causal model (L5) achieves 70.2% cost reduction ($1.16M savings) vs best correlation model's 65.3% ($1.08M)
- L5 reduces false alarms by 97% (from 165 to 5) while maintaining 87.9% recall and achieving 92.1% precision
- Causal model demonstrates stronger generalization with 2.6 pp train-test gap vs 4.1 pp for correlation models
- L5's derived features encode invariant physical mechanisms that reduce spurious correlations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cost-Asymmetric Threshold Optimization
Optimizing decision thresholds for business costs (50:1 FN:FP ratio) yields superior financial outcomes compared to statistical metrics like F1-score or accuracy. Grid search over probability thresholds (0.01-0.99) minimizes total cost = (TP × $5K) + (FP × $500) + (FN × $25K). The 50:1 cost asymmetry shifts decision boundaries toward higher recall, accepting more false alarms to avoid expensive missed failures.

### Mechanism 2: Causal Feature Derivation via Domain-Informed DAG
Causally-derived features (temperature differential, power, overstrain) reduce false positives by 97% while maintaining recall because they encode invariant physical mechanisms rather than contingent correlations. Domain knowledge encoded as DAG → do-calculus identifies adjustment sets → linear regression estimates causal coefficients → derived features fed to gradient boosting classifier.

### Mechanism 3: Invariant Causal Relationships Reduce Generalization Gap
Causal models exhibit smaller train-test performance gaps (2.6 pp) compared to correlation models (4.1 pp) because causal relationships remain stable under distribution shifts. Raw sensor correlations are contingent on training data distribution; causal features encode physics that holds regardless of operational baseline shifts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cost-sensitive learning vs. class balancing**
  - Why needed here: L1 (balanced weights) outperformed L2 (cost-optimized threshold) despite L2's additional sophistication, demonstrating that class balancing ≠ cost optimization. The 50:1 cost ratio is orthogonal to the 3.3% class prevalence.
  - Quick check question: Given FN cost = $25K, FP cost = $500, and 3.3% failure rate, would you adjust class weights or decision threshold first?

- **Concept: Backdoor criterion and confounding adjustment**
  - Why needed here: L5 uses Pearl's backdoor criterion to identify adjustment sets that block confounding paths. Without this, derived features may encode spurious relationships (e.g., machine type affecting both torque and failure rate).
  - Quick check question: If machine type influences both rotational speed and failure probability, what variables must be adjusted to estimate the causal effect of speed on failure?

- **Concept: Probability calibration and threshold selection**
  - Why needed here: L2 underperformed L1 because optimized thresholds overfit when probabilities are poorly calibrated. Well-calibrated probabilities are prerequisite for reliable cost-based threshold selection.
  - Quick check question: A model outputs failure probabilities of 0.15 for all positive cases and 0.10 for all negatives. Is it well-calibrated? What threshold minimizes false positives while maintaining 80% recall?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw Sensors (6 features) → Feature Engineering Fork:
    ├─→ Correlation Path: Direct to classifier (L1-L4, L7 baseline)
    └─→ Causal Path: DAG → do-calculus → Derived features (temp_diff, power, overstrain)
       → Gradient Boosting → Cost-optimized threshold → Prediction + Root-cause explanation

- **Critical path:**
  1. DAG construction (domain expert + failure mode documentation) → determines which causal effects are identifiable
  2. Adjustment set identification → controls confounding in causal coefficient estimation
  3. Feature derivation → transforms raw sensors into mechanistically meaningful variables
  4. Cost threshold optimization → aligns predictions with business objective

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - L3 (decision tree) vs. L5 (causal + gradient boosting): L3 simpler to deploy, no domain expertise required, but 97% more false alarms; L5 requires upfront DAG construction but provides interpretability and better generalization
  - L6 (rule-based) vs. L5 (ML-based): L6 achieves 100% recall but 294 false alarms; L5 sacrifices 12% recall coverage for 97% FP reduction
  - Assumption: DAG construction time < cumulative cost of L3's additional false alarms over deployment period

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Threshold overfitting: L2 pattern—training savings > test savings with large gap; calibrate probabilities first (Platt scaling, isotonic regression) before threshold search
  - DAG misspecification: Derived features show weak correlation with failure; validate causal edges against domain experts and dataset documentation
  - Distribution shift: Sudden precision drop in production; monitor feature distributions and retrain when marginal distributions diverge beyond threshold

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate L1-L3 pipeline on held-out 20% test split; verify recall ≥85% and cost savings ≥60% before attempting causal approach
  2. Validate DAG structure with domain expert: confirm temperature differential, power, and overstrain mechanisms match actual CNC failure physics; document any omitted failure modes
  3. Deploy L5 with shadow mode logging: compare predictions against actual failures and L3 predictions for 30 days; target <10 false alarms per month while maintaining >85% recall

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can causal discovery algorithms successfully automate or reduce the manual effort of DAG construction when domain expertise is unavailable?
- Do causal models maintain their superiority over correlation-based approaches when validated across diverse manufacturing domains and equipment types?
- How does the relative performance of causal vs. correlation models change as the cost asymmetry ratio varies from the studied 50:1?
- How does model performance degrade under real-world deployment with distribution drift and temporal evolution of operational conditions?

## Limitations

- Causal DAG structure is not fully specified in the text, requiring domain expertise to reproduce accurately
- The 50:1 cost asymmetry is assumed fixed, though real-world cost ratios may fluctuate with operational conditions
- Generalization claims rely on a single cross-validation dataset without longitudinal deployment data to validate invariance under actual distribution shifts

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Cost optimization methodology and threshold selection process; L3 decision tree performance metrics; L5 precision-recall tradeoff achieved through derived features.

**Medium Confidence**: Causal DAG structure effectiveness and derived feature validity; generalization gap comparison between causal and correlation models; the 97% false alarm reduction claim.

**Low Confidence**: Invariance claims without deployment data; comparative advantage over modern deep learning approaches; real-world cost ratio stability assumptions.

## Next Checks

1. **Longitudinal Deployment Study**: Deploy L5 in production for 90 days, comparing precision, recall, and false alarm rates against L3 baseline while monitoring actual maintenance costs and operational changes.

2. **DAG Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically perturb causal graph structure (add/remove edges, reverse directions) to quantify impact on derived features' predictive performance and false alarm rates.

3. **Cost Ratio Stress Testing**: Evaluate model performance across a range of cost ratios (10:1 to 100:1) to determine robustness of threshold optimization and identify operational regimes where causal advantages diminish.
