# Deep Neural Networks for Accurate Depth Estimation with Latent Space Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11777
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11777
- Authors: Siddiqui Muhammad Yasir; Hyunsik Ahn
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RMSE of 0.416 on NYU Depth V2, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a deep neural network architecture for monocular depth estimation that leverages latent space features to address common challenges in single-image depth prediction, including depth ambiguity and boundary blurring. The proposed method employs a dual encoder-decoder structure that performs both color-to-depth and depth-to-depth transformations, enabling precise depth map reconstruction through latent space encoding. A novel loss function combining latent loss and gradient loss is designed to preserve depth boundaries and local details, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

The method shows particular promise for applications requiring accurate depth estimation in complex indoor scenarios, such as human-robot interaction and 3D scene reconstruction. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset validate the effectiveness of the approach, with the proposed architecture achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics while maintaining robustness across various scene configurations.

## Method Summary
The proposed architecture utilizes a dual encoder-decoder structure that processes both RGB images and depth maps through separate pathways, converging in a shared latent space representation. The color-to-depth transformation maps RGB inputs to latent features, while the depth-to-depth transformation refines existing depth maps through the same latent space. This dual-path approach enables the network to learn rich feature representations that capture both global scene structure and local depth details. The loss function combines traditional depth reconstruction loss with latent space regularization and gradient-based boundary preservation, ensuring sharp object edges and accurate depth discontinuities are maintained during reconstruction.

## Key Results
- Achieves RMSE of 0.416 on NYU Depth V2 dataset
- Outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth estimation methods
- Demonstrates improved boundary preservation through gradient loss
- Shows robustness in complex indoor scene configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging latent space representations to bridge the gap between RGB and depth domains while maintaining geometric consistency. The dual transformation approach allows the network to learn bidirectional mappings between color and depth spaces, creating a more robust feature representation. The gradient loss component specifically addresses the common issue of blurry boundaries in depth maps by enforcing sharpness at depth discontinuities, while the latent space regularization ensures that essential structural information is preserved during encoding and decoding operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent space encoding**: Essential for capturing compact representations of complex scene geometry; verify by checking reconstruction quality at different latent dimensions
- **Dual-path architecture**: Enables bidirectional learning between RGB and depth domains; test by examining cross-domain feature alignment
- **Gradient-based boundary preservation**: Critical for maintaining sharp object edges in depth maps; validate by measuring boundary accuracy metrics
- **Multi-scale feature fusion**: Combines global and local information for improved depth estimation; assess through feature importance analysis
- **Depth-to-depth refinement**: Allows progressive depth map improvement; evaluate by comparing intermediate refinement stages
- **Loss function design**: Balances reconstruction accuracy with structural preservation; analyze by ablation study of individual loss components

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
RGB Input -> Color Encoder -> Latent Space -> Depth Decoder -> Refined Depth Output
Depth Input -> Depth Encoder -> Latent Space -> Depth Decoder -> Refined Depth Output

**Critical Path:**
1. Input processing through respective encoders
2. Latent space encoding and feature fusion
3. Decoder reconstruction with gradient preservation
4. Output refinement and depth map generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Latent space dimension vs. reconstruction quality**: Higher dimensions improve accuracy but increase computational cost
- **Gradient loss weight vs. smooth depth regions**: Higher weights preserve boundaries but may introduce noise in flat areas
- **Dual-path vs. single-path architecture**: Dual-path provides better feature learning but requires more parameters and training data

**Failure Signatures:**
- Blurry object boundaries indicate insufficient gradient loss weighting
- Depth artifacts in textureless regions suggest inadequate latent space regularization
- Inaccurate depth in occluded areas may result from limited training data diversity

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Train with only reconstruction loss (no gradient or latent loss) to establish baseline performance
2. Test with varying latent space dimensions to determine optimal compression ratio
3. Evaluate on synthetic RGB-depth pairs to verify cross-domain learning capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No comparison with recent transformer-based depth estimation methods
- Limited cross-dataset generalization testing
- Computational efficiency and real-time inference capabilities not addressed

## Confidence

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Depth estimation accuracy claims: High confidence (quantitative results on established benchmark)
- Boundary preservation effectiveness: Medium confidence (qualitative observations need more rigorous evaluation)
- Applicability to human-robot interaction: Low confidence (theoretical assertion without practical demonstration)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the method on more recent depth estimation benchmarks (e.g., DIODE, TUM RGB-D) to assess cross-dataset generalization
2. Compare against modern transformer-based approaches to establish relative performance
3. Conduct ablation studies on latent space dimensionality and its relationship to reconstruction fidelity
