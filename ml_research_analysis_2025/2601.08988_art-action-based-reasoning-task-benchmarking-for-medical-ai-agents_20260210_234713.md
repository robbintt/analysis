# ART: Action-based Reasoning Task Benchmarking for Medical AI Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08988
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08988
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved 100% retrieval accuracy after prompt refinement but only 28-64% for aggregation and 32-38% for threshold reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
ART introduces a benchmark targeting action-based clinical reasoning in medical AI agents, focusing on retrieval, aggregation, and conditional logic tasks grounded in real EHR data. The benchmark exposes weaknesses in LLM-based agents through failure-targeted synthetic tasks, revealing that while basic data retrieval can be optimized through prompt engineering, temporal and numerical reasoning remain significant challenges. GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed 100% retrieval accuracy after prompt refinement, but only 28-64% for aggregation and 32-38% for threshold reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for improved clinical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
ART employs a four-stage pipeline to generate failure-targeted synthetic tasks from real EHR data. The process begins with mining 50,000 EHR records to identify failure patterns in existing benchmarks, then synthesizes diverse instruction variants via LLM while preserving ground truth values. Clinician review validates the synthetic tasks, which are then evaluated using stateless agent execution via FHIR API against exact-match scoring. The benchmark focuses on three failure categories: data retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and threshold-based conditional misjudgments across 11 lab codes from 695 patients.

## Key Results
- Retrieval accuracy improved from 42-54% baseline to 100% after adding explicit "sort by date" parameter
- Aggregation task performance ranged from 28-64%, indicating inconsistent temporal and numerical reasoning
- Threshold reasoning accuracy was 32-38%, with borderline value classification being particularly challenging
- All tasks used exact-match scoring against ground truth computed from EHR database

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Failure-targeted synthetic task generation exposes reasoning weaknesses that generic benchmarks miss.
- Mechanism: A four-stage pipeline identifies known failure patterns from existing benchmarks (MedAgentBench), extracts matching real EHR scenarios, synthesizes diverse instruction variants via LLM, and validates with clinician review—producing tasks that systematically probe specific reasoning gaps.
- Core assumption: Agents that exhibit particular failure modes will continue to fail on new variants of those same failure patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses"
  - [section 2]: "Three major failure categories were identified: Data Retrieval Failure, Aggregation Error, and Threshold based conditional misjudgement"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; neighboring papers (Med-RewardBench, MedBench v4) address evaluation broadly but not failure-targeted generation specifically.
- Break condition: If synthesized tasks diverge from real-world failure patterns, benchmark predictive validity degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explicit prompt parameterization (e.g., "sort by date") can convert unreliable retrieval into deterministic behavior on structured EHR queries.
- Mechanism: Stateless agent execution (temperature=0, no conversation history) combined with explicit sort/filter arguments eliminates temporal alignment ambiguity in API queries.
- Core assumption: Retrieval failures stem from underspecified prompts rather than fundamental model limitations in understanding structured data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4]: "both GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5 achieved 100% SR in retrieval tasks, improving substantially from baseline scores of 42.5% and 54.5%, respectively, after the addition of an explicit 'sort by date' argument"
  - [section 2.1]: "suggests the retrieval logic did not consistently select the most recent valid record, which happens when agents do not supply a 'sort' parameter to their query"
  - [corpus]: No direct corroboration for this specific retrieval parameterization mechanism.
- Break condition: When retrieval requires multi-hop joins or implicit clinical context, explicit parameters may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal aggregation and threshold reasoning fail independently of retrieval, revealing deeper reasoning gaps.
- Mechanism: Tasks require correct time-window filtering + numerical computation + comparison against demographic-specific thresholds—each step is a potential failure point even when prior steps succeed.
- Core assumption: Temporal boundary handling and arithmetic are separable capabilities from data access.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4]: "performance declined sharply for aggregation tasks... Claude-3.5 achieved 64% and GPT-4o-mini 28%, indicating partial yet inconsistent handling of temporal and numerical reasoning"
  - [section 2.2]: "errors typically arose from missing data within aggregation windows or arithmetic inconsistencies"
  - [corpus]: Citrus-V mentions "reasoning over structured clinical tables" but does not specifically address temporal aggregation failures.
- Break condition: If agents cannot reliably filter time windows, aggregation failures conflate retrieval and computation errors, obscuring root cause.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
  - Why needed here: ART interfaces with FHIR R5 APIs; agents must construct valid FHIR resources (e.g., POST MedicationRequest) as action outputs.
  - Quick check question: What FHIR resource type would an agent POST to order potassium replacement for a patient with hypokalemia?

- Concept: Temporal Aggregation Windows
  - Why needed here: 24-hour averaging tasks test boundary handling; edge cases at 23–25h boundaries specifically probe window logic.
  - Quick check question: If a patient has glucose readings at 14:00 yesterday, 15:00 yesterday, and 13:00 today, which fall within a 24h window ending at 14:00 today?

- Concept: Demographic-Specific Reference Ranges
  - Why needed here: Threshold tasks use age/gender-adjusted normal ranges (e.g., hemoglobin for elderly male vs. general population); agents must apply context-sensitive logic.
  - Quick check question: Why might a creatinine value considered "normal" for a 30-year-old warrant clinical action for a 73-year-old?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: EHR records → failure pattern matching → task synthesis (real data + synthetic instructions) → clinical validation → agent execution → exact-match scoring

- Critical path: Scenario Identification Agent (mines 50K EHR records for failure-pattern matches; extracts real lab values, timestamps, demographics) → Task Generation Agent (LLM synthesizes 200 instruction variants per failure mode with preserved ground truth) → Quality Audit Agent (HITL clinician validation; planned automation via MedGemma/Med-PaLM with confidence-based routing) → AgentBench Evaluation (stateless execution via FHIR API, exact-match scoring against EHR-computed ground truth)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Real clinical data with synthetic instructions vs. fully synthetic: preserves EHR fidelity but limits instruction diversity
  - Exact-match scoring vs. step-wise verification: simpler implementation but may credit correct outputs from flawed intermediate steps (acknowledged limitation)
  - Stateless execution vs. multi-turn with memory: prevents memorization but restricts complex reasoning chains (planned future work)

- Failure signatures:
  - Retrieval: Agent returns "no recent [lab] found" despite valid values present (timestamp filtering or sort parameter missing)
  - Aggregation: Incorrect average despite correct retrieved values (incomplete window inclusion or arithmetic error)
  - Threshold: Misclassification of borderline values (e.g., K+=2.0–2.2 mEq/L labeled "not low" when replacement is warranted)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate retrieval improvement: Run 200 retrieval tasks without sort parameter, then with explicit "sort by date"; measure accuracy delta from ~50% → ~100%.
  2. Isolate aggregation error source: Provide agents pre-filtered data within time windows to separate filtering failures from computation failures.
  3. Map threshold sensitivity: Test same lab code across all 7 ranges (critically low → critically high) to identify systematic misclassification boundaries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do high exact-match scores on clinical EHR tasks mask flawed intermediate reasoning steps?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their exact-match metric "does not verify reasoning quality" and note agents "may reach correct outputs through flawed intermediate steps."
  - Why unresolved: Current evaluation protocols score only the final output, lacking the granular visibility required to validate the underlying logic or API call sequences.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study incorporating step-wise correctness checks (process-based evaluation) that distinguishes "lucky guesses" from sound clinical reasoning.

- Can specialized medical Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform general-purpose LLMs on failure-targeted aggregation and threshold tasks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the exclusion of baselines like "fine-tuned medical SLMs," which limits determining if observed gaps stem from inherent LLM limitations.
  - Why unresolved: The current study restricted evaluation to GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, leaving the performance profile of domain-specific smaller models on ART untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking ART against medical SLMs to compare error rates in temporal aggregation and threshold logic relative to general models.

- Is model performance on temporal reasoning tasks robust to variations in time window definitions and threshold boundaries?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "Evaluate temporal stability by varying time windows (24h→36h) and threshold boundaries" as a key direction for future work.
  - Why unresolved: Current results are based on fixed parameters and do not assess model sensitivity to parameter shifts or edge-case scenarios.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluating agents on ART tasks with perturbed time windows and boundary conditions to measure performance drift.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on a single institutional EHR dataset, raising concerns about generalizability across different healthcare systems with varying data schemas.
- Exact-match scoring cannot distinguish between correct outputs derived from flawed intermediate reasoning versus sound reasoning chains.
- The synthetic instruction generation process, while validated by clinicians, may not fully capture the diversity of real-world clinical communication patterns.

## Confidence

- High confidence in retrieval accuracy improvements (100% post-refinement) - directly measured with clear ground truth and deterministic API parameters.
- Medium confidence in aggregation failure rates (28-64%) - results depend on correct temporal window implementation which may vary across EHR systems.
- Low confidence in threshold reasoning difficulty claims (32-38%) - borderline value classification depends heavily on reference range definitions not fully specified in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-institutional validation: Replicate ART benchmark on EHR data from at least two additional healthcare systems to verify failure pattern consistency across different data schemas and clinical practices.

2. Ablation study on instruction generation: Systematically vary the synthetic instruction generation parameters (e.g., verbosity, clinical terminology usage) to quantify their impact on agent performance and identify optimal instruction characteristics.

3. Step-wise verification implementation: Modify the evaluation framework to capture intermediate reasoning steps (data retrieval, window filtering, computation) to distinguish between computational errors and upstream data access failures.
