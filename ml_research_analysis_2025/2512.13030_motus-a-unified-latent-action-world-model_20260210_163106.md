# Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.13030
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Motus achieves +15% improvement over X-VLA and +45% over π0.5 in simulation, and +11–48% gains on real-world dual-arm robots

## Executive Summary
Motus introduces a unified latent action world model that integrates vision-language understanding, video generation, inverse dynamics, world modeling, and video-action joint prediction within a single framework. The key innovation is leveraging optical flow-derived latent actions for large-scale pretraining, enabling cross-embodiment transfer by capturing universal motion patterns. Experiments demonstrate Motus achieves 87.02% success rate on RoboTwin 2.0, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins in both simulation and real-world dual-arm robot manipulation tasks.

## Method Summary
Motus employs a three-stage training pipeline: (1) pretrain VGM expert (Wan 2.2 5B) on video data, (2) unified training with latent actions derived from optical flow using Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, and (3) target-robot fine-tuning. The core innovation is the latent action pretraining pipeline that extracts 14-dimensional latent actions from optical flow via DC-AE compression, enabling action expert pretraining on unlabeled video data. A Tri-model Joint Attention mechanism fuses three experts (VLM, VGM, action) while preserving specialization through expert-specific feed-forward layers. The model supports five inference modes (VLA, WM, IDM, VGM, Joint) via UniDiffuser-style scheduling with modality-specific timesteps.

## Key Results
- +15% improvement over X-VLA and +45% over π0.5 in RoboTwin 2.0 simulation
- 87.02% success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 (50 tasks, clean/randomized)
- +11–48% gains on real-world dual-arm robots (AC-One, Agilex-Aloha-2)
- 97.6% success on LIBERO-Long benchmark
- Ablation shows ~5-10% drop when skipping latent action pretraining stage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Knowledge Fusion via Mixture-of-Transformers
The Tri-model Joint Attention shares multi-head self-attention layers across three experts while maintaining separate feed-forward networks. This enables gradient flow for cross-modal learning while preventing task interference. The architecture assumes pretrained VLM and VGM priors are complementary and transferable to action prediction through shared attention.

### Mechanism 2: Optical Flow-Derived Latent Actions for Pretraining
Optical flow captures pixel-level motion patterns that transfer across embodiments. The pipeline converts flow to RGB, compresses via DC-AE to 4×512 tokens, then encodes to 14-dim latent actions. Training mixes 90% unlabeled flow reconstruction with 10% labeled action supervision, driving latent-action alignment with real actions.

### Mechanism 3: Five-Mode Inference via UniDiffuser Scheduler
Single model switches between VLA, WM, IDM, VGM, and Joint modes by setting modality-specific timesteps. Video and action tokens receive independent noise schedules, with one modality set to clean (0) and the other to pure noise (T_τ) for conditional generation. Action-Dense Video-Sparse strategy (1:6 ratio) prevents video token dominance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rectified Flow / Flow Matching**
  - Why needed: Motus uses rectified flow objectives for joint video-action prediction, requiring understanding of straight-line interpolation in noise-data space.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why rectified flow uses v = ε - x_0 as the velocity target, and how it differs from DDPM's noise prediction?

- **Concept: Optical Flow and Motion Representation**
  - Why needed: Latent actions derive from optical flow, so understanding what optical flow encodes (pixel-level displacement, not semantics) explains cross-embodiment transfer.
  - Quick check: Why would optical flow be preferable to RGB reconstruction for learning cross-embodiment motion priors?

- **Concept: Mixture-of-Transformers vs Mixture-of-Experts**
  - Why needed: MoT differs from MoE—experts share attention, not routing. This determines how knowledge transfers across modalities.
  - Quick check: In MoT, which layers are shared vs. expert-specific, and what gradient path enables cross-modal learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input: o_t (current frame), ℓ (language), optional a_{t+1:t+k} or o_{t+1:t+k}
  ↓
  Video Encoder (from Wan 2.2 VGM) → video tokens
  VLM (Qwen3-VL-2B frozen) → understanding tokens
  Action Encoder (trainable Transformer) → action tokens
  ↓
  Tri-model Joint Attention: Concatenate all tokens for shared self-attention
  ↓
  Expert-specific FFNs process attention output separately
  ↓
  Video Decoder / Action Decoder based on inference mode

- **Critical path:** Stage 2 pretraining (unified training with latent actions) is the key innovation. Skipping directly to Stage 3 (SFT) without Stage 2 loses motion priors—ablation shows ~5-10% drop.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Video frame rate (5Hz) vs action frequency (30Hz): 1:6 ratio balances token counts but may lose temporal detail
  - DC-AE compression strength: Too aggressive loses motion detail; too weak retains appearance artifacts
  - VLM frozen vs fine-tuned: Frozen preserves understanding priors but limits adaptation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode collapse in VGM mode → video dominates, check token ratio
  - Latent actions don't align with real actions → VAE reconstruction too good (overfitting appearance) or too poor (losing motion)
  - Cross-embodiment transfer fails → task-agnostic data insufficient or optical flow contains embodiment-specific artifacts

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation Stage 2:** Train without latent action pretraining, compare success rate on RoboTwin 2.0. Expected: ~5-10% drop per Figure 6.
  2. **Latent action quality:** Visualize reconstructed optical flow from DC-AE latents; measure correlation between latent actions and ground-truth actions on held-out robot data.
  3. **Mode switching verification:** Run all five inference modes on same input; verify VLA produces actions, VGM produces video, IDM produces actions from future frames, etc. Compare VLA-only vs joint prediction performance (Table 8 shows 83.90% vs 87.02%).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the optical-flow-based latent action representation effectively scale to internet-scale uncurated video data where motion blur and compression artifacts degrade flow estimation?
  - Basis: The Conclusion states the future direction is to "learn latent actions from internet-scale general videos," whereas the current method relies on a curated "six-layer data pyramid."
  - Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on high-quality inputs (e.g., DPFlow) to derive latent actions; it is untested whether these "delta actions" remain semantically consistent when extracted from noisy, compressed internet videos.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the latent action encoder's performance and downstream policy success when trained exclusively on large-scale, unfiltered YouTube-style videos compared to the current curated datasets.

- **Question:** Does the reliance on off-the-shelf optical flow estimation introduce a failure mode in manipulation tasks involving heavy occlusion or texture-less objects?
  - Basis: The method (Sec. 4.2) derives latent actions from optical flow computed by DPFlow, a method typically susceptible to errors in regions with low texture or heavy occlusion.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates success in standard manipulation tasks, it does not ablate performance specifically against visual conditions known to break optical flow estimators.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of success rates on tasks specifically designed with texture-less objects or high-occlusion scenarios versus baseline methods that do not rely on explicit flow estimation.

- **Question:** What is the minimum density of labeled action data required to align the latent action space with executable robot controls effectively?
  - Basis: Section 4.2 mentions a specific recipe of mixing "90% unlabeled data... with 10% labeled trajectories" for alignment, but does not investigate if this ratio is optimal or a strict requirement.
  - Why unresolved: The sensitivity of the alignment loss (λ_a) and the latent space stability to lower labeled data ratios remains unquantified, which is critical for applying the method to data-scarce embodiments.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study plotting downstream task success rates against varying percentages (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%) of labeled action data used during the latent action pretraining phase.

## Limitations

- **Architecture Uncertainty:** The exact architecture of the lightweight encoder projecting 4×512 DC-AE tokens to 14-dimensional latent actions is not specified, affecting reproducibility of latent action quality.
- **Data Mixing Strategy:** Precise mixing ratios and sampling strategies for Stage 2 unified training across the six-layer data pyramid are not detailed, impacting knowledge balance.
- **Real-World Generalization:** The 11-48% gains on real dual-arm robots are based on limited evaluations with specific hardware embodiments, and may not generalize to other robot types.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (3/3):** The fundamental mechanism of using optical flow-derived latent actions for pretraining appears sound, supported by the ablation showing ~5-10% drop when skipping Stage 2. The MoT architecture concept is well-established, and the five-mode switching via UniDiffuser-style scheduler is theoretically valid.
- **Medium Confidence (2/3):** The quantitative improvements over baselines (15% over X-VLA, 45% over π0.5) are well-documented in simulation but rely on specific experimental conditions in RoboTwin 2.0. The real-world dual-arm results show promising ranges (11-48%) but with limited platform diversity.
- **Low Confidence (1/3):** The exact impact of latent action quality on cross-embodiment transfer is uncertain without detailed analysis of the DC-AE reconstruction quality and alignment metrics. The token ratio (1:6 video:action) and its necessity for preventing video dominance is inferred but not rigorously validated through ablation.

## Next Checks

1. **Latent Action Quality Validation:** Compute and visualize the correlation between reconstructed optical flow from DC-AE latents and ground-truth optical flow on held-out data. Measure MSE between latent actions and ground-truth actions on the labeled robot datasets to quantify alignment quality.

2. **Token Ratio Ablation:** Systematically vary the video-to-action token ratio (e.g., 1:3, 1:6, 1:10) and measure the impact on action prediction accuracy versus video generation quality. This validates whether the 1:6 ratio is optimal or if simpler ratios suffice.

3. **Cross-Embodiment Transfer Study:** Train Motus on a subset of robot embodiments and evaluate transfer to unseen robot types. Compare performance against models trained without latent action pretraining to quantify the cross-embodiment benefit and identify failure cases where optical flow contains embodiment-specific artifacts.
