core_contribution: This paper addresses the limitations of current medical AI systems
  that process diagnostic and medication tasks in isolation, lacking collaborative
  mechanisms and resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. To solve this problem,
  the authors propose MedCoAct, a confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates
  doctor-pharmacist collaboration in integrated diagnosis-to-treatment workflows.

# MedCoAct: Confidence-Aware Multi-Agent Collaboration for Complete Clinical Decision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10461
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Dual-agent framework achieves 67.58% diagnostic and medication accuracy, outperforming single-agent by 7.04% and 7.08% respectively

## Executive Summary
MedCoAct addresses the limitations of current medical AI systems that process diagnostic and medication tasks in isolation. The framework simulates doctor-pharmacist collaboration through specialized dual agents with confidence-aware reflection mechanisms. Using the DrugCareQA benchmark of 2,700 real-world medical consultation cases, MedCoAct demonstrates significant improvements in both diagnostic and medication recommendation accuracy while providing interpretable decision pathways. The system is particularly effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical scenarios.

## Method Summary
MedCoAct implements a dual-agent framework using Qwen-max-0428 LLM with role-specific knowledge bases. The doctor agent handles diagnosis through department classification, query planning, and vector search, while the pharmacist agent generates medication recommendations based on diagnostic results. Both agents employ confidence-aware reflection that triggers query regeneration when retrieval confidence falls below a threshold. The system uses Qwen3-embedding for coarse retrieval and Qwen3-reranker for fine-grained document selection, with knowledge bases pre-classified into doctor-only, pharmacist-only, or dual-indexed categories.

## Key Results
- 67.58% diagnostic accuracy and 67.58% medication recommendation accuracy
- 7.04% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over single-agent framework
- 7.08% improvement in medication recommendation accuracy over single-agent framework
- Outperforms Local Deep Research (web search) in Top-1 diagnostic accuracy (74.51% vs 82.59% for Top-3)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Role Specialization with Domain-Specific Retrieval
Medical expertise is partitionable into diagnostic vs. pharmaceutical knowledge domains. Doctor and pharmacist agents retrieve from specialized knowledge bases with minimal document overlap, validated by ROUGE analysis showing distinct retrieval patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence-Aware Reflection and Query Re-optimization
Agents autonomously assess retrieval confidence and regenerate queries when below threshold, preventing early commitment to poor evidence. This self-correction loop improves document contribution scores and final decision quality.

### Mechanism 3: Sequential Cross-Agent Workflow with Information Handoff
Doctor agent produces structured diagnosis → Pharmacist agent receives diagnosis + symptoms → Pharmacist autonomously evaluates adoption → Personalized medication plan generated. This mirrors clinical practice while maintaining professional independence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Search**: MedCoAct depends on two-stage retrieval (Qwen3-embedding for coarse recall, Qwen3-reranker for fine-grained selection). Quick check: Can you explain why reranking improves over embedding-only retrieval, and what "contribution" vs. "relevance" metrics measure?
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns**: MedCoAct implements sequential handoff (doctor → pharmacist), not debate or voting. Quick check: What are three common multi-agent coordination patterns, and which does MedCoAct use?
- **Confidence Estimation in LLMs**: The reflection mechanism hinges on confidence thresholds. Quick check: How might an LLM estimate confidence in its retrieval results, and what are failure modes of such estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Patient complaint → Doctor Agent (classification → query planning → vector search → reflection → diagnosis) → Pharmacist Agent (receives diagnosis + symptoms → query planning → vector search → reflection → medication recommendation)
- **Critical path**: 1. Patient complaint → Doctor agent (diagnosis) 2. Diagnosis + symptoms → Pharmacist agent (prescription) 3. Low-confidence trigger → Query regeneration loop
- **Design tradeoffs**: Closed knowledge bases for hospital compliance vs. Local Deep Research's web access; ~1.15% drug prescription improvement from dual agents; relevance scores (7.14–7.45) exceed contribution scores (5.89–6.58)
- **Failure signatures**: Insufficient medical knowledge, over-reliance on retrieved documents, conflicting information handling, model dependency worsening with weaker LLMs
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline replication on DrugCareQA subset to establish single-agent baselines 2. Confidence threshold sweep to identify optimal operating point 3. Ablation on reflection to quantify its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does MedCoAct performance scale when extended to broader, highly specialized medical domains beyond the current seven departments?
- Can advanced inter-agent communication protocols further optimize the efficiency or accuracy of the doctor-pharmacist collaboration?
- Can the framework's retrieval strategy be improved to match the Top-3 diagnostic breadth of internet-dependent deep research systems?

## Limitations
- Exact confidence thresholds and orchestration details are unspecified, blocking faithful reproduction
- Computational overhead of dual-agent framework is not quantified, raising scalability concerns
- Results are based on a relatively small dataset (2,700 cases) that may not capture full clinical diversity

## Confidence
- **High**: Role specialization and sequential collaboration improve diagnostic and prescription accuracy (supported by ablation results)
- **Medium**: Confidence-aware reflection mechanism effectiveness (described but lacks isolated ablation data)
- **Low**: Generalizability beyond DrugCareQA dataset (small sample size, limited domain coverage)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation of Confidence Thresholds**: Sweep confidence thresholds to identify optimal operating point and quantify reflection impact
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Test on external dataset like MIMIC-IV to assess robustness across different clinical contexts
3. **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Measure inference time and resource usage compared to single-agent baselines to evaluate practical scalability
