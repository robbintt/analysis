# A Spectral-Grassmann Wasserstein metric for operator representations of dynamical systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.24920
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24920
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** SGOT metric enables robust comparison and interpolation of dynamical systems via Koopman operator representations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Spectral-Grassmann Optimal Transport (SGOT) metric, a novel approach for comparing dynamical systems through their Koopman operator representations. The method represents each system as a distribution over joint eigenvalues and spectral projectors on the Grassmann manifold, enabling a principled Wasserstein distance computation. SGOT demonstrates superior performance on machine learning tasks like classification and dimensionality reduction while being robust to sampling frequency variations. The metric also supports computation of Fréchet means for barycenters between dynamical systems.

## Method Summary
The authors propose representing dynamical systems through their Koopman or transfer operator spectra, encoding each system as a joint distribution of eigenvalues and spectral projectors on the Grassmann manifold. This representation is then compared using optimal transport theory to define a Wasserstein metric. The approach leverages the geometric structure of the Grassmannian to capture both spectral and geometric properties of the operators, providing a theoretically principled and computationally efficient comparison method that remains robust to sampling frequency variations.

## Key Results
- SGOT consistently outperforms existing metrics on classification and dimensionality reduction tasks
- The metric enables meaningful interpolation between dynamical systems
- SGOT supports Fréchet mean computation for barycenters of dynamical systems
- The approach is computationally efficient and robust to sampling frequency variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric works by capturing both spectral and geometric properties of dynamical systems through their operator representations. By encoding systems as distributions over eigenvalues and spectral projectors on the Grassmann manifold, SGOT preserves the intrinsic geometry of the operator space while enabling optimal transport-based comparison. This joint representation captures both the spectral content (eigenvalues) and the geometric structure (projectors) of the dynamical systems, providing a more complete characterization than spectral metrics alone.

## Foundational Learning

**Koopman operator theory**: Linear infinite-dimensional operator that describes the evolution of observables in dynamical systems. Needed to understand how the method represents dynamical systems. Quick check: Verify that the Koopman operator is indeed linear and acts on observables rather than states.

**Grassmann manifold**: Space of all linear subspaces of a given dimension in a vector space. Required for representing spectral projectors geometrically. Quick check: Confirm that the Grassmannian provides the appropriate geometric structure for comparing subspaces.

**Optimal transport theory**: Mathematical framework for comparing probability distributions. Essential for defining the Wasserstein metric between system representations. Quick check: Ensure the transport cost satisfies the triangle inequality for metric properties.

**Spectral projector**: Orthogonal projection onto eigenspaces of an operator. Critical for capturing geometric properties beyond eigenvalues. Quick check: Verify that projectors are indeed orthogonal and span the correct eigenspaces.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Koopman/Transfer operator extraction -> Spectral decomposition -> Grassmannian embedding -> Optimal transport computation -> Metric calculation

**Critical path**: The essential computation flow is operator extraction → spectral decomposition → metric calculation, where the Grassmannian embedding serves as the critical bridge between spectral and geometric representations.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (optimal transport is expensive) for expressiveness (joint spectral-geometric representation), but mitigates this through efficient transport algorithms and eigenvalue truncation.

**Failure signatures**: The metric may fail when systems have very different spectral dimensions (leading to empty transport plans), when numerical instability in projector computation occurs, or when sampling is too sparse to capture essential dynamics.

**First experiments**:
1. Verify metric properties (symmetry, triangle inequality) on synthetic operators with known spectra
2. Test robustness to sampling frequency by comparing metrics on the same system with different time steps
3. Validate interpolation results by checking that interpolated systems exhibit expected intermediate dynamics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks
