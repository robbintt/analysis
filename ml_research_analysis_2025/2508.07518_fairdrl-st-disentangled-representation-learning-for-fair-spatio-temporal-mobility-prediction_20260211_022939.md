# FairDRL-ST: Disentangled Representation Learning for Fair Spatio-Temporal Mobility Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.07518
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07518
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves RFG of 24.45 and IFG of 4.89 on TaxiNYC while maintaining predictive accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes FairDRL-ST, a fairness-aware framework for spatio-temporal mobility prediction that integrates disentangled representation learning with adversarial learning to mitigate bias. The method learns to separate sensitive and non-sensitive factors in mobility data in an unsupervised manner, without requiring demographic group labels during training. Experiments on real-world datasets (TaxiNYC and BikeNYC) show that FairDRL-ST consistently reduces fairness gaps while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware baselines.

## Method Summary
FairDRL-ST is a VAE-based architecture that partitions the latent representation into sensitive ($z_S$) and non-sensitive ($z_{Ns}$) components. The decoder is conditioned on $z_{Ns}$ and ground-truth sensitive attributes, incentivizing the model to encode predictive factors without duplicating sensitive information. Adversarial training ensures $z_S$ retains all necessary demographic information through a generator-discriminator pair, while predictive regularization prevents information leakage by penalizing the non-sensitive code if it can predict sensitive attributes. The framework processes heterogeneous urban data by converting them into unified grid tensor structures.

## Key Results
- Achieves the best RFG of 24.45 and IFG of 4.89 on TaxiNYC dataset
- Achieves RFG of 32.16 and IFG of 23.28 on BikeNYC dataset
- Maintains or improves predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware baselines
- Demonstrates effectiveness in promoting fairness without sacrificing performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Space Partitioning
The framework isolates sensitive attributes from task-relevant spatio-temporal features by forcing them into separate latent subspaces. The model partitions latent representation $z$ into $z_S$ (sensitive) and $z_{Ns}$ (non-sensitive), with the decoder conditioned on $z_{Ns}$ and ground-truth $S$ during reconstruction.

### Mechanism 2: Adversarial Separation
Adversarial training ensures the sensitive latent code ($z_S$) retains all necessary demographic information, preventing the encoder from hiding sensitive data in the non-sensitive code. A generator attempts to reconstruct sensitive attributes $S$ from $z_S$, while a discriminator distinguishes real $S$ from generated $\hat{S}$.

### Mechanism 3: Predictive Regularization
Predictive regularisation prevents information leakage by actively penalizing the non-sensitive code ($z_{Ns}$) if it can predict sensitive attributes. A predictor network attempts to infer $S$ from $z_{Ns}$, and the loss function subtracts the predictor's success term, explicitly lowering the objective when the predictor succeeds.

## Foundational Learning

- **VAE & ELBO:** The architecture is built on a VAE backbone. Understanding Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and KL-divergence is required to grasp how the model enforces latent space structure and reconstruction quality. *Quick check:* Can you explain why minimizing KL-divergence in a VAE encourages the latent space to follow a Gaussian distribution?

- **Adversarial Learning (GANs):** The separation of sensitive attributes relies on a minimax game between a generator (reconstructing $S$) and a discriminator. *Quick check:* In a standard GAN, what happens to the generator's loss if the discriminator becomes too strong too quickly?

- **Spatio-Temporal Rasterization:** The model processes heterogeneous urban data (1D, 2D, 3D) by converting them into a unified grid tensor structure. *Quick check:* How would you convert a dataset of discrete Point-of-Interest (POI) coordinates into the 2D tensor format required by the encoder?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input tensors $\to$ Encoder $\to$ $z$ $\to$ Separator $\to$ $\{z_S, z_{Ns}\}$ $\to$ Decoder (takes $z_{Ns}$ + Ground Truth $S$) $\to$ Reconstructed Input; $z_S$ $\to$ Generator $\to$ $\hat{S}$; Discriminator compares $\hat{S}$ vs $S$; $z_{Ns}$ $\to$ Predictor $\to$ Predicted $S$

- **Critical path:** Input $\to$ Encoder $\to$ $z_S$ (must fool discriminator regarding $S$) AND $z_{Ns}$ (must fail predictor regarding $S$) $\to$ Decoder

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Supervision Paradox:** While claiming "unsupervised" regarding fairness metrics, training explicitly requires ground truth sensitive attributes $S$ for the discriminator and predictor
  - **Accuracy vs. Fairness:** The hyperparameter $\lambda$ controls the balance, with higher values improving fairness but potentially degrading accuracy

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Reconstruction Collapse:** If $z_S$ is ignored by the decoder, the model might learn to encode everything in $z_{Ns}$, ignoring the disentanglement
  - **Over-regularization:** High $\lambda$ might push $z_{Ns}$ to contain zero information, causing prediction accuracy (MAE) to spike

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Verify Entanglement:** Train the baseline VAE without the sensitive/non-sensitive modules. Attempt to predict $S$ from the latent code to confirm bias exists
  2. **Module Ablation:** Disable the Predictor (Non-sensitive Module) to verify if $z_{Ns}$ captures sensitive info (cheating the separation)
  3. **Hyperparameter Scan:** Sweep $\lambda$ to plot the Pareto frontier between MAE (accuracy) and RFG/IFG (fairness)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Adaptive constraint mechanisms:** How can adaptive constraint mechanisms be developed to dynamically balance the trade-off between fairness and accuracy during training, replacing the fixed regularization weight? The current framework relies on a fixed hyperparameter $\lambda$ that is suboptimal across different data distributions or training stages.

- **Generalization to other domains:** Does the unsupervised disentanglement approach generalize to other spatio-temporal domains, such as traffic flow forecasting or urban resource allocation, without requiring architectural modifications? The experiments are limited to mobility demand datasets that may share specific latent structures facilitating disentanglement.

- **Refining disentanglement mechanism:** Can the disentanglement mechanism be refined to prevent the loss of task-relevant predictive signals currently observed when the non-sensitive module is active? The current adversarial separation appears "lossy," discarding features correlated with sensitive attributes that are also critical for high-fidelity reconstruction and forecasting.

## Limitations

- The method requires ground truth sensitive attributes during training despite claiming unsupervised learning, creating a supervision paradox
- The effectiveness depends on the assumption that sensitive and non-sensitive factors are separable in the latent space, which may not hold for strongly correlated demographic and mobility patterns
- The fixed hyperparameter $\lambda$ may not optimally balance fairness and accuracy across different datasets or training stages

## Confidence

- **High:** The existence of a VAE-based architecture with latent space partitioning
- **Medium:** The effectiveness of the adversarial learning mechanism for enforcing sensitive attribute separation
- **Low:** The unsupervised nature of the method, as the loss function explicitly requires ground truth sensitive attributes for training

## Next Checks

1. **Entanglement Test:** Verify that sensitive attributes can be predicted from the baseline VAE's latent representation before applying FairDRL-ST, confirming the existence of bias

2. **Module Dependency:** Perform an ablation study removing the Predictor (Non-sensitive Module) to determine if $z_{Ns}$ still contains sensitive information

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Conduct a systematic sweep of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff parameter $\lambda$ to characterize the Pareto frontier and identify optimal settings for different fairness-accuracy priorities
