# Open-Set Living Need Prediction with Large Language Models
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02713
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02713
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: PIGEON achieves 19.37% better recall performance on average compared to closed-set methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting user living needs on life service platforms by reformulating it as an open-set classification problem. The proposed PIGEON system leverages large language models (LLMs) with behavior-aware record retrieval and Maslow's hierarchy of needs to generate flexible, unrestricted need descriptions. A key contribution is the design of a recall module using fine-tuned text embeddings to map these open-set needs to appropriate life services. Experiments show PIGEON significantly outperforms closed-set methods, achieving 19.37% better recall performance on average. Human evaluation confirms the generated predictions are both reasonable and specific, while ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.

## Method Summary
PIGEON employs a novel approach to living need prediction by first retrieving user behavior records and then using LLMs to generate need descriptions based on Maslow's hierarchy. The system maps these open-set needs to services through a recall module that uses fine-tuned text embeddings. A critical innovation is the instruction tuning framework that enables smaller, more efficient models to replicate the performance of larger LLMs. The approach treats need prediction as an open-set problem rather than restricting to predefined categories, allowing for more flexible and comprehensive service recommendations.

## Key Results
- PIGEON achieves 19.37% better recall performance on average compared to closed-set methods
- Human evaluation shows PIGEON's generated need descriptions are more reasonable and specific than competitors
- Instruction tuning enables smaller models to maintain performance while reducing computational costs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system succeeds by combining behavior-aware record retrieval with LLM-generated need descriptions, allowing for flexible, context-specific predictions. The recall module effectively bridges the gap between open-ended need descriptions and specific service offerings. By leveraging Maslow's hierarchy, the approach ensures needs are grounded in established psychological frameworks while remaining adaptable to individual user contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Open-set classification**: Needed to handle the infinite variety of user needs beyond predefined categories; quick check: compare performance against closed-set baselines
- **Text embedding fine-tuning**: Required to map free-form need descriptions to specific services; quick check: evaluate recall accuracy across different embedding models
- **Instruction tuning**: Enables efficient deployment on smaller models without sacrificing performance; quick check: measure performance degradation across different model sizes
- **Maslow's hierarchy of needs**: Provides a structured framework for generating relevant need descriptions; quick check: analyze coverage of predicted needs across hierarchy levels
- **Behavior-aware record retrieval**: Ensures predictions are grounded in actual user behavior patterns; quick check: compare retrieval strategies (sequential vs. random sampling)
- **Human evaluation methodology**: Critical for assessing the quality and reasonableness of generated predictions; quick check: validate inter-rater reliability and coverage

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Behavior Records -> LLM Need Generation -> Recall Module -> Service Mapping

Critical path: The most important execution sequence is User Behavior Records → LLM Need Generation → Recall Module, as this chain transforms raw user data into actionable service predictions.

Design tradeoffs: The system balances between open-set flexibility and practical service mapping accuracy. The instruction tuning approach trades some precision for deployment efficiency, while the recall module design prioritizes coverage over perfect precision.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include: (1) irrelevant need descriptions due to poor behavior record retrieval, (2) recall module mismatches between needs and services, (3) instruction tuning degradation on edge cases, and (4) cultural bias in Maslow's hierarchy application.

First experiments to run: (1) Compare recall module performance across different embedding models, (2) Test instruction tuning degradation across model size spectrum, (3) Validate behavior record retrieval quality with different sampling strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a dataset from a single Chinese platform, raising generalizability concerns
- Human evaluation sample size of 50 predictions may not capture full spectrum of quality variations
- Offline metrics may not fully represent real-world open-set prediction scenarios

## Confidence
High confidence in core finding that open-set prediction outperforms closed-set approaches, supported by consistent experimental results across multiple metrics.
Medium confidence in claims about PIGEON's generated need descriptions being more reasonable and specific, as this relies on subjective human evaluation.
Medium confidence in instruction tuning results for deployment efficiency, given limited exploration of trade-offs across model sizes.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural validation using datasets from multiple geographic regions and service platforms to assess generalizability
2. Real-world deployment testing with A/B experiments measuring actual user engagement and satisfaction with predicted needs
3. Robustness testing with adversarial or out-of-distribution need descriptions to evaluate the recall module's ability to handle truly novel requirements beyond the training distribution
