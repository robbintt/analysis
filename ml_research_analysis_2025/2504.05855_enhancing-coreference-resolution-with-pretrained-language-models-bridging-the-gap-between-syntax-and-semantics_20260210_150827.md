# Enhancing Coreference Resolution with Pretrained Language Models: Bridging the Gap Between Syntax and Semantics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.05855
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05855
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: Proposes a framework integrating syntax and semantics via attention to improve coreference resolution accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for coreference resolution that bridges the gap between syntactic structure and semantic understanding. The authors propose using attention mechanisms over contextual embeddings from pretrained language models, enhanced with syntactic features, to more accurately identify coreferential links between entities. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional systems, achieving 84.6% F1 score on benchmark datasets, with particular success in disambiguating ambiguous references. The approach addresses a fundamental challenge in natural language processing by showing how complementary syntactic and semantic signals can be jointly leveraged for improved entity resolution.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework extracts contextual embeddings from PLMs (BERT/RoBERTa), computes attention scores over entity pairs to quantify coreferential likelihood, and integrates these with syntactic parse features through an attention mechanism. The method uses an enhanced embedding layer that combines base PLM embeddings with syntactic features extracted from parse trees, then applies an attention-based decoder to predict coreferential links. The system is trained with AdamW optimizer (learning rate 2×10⁻⁵) for 5 epochs with gradient clipping, using beam search for inference.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.6% average F1 score with full syntax-semantic integration
- Improves over baseline (75.8% F1) by 8.8 percentage points
- Hierarchical Attention variant achieves 88.2% F1, outperforming Vanilla Attention (75.3%)
- Shows effectiveness across diverse datasets including LexGLUE, SciCo, and COVID-19 Tweets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Attention scores over contextual embeddings quantify coreferential likelihood between entity pairs by computing normalized similarity metrics that integrate with syntactic features through a decoder. This assumes semantic similarity in PLM embedding space correlates with coreferential relationships, with syntax providing disambiguating constraints.

### Mechanism 2
Jointly representing syntax and semantics through attention improves disambiguation by constructing representations where syntax provides structural context and semantics provides meaning-based signals. The integration captures nuances neither signal provides alone, particularly in ambiguous referential cases.

### Mechanism 3
Enhancing PLM embeddings with explicit syntactic features improves resolution beyond contextual embeddings alone by adding discriminative structural information that helps distinguish between competing referents. This refinement helps resolve ambiguous references where context alone is insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Coreference Resolution**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework targets identifying when different expressions refer to the same entity
  - Quick check question: Given "Alice went to the store. She bought milk," can you identify the coreferential link and explain why ambiguity might arise in longer texts?

- **Concept: Attention Mechanisms in Transformers**
  - Why needed here: The method computes attention scores over entity embeddings and uses query/key/value architecture for syntax-semantics fusion
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how softmax-normalized attention scores differ from raw similarity metrics, and why the paper uses K for syntax and V for semantics?

- **Concept: Syntactic Parsing (Dependency/Constituency Trees)**
  - Why needed here: The framework extracts parse trees T = (V, E) and integrates syntactic features into embeddings
  - Quick check question: For the sentence "The dog that chased the cat barked," what nodes would a parse tree capture that might help distinguish "that" referring to "dog" vs. other antecedents?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Text → Syntactic Parser → Parse Tree T
           → PLM (BERT/RoBERTa) → Contextual Embeddings C
           → Semantic Role Labeler → Semantic Roles R
           
  C + T + R → Enhanced Embedding Layer → E_enhanced
           → Attention Module → Coreference Scores S
           → Decoder D → Coreferential Link Predictions

- **Critical path:**
  1. Parse input to extract syntactic tree (error propagation risk)
  2. Generate PLM embeddings (GPU memory bottleneck for long sequences)
  3. Compute attention scores over all candidate entity pairs (O(n²) complexity)
  4. Integrate syntactic features via addition before attention
  5. Decode final predictions with joint syntactic-semantic features

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Parser choice vs. end-to-end: External parser adds interpretability but introduces pipeline errors
  - Embedding dimension vs. computational cost: Larger models may not linearly improve results
  - Attention type: Hierarchical Attention outperforms Vanilla but adds complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Parser errors on long/complex sentences → degraded E_enhanced → false negatives
  - Informal text → syntactic structures less reliable
  - Ambiguous pronouns → attention scores may distribute too evenly

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run base PLM on LexGLUE without syntax/semantic enhancements to verify reported baseline F1
  2. **Ablation by component:** Systematically remove syntax integration, then semantic enhancements, then attention to reproduce Table 2 degradation
  3. **Parser sensitivity test:** Swap syntactic parser for lower-quality alternative; measure correlation between parse accuracy and coreference F1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework be made robust to errors introduced by the syntactic parser without compromising the benefits of structural integration? The paper identifies parser quality as a key limitation but doesn't propose error correction mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
Can the model be adapted to better handle highly complex sentences where the relationship between syntactic structure and semantic roles is ambiguous? The current integration assumes a complementary relationship that may break down in complex contexts.

### Open Question 3
Does the integration strategy generalize effectively to varied linguistic conditions and low-resource languages not represented in current benchmarks? The authors explicitly call for broader assessment across diverse linguistic domains.

## Limitations
- Reliance on external syntactic parser introduces error propagation risk that may undermine performance
- Struggles with highly complex sentences where syntactic-semantic interactions are unclear
- Performance degrades on informal text (70.2% F1 on COVID-19 Tweets), limiting real-world applicability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Coreference resolution task definition, general attention mechanism architecture, reported performance improvements on standard datasets

**Medium confidence**: Claims about syntax-semantics integration benefits, effectiveness of enhanced embeddings

**Low confidence**: Specific implementation details enabling reproducibility, robustness to parser errors

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the ablation study (Table 2) by systematically removing syntax integration, semantic enhancements, and attention components to verify the reported performance degradation curve

2. Conduct parser sensitivity analysis by replacing the syntactic parser with a lower-quality alternative and measuring correlation between parse accuracy and coreference F1 scores

3. Implement the proposed framework on a held-out dataset with informal text to test the claimed limitation about informal text handling
