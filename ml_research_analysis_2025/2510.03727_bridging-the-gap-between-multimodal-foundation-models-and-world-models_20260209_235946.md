## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses the gap between Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and World Models by enhancing their ability to reason about spatial-temporal dynamics and generate controlled multimodal content. It introduces novel frameworks for structured and controllable generation (image, video, 4D scenes) and proposes the MMWorld benchmark to evaluate multi-discipline and multi-faceted reasoning. The work bridges perception and reasoning through causal, counterfactual, and spatiotemporal modules, aiming to equip MFMs with the capability to understand and simulate the underlying principles of the physical world.

## Method Summary
The thesis proposes a comprehensive framework to bridge MFMs and world models through three core mechanisms: (1) injecting counterfactual and causal reasoning into discriminative models to enable "what-if" scenario analysis, (2) introducing hierarchical control for generative models to simulate specific physical dynamics, and (3) establishing a rigorous evaluation benchmark (MMWorld) that measures multi-disciplinary reasoning. The approach leverages pre-trained models (CLIP, Stable Diffusion, video diffusion backbones) and enhances them with custom adapters for causal inference, motion control, and spatiotemporal awareness. The methods are validated across discriminative tasks (VQA, image retrieval) and generative tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-4D).

## Key Results
- Introduces CPL (Counterfactual Prompt Learning) to improve CLIP's ability to identify causally relevant features.
- Proposes Mojito, a text-to-video generation framework with explicit motion intensity and directional control.
- Establishes MMWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multi-discipline reasoning in MFMs across seven domains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Standard MFMs fail as world models because they rely on surface correlations rather than understanding the causal and temporal dynamics of the world. The architecture bridges the gap by injecting structural inductive biases—specifically counterfactual thinking and causal inference—into the reasoning pipeline. Instead of just mapping inputs to outputs, the model is forced to disentangle features and reason about "what-if" scenarios, enabling it to estimate missing states and predict future dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
Generative MFMs act as effective world models only when they can simulate specific, controlled physical dynamics rather than hallucinating unconstrained scenarios. The thesis implements a hierarchical control mechanism where high-level semantic constraints (scene graphs, text prompts) and low-level dynamic constraints (motion intensity, trajectories) jointly condition the generative process. This forces the latent space to respect physical consistency and user intent.

### Mechanism 3
Progress toward world models is stalled by benchmarks that focus on static perception rather than temporal and causal evolution. The introduction of the "MMWorld" benchmark establishes a feedback loop that explicitly measures multi-disciplinary reasoning (explanation, prediction, expertise). By defining the target metric as "reasoning about the underlying principles," the training and selection of MFMs shifts toward world-modeling capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Counterfactual Reasoning**
- Why needed here: The thesis posits that MFMs must reason about hypothetical scenarios ("what if?") to act as world models. Understanding this is crucial for the discriminative components.
- Quick check question: Can the model predict how a scene would change if an object were removed, or if an action were skipped?

**Concept: Disentangled Representation Learning**
- Why needed here: The generative components rely on separating motion, appearance, and structure. You cannot control specific aspects of a world simulation if the features are entangled.
- Quick check question: Can you vary the "speed" of a video generation without changing the "content"?

**Concept: Spatiotemporal Dynamics**
- Why needed here: A key gap identified is the lack of "spatial and temporal awareness." World modeling fundamentally requires understanding how states evolve over time.
- Quick check question: Does the model treat a video as a sequence of static images, or does it encode the trajectory and velocity of objects?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Pre-trained MFM (CLIP/Stable Diffusion) -> Prompt Adapters (CPL/ComCLIP) -> Causal/Graph Transformers -> Controlled Generation (FlexEControl/Mojito/Morpho4D) -> Output (Reasoning/Generated Content)

**Critical path:** The flow moves from **Perception** (Efficient Adaptation) -> **Reasoning** (Causal/Counterfactual) -> **Generation** (Controllable Video/4D). The crucial link is using the reasoning capabilities to inform the generation (e.g., understanding "motion" causality to generate it).

**Design tradeoffs:** The thesis trades off **simplicity** (standard CLIP/Stable Diffusion) for **controllability** (complex adapters, graph constraints). It increases parameter efficiency (K-Adaptation) to manage this complexity.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Reasoning Failure:** The model uses "shortcut learning" (e.g., answering based on background context rather than the action).
- **Generation Failure:** "Modal imbalance" where the text prompt dominates the control signal (e.g., prompt says "fast" but video is static because the control adapter failed).

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline Evaluation:** Run a standard MFM (e.g., GPT-4V or CLIP) on the MMWorld benchmark to quantify the initial "reasoning gap."
2. **Ablation of Causal Modules:** Remove the counterfactual prompt learning and measure the drop in performance on "what-if" questions in the benchmark.
3. **Control Verification:** Generate videos using "Mojito" with conflicting instructions (text vs. trajectory) to verify if the control mechanism successfully overrides the default generation bias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
How can multimodal foundation models be designed to maintain coherence and perform effective reasoning over very long video or interactive sequences (e.g., hundreds of frames or extended dialogues)? The conclusion identifies "improving long-horizon reasoning" as a key open challenge, and the future work section notes that current models "struggle to maintain coherence or perform reasoning over long sequences."

**Open Question 2**
What is the most effective way to incorporate diverse, structured modalities (e.g., depth maps, scene graphs, audio) into a unified generative world model without sacrificing the quality or controllability of the primary visual output? The future work section states: "Future models should be designed to flexibly fuse diverse and structured inputs, supporting multimodal synthesis that reflects the richness and variety of the real world."

**Open Question 3**
How can we develop a comprehensive evaluation suite that rigorously assesses a model's *causal* and *counterfactual* reasoning abilities within dynamic, multimodal environments? The conclusion notes the need for "benchmarks designed specifically for evaluating MFMs from these perspectives" (causality, controllability). The introduced MMWorld benchmark evaluates some reasoning facets but does not explicitly isolate causal or counterfactual performance.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of counterfactual reasoning modules depends on the quality of generated "what-if" questions and the robustness of the causal inference pipeline.
- The assumption that motion and appearance can be perfectly disentangled in natural scenes may not hold in complex, occluded environments.
- The MMWorld benchmark, while ambitious, is a new evaluation that has not yet been independently validated for sensitivity to shortcuts or overfitting.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observation that standard MFMs struggle with temporal and causal reasoning is well-supported by the literature.
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed mechanisms (counterfactual prompt learning, hierarchical control for generation) are theoretically sound but require further validation for general applicability.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific performance claims on the novel MMWorld benchmark are difficult to assess without independent replication.

## Next Checks

1. **OOD Generalization Test:** Evaluate the counterfactual reasoning model on a held-out set of "what-if" scenarios that are semantically similar but visually distinct from the training data to test for shortcut learning.
2. **Control Signal Interference:** Conduct a controlled experiment where text and motion control signals are in direct conflict (e.g., "a car moving right" with a trajectory pointing left) and measure which signal the model obeys.
3. **Benchmark Robustness Analysis:** Perform an ablation study on the MMWorld benchmark to identify which types of questions (perception vs. prediction vs. explanation) contribute most to the model's performance, to ensure the benchmark is not dominated by static recognition tasks.
