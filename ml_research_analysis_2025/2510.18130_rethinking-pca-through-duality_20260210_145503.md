# Rethinking PCA Through Duality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18130
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces DC dual formulations for PCA that are kernelizable and out-of-sample applicable, with surprising connections to simultaneous iteration and new optimization algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper revisits Principal Component Analysis through the lens of difference-of-convex (DC) duality, motivated by recent connections between self-attention and kernel PCA. The authors propose novel DC dual formulations where unitarily invariant functions enable kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability. They establish a surprising equivalence between the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA) and classical simultaneous iteration, providing new insights into this numerical linear algebra method. The work introduces new algorithms including kernelizable robust PCA minimizing ℓ₁ reconstruction errors, demonstrating that simple first-order optimization methods can outperform state-of-the-art solvers for certain formulations.

## Method Summary
The paper develops DC dual formulations for PCA by decomposing objectives into convex-concave pairs, enabling the use of specialized solvers like DCA. When the primal function is unitarily invariant (e.g., Schatten p-norms), the dual becomes kernelizable, allowing operations on kernel matrices instead of explicit data. The authors implement proximal gradient and ZeroFPR algorithms for these formulations and compare against classical eigensolvers (SVDS/KrylovKit) on synthetic matrices, MNIST, and GloVe embeddings, targeting low-precision PCA (ε=10⁻³).

## Key Results
- First-order methods on new dual formulations (n)-(o) outperform classical solvers at low precision
- DC dual of variance maximization PCA is equivalent to simultaneous iteration
- ℓ₁ reconstruction error PCA admits kernelizable DC dual formulation
- Robust PCA shows significant improvement on contaminated data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The DC dual of a PCA problem is kernelizable and out-of-sample applicable if the primal contains a unitarily invariant function. By expressing the primal function G as g∘σ (where σ are singular values), the dual depends solely on the kernel matrix K=XXᵀ rather than explicit data X. This allows kernel trick usage for high-dimensional feature spaces and projecting new data without computing features explicitly. Core assumption: G is unitarily invariant (e.g., Schatten p-norms). Break condition: If G is not unitarily invariant, dual may not reduce to kernel matrix operations.

### Mechanism 2
DCA applied to variance maximization PCA is equivalent to simultaneous iteration. When DCA is applied to relaxed variance maximization objective (-½‖XW‖²_{S₂}), iterative update steps produce iterates spanning same subspace as simultaneous iteration, bridging optimization with numerical linear algebra. Core assumption: Assumption 2.4 holds and constraint set is relaxed to spectral norm ball. Break condition: Significant objective modifications (e.g., non-unitarily invariant sparsity constraints) may break alignment with orthogonal subspace iteration.

### Mechanism 3
ℓ₁ reconstruction error PCA admits kernelizable DC dual formulation solvable by DCA. The robust least absolute deviation formulation is cast as DC program, with dual depending only on kernel matrix, enabling robust feature extraction in high-dimensional spaces while mitigating outlier sensitivity. Core assumption: ℓ₁ norm's geometry provides robustness and unitary invariance of constraint set ensures kernel-compatibility. Break condition: Structured outliers saturating ℓ₁ assumption may yield unstable subspace.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Difference-of-Convex (DC) Duality & Toland Duality**
- Why needed: This is the mathematical engine enabling decomposition of non-convex PCA problems into convex-concave pairs where strong duality holds
- Quick check: Can you explain why strong duality in Toland duality allows solving the dual instead of primal to find same infimum?

**Concept: Unitary Invariance & Schatten Norms**
- Why needed: Kernelizability of dual relies entirely on primal function being unitarily invariant; understanding Schatten p-norms is required to parse formulations
- Quick check: Why does property F(VXU)=F(X) (unitary invariance) facilitate kernel trick use in dual space?

**Concept: Subgradient Calculus**
- Why needed: Algorithms 1-6 are derived by computing subdifferentials ∂F and ∂G*, making update rules transparent
- Quick check: If function is non-differentiable at point (like spectral norm), how does subgradient generalize gradient concept?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Primal: l, n, p → Dual: m, o, q; Solvers: Proximal Gradient (PG), ZeroFPR, DCA iterations (Algorithms 1-6); Post-processing: Out-of-sample extension logic (Theorem 3.8)

**Critical path:** 1. Select formulation pair based on data shape 2. Run specific solver (e.g., ZeroFPR on formulation n for speed) 3. For Kernel PCA, compute K and run kernel-compatible dual solver (Algorithm 4 or 6)

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. Speed: First-order methods outperform classical Krylov methods at low accuracy (ε=10⁻³) but may lag at high precision (ε=10⁻⁵)
- Primal vs. Dual: Primal scales with feature dimension d, Dual scales with sample count N; Dual formulations (n)-(o) often faster for large matrices
- Robustness vs. Complexity: Robust PCA adds computational overhead but significantly improves contaminated data performance

**Failure signatures:**
- Slow Convergence: Using standard variance maximization (l) with first-order methods converges significantly slower than classical solvers
- Memory Bottleneck: Kernel methods scale as O(N²); kernelized robust PCA on large N without Nyström approximations will fail

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Baseline Comparison: Replicate Table 1 timings for ZeroFPR (n) vs. SVDS on synthetic matrix (e.g., 4000×2000) to validate speed claim for low-precision PCA
2. Robustness Check: Implement Algorithm 5 (Robust PCA) and standard PCA on MNIST with 15% label noise to verify reconstruction error gap in Table 10
3. Kernel Scaling: Implement Algorithm 4 on small dataset to verify equivalence of kernelized dual solution to primal solution via standard eigenvalue decomposition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can specialized optimization algorithms be developed for high-performing dual pairs (n)-(o) to outperform current adaptations of methods designed for formulation (l)? Basis: Section 7 states current algorithms are derived for (l) potentially missing efficiency gains specific to (n)-(o). Evidence: New algorithm specifically designed for (n)-(o) demonstrating faster convergence or higher accuracy than PG and ZeroFPR methods.

**Open Question 2:** What are properties of deep architectures constructed by stacking these novel (kernel) PCA layers? Basis: Section 7 proposes considering deep variants by stacking (kernel) PCA layers. Evidence: Empirical study on trainability and feature extraction quality of deep networks built using proposed DC PCA modules.

**Open Question 3:** What new formulations emerge from incorporating domain-specific structural priors via unitarily invariant functions beyond Schatten p-norms? Basis: Section 7 identifies exploration of other unitarily invariant objectives incorporating domain knowledge as promising. Evidence: Derivation and validation of new dual formulations using distinct unitarily invariant priors tailored to specific data structures.

## Limitations
- Kernelizability mechanism critically depends on unitary invariance, but paper doesn't fully characterize when this breaks down for practical PCA variants
- Equivalence between DCA and simultaneous iteration established for relaxed formulations, but impact of relaxation on convergence rates and accuracy not analyzed
- Experimental validation focuses on low-precision targets (ε=10⁻³), with limited data on high-precision comparisons across diverse matrix spectra

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Kernelizability of DC duals when primal contains unitarily invariant functions (Proposition 3.5); experimental timing comparisons showing first-order methods outperform classical solvers at low precision.

**Medium Confidence:** Equivalence between DCA and simultaneous iteration (Theorem 3.11) for relaxed variance maximization; robustness claims for ℓ₁-based robust PCA (Proposition 4.1).

**Low Confidence:** General scalability claims for kernelized robust PCA without Nyström approximations; out-of-sample extension validity for all DC formulations.

## Next Checks

1. **Relaxation Impact:** Implement and compare exact variance maximization PCA (formulation l) using both DCA and classical simultaneous iteration to quantify effect of spectral norm relaxation on convergence speed and solution quality.

2. **High-Precision Scaling:** Extend timing experiments from Table 1 to target ε=10⁻⁵ and evaluate first-order method performance across matrices with varying spectral gaps (clustered vs. well-separated singular values).

3. **Robustness Boundary:** Systematically vary noise level and structure in robust PCA experiments (Table 10) to identify breaking point where ℓ₁-based robustness degrades to ℓ₂-level performance.
