# MS4UI: A Dataset for Multi-modal Summarization of User Interface Instructional Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12623
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12623
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Text-based video segmentation outperforms vision-based methods on UI instructional videos

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MS4UI, a new dataset for multi-modal summarization of UI instructional videos. The dataset contains 2,413 UI tutorial videos spanning 167 hours, annotated with video segmentation, text summaries, and key frames. Three core tasks are defined: video segmentation, text summarization, and video summarization. Experiments show that state-of-the-art methods struggle on this dataset, with text-based segmentation outperforming vision-based methods, and multimodal approaches showing mixed results. The work highlights the need for specialized models to handle the unique features of UI videos.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three core tasks for UI instructional video summarization: video segmentation (partitioning videos into steps), text summarization (generating concise executable text instructions per step), and video summarization (selecting representative key frames for each step). The dataset contains 2,413 UI tutorial videos from Adobe HelpX and YouTube, with human-verified annotations. The evaluation uses MIOU and F1 scores for segmentation, ROUGE metrics for text summarization, and Recall@k for video summarization. Baselines include text-only, vision-only, and multimodal approaches using standard transformer architectures.

## Key Results
- Text-based segmentation methods outperform vision-based methods (20.53 vs 20.08 MIOU)
- Multimodal approaches show mixed results, improving text summarization but not segmentation
- State-of-the-art methods struggle with detecting fine-grained UI operations in visual data
- Vision modules fail to distinguish similar UI frames and detect key operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Text-based segmentation of UI videos can outperform vision-based methods.
- Mechanism: Verbal descriptions of UI actions contain explicit transition signals (e.g., "next, click..." or "then, drag...") that can be detected by language models to identify step boundaries. This can be more reliable than relying on visual changes, which are often subtle or repetitive in UI contexts.
- Core assumption: The provided video transcriptions are accurate and contain sufficient linguistic markers for step transitions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The abstract notes experiments show "text-based segmentation outperforming vision-based methods."
  - [section] Table 2 (Page 4) shows Cross TextSeg (text-based) achieving 20.53 MIOU, higher than LGSS (20.08) and PySceneDetect (19.21). The text notes, "The text-based method outperforms both the vision-based and multi-modal methods."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals mention "HierSum: A Global and Local Attention Mechanism for Video Summarization" which focuses on instructional videos, implying the broader relevance of advanced attention mechanisms for segmentation, but does not directly contrast text vs. vision performance on UI tasks.
- Break condition: If video transcripts are unavailable, of very poor quality, or if UI actions are predominantly non-verbal, this mechanism's efficacy would be severely diminished.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating multimodal information can improve text summarization quality for UI videos.
- Mechanism: A model that fuses visual and textual features can leverage the appearance of UI elements shown on screen to ground the technical terms used in the transcript. This helps in generating more accurate and executable summaries by associating words with specific visual components.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively align textual concepts with their corresponding visual representations in the UI.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The abstract states "multimodal approaches showing mixed results."
  - [section] Section 4.3 on Text Summarization (Page 4) states: "...multi-modal methods [MLASK, A2Summ] outperform text-only methods on text summarization, which indicates that the vision signals of the UI layouts can benefit the understanding of text instructions." Table 3 shows MLASK achieving the highest ROUGE-1/2/L scores.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors include "NoteIt: A System Converting Instructional Videos to Interactable Notes," which depends on multimodal understanding, suggesting the general utility of this approach in the instructional video domain.
- Break condition: If the visual features are not discriminative or if the multimodal fusion module fails to learn the correct alignments between text and image regions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A primary challenge for current models in UI video summarization is detecting fine-grained, key operations from visual data.
- Mechanism: General-purpose video models are often trained on natural scenes with large, distinct motions. They struggle with UI videos where critical actions (e.g., a single click on a small icon) are visually subtle and occur within a structured, often static, layout. The key frames showing these actions look very similar to non-key frames.
- Core assumption: Standard vision features are insufficient for capturing UI-specific semantic changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The abstract notes that "state-of-the-art methods struggle on this dataset."
  - [section] Section 4.3 on Video Summarization (Page 4) explains poor performance by stating it "might be attributed to the vision module of baseline models struggling to distinguish similar images of the same UI and detect key operations." Table 4 shows low Recall@1 scores (e.g., 10.46 for MLASK).
  - [corpus] Corpus analysis does not offer a direct counter-claim for this specific UI fine-grained detection issue. This gap is implied by the dataset's novelty.
- Break condition: A model that successfully incorporates UI-specific features (e.g., from a UI element detector) would overcome this limitation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multimodal Fusion**
  - Why needed here: This is the core technique for combining textual and visual information. Without it, a model can't leverage the visual grounding to improve text summaries or select key frames. You must understand early vs. late fusion, and cross-attention mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a cross-attention module allows a text embedding to query a sequence of image embeddings?

- Concept: **Video Temporal Segmentation**
  - Why needed here: The first defined core task is to segment a long video into distinct, step-based clips. This is the prerequisite for any step-by-step summarization. Understanding boundary detection is essential.
  - Quick check question: How would you formulate the problem of video segmentation as a supervised classification task on a sequence of video frames or text sentences?

- Concept: **ROUGE Metrics for Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L to evaluate text summarization. You must understand what these metrics measure (n-gram overlap) and their limitations (they don't capture semantic correctness or executability).
  - Quick check question: A generated summary is "Click the button." The ground truth is "Press the OK button." Would ROUGE-1 likely be high or low, and what does that tell you about the metric's limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Video/Audio Ingest -> Feature Encoders -> Segmentation Module -> Multimodal Fusion Summarizer -> Output Heads

- Critical path: The system must first correctly segment the video. A segmentation error will cascade, causing subsequent summarization to be incorrect. The text summary's quality is highly dependent on the quality of the upstream segmentation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Text-only vs. Multimodal for Segmentation: Text is currently more reliable but fails without a transcript. Vision is noisier but always available. A robust system might use a weighted or cascaded approach.
  - Pre-trained vs. Specialized Vision Features: Using off-the-shelf features is cheap but less effective for UIs. Fine-tuning or using UI-specific pre-training would be more performant but requires additional data and compute.
  - Model Complexity vs. Inference Speed: A sophisticated multimodal model with a large LLM decoder provides high-quality summaries but may be too slow for real-time processing.

- Failure signatures:
  1. Over-segmentation: A generated summary for one step is split across multiple predicted segments. Check: Look for F1@0.5 scores in segmentation.
  2. Hallucination: The text summary contains actions or UI elements not mentioned in the transcript or shown in the video. Check: Low ROUGE scores; manual inspection.
  3. Missed Key Frame: The selected frame is from a static or irrelevant part of the UI, missing the actual click or action. Check: Low Recall@k scores for video summarization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Baseline Segmentation: Run a text-based segmentation model (e.g., Cross TextSeg) on the MS4UI dataset's transcripts to establish a performance baseline and confirm the paper's finding that text outperforms vision for this task.
  2. Ablate Multimodal Fusion in Summarization: Train a text-only summarization model (e.g., BART) and a multimodal model (e.g., MLASK) on the MS4UI dataset. Compare their ROUGE scores to confirm the hypothesis that visual grounding aids text summarization.
  3. Analyze Vision Failure Modes: Train a vision-only video summarization model (e.g., VSumm) and qualitatively analyze its errors on the MS4UI dataset. Specifically, identify cases where it fails to distinguish between a key operation and a similar-looking non-key frame.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Question: What specific architectural modifications are required for models to effectively process the structured, symbolic visual elements unique to UI videos?
- Question: How does the restriction of the dataset to Adobe Creative Cloud products affect the cross-domain generalizability of trained summarization models?
- Question: Why does the inclusion of visual modality improve text summarization performance but degrade video segmentation accuracy compared to text-only methods?

## Limitations
- Dataset is limited to Adobe Creative Cloud applications, restricting generalizability
- Performance depends heavily on availability and quality of video transcripts
- ROUGE metrics don't capture semantic correctness or executability of UI instructions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The dataset creation process, task definitions, and evaluation metrics are clearly specified and reproducible. The finding that text-based segmentation outperforms vision-based methods on this dataset is well-supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that multimodal approaches show mixed results is supported by the data, but the reasons for this variability are not fully explored.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that state-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained UI visual understanding is primarily based on low Recall@k scores without qualitative analysis of specific failure cases.

## Next Checks

1. Test the best-performing models (Cross TextSeg for segmentation, MLASK for summarization) on UI videos from different domains (e.g., mobile app tutorials, web interface guides) to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct an ablation study on the multimodal models (MLASK, A2Summ) to isolate the contribution of visual features versus fusion mechanisms. Test models with UI-specific visual encoders to determine if specialized vision features improve performance.

3. Perform a detailed qualitative analysis of the vision-only video summarization model's errors. Categorize failure types and correlate them with specific UI interaction patterns to better understand the limitations of current visual features for UI understanding.
