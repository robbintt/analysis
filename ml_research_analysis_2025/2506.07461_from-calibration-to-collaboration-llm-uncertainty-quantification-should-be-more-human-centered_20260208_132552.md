# From Calibration to Collaboration: LLM Uncertainty Quantification Should Be More Human-Centered

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.07461
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07461
- **Reference count:** 33
- **Primary result:** Current LLM UQ evaluation practices are insufficient for real-world users, requiring more human-centered approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines evaluation practices of Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods, identifying significant gaps between current benchmarks and real-world user needs. The authors analyze 40 LLM UQ methods and find that most evaluations rely on low-ecological-validity benchmarks like multiple-choice question answering, focus only on epistemic uncertainty while ignoring aleatoric and distributional uncertainty, and optimize for metrics that may not correlate with actual user utility. The paper advocates for shifting evaluation to more diverse, real-world relevant benchmarks, incorporating tasks with inherent aleatoric uncertainty, testing under distribution shift, and conducting human studies to understand how uncertainty presentation affects user reliance and decision-making.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed 40 LLM UQ methods sourced from two existing surveys (Shorinwa et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024), focusing on 22 benchmarks used by at least two methods. The authors manually annotated each paper using a systematic schema covering UQ type, datasets, distribution shift testing, supervised status, evaluation metrics, and human uplift study presence. They categorized benchmarks by task type and applied four ecological validity criteria (C1-C4) to assess real-world relevance. The analysis tracked the presence of aleatoric uncertainty and distribution shift testing across methods, distinguishing between unsupervised (entropy/sampling) and supervised (calibration layers) approaches.

## Key Results
- 68.2% of evaluations use Multiple Choice QA benchmarks, which are unrepresentative of real user queries
- Only 1 of 22 analyzed benchmarks contains intentional aleatoric uncertainty
- Nearly half of supervised UQ methods aren't tested for distribution shift robustness
- Most evaluations focus exclusively on epistemic uncertainty, ignoring aleatoric and distributional uncertainty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Shifting evaluation to benchmarks with high ecological validity improves transferability to real-world decision-making.
- **Mechanism:** Current MCQA benchmarks with single gold labels create a "reality gap" between evaluation and actual user queries. Moving to tasks satisfying C1-C4 criteria aligns feedback signals with real user distributions.
- **Core assumption:** Real-world benchmarks like Natural Questions are valid proxies for true user intent distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract identifies low ecological validity as primary barrier; Section 3.2 details C1-C4 criteria.
- **Break condition:** If real-world benchmarks become over-fitted or high-stakes scenarios behave fundamentally differently than data collection environments.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Explicitly accounting for aleatoric uncertainty prevents conflation of ambiguity with ignorance.
- **Mechanism:** Single-label benchmarks force models to treat all uncertainty as epistemic. Datasets with label variation force UQ methods to output calibrated probabilities over multiple valid outcomes.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can distinguish between "I don't know" (epistemic) and "data is ambiguous" (aleatoric), and users can interpret this distinction.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract notes focus on only epistemic uncertainty; Section 4.1 cites FolkTexts showing LLM struggles under aleatoric uncertainty.
- **Break condition:** If users interpret high aleatoric uncertainty as model failure rather than legitimate ambiguity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Optimizing for human-aligned calibration improves human-AI team performance more reliably than ECE alone.
- **Mechanism:** ECE measures statistical alignment but ignores decision psychology. Human-aligned calibration adjusts uncertainty presentation to complement human priors.
- **Core assumption:** Generalizable mapping exists between uncertainty presentation and human reliance behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract argues for metrics correlating with human-AI team performance; Section 5.1 cites studies showing calibration doesn't always equal uplift.
- **Break condition:** If cognitive load of interpreting human-aligned uncertainty exceeds information benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Ecological Validity**
  - **Why needed here:** Distinguishes between "beating the benchmark" and "solving the user's problem." 68.2% of current evaluations are MCQA, misrepresenting real LLM use.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the evaluation dataset reflect the ambiguity and input format of a user actually asking an LLM for help, or is it a synthetic construct?

- **Concept:** **Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for diagnosing model failure. Epistemic uncertainty (reducible) vs. aleatoric uncertainty (irreducible ambiguity) requires different handling.
  - **Quick check question:** If two identical inputs have different valid labels, is the model's uncertainty a bug or a feature?

- **Concept:** **Human-Aligned Calibration**
  - **Why needed here:** Moves beyond proxy metrics. ECE is a proxy for trust; human uplift (better decisions) is the actual goal. These are not perfectly correlated.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model is perfectly calibrated (ECE=0) but users ignore confidence signals because they're numerically opaque, is the UQ method successful?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Source -> Uncertainty Engine -> Uncertainty Type Filter -> Presentation Layer -> Evaluation Sink
- **Critical path:** Benchmark Selection → Uncertainty Type Definition → Utility Metric. If benchmark lacks aleatoric noise, UQ method cannot learn to express it, and ECE optimization won't translate to user value.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Stability vs. Realism: Stable MCQA evaluation (low variance) vs. noisy, high-ecological-validity tasks (high variance, user-centric)
  - Metric Speed vs. Value: Calculating ECE is cheap; running human uplift studies is slow but necessary for true utility verification
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "TriviaQA Trap": High ECE scores but low user trust because users don't ask trivia questions
  - Aleatoric Blindness: Model oscillates between high-confidence wrong answers for ambiguous queries instead of expressing uncertainty
  - Metric Divergence: Improving Brier score causes human-AI team performance to drop
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Distribution Shift Audit: Test supervised UQ method degradation across 3 domains not in calibration set
  2. Aleatoric Injection: Evaluate semantic entropy method on synthetic dataset with controlled label noise (0% to 50%)
  3. Metric Correlation Study: Run small user study (n=20) comparing "Numeric Confidence" vs. "Linguistic Hedging" on ambiguous questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do standard calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score) correlate positively with human-AI team performance on decision-making tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** Recommendation R7 explicitly calls for development of studies to understand relationship between these metrics and downstream utility.
- **Why unresolved:** Current research focuses on "hill-climbing" these metrics without verifying if they lead to better human outcomes; theory suggests calibration may not be sufficient for human uplift.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies demonstrating significant correlation between low calibration error and improved human decision accuracy or efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How do different uncertainty presentation schemes impact user reliance and trust?
- **Basis in paper:** Recommendation R8 notes uncertainty presentation schemes to LLM users on language tasks is understudied.
- **Why unresolved:** LLMs can express uncertainty through language (e.g., anthropomorphic cues), but unknown which method best fosters appropriate reliance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative human-subject studies measuring reliance behavior and task success rates across different uncertainty presentation formats.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do state-of-the-art LLM UQ methods perform on benchmarks containing intentional aleatoric uncertainty?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4.1 and Recommendation R4 note evaluation on aleatoric uncertainty is largely missing, with only 1 of 22 benchmarks containing it.
- **Why unresolved:** Most benchmarks use single gold-label answers (epistemic), leaving ability to handle irreducible data uncertainty untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of existing methods on datasets like FolkTexts or ChaosNLI which feature label variation.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can findings from classical UQ regarding human-aligned calibration be transferred to LLM-assisted decision making?
- **Basis in paper:** Recommendation R6 suggests adapting findings from classical UQ, noting LLM responses differ from classical predictive models.
- **Why unresolved:** Unclear if theoretical conditions for human uplift in classical settings hold true when model output is generative text.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Studies replicating classical human-alignment experiments within LLM context to see if human-aligned calibration outperforms standard calibration.

## Limitations

- Potential incompleteness of method corpus from two existing surveys, possibly missing newer or non-survey published methods
- Manual annotation process depends on paper-reported details without experimental verification
- Ecological validity criteria application requires subjective judgment, particularly for "real-world connection" and "meaningful challenge"
- Paper doesn't empirically validate whether proposed human-centered metrics actually improve user outcomes

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Characterization of current evaluation practices as predominantly MCQA with single labels (epistemic focus) is well-supported by 40-method analysis
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that supervised methods lack distribution shift testing is based on reported absence in papers, may reflect publication bias
- **Medium confidence:** Recommendation for aleatoric uncertainty evaluation assumes LLMs can meaningfully distinguish epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, which remains open question

## Next Checks

1. **Expand Method Coverage:** Systematically search for LLM UQ methods published after cited surveys and in non-survey venues to assess if evaluation trends have shifted
2. **Ecological Validity Scoring Validation:** Have multiple annotators independently apply C1-C4 criteria to benchmark subset and measure inter-rater reliability
3. **Human Study on Aleatoric Expression:** Conduct controlled experiment where users interact with LLM on ambiguous queries to measure if explicit aleatoric uncertainty expression improves decision-making vs. epistemic-only signals
