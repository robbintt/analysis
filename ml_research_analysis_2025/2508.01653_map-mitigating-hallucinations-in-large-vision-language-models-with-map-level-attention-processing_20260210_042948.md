# MAP: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Map-Level Attention Processing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01653
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01653
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** Training-free decoding method MAP achieves 1529.34 total score on LLaVA-1.5 for MME benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MAP (Map-Level Attention Processing), a training-free decoding method designed to mitigate hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The key insight is that factual information is widely distributed across hidden states, beyond traditional inter- or intra-layer regions. MAP treats the entire set of hidden states as a 2D semantic map and employs Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to refine token representations by aggregating factual signals from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. The method also includes a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism to enhance final predictions.

Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across various LVLMs, with MAP achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination benchmarks including POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench. The approach shows particular effectiveness in reducing visual-linguistic hallucinations while improving multimodal reasoning capabilities without requiring additional training.

## Method Summary
MAP addresses LVLM hallucinations by leveraging the distributed nature of factual information across hidden states. The method constructs a 2D semantic map from all hidden states and applies Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to capture both inter-layer and intra-layer contextual relationships. This attention mechanism refines token representations by aggregating factual signals from the entire hidden state space. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion component combines different levels of prediction information to produce enhanced final outputs. The approach is training-free and operates during the decoding phase, making it applicable to existing pre-trained LVLMs without modification to their architecture or training procedure.

## Key Results
- MAP achieves 1529.34 total score on LLaVA-1.5 for MME benchmark, outperforming baseline methods
- Consistent improvements across multiple LVLMs: 1466.36 on mPLUG-Owl2 and 1302.72 on InstructBLIP for MME benchmark
- Effective reduction in hallucinations demonstrated on POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks
- Method shows effectiveness in improving multimodal reasoning capabilities without requiring additional training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAP works by recognizing that factual information in LVLMs is not confined to specific layers or regions of the model's hidden states, but is instead distributed throughout the entire representation space. By treating all hidden states as a 2D semantic map, MAP can capture long-range dependencies and cross-layer interactions that traditional attention mechanisms might miss. The Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention specifically enables the model to aggregate information both vertically (across layers) and horizontally (within layers), creating a more comprehensive representation of factual content. The Global-Local Logit Fusion then combines these refined representations at different scales to produce more accurate final predictions, effectively filtering out hallucinatory content while preserving and enhancing factual information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention:** A variant of attention mechanism that captures both inter-layer and intra-layer relationships; needed to aggregate distributed factual information across the entire hidden state space; quick check: verify that criss-cross patterns capture both vertical and horizontal dependencies
- **2D Semantic Map Construction:** Treating hidden states as a spatial map rather than sequential layers; needed to enable spatial reasoning over distributed information; quick check: confirm map dimensions preserve all relevant information from hidden states
- **Global-Local Logit Fusion:** Combining predictions at different scales or levels; needed to integrate refined representations from criss-cross attention into final output; quick check: ensure fusion weights are properly calibrated
- **Training-free Decoding Methods:** Post-training inference-time processing techniques; needed to apply hallucination mitigation without retraining; quick check: verify method compatibility with different LVLM architectures
- **Hallucination Detection in Multimodal Models:** Identifying factual vs hallucinatory content in vision-language outputs; needed to understand what MAP is correcting; quick check: establish baseline hallucination rates for evaluation
- **Cross-modal Information Integration:** Combining visual and linguistic representations effectively; needed for multimodal reasoning improvements; quick check: validate that visual and language modalities are properly aligned

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Hidden States -> 2D Semantic Map Construction -> Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention -> Refined Representations -> Global-Local Logit Fusion -> Final Predictions

**Critical Path:** The core processing pipeline involves converting hidden states to a 2D semantic map, applying criss-cross attention to refine representations, and using global-local fusion to produce final outputs. The critical computational path is the criss-cross attention operation, which must efficiently process the full hidden state space.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades increased inference-time computation for improved accuracy without requiring retraining. This makes it broadly applicable but potentially introduces latency. The 2D semantic map approach requires careful memory management, especially for models with large hidden state spaces. The global-local fusion adds complexity but provides better integration of refined representations.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failure modes include: (1) memory overflow when processing very large models due to 2D map construction, (2) loss of temporal/sequential information when converting to spatial representation, (3) suboptimal fusion weights leading to degraded performance, and (4) computational overhead that may not justify accuracy gains for time-sensitive applications.

**Three First Experiments:** 
1. Baseline comparison showing hallucination rates on POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench without MAP
2. Ablation study comparing performance with only criss-cross attention vs. only global-local fusion vs. full MAP
3. Memory and latency profiling across different LVLM sizes to quantify computational overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Method focuses exclusively on vision-language hallucinations without addressing pure text-based hallucinations, limiting generalizability
- Relies on post-training inference-time processing, potentially introducing computational overhead not thoroughly quantified
- Lacks ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (criss-cross attention vs global-local logit fusion)
- Evaluation primarily uses MME benchmark with limited analysis of failure cases or qualitative examples

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|

| Consistent improvements across various LVLMs | Medium |
| Effectiveness in reducing hallucinations | Medium |
| Scalability assessment and computational costs | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of layer-wise criss-cross attention and global-local logit fusion components
2. Test MAP on pure text-based hallucination benchmarks to assess cross-modal generalization
3. Measure inference-time latency and computational overhead compared to baseline decoding strategies across different hardware configurations
