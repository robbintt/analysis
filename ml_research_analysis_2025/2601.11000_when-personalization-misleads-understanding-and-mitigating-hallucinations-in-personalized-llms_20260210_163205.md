# When Personalization Misleads: Understanding and Mitigating Hallucinations in Personalized LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11000
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Personalization-induced hallucinations in LLMs can be substantially reduced while preserving personalized performance using the FPPS framework

## Executive Summary
This work identifies personalization-induced hallucinations in personalized large language models, where user history causes models to generate factually incorrect answers aligned with user preferences rather than objective truth. The problem stems from representational entanglement between personalization and factual knowledge subspaces. To address this, the authors propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time framework that detects and mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving beneficial personalized behavior. FPPS integrates three components: a Representation Shift Locator to identify vulnerable layers, a Factuality Entanglement Prober to assess factual-personalization interference, and an Adaptive Knowledge Steering Module to selectively restore factuality.

## Method Summary
The Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS) framework addresses personalization-induced hallucinations through an inference-time intervention system. The approach consists of three main components working together: the Representation Shift Locator identifies which layers are most affected by personalization during inference; the Factuality Entanglement Prober quantifies the degree of interference between factual knowledge and personalization signals; and the Adaptive Knowledge Steering Module selectively applies steering to restore factual accuracy where needed. The framework operates as a lightweight overlay during inference, making it compatible with various personalization methods and LLM backbones. The mixed steering variant (FPPS-M) combines different steering strategies to achieve optimal balance between factuality and personalization preservation.

## Key Results
- FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy with F-score increases of 50%+ across multiple benchmarks
- The framework maintains personalized performance while correcting factual distortions
- FPPS-M (mixed steering variant) consistently delivers the best overall balance between factuality and personalization
- The approach is effective across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by detecting and correcting representational entanglement between factual knowledge and personalization signals. During personalization, user history can shift the model's internal representations in ways that prioritize personalized preferences over factual accuracy. FPPS identifies these shifts through layer-level analysis, measures the interference between factual and personalized representations, and applies targeted steering to restore factual integrity without disrupting beneficial personalization effects. This selective intervention preserves the useful aspects of personalization while preventing the model from generating hallucinated content that aligns with user preferences but contradicts objective facts.

## Foundational Learning

**Representational entanglement**: The phenomenon where different types of information (factual knowledge vs. personalization) become intertwined in shared model subspaces, making it difficult to separate their influences during inference. *Why needed*: Understanding this entanglement is crucial for developing targeted interventions that can preserve personalization benefits while correcting factual distortions.

**Inference-time steering**: Techniques that modify model behavior during generation rather than through retraining, allowing for lightweight interventions that preserve the base model's capabilities. *Quick check*: Verify that steering modifications don't degrade base model performance on non-personalized tasks.

**Layer-wise representation analysis**: Examining how personalization affects model representations at different depth levels to identify where factual-personalization interference is most severe. *Quick check*: Confirm that identified vulnerable layers correlate with observed hallucination patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Representation Shift Locator -> Factuality Entanglement Prober -> Adaptive Knowledge Steering Module

**Critical path**: The framework operates during inference, with the Representation Shift Locator identifying vulnerable layers, followed by the Factuality Entanglement Prober measuring interference levels, and finally the Adaptive Knowledge Steering Module applying targeted corrections to restore factual accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes lightweight inference-time intervention over comprehensive retraining, sacrificing some potential performance gains for practical deployability and compatibility with existing personalization methods.

**Failure signatures**: When FPPS fails, it may either overcorrect (removing beneficial personalization) or undercorrect (failing to address severe factual distortions), with the optimal balance varying by personalization context.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate factual accuracy and personalization performance without FPPS intervention
2. Layer ablation: Test FPPS performance with different vulnerable layer selections to identify optimal targeting strategy
3. Steering variant comparison: Compare FPPS-M against single-strategy variants to validate the mixed approach benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework focuses primarily on textual personalization signals and may not fully address multimodal personalization scenarios
- Computational overhead of FPPS components, particularly the factuality entanglement probing, is not thoroughly characterized
- Long-term stability and generalization across diverse personalization contexts needs further validation
- Real-world deployment challenges with complex, nuanced personalization scenarios may differ from benchmark results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The identification of personalization-induced hallucinations as a distinct problem, and the general effectiveness of FPPS in improving factual accuracy while preserving personalization
- **Medium confidence**: The specific layer identification methodology and the relative performance differences between FPPS variants across all test conditions
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that FPPS provides a general solution applicable across different personalization methods, though this is reasonably supported by the experimental design

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing individual FPPS components to quantify their specific contributions to overall performance improvements
2. Test FPPS with multimodal personalization inputs (images, audio, structured data) to evaluate cross-modal robustness
3. Perform long-term stability analysis measuring FPPS performance degradation over extended use with evolving user histories
