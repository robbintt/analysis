# Multidimensional Uncertainty Quantification via Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22380
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22380
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: VecUQ-OT unifies complementary uncertainty measures into a vector-based framework using optimal transport, improving OOD detection, misclassification detection, selective prediction, and selective generation across synthetic, image, and text domains.

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces VecUQ-OT, a framework for multidimensional uncertainty quantification that represents predictive uncertainty as a vector of complementary measures and orders these vectors using optimal transport-based ranks. This approach addresses the limitation of single-scalar uncertainty measures, which often excel at only one task despite targeting similar uncertainty types. VecUQ-OT uses entropy-regularized optimal transport to map calibration uncertainty vectors to a reference distribution and defines uncertainty as the distance to the reference center. The method generalizes to unseen inputs without retraining and supports flexible, non-additive fusion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components.

## Method Summary
VecUQ-OT is a framework that represents predictive uncertainty as a vector of complementary measures and orders these vectors using optimal transport-based ranks. The method uses entropy-regularized optimal transport to map calibration uncertainty vectors to a reference distribution, defining uncertainty as the distance to the reference center. It generalizes to unseen inputs without retraining and supports flexible, non-additive fusion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components.

## Key Results
- On image datasets, VecUQ-OT achieves ROC-AUC scores of 0.917 for CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100 OOD detection and 0.997 for selective prediction on CIFAR10
- For text generation, PRR scores reach 0.698 on the LLaMA-8B model
- Across synthetic, image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows robust performance on downstream tasks such as OOD detection, misclassification detection, selective prediction, and selective generation, outperforming or matching individual measures even when some components fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VecUQ-OT works by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple uncertainty measures through vector representation and optimal transport-based ranking. The framework captures different aspects of uncertainty (aleatoric vs epistemic, model vs data uncertainty) in a unified vector space, then uses optimal transport to define a principled ordering that accounts for the multidimensional nature of uncertainty. The entropy regularization in the optimal transport step provides robustness and computational efficiency, while the reference distribution approach allows for generalization to unseen inputs without retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal Transport (OT): A mathematical framework for comparing probability distributions; needed for defining meaningful distances between multidimensional uncertainty vectors; quick check: verify that the OT distance satisfies metric properties
- Entropy Regularization: A technique to smooth and approximate optimal transport; needed for computational tractability and robustness; quick check: observe convergence behavior with varying regularization strength
- Aleatoric vs Epistemic Uncertainty: Distinction between inherent data variability and model uncertainty; needed for comprehensive uncertainty characterization; quick check: ensure measures capture both types appropriately
- Calibration Uncertainty: Measures of how well predicted probabilities match empirical frequencies; needed for reliable uncertainty quantification; quick check: verify calibration on held-out validation data
- Selective Prediction: The ability to abstain from predictions when uncertainty is high; needed for safety-critical applications; quick check: measure coverage-accuracy trade-offs

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Uncertainty Measures -> Vector Aggregation -> Entropy-Regularized OT -> Reference Distribution Mapping -> Uncertainty Score

Critical path: The core workflow involves computing multiple uncertainty measures, aggregating them into a vector, computing the entropy-regularized optimal transport distance to a reference distribution, and using this distance as the final uncertainty score.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades model simplicity for representational power by using multiple uncertainty measures instead of a single scalar. The entropy regularization balances computational efficiency with approximation accuracy. The reference distribution approach enables generalization but may limit expressiveness for highly specific uncertainty patterns.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may occur when the reference distribution poorly represents the true uncertainty landscape, when uncertainty measures are highly correlated (reducing complementarity), or when the entropy regularization is poorly tuned. The method may also struggle with highly imbalanced datasets or when individual uncertainty measures are fundamentally flawed.

First experiments:
1. Apply VecUQ-OT to a simple synthetic dataset where the true uncertainty pattern is known, comparing against individual uncertainty measures
2. Test the framework on a standard image classification benchmark (e.g., CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100) to validate OOD detection performance
3. Evaluate VecUQ-OT on a text generation task using a pre-trained language model to assess selective generation capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The assumption that a single reference distribution can effectively represent the center of calibration uncertainty across diverse datasets and models may not hold for highly heterogeneous or domain-specific scenarios
- Performance relies on entropy regularization in optimal transport, but sensitivity to this hyperparameter is not extensively explored
- While the framework generalizes to unseen inputs without retraining, this claim requires validation across a broader range of model architectures and data distributions

## Confidence
High: VecUQ-OT's ability to unify complementary uncertainty measures and improve downstream task performance is supported by extensive experiments across synthetic, image, and text domains.
Medium: The method's generalization to highly diverse or out-of-distribution scenarios, as the current validation covers standard benchmarks but may not fully capture edge cases.
Medium: The claim about robustness when individual components fail, as this depends on the specific failure modes and dataset characteristics.

## Next Checks
1. Test VecUQ-OT on a broader set of out-of-distribution datasets with varying domain shifts to assess robustness beyond standard benchmarks
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the entropy regularization parameter to determine optimal settings across different model architectures and uncertainty types
3. Apply VecUQ-OT to a real-world, high-stakes application (e.g., medical diagnosis or autonomous driving) to evaluate performance in safety-critical contexts with domain-specific uncertainty patterns
