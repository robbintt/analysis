# Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-agent AI system designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts

## Executive Summary
Anubuddhi is a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts, eliminating the need for specialized programming knowledge. The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8-9/10 across 13 diverse experiments spanning fundamental optics, quantum information protocols, and advanced technologies. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system successfully generates complete experimental architectures including component selection, spatial positioning, and beam routing from single-line prompts like "Design a Bell state generator."

## Method Summary
The system implements a three-layer cognitive architecture: LLM-based intent routing to distinguish design commands from conversational queries, knowledge-augmented generation with semantic retrieval from a three-tier toolbox (primitives, learned composites, custom components), and dual-mode validation using QuTiP for constrained quantum optics and FreeSim for flexible simulations. A six-stage convergent refinement pipeline iterates up to three times, applying targeted fixes rather than complete regeneration to improve alignment scores. Procedural learning saves validated designs as reusable building blocks through semantic similarity search using ONNX MiniLM-L6-V2 embeddings and ChromaDB.

## Key Results
- Design-simulation alignment scores of 8-9/10 across 13 diverse quantum optics experiments
- Free-form simulation (FreeSim) outperformed constrained QuTiP framework for 11/13 experiments
- Natural language prompts like "Design a Bell state generator" successfully generate complete experimental architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical intent routing preserves conversational context while enabling design modifications. LLM-based classifier distinguishes CHAT intent (questions, explanations) from DESIGN intent (create, modify commands), with keyword-based fallback for robustness. This prevents accidental design destruction during exploratory discussion.

### Mechanism 2
Three-tier knowledge hierarchy with semantic retrieval enables procedural learning from validated designs. Primitives (50+ immutable components), learned composites (user-approved assemblies saved with complete specifications), and custom components (specialized equipment) are accessed via ONNX MiniLM-L6-V2 embeddings + ChromaDB similarity search.

### Mechanism 3
Six-stage convergent refinement pipeline improves simulation-to-design alignment through targeted, not regenerative, fixes. The process iterates up to 3 times, reverting to best version if quality degrades, and includes physics classification, guided code generation, pre-execution review, isolated execution, alignment check, and targeted refinement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fock state formalism vs. continuous-variable representations**: Why needed here: QuTiP's constrained mode uses Fock states; FreeSim can use wavepackets, quadrature operators, or Lindblad equations. Knowing when each applies determines simulation validity.
  - Quick check question: Can a Fock state representation model Hong-Ou-Mandel temporal overlap? (Answer: No—requires wavepacket propagation with temporal structure.)

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with embedding similarity**: Why needed here: The learned composites library grows through use; understanding cosine similarity thresholds (80% match vs. partial) determines whether designs reuse or regenerate.
  - Quick check question: What happens if a "quantum teleportation" query retrieves "classical teleportation" designs with high similarity? (Answer: Wrong physics precedent enters generation context.)

- **Design-simulation alignment vs. quantitative accuracy**: Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes structural correctness (alignment 8-9/10) from numerical prediction reliability (may have 10⁴-10⁶ parameter errors).
  - Quick check question: If a Bell state generator simulation has 9/10 alignment but predicts 10¹⁰ pairs/s (vs. realistic 10⁴-10⁶), is the design validated? (Answer: Architecture validated, parameters require expert review.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User prompt → Intent classification → Semantic retrieval (top-5 composites) → LLM generation → Pre-execution review → Isolated execution → Alignment scoring → (if <6/10) Targeted refinement (max 3 cycles) → User approval → Save to learned_composites.json

- **Critical path**: User prompt routes through intent classifier to design agent, which retrieves semantic context, generates simulation code, validates through 6-stage pipeline, and saves approved designs to vector database for reuse.

- **Design tradeoffs**: FreeSim vs. QuTiP: FreeSim outperformed 11/13 experiments but has more error modes; QuTiP is type-safe but cannot model temporal/atomic physics. Regeneration vs. targeted refinement: Regeneration loses working code; refinement preserves but requires accurate error diagnosis. Accessibility vs. quantitative accuracy: Natural language interface lowers barriers but cannot guarantee numerical correctness without simulation-in-the-loop validation.

- **Failure signatures**: Alignment 9/10 with unphysical parameters (e.g., EIT optical depth 0.00035 vs. required 10-100) → Parameter formula error, not physics error. Non-zero visibility in which-path measurements (should be ~0) → Probability distribution formalism error. CHSH correlations identical across different measurement settings → Correlation function implementation broken. Convergence required 3 iterations but alignment still <6/10 → Multi-physics domain may exceed current capability.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference — Start here; simplest two-photon quantum effect, clear success criteria (visibility >0.5, dip at zero delay), 2-iteration convergence, alignment 9/10. 2. Mach-Zehnder interferometer — Classical baseline; validates complementary detection, single-iteration convergence, exposes loss modeling issues if visibility claims are unphysical. 3. Bell state generator via SPDC — Tests entanglement primitives; QuTiP performs well here, 7/10 quality, validates polarization formalism before attempting multi-photon protocols.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can integrating physical databases (e.g., NIST atomic data) into a "simulation-in-the-loop" feedback cycle eliminate the quantitative parameter errors that currently require expert review? This addresses the current limitation where alignment scores validate physics architecture but miss subtle quantitative errors like atomic densities off by 10⁶.

### Open Question 2
How can the architecture be improved to reliably handle multi-scale physics problems (e.g., combining atomic coherence with macroscopic propagation) that currently cause convergence failures? This tackles the ~20% of experiments requiring all three iterations, particularly multi-physics domains like EIT and frequency conversion.

### Open Question 3
Does the three-layer cognitive architecture generalize effectively to adjacent domains like atomic physics or quantum computing without requiring fundamental structural redesign? This explores whether intent routing, component toolbox structure, and validation logic are robust enough for constraints of other physical domains.

## Limitations

- Quantitative accuracy remains uncertain despite high alignment scores; numerical predictions may have 10⁴-10⁶ parameter errors
- FreeSim's flexibility comes at the cost of 3× more error modes compared to QuTiP's constrained framework
- Long-term scalability of learned composites library under diverse quantum optics applications is unproven

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (8-10/10)**: Hierarchical intent routing mechanism reliably preserves conversational context; three-tier knowledge hierarchy demonstrates procedural learning; six-stage convergent refinement consistently improves alignment
- **Medium Confidence (5-7/10)**: Quantitative accuracy of simulation outputs remains uncertain despite high alignment scores; 8-9/10 alignment metric may systematically overrate structurally correct but numerically invalid designs
- **Low Confidence (1-4/10)**: Long-term scalability of learned composites library; performance on truly novel experiments outside 13-test corpus; generalization across different LLM backends

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative Validation Benchmark**: Select 5 experiments with well-established numerical predictions and measure absolute parameter errors against literature values. Document cases where alignment 9/10 coincides with >50% quantitative error.

2. **Cross-Modal Extraction Stress Test**: Evaluate the system's ability to extract and utilize multi-modal data from academic papers for complex multi-physics experiments. Test whether embedding similarity successfully retrieves relevant composites across different experimental contexts.

3. **Generalization to Novel Physics**: Design a new quantum optics experiment outside the current 13-experiment scope and assess whether semantic retrieval can bridge knowledge gaps or requires complete regeneration from primitives.
