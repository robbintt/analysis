# Beyond Consensus: Perspectivist Modeling and Evaluation of Annotator Disagreement in NLP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09065
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Survey provides taxonomy of annotator disagreement sources and synthesizes modeling approaches using prediction targets and pooling structures

## Executive Summary
This survey synthesizes the emerging perspectivist approach to modeling annotator disagreement in NLP, moving beyond treating disagreement as noise to modeling it as structured variation reflecting different interpretations and perspectives. The authors provide a unified taxonomy of disagreement sources—data, task, and annotator factors—and organize modeling approaches using a common framework based on prediction targets and pooling structures. The work traces NLP's shift from consensus-based methods to perspectivist modeling, highlighting methods from latent truth inference to embedding-based models that predict label distributions. The survey also reviews evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on annotator disagreement modeling through three core elements: prediction targets (consensus vs. distribution), pooling structures (no pooling, partial pooling, complete pooling), and disagreement sources (data, task, annotator factors). The authors organize modeling approaches into three families: latent truth models that recover a hidden ground truth, task-based models that treat each annotator as a separate task, and embedding-based models that represent annotators in a shared latent space. The survey provides a unified framework for understanding how these approaches differ and what tradeoffs they entail, drawing connections across papers that have previously been treated separately.

## Key Results
- Annotator disagreement can be modeled as structured signal rather than noise, enabling capture of valid diverse perspectives
- Embedding-based architectures with partial pooling enable scalable modeling of annotator behavior and generalization to unseen annotators
- Distributional modeling approaches that predict label distributions are emerging as a research standard, explicitly training models to predict "how many people think X"

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Treating annotator disagreement as structured signal rather than statistical noise allows models to capture valid, diverse perspectives that majority voting would otherwise erase.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of aggregating labels into a single "ground truth" via majority vote (which assumes a single correct answer), the model preserves the variance in annotations. It learns to predict the variation itself—either by modeling individual annotators or the full label distribution—based on the premise that disagreement arises from systematic factors (e.g., demographics, ambiguity) rather than random error.
- **Core assumption:** Disagreement is driven by valid differences in interpretation (subjectivity/ambiguity) and not solely by low-quality annotator effort; a single gold standard does not exist for the task.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "Recent work increasingly models it [disagreement] as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective."
  - [Section 1] "Majority aggregation can also obscure minoritized perspectives, leading to biased models... This 'single ground truth' assumption has been increasingly challenged."
- **Break condition:** If the task is strictly objective (e.g., POS tagging on unambiguous text) and disagreement is purely due to spam or error, modeling disagreement as signal may introduce noise and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Embedding-based architectures enable scalable modeling of annotator behavior by mapping annotators to a latent space, allowing the model to generalize to unseen annotators and sparse labels.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns a shared content encoder $h_i = f(x_i)$ and an annotator encoder $e_j = g(a_j)$. The prediction is parameterized as the interaction between these embeddings $p(y_{ij} | h_i, e_j)$. This implements "partial pooling," where annotators are treated as samples from a population distribution, allowing the model to share statistical strength across annotators rather than fitting independent models for each.
- **Core assumption:** Annotators exhibit regularities in behavior that can be captured in a lower-dimensional latent space (e.g., demographics or implicit biases correlate with labeling patterns).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3] "Embedding-based models... encode annotator differences in a shared latent space, enabling scalability to thousands of annotators with sparse labels."
  - [Section 5] "Partial pooling encodes structured relationships among annotators... [Embedding-based approaches] represent annotators as points in a latent population space."
- **Break condition:** If annotator identities are entirely random or uncorrelated with any observable features, the embedding space may collapse or fail to provide useful signal for generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Shifting the prediction target from a hard label to a distribution (e.g., soft labels or probability vectors) allows models to preserve uncertainty and represent the proportion of a population that would endorse a specific view.
- **Mechanism:** The model optimizes a composite objective function. It combines a standard supervised loss (alignment with observed individual annotations) with a distributional alignment term (e.g., KL-divergence) that forces the predicted label distribution to match the empirical annotator distribution. This explicitly trains the model to predict "how many people think X" rather than just "what is X."
- **Core assumption:** The observed annotations are samples from a true underlying distribution of human perspectives, and matching this distribution is desirable for fairness or accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3] "Distributional modeling treats disagreement itself as the target... parameterizing an item-level label distribution $p(y|x_i)$."
  - [Section 5] "Few works actually model disagreement distributions, but there is a convergence toward distribution-level modeling... Predicting how much people disagree is becoming as important as predicting what label they choose."
- **Break condition:** If the number of annotators per item is very low (extreme sparsity), the empirical distribution may be a poor approximation of the true population distribution, leading to high variance in the distributional loss.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Variable Models (Dawid-Skene)**
  - **Why needed here:** The survey contrasts modern methods against the "Latent Truth" family. Understanding that early methods viewed the "true label" as a hidden variable to be recovered (and disagreement as error) is essential to understanding the perspectivist shift.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model assume a single hidden truth exists, or does it predict the observed variance directly?

- **Concept: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and Partial Pooling**
  - **Why needed here:** "Task-based" models treat each annotator as a separate task. Understanding shared backbones vs. specific heads (and how partial pooling regularizes this) explains how the architecture handles thousands of annotators.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the model share information between Annotator A and Annotator B? (Answer: Shared backbone or latent space priors).

- **Concept: Distributional Divergence (KL/JS Divergence)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights evaluation and training via "soft metrics." You must understand measuring the distance between two probability distributions to implement the loss functions discussed in Mechanism 3.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is Cross-Entropy insufficient for evaluating disagreement, necessitating divergence metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Encoder $f(x)$ -> Annotator Encoder $g(a)$ -> Fusion Layer -> Prediction Head
- **Critical path:** The definition of the **pooling structure** (how annotators relate) and **prediction target** (consensus vs. distribution). If these are misaligned with the data's disagreement source (e.g., using a consensus target on highly subjective data), the model will fail to capture variance.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Task-based (Unpooled):** Most expressive, captures individual quirks. Fails on new annotators; computationally expensive for thousands of annotators.
  - **Embedding-based (Partial Pooling):** Scales well, generalizes to new annotators. May smooth over idiosyncratic but valid individual behaviors.
  - **Latent Truth (Noise reduction):** Good for objective tasks. Deletes minority signal on subjective tasks.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Mode Collapse:** The model predicts the majority class regardless of the input or annotator ID, effectively ignoring the perspectivist setup.
  - **Overfitting Annotators:** The model memorizes specific annotator labels (in task-based setups) but fails to generalize to new text.
  - **Demographic Stereotyping:** The model relies too heavily on demographic embeddings to bias predictions in ways that reinforce stereotypes (noted in Challenges).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Consensus):** Train a standard classifier on majority-vote labels to establish a baseline accuracy.
  2. **Distributional Baseline:** Implement a simple distributional model (e.g., predicting soft labels) using KL-divergence loss to see if the model captures the variance in the dataset (DisCo-style).
  3. **Annotator Ablation:** Implement an embedding-based model (Annotator ID + Text). Compare performance on "seen" vs. "unseen" annotators to verify generalization (partial pooling).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can models jointly integrate data, task, and annotator factors as structured sources of disagreement rather than modeling them in isolation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "Developing models that integrate all three sources, task, annotator, and data, remains an open challenge, partly constrained by data availability."
- **Why unresolved:** Current methods focus primarily on annotator bias; Figure 2 shows minimal work modeling data factors alone or jointly integrating all three sources.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model architecture that explicitly parameterizes interactions among linguistic ambiguity, task design features, and annotator demographics, demonstrated on datasets with rich metadata across all dimensions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can interpretability frameworks explain why specific annotators or demographic groups disagree on particular items?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Explainability remains underdeveloped for disagreement-aware NLP models. Most methods for model interpretability target single-label predictions and do not explain why annotators or groups disagree."
- **Why unresolved:** Feature- and attention-based explanations in multi-annotator models are rarely validated against actual annotator reasoning; metrics like Behavior Alignment Explainability are emerging but not established.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validated interpretability methods that surface linguistically or socially meaningful features driving disagreement, correlated with qualitative evidence from annotators about their reasoning.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What normative frameworks should govern fairness evaluation in disagreement-aware NLP, moving beyond descriptive parity metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative... do not specify what outcomes should count as fair."
- **Why unresolved:** Disaggregated metrics reveal disparities but lack explicit normative grounding; frameworks like statistical parity and equalized opportunity have not been systematically adapted to perspectivist settings.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A principled fairness framework for disagreement-aware models, with normative justification and empirical validation that preserving minority perspectives improves downstream outcomes for affected groups.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can task design features (instruction phrasing, label schemas, interfaces) be explicitly embedded in models to capture task-induced disagreement?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Future work could embed task schemas directly, enabling models to capture how task framing interacts with annotators and data."
- **Why unresolved:** Task-level sources remain underexplored; most models incorporate task information only indirectly via shared encoders.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Models that take structured task representations as input and demonstrate transfer across annotation protocols, isolating task effects from annotator and data variation.

## Limitations
- The survey does not report empirical results, so claims are based on theoretical coherence rather than experimental validation.
- Practical effectiveness of perspectivist modeling versus consensus-based approaches depends heavily on task characteristics and data quality not empirically tested within the survey.
- Most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative, indicating a gap between theoretical framing and actionable evaluation standards.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The taxonomy of disagreement sources (data, task, annotator factors) and the categorization of modeling approaches (latent truth, task-based, embedding-based) are clearly supported by cited literature and present a coherent synthesis.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that embedding-based partial pooling enables scalability and generalization to unseen annotators is well-supported by the cited papers, but practical performance will vary by dataset and task.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that distributional modeling is converging as a research standard is plausible given the mention of the LeWiDi-2025 shared task, but broader adoption is not yet demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Comparison**: Conduct experiments comparing embedding-based partial pooling models against consensus baselines (majority vote) and task-based models on multiple subjective NLP tasks (e.g., toxicity detection, stance analysis) to measure gains in predictive accuracy and fairness.
2. **Annotator Generalization Test**: Implement an ablation study to compare model performance on seen versus unseen annotators, directly testing the generalization claims of embedding-based partial pooling.
3. **Fairness Evaluation**: Design and execute a study using disaggregated metrics to assess whether perspectivist models actually reduce bias toward minoritized perspectives compared to consensus models, moving beyond descriptive fairness to normative claims.
