# GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735
- Reference count: 12
- Achieves 69% and 55% improvements in distance and radius metrics on FS-TKY dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for generating synthetic fine-grained location-based social network (LBSN) check-in trajectories. The method first reconstructs spatially continuous and temporally regular latent movement sequences from original discrete LBSN trajectories, then generates synthetic coarse-grained sequences using a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model with an efficient SASG-UNet. In the second stage, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture Coarse2FineNet translates these sequences into fine-grained trajectories by modeling POI semantics and temporal uncertainty. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
GeoGen operates through a two-stage approach. The first stage reconstructs latent movement sequences from discrete LBSN trajectories using spatio-temporal diffusion modeling with a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal UNet (SASG-UNet). This generates coarse-grained synthetic sequences that maintain spatial continuity and temporal regularity. The second stage employs a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture called Coarse2FineNet to translate these coarse sequences into fine-grained trajectories, explicitly modeling POI semantics and temporal uncertainty. The framework addresses the challenge of generating realistic synthetic trajectories from sparse check-in data while preserving the fine-grained characteristics of user movement patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves 69% improvement in distance metric on FS-TKY dataset
- Achieves 55% improvement in radius metric on FS-TKY dataset
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across four real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage coarse-to-fine approach works by first generating reliable coarse-grained representations that capture the essential spatio-temporal patterns, then refining these into fine-grained trajectories that preserve semantic and temporal details. The SASG-UNet efficiently handles the sparsity and irregularity inherent in LBSN data, while the Transformer-based Coarse2FineNet effectively models the complex relationships between coarse sequences and fine-grained outputs through self-attention mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatio-temporal diffusion models**: Used to generate continuous trajectories from discrete check-ins; needed because LBSN data is inherently sparse and irregular; quick check: verify that diffusion process converges to realistic movement patterns
- **SASG-UNet architecture**: Specialized UNet variant for handling sparsity in spatial and temporal dimensions; needed to efficiently process irregular LBSN data; quick check: compare efficiency against standard UNet on synthetic sparse data
- **Transformer-based Seq2Seq**: Sequence-to-sequence modeling using self-attention; needed to capture complex dependencies between coarse and fine-grained representations; quick check: evaluate attention patterns on validation sequences
- **POI semantics modeling**: Understanding meaning and context of Points of Interest; needed to generate semantically plausible trajectories; quick check: verify generated trajectories visit semantically consistent locations
- **Temporal uncertainty modeling**: Handling uncertainty in timing of check-ins; needed because real user behavior has temporal variability; quick check: compare temporal distributions against ground truth

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Discrete LBSN Trajectories -> Stage 1 (SASG-UNet + Spatio-temporal Diffusion) -> Coarse-grained Sequences -> Stage 2 (Coarse2FineNet Transformer) -> Fine-grained Trajectories
- **Critical path**: The data flows through both stages sequentially, with the output of Stage 1 directly feeding into Stage 2 as input
- **Design tradeoffs**: The two-stage approach adds complexity but enables better handling of sparsity and generation of more realistic fine-grained trajectories compared to end-to-end methods
- **Failure signatures**: Poor coarse-grained generation in Stage 1 will propagate errors to Stage 2; inadequate semantic modeling may produce trajectories that don't match real user behavior patterns
- **First experiments**: 1) Test SASG-UNet on synthetic sparse trajectories to verify sparsity handling; 2) Validate coarse-to-fine translation on paired coarse/fine sequences; 3) Benchmark against baseline diffusion models on standard trajectory datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework relies on well-structured discrete check-in data, limiting generalizability to noisy or sparse real-world LBSN datasets
- Two-stage approach may introduce cumulative errors from Stage 1 into Stage 2, potentially amplifying trajectory inaccuracies
- Evaluation focuses primarily on spatial accuracy without adequately addressing temporal consistency or semantic plausibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Methodological novelty and technical implementation of the two-stage framework
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability of results across different LBSN datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Computational efficiency claims, pending more detailed complexity analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on additional LBSN datasets with varying levels of sparsity and noise to assess robustness across different data quality conditions
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify contribution of each component (SASG-UNet, Coarse2FineNet, spatio-temporal modeling) to overall performance
3. Evaluate temporal consistency of generated trajectories using time-based metrics and conduct user studies to assess semantic plausibility
