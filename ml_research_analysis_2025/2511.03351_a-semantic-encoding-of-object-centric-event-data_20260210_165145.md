# A Semantic Encoding of Object Centric Event Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03351
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Three-layered semantic framework for Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) using Semantic Web technologies, enabling machine-readable, interoperable process data representation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a semantic framework for Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) using Semantic Web technologies to enable machine-readable, interoperable process data representation. The framework implements a three-layered knowledge structure: OCED Ontology (OCEDO) at the meta-level, domain-specific extensions (OCEDD) at the intensional level, and resource knowledge graphs (OCEDR) at the extensional level. The approach allows for the encoding of domain knowledge, enhances reasoning capabilities, and supports information integration across heterogeneous sources. A proof-of-concept tool demonstrates automated extraction of OCEDR knowledge graphs from XES event logs, laying groundwork for advanced process mining applications and semantic interoperability.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-layered semantic architecture using RDF/OWL standards. OCEDO defines core concepts (Event, Object) and auxiliary structures. OCEDD extends these via subclassing for domain-specific needs. OCEDR instantiates concrete resources conforming to both layers. The proof-of-concept tool uses RML (RDF Mapping Language) to transform XES event logs into OCEDR knowledge graphs when paired with domain descriptors. The approach supports both XES event logs and native OCED sources (OCEL, databases), with ongoing development for broader data format integration.

## Key Results
- Three-layered semantic stratification (OCEDO, OCEDD, OCEDR) enables domain-agnostic interoperability while permitting domain-specific knowledge injection
- RDF reification pattern captures event-object qualifiers (e.g., "creates," "modifies") through the `aux:Observe` class
- Proof-of-concept tool demonstrates automated XES-to-OCEDR transformation using RML mappings and tabular descriptors
- Framework supports both process mining analysis and semantic interoperability across heterogeneous data sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Three-Layered Semantic Stratification
The framework separates OCED representation into meta-level (OCEDO), intensional level (OCEDD), and extensional level (OCEDR). This stratification enables domain-agnostic interoperability while permitting domain-specific knowledge injection. OCEDO defines first-class citizens (Event, Object) and auxiliary structures. OCEDD extends these via `rdfs:subClassOf` and `rdfs:subPropertyOf` to create domain dialects. OCEDR instantiates concrete resources conforming to both layers. This architecture allows domain experts to add constraints without modifying the core standard.

Core assumption: Domain-specific extensions maintain backward compatibility through proper subclassing rather than altering OCEDO core definitions.

### Mechanism 2: RDF Reification for N-ary Relations
Reifying the `observes` relation between events and objects enables qualification of event-object interactions. Rather than a simple binary `Event → Object` property, the framework introduces `aux:Observe` as an OWL class with properties linking events, objects, and qualifiers. This pattern captures the OCED meta-model's requirement that events observe objects with qualifying semantics.

Core assumption: Consumers of OCEDR knowledge graphs can traverse reified relations efficiently; query complexity does not become prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3: RML-Based XES-to-OCEDR Transformation
Declarative mappings using RDF Mapping Language (RML) automate conversion of legacy XES logs into OCEDR knowledge graphs when paired with domain descriptors. The tool accepts an XES event log, an OCEDD ontology, and a tabular descriptor mapping XES attributes to OCEDO/OCEDD concepts. RML rules then generate RDF triples conforming to the layered schema.

Core assumption: The tabular descriptor accurately captures the semantic intent of XES attribute names; mapping authoring overhead is manageable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: RDF triples and namespaces
  - Why needed here: OCEDO/OCEDD/OCEDR are serialized as RDF graphs using subject-predicate-object triples with URI-identified resources. Understanding prefixes (e.g., `oced:`, `ext:`, `res:`) is essential to read the ontology listings.
  - Quick check question: Given the triple `ext:pertains_to rdfs:domain oced:Event`, what does this assert about resources using `ext:pertains_to`?

- Concept: RDFS/OWL subclassing and property hierarchies
  - Why needed here: OCEDD extends OCEDO via `rdfs:subClassOf` (e.g., `ext:Incident rdfs:subClassOf oced:Object`) and `rdfs:subPropertyOf` (e.g., domain-specific attributes). This mechanism underpins extensibility.
  - Quick check question: If `ext:Incident` is a subclass of `oced:Object`, can an `ext:Incident` instance be the subject of `aux:has_object_attribute`?

- Concept: Object-centric vs. activity-centric process mining
  - Why needed here: OCED shifts focus from case-based traces to objects and their lifecycle. Recognizing this paradigm shift clarifies why the ontology models events, objects, and their relations separately from "case" notions.
  - Quick check question: In the Volvo incident example, what are the objects and what is the event? How would a traditional XES trace differ from an OCEDR representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - OCEDO Core (`oced:` prefix): Defines `Event`, `Object`, `observed_at` timestamp property
  - OCEDO Auxiliary (`aux:` prefix): Defines `Observe` (reified event-object relation), `ObjectRelation`, `ObjectAttribute`, `EventType`, `ObjectType`, and linking properties (`from`, `to`, `qualifier`)
  - OCEDD Extension (`ext:` prefix): Domain-specific subclasses (e.g., `Incident`, `TeamMember`) and properties (e.g., `pertains_to`, `works_in`)
  - OCEDR Resources (`res:` prefix): Concrete instances of events and objects with attribute values and relation links
  - Transformation Layer: RML-based mapping tool ingesting XES + OCEDD + descriptor → OCEDR Turtle output

- Critical path:
  1. Define or obtain an OCEDD ontology matching your domain (subclass `oced:Event` and `oced:Object`, add domain-specific properties)
  2. Author a tabular descriptor mapping source data fields (XES attributes, CSV columns, or DB columns) to OCEDO/OCEDD terms
  3. Run the RML-based transformer to generate OCEDR triples
  4. Validate output against OCEDO/OCEDD schemas; query via SPARQL for process mining tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Reification vs. direct binary relations: Reified `Observe` supports qualifiers but increases graph traversal depth; binary properties are simpler but lose qualification semantics
  - Tight OCEDD constraints vs. flexibility: Adding SHACL shapes enforces domain rules (e.g., "every team member must belong to exactly one team") but reduces flexibility for edge cases
  - XES compatibility vs. native OCED: Maintaining XES-to-OCEDR bridges aids adoption; native OCED sources (OCEL, databases) may provide richer semantics

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent qualifier usage: Events observing the same object type with different or missing qualifiers break reasoning about lifecycle transitions
  - Orphan resources: Instances typed only as `oced:Object` without domain-specific subclass indicate incomplete OCEDD mapping
  - Namespace collisions: Reusing prefixes without checking URI uniqueness causes merge failures when integrating multiple OCEDR graphs
  - Circular object relations: Object-to-object relations forming cycles without clear semantics may confuse process discovery algorithms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate OCEDR from the BPIC 2013 Volvo XES log using the provided OCEDD and descriptor. Query for all `ext:Incident` objects and their `ext:is_about_product` relations to verify product linkage completeness
  2. Create a minimal custom OCEDD for a simple order-management domain (Order, Customer, Item subclasses; `places`, `contains` properties). Transform a small CSV event log and validate subclass inferences via SPARQL `rdfs:subClassOf*` queries
  3. Introduce SHACL constraints requiring every `ext:TeamMember` to have exactly one `ext:works_in` relation. Apply validation to the OCEDR graph and identify constraint violations; iterate on descriptor to fix missing relations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can machine learning approaches be effectively utilized to automatically infer event-to-object and object-to-object relations directly from raw event data?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 states that "an intriguing direction points at the use of machine learning approaches to automatically infer event-to-object and object-to-object relations based on raw event data."
- Why unresolved: The current framework and proof-of-concept tool rely on manual mappings (RML) and pre-defined descriptors rather than automated semantic inference.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated algorithm that generates OCEDR triples from raw logs with high precision, removing the need for manual schema mapping.

### Open Question 2
What visual languages or model-driven approaches can facilitate the definition of domain-specific OCEDD extensions for users unfamiliar with RDF?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 notes that "visual languages and model-driven approaches should be developed so as to allow their definition without necessarily being fluent in RDF and derivatives."
- Why unresolved: The current encoding of OCEDD documents requires writing Turtle syntax, creating a barrier for domain experts who lack semantic web expertise.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study demonstrating that domain experts can successfully create and modify OCEDD extensions using a new visual tool without writing code.

### Open Question 3
How can the framework be adapted to support the extraction of OCEDR graphs from heterogeneous data formats beyond XES, such as relational databases and OCEL files?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 calls for "implementations that link not only XES but other formats including raw CSVs, relational databases, OCEL files to OCEDR graphs."
- Why unresolved: The presented tool currently only supports automated extraction from XES event logs, limiting the framework's immediate applicability to other common data sources.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of connectors or transformation pipelines that successfully map database tables or OCEL events to the OCEDR structure.

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation on large-scale OCED datasets and performance benchmarks for RML-based transformation
- No integration testing with existing process mining tools or scalability assessment for high-volume event logs
- Proof-of-concept tool lacks documentation for the tabular descriptor format and tool dependencies, hindering reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The three-layered semantic architecture (OCEDO, OCEDD, OCEDR) is logically sound and aligns with established Semantic Web practices for extensibility and interoperability
- **Medium Confidence**: The RDF reification approach for event-object qualifiers is theoretically valid but lacks performance validation for large-scale OCED graphs
- **Low Confidence**: The RML-based transformation pipeline is promising but unproven without detailed specifications for the descriptor format and tool dependencies

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Test**: Transform the complete BPIC 2013 Volvo dataset using the RML tool and measure query performance on the resulting OCEDR graph compared to the original XES log
2. **SHACL Constraint Validation**: Implement SHACL shapes for the BPIC2013 OCEDD and validate the generated OCEDR graph to identify constraint violations and assess domain rule enforcement
3. **Tool Documentation Completion**: Reverse-engineer the tabular descriptor format from the repository examples and document the complete transformation pipeline with dependencies and runtime requirements
