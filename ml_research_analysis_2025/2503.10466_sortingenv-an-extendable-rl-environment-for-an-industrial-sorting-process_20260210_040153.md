# SortingEnv: An Extendable RL-Environment for an Industrial Sorting Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10466
- Reference count: 0
- SortingEnv is a novel RL environment simulating industrial sorting processes with two variants and digital twin concept

## Executive Summary
SortingEnv is a novel reinforcement learning environment designed to simulate industrial sorting processes, offering both basic and advanced variants to model material flow dynamics and operational parameters. The environment follows a digital twin concept, allowing testing of RL algorithms like PPO, DQN, and A2C against rule-based baselines in evolving setups. Experiments demonstrate that RL agents outperform rule-based agents, particularly in environments with seasonal input patterns and noise, making it a promising benchmark for industrial RL applications.

## Method Summary
The SortingEnv framework provides a realistic simulation of industrial sorting processes with two variants: a basic version with discrete belt speed adjustments and an advanced version featuring multiple sorting modes and enhanced observations. It models material flow dynamics and operational parameters following the digital twin concept, allowing testing of various RL algorithms against rule-based baselines. The environment's extendability enables studying agent behavior and adaptability in different industrial scenarios, with potential applications in transfer learning and continual learning research.

## Key Results
- RL agents outperformed rule-based agents in basic and advanced sorting environments
- Advanced environments achieved higher cumulative rewards than basic variants
- RL agents demonstrated superior performance in environments with seasonal input patterns and noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SortingEnv's effectiveness stems from its realistic simulation of industrial sorting processes, incorporating material flow dynamics and operational parameters. The digital twin concept allows for accurate modeling of real-world constraints and variations, while the extendability enables testing of RL algorithms in increasingly complex scenarios. The environment's design facilitates the study of agent adaptability and decision-making in dynamic industrial settings, providing valuable insights for real-world applications.
