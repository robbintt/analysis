# BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00622
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art time series forecasting with 8.9% MSE and 5.8% MAE improvement over LLM-based baselines

## Executive Summary
BALM-TSF introduces a lightweight framework for LLM-based time series forecasting that addresses modality imbalance through balanced alignment. The model uses a dual-branch architecture with learnable prompts and statistical summaries to harmonize textual and temporal embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting while maintaining high efficiency with only 0.97M trainable parameters.

## Method Summary
BALM-TSF addresses modality imbalance in LLM-based time series forecasting through a dual-branch architecture. The framework extracts statistical summaries from time series data, feeds them into a frozen LLM, and aligns the resulting embeddings with time series patches using a combination of scaling and contrastive alignment strategies. The learnable prompt mechanism helps bridge the semantic gap between textual and temporal modalities, while the balanced alignment strategy mitigates distributional imbalances between modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8.9% MSE reduction and 5.8% MAE reduction compared to strongest LLM-based baseline
- Highly efficient with only 0.97M trainable parameters
- Demonstrates strong performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The balanced alignment strategy effectively harmonizes the semantic and distributional differences between textual and temporal embeddings. By using statistical summaries as an intermediate representation, the framework creates a natural bridge between time series data and LLM embeddings. The dual-branch architecture allows for specialized processing of each modality while the learnable prompt mechanism adapts to specific forecasting tasks. The combination of scaling and contrastive alignment provides complementary mechanisms for aligning embeddings in both feature space and semantic space.

## Foundational Learning

**Statistical summaries for time series**: Converting raw time series into statistical features (mean, variance, trends, etc.) - needed to create a bridge between numerical time series and textual embeddings; quick check: verify summary statistics capture relevant patterns for the forecasting task.

**Multimodal alignment**: Techniques for harmonizing embeddings from different modalities - needed to ensure consistent representation space; quick check: measure alignment quality using similarity metrics across modalities.

**Contrastive learning for alignment**: Using positive/negative pairs to align embeddings - needed for fine-grained semantic alignment; quick check: validate that positive pairs have higher similarity than negative pairs post-alignment.

**Learnable prompts in frozen LLMs**: Adapting frozen language models through prompt engineering - needed to maintain LLM capabilities while adapting to specific tasks; quick check: test prompt effectiveness with ablation studies.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Time series -> Statistical Summary Extractor -> Frozen LLM -> Textual Embeddings; Time series -> Temporal Patch Extractor -> Temporal Embeddings; Textual Embeddings + Temporal Embeddings -> Alignment Module (Scaling + Contrastive) -> Forecast

**Critical path**: Statistical summary extraction -> LLM encoding -> alignment with temporal patches -> forecasting output

**Design tradeoffs**: Using frozen LLM preserves pre-trained knowledge but limits fine-tuning; statistical summaries reduce information but improve alignment; dual-branch adds complexity but enables specialized processing.

**Failure signatures**: Poor alignment quality manifests as degraded forecasting accuracy; modality imbalance leads to biased predictions; inadequate statistical summaries cause information loss.

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline: Time series to statistical summaries to frozen LLM without alignment
2. Ablation: Test scaling alignment alone vs. contrastive alignment alone
3. Sensitivity: Vary statistical summary granularity and measure impact on accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies on scaling versus contrastive alignment components
- Limited evaluation on noisy, real-world time series data
- No quantitative GPU memory usage benchmarks provided

## Confidence
- **High**: Dual-branch architecture design and learnable prompt mechanism effectiveness
- **Medium**: State-of-the-art performance claims and efficiency improvements
- **Low**: Robustness to real-world noise and cross-domain generalization capabilities

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of scaling versus contrastive alignment on forecasting accuracy
2. Provide quantitative GPU memory usage benchmarks and runtime comparisons across multiple hardware setups
3. Test the model on noisy, real-world datasets with varying levels of modality imbalance to assess robustness
