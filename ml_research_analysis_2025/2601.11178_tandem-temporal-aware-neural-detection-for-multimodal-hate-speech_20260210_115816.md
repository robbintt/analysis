- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178
- Authors: Girish A. Koushik; Helen Treharne; Diptesh Kanojia

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TANDEM, a unified framework for structured multimodal hate speech detection in long-form videos. The key innovation is a tandem reinforcement learning strategy that jointly optimizes vision-language and audio-language models through self-constrained cross-modal context, enabling precise temporal grounding and target identification without requiring dense frame-level supervision. TANDEM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HateMM dataset, improving target identification F1 score by 30% over previous methods, while also demonstrating strong generalization to other multimodal hate benchmarks.

## Method Summary
TANDEM employs a tandem reinforcement learning approach that optimizes both vision-language and audio-language models simultaneously through self-constrained cross-modal context. The framework uses temporal-aware neural detection to identify hate speech instances and their targets without requiring dense frame-level supervision. The system processes long-form videos by jointly analyzing visual, textual, and audio modalities to provide interpretable outputs for human-in-the-loop moderation.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HateMM dataset
- Improves target identification F1 score by 30% over previous methods
- Demonstrates strong generalization to other multimodal hate benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TANDEM's effectiveness stems from its tandem reinforcement learning strategy that enables joint optimization of vision-language and audio-language models. The self-constrained cross-modal context allows the system to learn temporal relationships between different modalities without requiring dense supervision. This approach addresses the challenge of detecting hate speech in long-form videos where targets and contexts can change over time.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning** - Why needed: To jointly optimize multiple models through reward signals; Quick check: Verify reward functions are properly shaped for multimodal tasks

**Cross-modal Context Learning** - Why needed: To capture relationships between visual, textual, and audio information; Quick check: Validate cross-modal attention mechanisms are effective

**Temporal Grounding** - Why needed: To identify when hate speech occurs within long videos; Quick check: Ensure temporal boundaries are accurately detected

**Multimodal Fusion** - Why needed: To combine information from different modalities effectively; Quick check: Test fusion strategies for robustness

**Self-constrained Learning** - Why needed: To reduce dependency on dense supervision; Quick check: Validate pseudo-labels maintain quality

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Video -> Multimodal Encoder -> Temporal Attention -> Hate Speech Detector -> Target Identification

Critical path: Video frames and audio → Multimodal feature extraction → Temporal context modeling → Hate speech classification → Target grounding

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades off dense supervision requirements for self-supervised learning, which may affect precision but enables scalability to longer videos.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include missing subtle hate speech instances, misidentifying targets due to context ambiguity, and struggling with rapid context shifts within videos.

First experiments:
1. Test model on single-modality inputs to verify individual component performance
2. Evaluate temporal grounding accuracy on videos with known hate speech timestamps
3. Conduct ablation study removing cross-modal context to measure its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Heavy dependence on the quality and representativeness of the HateMM dataset
- Claims of strong generalization require verification across diverse cultural contexts
- Practical interpretability and actionability for human moderators needs more detailed validation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical feasibility of tandem reinforcement learning approach
**Medium confidence**: 30% F1 score improvement pending independent validation
**Medium confidence**: Generalization claims across diverse datasets
**Low confidence**: Practical interpretability and usability claims without user studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating contributions of vision-language versus audio-language optimization
2. Test model on hate speech datasets from different cultural contexts and languages
3. Perform user studies with content moderators to evaluate interpretability and usability in real workflows
