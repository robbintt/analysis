# RE-LLM: Integrating Large Language Models into Renewable Energy Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.01392
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01392
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ML surrogates reduce optimization computational costs by >10x while maintaining R² > 0.94 accuracy for forest management capacity predictions

## Executive Summary
RE-LLM integrates large language models (LLMs) into renewable energy system optimization by combining machine learning surrogates for rapid scenario evaluation with LLM-powered natural language generation for stakeholder communication. The framework accelerates Germany's land-based greenhouse gas mitigation planning by training Random Forest ensembles on GAMS optimization outputs, using SHAP analysis to identify key drivers, and generating accessible narratives from quantitative results. Applied to 26 scenarios spanning 2020-2050, the approach demonstrates that surrogate models can approximate complex optimization behavior with minimal accuracy loss while dramatically reducing computation time, and that LLM-generated explanations improve stakeholder comprehension of technical modeling outputs.

## Method Summary
The RE-LLM framework integrates optimization-based scenario exploration with machine learning surrogate models and LLM-powered natural language generation. A GAMS/BENOPTex optimizer generates a scenario bank of land-based greenhouse gas mitigation outcomes, which are compressed through feature engineering into time-series summaries (initial, final, slope values). A 10-fold ensemble of Random Forest regressors learns to predict forest management capacity from these features, achieving R² > 0.94 accuracy. SHAP analysis identifies key drivers of system behavior, while a structured prompt pipeline injects these insights into an LLM to generate stakeholder-friendly narratives explaining complex optimization results.

## Key Results
- Machine learning surrogates achieve R² > 0.94 and RMSE < 10,160 ha for forest management capacity prediction
- Computational cost reduced by over an order of magnitude compared to full optimization
- SHAP analysis identifies CO2 price and initial land area as primary drivers of forest management capacity
- LLM-generated narratives improve stakeholder comprehension of complex optimization outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: If high-fidelity energy system optimization is computationally prohibitive for rapid scenario exploration, training a machine learning surrogate on a subset of optimization inputs and outputs can approximate the system behavior with significantly lower latency.
- Mechanism: The framework extracts features (e.g., cost trajectories, land availability) from GAMS optimization outputs to train an ensemble of Random Forest (RF) regressors. This surrogate model learns the mapping $\hat{y} = f_\theta(x) \approx O(x)$, allowing users to query system outcomes without re-running the expensive linear programming solver.
- Core assumption: The engineered feature set (temporal trends, slopes, regional aggregates) sufficiently captures the variance of the optimization landscape so the surrogate generalizes to unseen scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Machine learning surrogates... accelerate scenario analysis while retaining fidelity... R² > 0.94."
  - [section 4.3] "We seek to learn a predictive mapping $\hat{y}=f_\theta(x)$ that approximates the underlying (black-box) optimization operator $O(x)$."
  - [corpus] "Operator Learning for Power Systems Simulation" supports the general viability of using learned operators to speed up complex grid simulations.
- Break condition: If the optimization space is highly non-linear or discontinuous in ways not captured by the training scenarios (e.g., unexpected unit commitment binary switching), the surrogate's predictive accuracy (R²) will degrade, breaking the approximation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: If a surrogate model is treated as an opaque predictor, stakeholder trust diminishes; therefore, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used to reverse-engineer feature importance and identify system drivers.
- Mechanism: The framework calculates SHAP values for the ensemble surrogate. These values quantify the marginal contribution of each input feature (e.g., CO2 price, initial land area) to a specific prediction. This transforms the "black box" ML model into a glass box where specific policy levers can be traced to outcomes.
- Core assumption: The surrogate model has learned the correct physical/economic correlations rather than spurious artifacts, ensuring that SHAP attributions reflect true system sensitivities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHAP analysis identifies key drivers of forest management capacity."
  - [section 4.3.1] "SHAP offers both theoretical rigor and empirical utility for understanding the contribution of features... ensuring that the model's prediction is decomposed exactly."
  - [corpus] Evidence for SHAP in this specific RE-LLM architecture is limited in the provided corpus; mechanism relies primarily on [section 4.3.1].
- Break condition: If input features are highly collinear (multicollinearity), SHAP values may become unstable or distribute importance arbitrarily among correlated features, obscuring the true driver.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: If an LLM is provided with structured, quantitative context (SHAP values and cluster metadata), it can generate natural language narratives that are factually grounded in the optimization results rather than hallucinated.
- Mechanism: A prompting pipeline parses a user query (e.g., "What if CO2 price rises?"), matches it to the relevant scenario cluster, retrieves the top-k SHAP features, and injects this data into the LLM prompt. The LLM acts as a translator, synthesizing the quantitative summary into a stakeholder-readable report.
- Core assumption: The LLM possesses sufficient prior knowledge to interpret domain concepts (e.g., "abatement," "hectares") and adheres to the constraints provided in the prompt template.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-generated narratives improve comprehension... bridging the gap between technical modeling and actionable decision-making."
  - [section 4.4] "We construct a structured prompt $\Pi(Q, p^*, \lambda, C_{k*}, \bar{\rho})$ for the LLM... encoding the original query [and] matched parameters."
  - [corpus] Evidence regarding the specific "SHAP-to-LLM" injection mechanism is unique to this paper in the provided corpus.
- Break condition: If the user query implies a scenario outside the training distribution (out-of-distribution), the retrieved SHAP values and cluster context will be irrelevant, likely leading the LLM to generate plausible but incorrect explanations.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Feature Engineering for Time-Series Data**
- Why needed here: The raw optimization outputs are high-dimensional time-series (2020–2050). Directly feeding these into a surrogate model causes the "curse of dimensionality."
- Quick check question: Can you explain why summarizing a time-series into [Initial, Final, Slope] might lose critical information about non-linear policy shocks?

**Concept: Surrogate Modeling (Emulation)**
- Why needed here: This is the bridge between slow, rigorous physics-based models and fast, interactive AI interfaces. You must understand the trade-off between simulation fidelity and inference speed.
- Quick check question: If a surrogate model has an R² of 0.99 but fails to predict a critical constraint violation (e.g., capacity exceeding land limits), is it fit for purpose?

**Concept: Shapley Values (Game Theory)**
- Why needed here: SHAP is the interpretability layer. Understanding that it treats feature contribution as a "payout" in a cooperative game is key to debugging why the model makes specific predictions.
- Quick check question: Does a high global SHAP value for "CO2 Price" guarantee that changing "CO2 Price" will change the output in every specific scenario?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Optimizer (GAMS/BENOPTex) -> Feature Extractor -> Surrogate Engine (RF/XGBoost) -> Explainer (SHAP) -> Interface (LLM)

**Critical path:** The **Feature Extractor** determines the maximum fidelity of the Surrogate Engine. If the feature engineering fails to capture a key driver (e.g., inter-temporal storage dynamics), the downstream LLM will confidently explain incorrect conclusions.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Scenario Bank Size vs. Coverage:** The paper uses 26 scenarios. This is computationally light but risks low coverage of the input space compared to Latin Hypercube sampling.
- **Global vs. Local Explanation:** Using global SHAP values for ranking vs. local SHAP values for specific scenario explanations.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Surrogate Collapse:** High RMSE on test sets indicates the optimizer's logic is too complex for the selected model class (e.g., linear trends cannot capture step-changes in policy).
- **Collinearity Artifacts:** If SHAP values fluctuate wildly across similar scenarios, input features are likely too correlated.
- **LLM Drift:** If the LLM response discusses concepts not found in the prompt context (e.g., mentioning "solar panels" in a forestry model), the prompt constraints are too weak.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline Fidelity Check:** Train the surrogate on 20 scenarios and test on the held-out 6. Plot Predicted vs. Actual `capFMs` to verify R² > 0.94 as claimed in [section 5.3].
2. **SHAP Ablation:** Remove the top-ranked SHAP feature (e.g., `year` or `Technology_FM02_TSA`) from the training set and measure the drop in surrogate accuracy to validate its importance.
3. **Prompt Adherence Test:** Query the LLM with a contradictory premise (e.g., "What if land area is negative?") to verify if it relies on retrieved cluster data or hallucinates a response.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can RE-LLM's surrogate models maintain high fidelity (R² > 0.94) when scaled to scenario banks with orders of magnitude more scenarios and higher-dimensional input spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Future research will extend this approach toward larger scenario banks, multi-country applications, and deeper integration of LLMs with optimization solvers."
- Why unresolved: The current study uses only 26 scenarios with highly correlated inputs (r ≈ 0.999–1.000), which may inflate surrogate performance. The curse of dimensionality may degrade accuracy as scenario diversity increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking surrogate performance (R², RMSE) on scenario banks with 500+ scenarios, intentionally designed orthogonal perturbations, and multi-country applications with heterogeneous constraints.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How do non-expert stakeholders rate the trustworthiness and accuracy of LLM-generated narratives compared to traditional reporting methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims LLM narratives "improve comprehension" and cites a "structured user study with energy policy analysts," but presents no quantitative validation data, survey results, or comparative comprehension scores.
- Why unresolved: Without empirical stakeholder feedback, it remains unclear whether LLM outputs genuinely enhance decision-making or merely create an illusion of understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled user studies measuring (i) factual accuracy perception, (ii) decision confidence, and (iii) task-based comprehension scores between LLM-generated vs. chart/tabular presentations.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: To what extent does SHAP-guided prompting mitigate LLM hallucinations in energy policy narratives?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors claim SHAP values "ground" LLM outputs, yet the framework does not evaluate whether generated narratives contain factual errors or unsupported inferences beyond the SHAP-ranked features.
- Why unresolved: The LLM may still extrapolate beyond data or generate plausible-but-incorrect causal explanations, even with SHAP-based constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic human or automated fact-checking of LLM outputs against raw optimization results, measuring hallucination rates with and without SHAP grounding.

## Limitations
- The framework's generalizability beyond forestry-focused optimization remains unclear due to limited scenario diversity
- The 26-scenario training set may not capture edge cases or discontinuous policy shifts
- The paper does not address surrogate performance with fundamentally different optimization structures or expanded spatial-temporal dimensions

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The computational acceleration claim (R² > 0.94, RMSE < 10,160 ha) is well-supported by specific numerical results and established machine learning methodology.

**Medium confidence:** The interpretability benefits through SHAP analysis are theoretically sound but the paper provides limited validation that these attributions align with domain expert understanding of the underlying optimization model.

**Medium confidence:** The LLM narrative generation shows promise but the specific prompting strategy and its robustness to diverse stakeholder queries warrants further empirical validation beyond the demonstrated examples.

## Next Checks

1. Test surrogate generalization by training on a subset of scenarios (e.g., 15) and evaluating on completely held-out scenarios to verify the R² > 0.94 threshold holds for truly unseen data.

2. Conduct a blind expert review where energy system analysts evaluate whether SHAP-derived explanations align with their understanding of the optimization model's behavior.

3. Perform an adversarial prompt test by querying the LLM with intentionally misleading or out-of-distribution scenarios to assess whether it maintains factual accuracy or defaults to hallucination.
