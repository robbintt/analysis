# AEMA: Verifiable Evaluation Framework for Trustworthy and Controlled Agentic LLM Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11903
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: AEMA reduces score dispersion and absolute error vs single LLM-as-a-Judge in finance workflow evaluation, with average step-level errors of 0.018 vs 0.077 (good) and 0.037 vs 0.108 (degraded).

## Executive Summary
AEMA (Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent) introduces a verifiable, process-aware framework for assessing multi-agent LLM systems. It employs coordinated planning, prompt refinement, and debate-based scoring to produce stable, human-aligned assessments. The framework reduces score dispersion and improves alignment with human references compared to single LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, while supporting traceable evaluation logs for accountable, reproducible assessment of complex enterprise workflows.

## Method Summary
AEMA implements a four-role multi-agent evaluator orchestrated in AutoGen. The Planning Agent classifies context, retrieves evaluation functions via hybrid BM25+dense search, and debates plan generation with an Evaluator role (max 5 rounds, typically converging by 3). The Prompt-Refinement Agent extracts parameters from traces and synthesizes few-shot examples through retrieval. Evaluation Agents execute LLM and code-based evaluators, producing normalized 0-1 scores plus qualitative feedback. The Final Report Agent aggregates metrics, generates summaries, and supports historical trend analysis. The system uses GPT-4o as backbone LLM, ChromaDB for vector storage, and LangChain for memory integration.

## Key Results
- Average step-level absolute error: 0.018 (AEMA) vs 0.077 (single LLM) on good-quality invoices
- Average step-level absolute error: 0.037 (AEMA) vs 0.108 (single LLM) on degraded-quality invoices
- Debate consensus reached within 1-3 rounds in 26 of 30 runs, with only 4 requiring 3 rounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Internal Debate for Plan Consensus
Two LLM instances with different system prompts iterate—Generator creates a candidate plan, Evaluator critiques it. If disagreement, Evaluator provides feedback prompting revision; loop continues until consensus or iteration cap. Structured disagreement followed by revision converges on higher-quality plans than single generation, and convergence within few rounds indicates plan stability. [section]: Consensus reached in 13 runs after 1 round, 13 after 2 rounds, 4 after 3 rounds (30 total runs). Break condition: If consensus not reached within max iterations (default 5), the last plan is used; may yield incomplete or suboptimal evaluation coverage.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Retrieval for Function Matching
Combining sparse (BM25) and dense (embedding) retrieval improves relevance of evaluation-function selection over either method alone. Sparse retrieval captures keyword-level matches; dense retrieval captures semantic similarity. A convex combination ranks candidates; top-k are passed to the Plan Generator. [section]: "Combining sparse and dense retrieval methods has been empirically shown to yield more accurate and robust results than using either alone," citing Xiong et al. 2024. Break condition: Poorly written docstrings or ambiguous task context can surface irrelevant evaluators, reducing plan coherence.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Criteria Aggregation via AHP
Weighted aggregation of five plan-quality metrics yields stable, interpretable final scores with better human alignment than single-judge baselines. Five criteria—schema validity, agent-selection F1, step-agent coherence, order preservation, step efficiency—are weighted via Analytic Hierarchy Process from pairwise comparisons; final score is weighted sum. [section]: Tables 1–2 show average step-level absolute errors: AEMA 0.018 vs single-LLM 0.077 (good); 0.037 vs 0.108 (degraded). Break condition: Misspecified weights or shifting domain priorities without re-calibration can produce scores misaligned with human judgment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
  - Why needed here: AEMA extends single-judge approaches with multi-agent coordination and debate; understanding baseline variance helps contextualize stability gains.
  - Quick check question: What score distribution (mean, spread) would you expect from running the same evaluation prompt 30 times through a single LLM?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with hybrid search
  - Why needed here: Planning and Prompt-Refinement agents use BM25 + embedding similarity to match functions and examples; tuning retrieval affects plan quality.
  - Quick check question: If a function's docstring omits key domain terminology, which retrieval method (sparse or dense) is more likely to fail?

- Concept: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for multi-criteria decisions
  - Why needed here: Final score aggregation relies on AHP-derived weights; consistency checks guard against incoherent pairwise comparisons.
  - Quick check question: If pairwise criterion comparisons are inconsistent (consistency ratio > 0.1), what corrective action does AHP require?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User input → Planning Agent (context classification → function retrieval → plan debate) → Prompt-Refinement Agent (parameter extraction → example retrieval/synthesis) → Evaluation Agents (scoring per step) → Final Report Agent (aggregation + recommendations)

- Critical path: User input → Planning Agent (context classification → function retrieval → plan debate) → Prompt-Refinement Agent (parameter extraction → example retrieval/synthesis) → Evaluation Agents (scoring per step) → Final Report Agent (aggregation + recommendations)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Debate rounds improve plan quality but add latency; paper data suggests 3 rounds sufficient for convergence in tested scenarios.
  - Separate agent roles improve modularity and auditability but multiply LLM calls; prompt merging can reduce calls but may lower accuracy (noted as open question).
  - Continuous scoring shows variance despite coherent rationales; discrete/categorical scales recommended for repeatability.
  - Full evaluation of verbose traces can be costly; mitigations include priority-action-only evaluation, caching, and budget-aware planning.

- Failure signatures:
  - Planning loop exceeds max iterations without consensus → uses last plan; may miss critical evaluation steps.
  - Hybrid retrieval surfaces low-relevance functions → plan includes inappropriate or redundant evaluations.
  - Continuous scores vary across identical runs → unstable thresholds; discrete scales or averaging may be needed.
  - Latency/cost spikes on long traces → requires selective evaluation, caching, or small-model delegation.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Stability baseline: Run AEMA 30× on identical workflow output; measure per-step and final score dispersion (IQR, outliers) to establish variance bounds before setting operational thresholds.
  2. Human alignment test: Compare AEMA vs single LLM-as-a-Judge against human references on both clean and degraded inputs in your domain; verify error reduction replicates.
  3. Convergence audit: Log debate round counts and consensus rates for the Planning Agent; if >3 rounds are common, investigate prompt design or function-library coverage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent does AEMA generalize beyond the Finance domain to safety-critical or heterogeneous multi-agent workflows?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 states "Current experiments are confined to a single Finance domain" and Section 6 calls for "future extensions will explore cross-domain settings, including safety-critical workflows."
- Why unresolved: The evaluation was limited to one domain with homogeneous LLM-based agents; cross-domain performance and handling of heterogeneous agent configurations remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across at least 2–3 additional domains (e.g., Healthcare, Software, IT automation) with metrics comparable to the Finance experiments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal level of prompt consolidation that reduces latency without sacrificing evaluation accuracy or interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes "early observations suggest that heavily merged prompts may lower task accuracy or interpretability. Controlled experiments are planned to identify safe levels of consolidation."
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between fewer LLM calls (lower cost/latency) and task accuracy has only been observed anecdotally; no systematic study has been conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study varying prompt merging levels, measuring both latency and accuracy against human references.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can budget-aware planning with dynamic model selection maintain human alignment while reducing evaluation cost?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 proposes "integrating cost or budget constraints into the workflow could allow the Planning Agent to activate evaluation tools dynamically based on available resources or to decide when to use small language models versus larger ones."
- Why unresolved: No experiments currently explore dynamic allocation between small and large models, and the accuracy–cost frontier is uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with configurable budget thresholds, comparing alignment scores and total token cost against fixed-model baselines.

## Limitations

- Core evaluation stability results rely on a single finance-domain invoice workflow with two controlled degradation modes; generalization to other domains or more complex agent graphs is unverified.
- The hybrid retrieval effectiveness is inferred from general literature rather than ablation studies specific to the evaluation-function matching task.
- Continuous scoring variance is noted but only mitigation strategies are suggested, not empirically validated alternatives.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multi-agent debate mechanism improves plan consensus over single-pass generation, as evidenced by documented convergence rates (13/13/4 consensus at 1/2/3 rounds). The five-step evaluation process (schema, F1, coherence, order, efficiency) is formally defined and measurable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The hybrid retrieval combination outperforms either sparse or dense alone for function matching, based on general empirical literature but not task-specific ablations. The AHP aggregation yields interpretable scores, but weight calibration robustness is unverified.
- **Low Confidence**: Stability gains over single LLM-as-a-Judge will replicate in non-finance domains or more complex workflows, due to limited external validation and domain-specific design choices.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Test**: Apply AEMA to a non-finance multi-agent workflow (e.g., customer support or logistics) and compare score dispersion and error rates against single LLM-as-a-Judge under identical conditions.
2. **Ablation on Retrieval**: Run the Planning Agent with only BM25, only dense, and the hybrid combination on a fixed set of evaluation functions; measure F1 of correct function retrieval and downstream plan quality.
3. **Scoring Consistency Audit**: Repeat AEMA evaluations on identical inputs 50+ times; calculate per-step and final score variance, then compare discrete vs continuous scoring variants for repeatability.
