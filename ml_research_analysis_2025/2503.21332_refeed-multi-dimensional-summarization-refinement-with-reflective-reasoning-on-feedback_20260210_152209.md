# ReFeed: Multi-dimensional Summarization Refinement with Reflective Reasoning on Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21332
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21332
- Reference count: 40
- Improves multi-dimensional summarization refinement by integrating reflective reasoning on feedback

## Executive Summary
ReFeed addresses the challenge of multi-dimensional summarization refinement by constructing SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale dataset capturing long-chain-of-thought reasoning. The approach trains lightweight models to handle trade-offs, ordering bias, and noise in feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that ReFeed achieves higher composite scores across faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness compared to prior methods.

## Method Summary
ReFeed introduces a novel approach to multi-dimensional summarization refinement by leveraging reflective reasoning on feedback. The method constructs SumFeed-CoT, a dataset specifically designed to capture long-chain-of-thought reasoning patterns. This dataset enables training of lightweight models that can simultaneously address multiple refinement dimensions while being robust to feedback quality variations and ordering biases.

## Key Results
- Achieves composite score of 75.3% across faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness
- Outperforms prior methods (73.2-73.8%) in multi-dimensional refinement
- Demonstrates robustness to feedback order and quality variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by integrating reflective reasoning into the feedback processing pipeline, allowing the model to understand and apply multi-dimensional refinement instructions simultaneously. The SumFeed-CoT dataset provides training examples that capture complex reasoning chains, enabling the model to handle nuanced trade-offs between different summarization quality dimensions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Understanding long reasoning sequences is crucial for handling complex feedback instructions. Quick check: Verify model can follow multi-step reasoning chains in test scenarios.
- **Multi-dimensional quality assessment**: Balancing faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness requires understanding their interactions. Quick check: Test model's ability to maintain quality across all three dimensions simultaneously.
- **Feedback noise handling**: Robustness to noisy or ambiguous feedback is essential for real-world applicability. Quick check: Evaluate performance degradation with increasingly noisy feedback inputs.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input text -> Feedback processor -> Reflective reasoning module -> Multi-dimensional refiner -> Output summary

**Critical path**: The feedback processor and reflective reasoning module form the core of the system, as they determine how effectively the model can interpret and apply refinement instructions.

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using lightweight models trained on specialized data rather than larger general-purpose models.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on feedback with implicit rather than explicit instructions, and reduced effectiveness when quality dimensions conflict strongly.

**First experiments**: 1) Test model's ability to handle single-dimension refinement, 2) Evaluate robustness to feedback ordering variations, 3) Measure performance degradation with noisy feedback inputs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on SumFeed-CoT dataset may limit generalizability to diverse summarization tasks
- Scalability and computational efficiency of training lightweight models with long-chain reasoning requires further investigation
- Generalizability to domains beyond tested scenarios needs validation

## Confidence
- Dataset representativeness and bias: Medium
- Causal relationship between components and improvements: Medium
- Real-world feedback scenario robustness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments with real-world user feedback data to validate robustness claims in practical settings
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of reflective reasoning from other components
3. Test the approach on diverse summarization tasks and domains to assess generalizability
