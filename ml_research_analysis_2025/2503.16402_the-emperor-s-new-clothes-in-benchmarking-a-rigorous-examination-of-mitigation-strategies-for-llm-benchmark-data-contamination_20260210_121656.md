# The Emperor's New Clothes in Benchmarking? A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16402
- Reference count: 33
- This paper introduces systematic pipeline and novel metrics to evaluate Benchmark Data Contamination mitigation strategies, finding no existing strategy significantly improves contamination resistance while maintaining fidelity

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical issue of Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC) in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a systematic evaluation framework with two novel metrics: fidelity and contamination resistance. Unlike previous approaches that focus on aggregate accuracy, the proposed metrics emphasize question-level evaluation result matching, providing a fine-grained assessment of mitigation strategies. The study comprehensively tests 20 mitigation strategies across 10 LLMs and 5 benchmarks, revealing that existing approaches fail to significantly improve contamination resistance while maintaining evaluation fidelity.

The research highlights a fundamental challenge in LLM evaluation: current mitigation strategies cannot effectively balance the dual objectives of maintaining evaluation quality (fidelity) while reducing the impact of contaminated benchmark data (contamination resistance). The findings suggest that the field urgently needs new approaches to address BDC, as existing methods may give false confidence in LLM performance measurements.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a systematic and controlled pipeline to assess Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC) mitigation strategies for LLMs. The approach includes two novel metrics—fidelity and contamination resistance—that evaluate mitigation strategies at the question level rather than aggregate accuracy. The pipeline involves controlled contamination scenarios where LLMs are tested on benchmarks with varying levels of contamination. Fidelity measures how well the mitigation strategy preserves the original evaluation quality, while contamination resistance quantifies the strategy's ability to reduce the impact of contaminated data. The framework was applied across 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and 20 mitigation strategies, providing comprehensive coverage of the current landscape.

## Key Results
- No existing BDC mitigation strategy significantly improves contamination resistance over the vanilla case across all benchmarks
- None of the tested strategies effectively balance fidelity and contamination resistance simultaneously
- The novel fidelity and contamination resistance metrics provide more nuanced evaluation than traditional aggregate accuracy measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by shifting from aggregate accuracy metrics to question-level evaluation result matching. This granular assessment captures the nuanced effects of contamination that might be masked in summary statistics. The systematic pipeline creates controlled contamination scenarios that allow for direct comparison of mitigation strategies under identical conditions, eliminating confounding variables that plague real-world evaluations.

## Foundational Learning

**Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)** - When LLMs are trained on or exposed to benchmark datasets, potentially inflating their measured performance
- *Why needed*: Understanding contamination is crucial for valid LLM evaluation
- *Quick check*: Does the model perform significantly better on known benchmarks versus novel tasks?

**Fidelity Metric** - Measures how well mitigation strategies preserve original evaluation quality
- *Why needed*: Ensures that contamination resistance doesn't come at the cost of evaluation validity
- *Quick check*: Does the mitigated evaluation still accurately reflect model capabilities?

**Contamination Resistance** - Quantifies a strategy's ability to reduce the impact of contaminated data on evaluation results
- *Why needed*: Directly measures the effectiveness of BDC mitigation
- *Quick check*: Does the strategy reduce performance inflation from known contamination?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLMs -> Mitigation Strategies -> Evaluation Pipeline -> Fidelity/Resistance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Benchmark Selection → Contamination Control → Strategy Application → Metric Calculation → Comparative Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes controlled, reproducible evaluation over real-world complexity, sacrificing ecological validity for methodological rigor.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor contamination resistance indicates strategies fail to reduce performance inflation; low fidelity suggests strategies overly distort evaluation quality.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply each mitigation strategy to a single LLM on a single benchmark to establish baseline performance
2. Compare question-level results between mitigated and unmitigated evaluations
3. Test the same strategies across multiple contamination levels to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The controlled pipeline may not perfectly capture real-world contamination scenarios where LLMs encounter benchmark data organically
- Novel metrics lack extensive validation against established evaluation standards
- The study focuses primarily on contamination aspects rather than comprehensively validating all fidelity dimensions

## Confidence

- **Medium-High**: The claim that no strategy significantly improves contamination resistance across all benchmarks is supported by systematic testing across multiple benchmarks
- **Medium**: The fidelity measurements focus primarily on contamination aspects rather than comprehensive validation of all fidelity dimensions
- **High**: The urgent need for more effective BDC mitigation strategies is well-supported by the empirical evidence

## Next Checks

1. Validate the fidelity and contamination resistance metrics against human expert evaluations on a subset of questions to ensure metric reliability
2. Test the evaluation framework on additional LLM architectures (including smaller models and specialized domains) to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual components of the mitigation strategies to identify which elements contribute most to the observed lack of effectiveness
