# Knowledge Graph-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Integrating Deepseek-R1 with Weaviate for Advanced Chatbot Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.11108
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11108
- **Authors**: Alexandru Lecu; Adrian Groza; Lezan Hawizy
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: Knowledge graph-driven RAG framework integrates DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate to enhance biomedical chatbot accuracy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

## Executive Summary
This study presents a knowledge graph-driven retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that integrates DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate to enhance biomedical chatbot accuracy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The system extracts and refines causal relations and named entities from medical abstracts, stores them in a structured knowledge graph, and uses semantic embeddings for retrieval. By grounding LLM responses in verified clinical evidence, the approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factual precision. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced response clarity and reliability, making the system a robust solution for advanced biomedical chatbot applications.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts causal relations and named entities from medical abstracts using natural language processing techniques, then refines these extractions into a structured knowledge graph. This graph is stored in Weaviate, a vector database optimized for semantic search, where entities and relationships are indexed as vector embeddings. When users query the biomedical chatbot, DeepSeek-R1 retrieves relevant knowledge graph nodes through semantic similarity search, grounding its responses in verified clinical evidence rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge. The system processes medical literature systematically, converting unstructured text into structured knowledge that can be efficiently queried and validated.

## Key Results
- Knowledge graph-driven RAG framework significantly reduces LLM hallucinations in biomedical responses
- System improves factual precision by grounding responses in verified clinical evidence from AMD literature
- Enhanced response clarity and reliability demonstrated through experimental evaluation with medical abstracts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate creates a hybrid system where parametric knowledge (LLM) is augmented with structured, verifiable knowledge (knowledge graph). DeepSeek-R1 provides the generative capability and natural language understanding, while Weaviate offers efficient semantic search and retrieval of relevant medical facts. The knowledge graph structure ensures that retrieved information maintains relationships and context, enabling more accurate and coherent responses. This approach addresses the fundamental limitation of LLMs where responses may be fluent but factually incorrect, by providing a mechanism to cross-reference claims against structured medical knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Understanding how to extract and structure medical knowledge from unstructured text is essential for creating a reliable knowledge base. Quick check: Verify that extracted entities and relationships maintain semantic accuracy and coverage of relevant medical concepts.
- **Vector Database Operations**: Familiarity with Weaviate's vector indexing and semantic search capabilities is crucial for efficient retrieval. Quick check: Test retrieval precision by measuring relevance of top-k results for various medical queries.
- **RAG Architecture Principles**: Understanding how to integrate retrieval mechanisms with LLM generation is fundamental to the approach. Quick check: Validate that retrieved knowledge effectively grounds LLM responses by measuring hallucination reduction.
- **Biomedical NLP Techniques**: Knowledge of domain-specific named entity recognition and relation extraction methods is required for processing medical literature. Quick check: Evaluate extraction accuracy against manually annotated medical abstracts.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Medical Abstract -> NLP Extraction -> Knowledge Graph -> Weaviate Vector DB -> Semantic Retrieval -> DeepSeek-R1 -> Chatbot Response

**Critical Path**: The system processes user queries by first performing semantic search in Weaviate to retrieve relevant medical facts, then feeding these facts to DeepSeek-R1 for response generation, ensuring all responses are grounded in verified clinical evidence.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture prioritizes accuracy and factual reliability over response speed, accepting the computational overhead of knowledge graph maintenance and semantic search. This tradeoff is justified in biomedical applications where precision is critical, but may limit real-time interaction capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failures include incomplete knowledge graph coverage leading to retrieval gaps, semantic search returning irrelevant results due to vector similarity mismatches, and LLM generation that fails to properly incorporate retrieved facts. Performance degradation typically manifests as increased hallucination rates or irrelevant responses.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test retrieval accuracy by querying known medical facts and measuring precision of top-5 retrieved results
2. Evaluate hallucination reduction by comparing LLM responses with and without knowledge graph grounding on clinical questions
3. Measure response quality improvements by conducting blinded evaluation of chatbot responses against traditional LLM-only approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) literature, raising generalizability concerns for other medical domains
- Performance metrics focus on response clarity and precision without quantitative benchmarks against baseline RAG systems
- Computational overhead of knowledge graph maintenance and querying not addressed, critical for real-world deployment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of DeepSeek-R1 and Weaviate integration for knowledge graph-driven retrieval is well-established; methodology follows established NLP practices for medical text processing
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about hallucination reduction and improved factual precision supported by experimental setup but lack quantitative comparisons against alternative approaches
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability claims for broader biomedical applications are speculative given single-domain focus on AMD; "robust solution" characterization extends beyond demonstrated evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing the framework on multiple medical specialties (e.g., oncology, cardiology) to assess generalizability beyond AMD literature
2. Implement quantitative benchmarking against standard RAG approaches using metrics such as response accuracy rates, hallucination frequency, and retrieval precision scores across multiple evaluation datasets
3. Perform deployment analysis measuring computational overhead, query response times, and resource utilization to establish practical feasibility for clinical settings
