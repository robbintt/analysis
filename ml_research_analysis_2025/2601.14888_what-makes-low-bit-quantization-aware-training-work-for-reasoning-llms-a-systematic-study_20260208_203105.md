# What Makes Low-Bit Quantization-Aware Training Work for Reasoning LLMs? A Systematic Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14888
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14888
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: KD is optimal for low-bit QAT; PTQ initialization accelerates; RL requires KD cold-start; domain alignment helps; Reasoning-QAT outperforms PTQ/QAT baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning large language models under low-bit quantization (2-3 bits). Through controlled experiments on R1-Qwen and Qwen3 models, it identifies knowledge distillation as the optimal training objective for recovering reasoning performance, with PTQ initialization providing faster convergence and reinforcement learning requiring a KD cold-start to succeed. The proposed Reasoning-QAT workflow combines these insights and achieves significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods, particularly on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The method follows a three-stage Reasoning-QAT workflow: (1) PTQ initialization using GPTQ with Hessian-based weight compensation on calibration data, (2) KD recovery via KL divergence minimization to full-precision teacher on OpenR1-Math dataset, and (3) GRPO-based RL with correctness rewards applied only after KD convergence. The approach targets weight-only quantization (W3G128/W2G128) and weight-activation quantization (W4A4KV4), using asymmetric quantization with group size 128 and excluding embeddings/lm_head from quantization. Training employs cosine learning rate decay with warmup, batch sizes of 32-64, and evaluates on multiple reasoning benchmarks.

## Key Results
- KD outperforms SFT as QAT objective, achieving smaller accuracy drops across both SFT and RL-trained base models under 3-bit quantization.
- GPTQ initialization accelerates convergence and improves final accuracy compared to RTN initialization, starting from higher initial test accuracy and lower loss.
- RL requires KD cold-start; direct RL on heavily quantized models collapses completely, while KD cold-start improves accuracy by ~46%.
- Aligning PTQ calibration domain with QAT training domain accelerates convergence and boosts accuracy, preventing harmful readjustment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge distillation (KD) is the preferred QAT objective for low-bit reasoning models over supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- Mechanism: KD aligns output distributions between the quantized student and full-precision teacher via KL divergence, preserving uncertainty structure and providing smoother gradient signals. Hard-label SFT discards distributional information, making recovery under quantization noise harder.
- Core assumption: The teacher's output distribution contains recoverable signal that survives quantization-induced perturbation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Knowledge distillation (KD) is the optimal objective for low-bit QAT, providing stable recovery across both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms."
  - [section 3.2] "KD yields smaller accuracy drops than SFT on both an SFT-trained model (R1-Qwen-1.5B) and an RL-trained model (Qwen3-4B) under W3G128."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence on KD vs. SFT for reasoning; neighbor papers (DL-QAT, BitDistiller) use distillation but do not systematically compare objectives.
- Break condition: If the teacher model itself has degraded reasoning capability or if the quantization budget drops below a representation threshold where distribution matching becomes impossible.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PTQ initialization (e.g., GPTQ) provides a stronger starting point for QAT than random or round-to-nearest (RTN) initialization.
- Mechanism: PTQ methods like GPTQ perform Hessian-based weight compensation during quantization, reducing initial quantization error. This positions QAT closer to a viable solution, reducing the optimization burden and accelerating convergence.
- Core assumption: The PTQ calibration set is representative of the target distribution; Hessian-based compensation generalizes beyond calibration data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PTQ initialization improves efficiency and accuracy."
  - [section 3.3] "GPTQ+KD starts from a higher starting point (higher test accuracy and lower loss)... exhibits a faster convergence rate within the same number of training steps."
  - [corpus] PTQTP (arXiv:2509.16989) corroborates that PTQ at ultra-low bits remains challenging without training-based recovery.
- Break condition: If PTQ calibration data is severely mismatched to the target domain, initialization may anchor to a poor local basin.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reinforcement learning requires a KD cold-start; direct RL on heavily quantized models collapses.
- Mechanism: RTN-quantized models suffer severe sampling degradation—they fail to generate valid reasoning trajectories, making reward signals sparse or uninformative. KD recovers sufficient sampling capability to provide exploitable reward density for RL (GRPO).
- Core assumption: Reward signals are contingent on the model producing syntactically and semantically valid outputs; quantization noise destroys this capability below a threshold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RL yields further gains only after a KD cold start."
  - [section 3.4] "Zero-RL QAT collapses completely, whereas the cold-start setting improves accuracy by approximately 46%."
  - [corpus] "The Impact of Quantization on Large Reasoning Model Reinforcement Learning" (arXiv:2511.15694) directly studies quantization-RL interaction but does not establish the cold-start requirement.
- Break condition: If reward design is too sparse or if the KD recovery is insufficient to produce rewardable outputs, RL will still fail.

### Mechanism 4
- Claim: Aligning PTQ calibration domain with QAT training domain accelerates convergence and improves final accuracy.
- Mechanism: Domain alignment prevents harmful readjustment where the model must unlearn PTQ-calibrated weights to adapt to a mismatched training distribution. Consistent domains allow incremental refinement rather than destructive relearning.
- Core assumption: Calibration data and training data share sufficient statistical structure that quantization error patterns transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Aligning the PTQ calibration and QAT training domains accelerates convergence and boosts accuracy."
  - [section 3.5] "When calibration and training domains match, the curve converges much earlier... mismatched combinations stabilize slowly."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on domain alignment for QAT; this is a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If the target deployment domain differs from both calibration and training domains, generalization may still suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Quantization fundamentals (PTQ vs. QAT, weight-only vs. weight-activation)**
  - Why needed here: The paper operates at 3-bit and 2-bit weight-only quantization (W3G128, W2G128). Understanding the quantization equation (Eq. 1), scaling factors, and the straight-through estimator (STE) is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given a weight matrix W, can you compute the quantized representation W_int for 3-bit symmetric quantization and explain why STE is needed for backpropagation?

- **Knowledge distillation mechanics (KL divergence, teacher-student)**
  - Why needed here: KD is the core recovery objective. You must understand why soft targets preserve inter-class relationships better than hard labels.
  - Quick check question: Why would minimizing KL divergence between teacher and student distributions be more robust to quantization noise than cross-entropy on ground-truth labels?

- **Reinforcement learning for LLMs (GRPO, policy gradients, reward shaping)**
  - Why needed here: The cold-start RL phase uses GRPO. Understanding why RL requires viable sampling is critical to grasping the failure mode.
  - Quick check question: What happens to policy gradient estimates if the policy cannot generate valid outputs that receive positive reward?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - PTQ Initialization (GPTQ) -> KD Recovery -> Cold-Start RL (GRPO)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Calibration data selection (NuminaMath-1.5 aligned with OpenR1-Math).
  2. PTQ initialization quality (GPTQ > RTN, but FlatQuant required for W4A4KV4).
  3. KD training to viable policy (must reach sufficient sampling capability).
  4. RL only after KD convergence; skip if KD recovery is incomplete.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - PTQ method: GPTQ is efficient but may retain outliers; FlatQuant adds transformation matrices for activation quantization but increases complexity.
  - Training objective: KD is slower per-step than SFT but converges faster in total steps.
  - Bit-width: 3-bit is recoverable with moderate effort; 2-bit requires full workflow and still leaves 20%+ gap to BF16 on some benchmarks.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Zero-RL QAT: Complete collapse (AIME-120: 0%, MATH-500: ~15%) due to invalid sampling.
  - Domain mismatch: Sharp accuracy drop during early training, slow recovery, failure to exceed PTQ baseline.
  - W4A4KV4 without outlier suppression (RTN init): Training divergence, near-zero accuracy across all benchmarks.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Table 1 on R1-Qwen-1.5B (W3G128): Compare SFT vs. KD recovery. Validate that KD achieves <10% average drop while SFT exceeds 10%.
  2. Ablate PTQ initialization: Run RTN+KD vs. GPTQ+KD on MATH-500 for 2k steps. Plot loss and accuracy curves to confirm faster convergence with GPTQ.
  3. Test cold-start requirement: Apply GRPO directly to RTN-quantized model (zero-RL) and confirm collapse; then apply GRPO after KD and verify recovery (target: 46%+ improvement over zero-RL baseline).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-domain generalization to other reasoning tasks (e.g., coding and science) remains limited, particularly for smaller models under extreme low-bit settings.** The study primarily uses OpenR1-Math dataset and evaluates mostly on mathematical benchmarks, leaving unclear whether findings transfer to non-mathematical reasoning domains.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation on non-mathematical reasoning domains (coding, science) despite testing on some benchmarks.
- Underspecified GRPO reward formulation, critical for understanding RL recovery mechanism.
- Does not identify systematic bit-width threshold below which KD recovery becomes insufficient.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Knowledge distillation is the optimal QAT objective (supported by direct ablation across two model scales and training paradigms).

**Medium Confidence:** PTQ initialization accelerates convergence (supported by empirical convergence curves, though Hessian generalization beyond calibration data remains unverified).

**Medium Confidence:** RL requires KD cold-start (supported by dramatic failure of zero-RL, though reward formulation details are underspecified).

**Low Confidence:** Domain alignment mechanism (lacks ablation studies on calibration data diversity and transferability).

## Next Checks

1. **Reward formulation ablation:** Implement and compare three reward schemes for GRPO: (a) binary correctness, (b) step-level partial credit for intermediate reasoning, (c) formatted response bonus. Measure impact on RL recovery efficiency and final accuracy.

2. **Calibration domain stress test:** Train Reasoning-QAT with PTQ initialization using three calibration sets: (a) aligned (NuminaMath-1.5), (b) generic (Wikitext2), (c) mismatched (different reasoning corpus). Evaluate on both in-domain (MATH-500) and out-of-domain (LiveCodeBench) benchmarks to quantify domain alignment benefits and transferability limits.

3. **Bit-width threshold exploration:** Systematically evaluate Reasoning-QAT workflow at W4G128, W3G128, W2G128, W2G4, and W1G2. Measure recovery ratio (quantized accuracy / full-precision accuracy) to identify the minimum bit-width where KD recovery remains effective, and determine whether alternative objectives (e.g., SFT with temperature scaling) become necessary below this threshold.
