# Agentic LLM Framework for Adaptive Decision Discourse

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.10978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10978
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Multi-agent LLM framework produces adaptive, risk-calibrated recommendations through stakeholder discourse simulation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an agentic LLM framework that simulates decision discourse for complex, uncertain challenges by deploying specialized persona agents representing diverse stakeholder perspectives. Using a hypothetical extreme flooding scenario in a Midwestern township, the framework dynamically adapts recommendations as flood risk probability increases, shifting from preventive to reactive strategies. Results show coherent and context-aware responses, including evacuation, infrastructure protection, and community support, demonstrating the framework's ability to navigate competing priorities and uncertainty. The approach advances AI-driven collaborative decision-making for high-stakes scenarios.

## Method Summary
The framework uses off-the-shelf GPT-4 via API with stateless agents managed at the macro-scale through a virtual conference room orchestrating turn-based discourse. Initial assembly includes personas for Mayor, Environmental Scientist (with Chain-of-Thought prompting), Community Advocate/Spokesperson, and Moderator. Agents receive full conversation history each turn and can dynamically summon new specialists when expertise gaps are identified. The system executed 15 times per probability setting (50%, 75%, 90%) with recommendations categorized post-hoc using GPT-4o with human refinement.

## Key Results
- Framework produced coherent discourse with multiple stakeholder perspectives on extreme flooding scenarios
- Recommendations shifted qualitatively from preventive strategies at 50% risk to evacuation-focused approaches at 75-90% risk
- Agents successfully summoned complementary personas (hydrologists summoned 7-8 times across runs) to fill expertise gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Persona-Based Knowledge Partitioning
Specialized persona prompts restrict each agent's accessible knowledge space, creating non-redundant perspectives that monolithic LLMs cannot simultaneously simulate. Each agent receives a persona prompt defining role, expertise boundaries, and value-driven priorities, creating "disjoint knowledge subspace restrictions" that force differentiated contributions during discourse.

### Mechanism 2: Self-Governance via Dynamic Agent Summoning
Agents identify expertise gaps mid-discourse and summon complementary personas, enabling adaptive assembly optimization without manual intervention. During discourse, if an agent judges the assembly lacks necessary expertise, it formulates a description for a new persona, which is then generated and registered.

### Mechanism 3: Risk-Calibrated Recommendation Shift
The framework produces qualitatively different recommendation distributions as input risk probability changes, shifting from preventive to reactive strategies. Scenario prompt includes a probability parameter (50%, 75%, 90%) that agents internalize, producing more evacuation/reactive recommendations at higher probabilities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Partial Information Decomposition (PID)**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames agent interactions through information theory—unique, redundant, and synergistic knowledge. Understanding how agent contributions combine helps diagnose whether discourse is productive (synergistic) or repetitive (redundant).
  - Quick check question: Given two agents discussing flood response, can you identify what insight emerges only from their interaction (synergistic) vs. what either could produce alone?

- **Concept: Persona Prompt Patterns**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on persona prompts to constrain agent behavior. Understanding prompt engineering—how instruction ordering, specificity, and formatting affect compliance—is essential for designing stable personas.
  - Quick check question: If an agent repeatedly ignores its persona constraints during long conversations, what prompt modifications might help?

- **Concept: Stateless LLM APIs and Memory Management**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes LLM APIs are stateless; conversation memory must be managed at the macro-scale. Understanding token limits, context window management, and summarization strategies is critical for scaling discourse length.
  - Quick check question: If a 50-turn conversation exceeds the LLM's context window, what strategies could preserve key decisions without re-sending the full history?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Scenario prompt -> Macro-scale orchestrator (agent registration, conversation history, turn-taking) -> Individual LLM agents (with persona prompts) -> Extraction layer (parses responses for addressee, content, summon requests) -> Moderator agent (periodic analysis)

- **Critical path:** 1) Scenario prompt initializes context 2) Initial assembly created 3) Turn loop: orchestrator selects speaker → agent receives conversation + persona prompt → agent generates response → extractor parses → conversation log updated → check for summon requests → repeat until convergence 4) Summarizer agent produces final recommendation report

- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed vs. dynamic assembly (predictable vs. expertise coverage); Turn selection (random vs. addressed); Conversation memory (full vs. summarized)

- **Failure signatures:** Persona drift (agents ignore constraints in long conversations); Redundant discourse (high overlap in agent contributions); Moderator over-intervention (disrupting organic flow); Hallucinated expertise (scientist making unverified claims)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Persona boundary test: Run 10-turn discourse with two agents having overlapping personas, measure response redundancy via embedding similarity
  2. Summoning quality test: Have human evaluators rate relevance and value of summoned personas across varying complexity levels
  3. Risk calibration test: Run flooding scenario at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% probability with identical assembly, measure distribution shift in recommendation categories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can reliable, automated metrics be established to evaluate the semantic validity and decision quality of agentic LLM discourse?
- Can multi-agent interactions generate "synergistic knowledge" that is mathematically inaccessible to monolithic LLMs?
- Can a retrieval-augmented fact-checker agent effectively mitigate hallucinations in scientific decision-making contexts?
- What testing methodologies are required to ensure the stability of self-governing agent personas and their dynamic assembly expansion?

## Limitations

- Framework effectiveness heavily depends on persona prompt quality and specificity, which are not provided in the paper
- Risk-calibrated recommendation shifts lack statistical significance testing and may be influenced by LLM guardrails
- Self-governance mechanism's reliability is uncertain since agent-generated persona prompts are not validated against expert-designed alternatives

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Basic architecture of stateless agents with macro-scale memory management is well-established
- **Medium Confidence:** Persona-based knowledge partitioning mechanism works as described, though degree of non-redundancy depends on prompt specificity
- **Low Confidence:** Self-governance mechanism's effectiveness and causal relationship between input risk probability and output recommendations require further validation

## Next Checks

1. Run flooding scenario at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% probability levels with 30 independent executions each, apply chi-square tests to verify recommendation distribution differences are statistically significant
2. Execute 100-turn discourses and measure persona adherence decay using embedding similarity between agent responses and their initial persona descriptions at 10-turn intervals
3. Have domain experts blind to the summoning mechanism rate relevance and added value of all summoned personas across 50 discourse runs, comparing agent-generated persona prompts against expert-crafted prompts
