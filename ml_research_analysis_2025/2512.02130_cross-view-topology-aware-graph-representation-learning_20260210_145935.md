core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of graph classification by integrating
  structural and topological information through a dual-view contrastive learning
  framework called GraphTCL. The method combines embeddings from a GNN (for local
  structural patterns) and persistent homology (for global topological features) by
  aligning them in a shared latent space using a cross-view contrastive loss.

# Cross-View Topology-Aware Graph Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02130
- Reference count: 31
- Outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs by up to 6% on graph classification benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework for graph classification that aligns structural embeddings from GNNs with topological features from persistent homology. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven TU datasets and five OGB molecular datasets by enforcing consistency between GNN-based structural representations and HKS-based topological embeddings. GraphTCL demonstrates relative improvements of up to 6% over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the crucial role of contrastive alignment in maximizing performance.

## Method Summary
GraphTCL combines GNN structural embeddings with persistent homology topological features through a cross-view contrastive learning framework. The method uses GIN/GCN encoders to extract local structural patterns, computes HKS-based persistent homology features at 10 filtration scales, and aligns these dual-view embeddings in a shared latent space using bidirectional InfoNCE contrastive loss. The joint objective balances classification accuracy with contrastive alignment, with the GIN encoder using learnable epsilon parameters and global mean pooling, while PH features are processed through a 2-layer MLP before fusion.

## Key Results
- Achieves highest accuracy on six out of seven TU benchmark datasets, with up to 6% relative improvement
- Improves over standard GIN and GCN by average of 3.7 percentage points on OGB molecular datasets
- Ablation studies confirm contrastive alignment is crucial for maximizing performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-view approach captures complementary information: GNNs learn local structural patterns while persistent homology encodes global topological features invariant to graph isomorphism. The contrastive alignment enforces consistency between these views, preventing information loss during fusion and enabling the model to leverage both local connectivity and global topological structure for improved graph classification.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks**: Learn node representations by aggregating neighbor information through message passing. Needed for extracting local structural patterns that capture graph connectivity and node relationships.

**Persistent Homology**: Computes topological features across multiple scales by tracking connected components, loops, and voids in filtrations. Needed to capture global structural properties invariant to graph isomorphism and sensitive to connectivity patterns.

**Contrastive Learning**: Aligns embeddings from different views by maximizing agreement between positive pairs while minimizing similarity with negatives. Needed to enforce consistency between structural and topological representations without losing complementary information.

**HKS Filtration**: Uses Heat Kernel Signatures to create graph filtrations based on diffusion processes. Needed to generate meaningful persistence diagrams that capture both local and global topological features.

**InfoNCE Loss**: Bidirectional contrastive objective that aligns dual-view embeddings through mutual information maximization. Needed to ensure both structural and topological views inform each other during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph -> GNN Encoder -> z_i -> MLP Classifier; Graph -> HKS Filtration -> Persistence Diagrams -> PH Encoder -> u_i -> Concat(z_i, u_i) -> MLP Fusion -> Class Prediction and Contrastive Alignment

**Critical Path**: Graph data flows through both GNN and PH encoders in parallel, then their embeddings are concatenated and processed through a fusion MLP that outputs both classification logits and L2-normalized projection vectors for contrastive alignment.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances computational complexity (persistent homology computation) against performance gains from incorporating topological information. The choice of α = 0.1 for the joint loss reflects a tradeoff between classification accuracy and contrastive alignment strength.

**Failure Signatures**: If contrastive loss dominates classification loss, the model may overfit to alignment at the expense of discriminative power. If PH features are poorly aligned with GNN embeddings, the fusion module cannot effectively combine complementary information.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify HKS-based persistence diagram computation on small graphs and visualize resulting topological features
2. Test bidirectional InfoNCE with different temperature values to find optimal contrastive alignment
3. Run ablation study comparing single-view (GNN-only or PH-only) vs dual-view performance on a simple dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Several critical hyperparameters unspecified (contrastive loss temperature τ, batch size B, PH vectorization method, training epochs)
- Computational overhead of persistent homology computation not discussed, potentially limiting scalability
- Performance gains more pronounced on smaller TU datasets than larger OGB molecular graphs

## Confidence
- **High** in overall methodology and empirical claims due to systematic baseline comparisons and ablation studies
- **Medium** in exact numerical results due to unspecified contrastive learning hyperparameters
- **Low** in computational efficiency claims due to lack of runtime or memory analysis

## Next Checks
1. Verify contrastive loss stability by testing multiple temperature values (τ ∈ [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]) and monitoring classification vs contrastive loss trade-off
2. Benchmark HKS filtration computation time on OGB graphs (molsider has ~4k nodes) to assess scalability limitations
3. Compare persistence image/vectorization dimension sensitivity by testing different PH feature dimensions and evaluating impact on downstream accuracy
