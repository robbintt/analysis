## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16345
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16345
- Authors: Blake Matheny; Phuong Minh Nguyen; Minh Le Nguyen; Stephanie Reynolds
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces PIFL-OSCAR (5.8M potential idioms) and IFL-OSCAR-A (1.3K human-annotated idioms), with BERT-based models achieving 91.51% sequence accuracy on MAGPIE.

## Executive Summary
This research introduces three new datasets to advance idiom and figurative language detection in NLP. The PIFL-OSCAR dataset contains 5.8 million entries of potential idiomatic expressions, while IFL-OSCAR-A and IFL-C4-A provide 1,300 human-annotated examples for training and evaluation. These datasets were created by retrieving context sequences from Common Crawl, post-processing with POS tags, BIO labels, and BERT-based similarity metrics, and refining through human annotation. Baseline experiments using BERT-based models achieved state-of-the-art sequence accuracy of 91.51% on the MAGPIE dataset, with cross-evaluation showing PIFL-OSCAR's superior generalizability. Chat-based LLMs like Gemma-3 and Llama3.1 performed poorly, highlighting the need for specialized models.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed PIFL-OSCAR by retrieving context sequences from Common Crawl that matched idiom lists from existing datasets (MAGPIE, FLUTE, EPIE, LIdioms). The data underwent post-processing with POS tagging, BIO labeling, and BERT-based similarity metrics. Human annotation refined the results, creating IFL-OSCAR-A and IFL-C4-A. BERT-based models were fine-tuned for sequence labeling (B-idiom, I-idiom, O) and evaluated on MAGPIE and SemEval 2022 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Chat-based LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting but showed poor results.

## Key Results
- BERT-based models achieved 91.51% sequence accuracy on MAGPIE, state-of-the-art performance
- PIFL-OSCAR (5.8M entries) demonstrated superior generalizability across cross-dataset evaluations
- Chat-based LLMs (Gemma-3, Llama3.1) performed poorly on zero-shot slot tagging, underscoring need for specialized models
- Sequence accuracy metric (strict BIO tag matching) proved most reliable for evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Large-Scale Data Construction from Common Crawl
Large-scale, diverse datasets created from large web corpora can improve model generalizability for idiomatic and figurative language detection. The study combines existing idiom lists from prior datasets and retrieves matching sequences from the OSCAR and C4 filters of Common Crawl. This process generates the large PIFL-OSCAR dataset (5.8 million entries) containing potential idiomatic/figurative expressions. This scale and diversity, derived from recent vernacular on the web, provide a broader training signal compared to smaller, more curated datasets.

### Mechanism 2: Sequence Labeling with Pre-trained Contextual Embeddings
Framing idiom detection as a sequence labeling task and fine-tuning BERT-based models achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in sequence accuracy. The task is defined as assigning a label (B-idiom, I-idiom, O) to each token in a sentence. A pre-trained BERT model provides contextualized embeddings for each token. These embeddings are passed through a simple classification layer (Dense + softmax) which is trained on the annotated data. The model learns to recognize the span of tokens that form an idiomatic expression based on their context.

### Mechanism 3: Poor Performance of Chat-based LLMs on Zero-Shot Slot Tagging
Despite their general capabilities, chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) perform poorly on idiom detection when prompted in a zero-shot manner for slot tagging. LLMs like Gemma-3, Llama3.1, etc., were prompted with a simple instruction to perform slot tagging. The paper suggests their failure stems from an inability to follow the strict formatting and reasoning required for token-level sequence labeling without explicit, task-specific fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Sequence Labeling / Slot Tagging**: The task of assigning a categorical label to each token in a sequence. Here, labels are `B-idiom`, `I-idiom`, `O`. Why needed: This is the core task formulation used to achieve the paper's state-of-the-art results. Understanding it is essential for replicating the architecture and evaluation. Quick check: How would you label the sentence "The bottom line is we value our customers"?

**Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models**: Using a model (like BERT) already trained on a massive general-purpose corpus and adapting it to a specific downstream task (idiom detection) via fine-tuning. Why needed: The entire approach relies on leveraging the rich contextual embeddings from BERT, which captures general linguistic knowledge, and specializing it for idiom detection with the created datasets. Quick check: Why is it more effective to fine-tune BERT than to train a sequence labeling model from scratch?

**Non-compositional Language**: Expressions (like idioms) whose meaning cannot be derived from the meanings of their individual parts. Why needed: This is the fundamental linguistic phenomenon the paper addresses. It explains why idioms are a hard problem for models that might rely on compositional interpretation. Quick check: Is "New York" a compositional or non-compositional phrase? What about "kick the bucket"?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Tokenized text sequence -> BERT tokenizer -> Pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa encoder -> Token embeddings -> Dense classification head with softmax -> Probability distribution over {B-idiom, I-idiom, O}

**Critical path**: 
1. Prepare data in required format: `seq.in` (sentence), `seq.out` (BIO tags), `seq.pos` (optional)
2. Initialize a pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model from a library like Hugging Face Transformers
3. Add a token classification head on top of the BERT encoder
4. Fine-tune the entire model on a training dataset (e.g., PIFL-OSCAR) using Cross-Entropy loss
5. Evaluate on a test set using metrics like sequence accuracy and F1 score

**Design tradeoffs**:
- **PIFL-OSCAR vs. IFL-OSCAR-A**: The large PIFL-OSCAR has more data but is noisier (contains "potential" idioms). The smaller IFL-OSCAR-A is clean (human-annotated) but has fewer examples. The paper shows training on PIFL-OSCAR generalizes better.
- **BERT vs. RoBERTa**: The paper found `bert-base-uncased` outperformed `roberta-base` on this specific task and datasets. This is a key implementation detail to note.
- **Chat LLM vs. Fine-tuned Encoder**: Using a chat LLM is simpler to implement (just prompting) but was shown to be ineffective. Fine-tuning a smaller encoder is more complex but yields far superior results.

**Failure signatures**:
- **Over-labeling**: Model tags too many words as part of the idiom (e.g., `[California] can lead the way [by trying]`). Suggests the model is not learning the precise boundaries.
- **Under-labeling / Missed Detection**: Model fails to tag any part of an idiom (returns all `O` tags). Suggests the model has not learned the feature patterns for that idiom type.
- **Poor Generalization**: A model trained on one dataset (e.g., FLUTE) performs poorly when evaluated on another (e.g., MAGPIE). The paper highlights this and recommends PIFL-OSCAR for its generalization capability.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. **Reproduce Baseline**: Fine-tune `bert-base-uncased` on the provided PIFL-OSCAR dataset and evaluate on the MAGPIE random test split to verify the reported ~91.5% sequence accuracy.
2. **Ablation on Data Source**: Train separate BERT models on PIFL-OSCAR, IFL-OSCAR-A, and MAGPIE. Cross-evaluate each model on the test sets of the *other* datasets to empirically verify the paper's claim about PIFL-OSCAR's superior generalizability.
3. **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Take a failing LLM (e.g., Gemma-3) and experiment with different few-shot prompting strategies or Chain-of-Thought instructions to see if performance on the slot tagging task can be improved, or if the failure is more fundamental as the paper suggests.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Future Dataset Enhancements**: Future iterations of this dataset could incorporate a confidence metric representing the probability of idiomaticity for each instance.

**Multilingual Extension**: Extending the dataset to include multilingual variants would enhance its generalizability across languages and enable broader cross-linguistic analyses.

**Model Architecture**: The results for chat LLMs, particularly the near zero precision and recall, highlight a potential limitation of general-purpose models for idiom detection. These findings underscore the importance of developing specialized models tailored to this task.

## Limitations

**Data Quality and Noise**: The PIFL-OSCAR dataset contains 5.8 million "potential" idiomatic expressions, but these are not all verified as true idioms. The trade-off between scale and precision remains an open question for practical applications.

**Generalization Scope**: While the paper claims PIFL-OSCAR shows superior generalizability, this evaluation was limited to specific test sets. The extent to which these models generalize to idioms in specialized domains or different dialects is untested.

**LLM Evaluation Limitations**: The poor performance of chat-based LLMs was tested only with zero-shot prompting. The evaluation also used 4-bit quantized models, which may have impacted performance.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core findings about BERT-based models achieving state-of-the-art sequence accuracy (91.51% on MAGPIE) and the superiority of PIFL-OSCAR for generalization are well-supported by experimental results presented in the paper.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that PIFL-OSCAR's large scale compensates for its noise level is reasonable but not definitively proven. The paper shows it generalizes better than smaller curated datasets, but doesn't directly compare performance when training on equivalent amounts of verified idiom data versus the noisy PIFL-OSCAR.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that chat-based LLMs are fundamentally unsuited for idiom detection based solely on zero-shot prompting results is too strong. The evaluation methodology doesn't explore the full space of possible prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches that might reveal different conclusions.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Evaluate models trained on PIFL-OSCAR across diverse text domains (academic papers, legal documents, technical manuals, social media) to quantify actual generalization limits and identify which idiom types or contexts fail to transfer.

2. **Noise Impact Analysis**: Create a controlled experiment comparing model performance when trained on: (a) verified idiom data of equivalent size to IFL-OSCAR-A, (b) PIFL-OSCAR, and (c) PIFL-OSCAR with confidence-weighted training where uncertain examples are down-weighted. This would directly test whether scale truly compensates for noise.

3. **LLM Capability Boundary Testing**: Systematically test Gemma-3 and Llama3.1 with: (a) few-shot prompting with 5-10 examples, (b) chain-of-thought reasoning prompts, (c) fine-tuning on a small subset of the idiom detection task, and (d) comparison with smaller, fine-tuned encoder models to establish whether the poor performance is fundamental or prompt-dependent.
