# ZTFed-MAS2S: A Zero-Trust Federated Learning Framework with Verifiable Privacy and Trust-Aware Aggregation for Wind Power Data Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18318
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18318
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: ZTFed-MAS2S achieves up to 42.28% lower RMSE under 90% missing rates compared to Transformer baselines while reducing communication overhead by at least 61.17% compared to homomorphic encryption and threshold secret sharing approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses missing data imputation in wind power datasets where sensor faults and unstable transmission at edge sites lead to frequent data gaps. The proposed ZTFed-MAS2S framework combines federated learning with verifiable differential privacy, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and dynamic trust-aware aggregation to ensure privacy preservation and robustness in a zero-trust environment. The core method integrates a multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence model (MAS2S) for accurate imputation of wind power data while reducing communication overhead through sparsity and quantization. Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets show that ZTFed-MAS2S outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

## Method Summary
ZTFed-MAS2S is a federated learning framework that performs missing data imputation for wind power time series. It uses a MAS2S model (Bi-LSTM encoder with LSTM decoder enhanced by multi-head attention) for accurate imputation, applies differential privacy with verifiable NIZK proofs for privacy preservation, and employs dynamic trust-aware aggregation (DTAA) with similarity graphs and MAD-based outlier detection for robustness. The system compresses model parameters via sparsity and quantization to reduce communication overhead. The framework is evaluated on the NREL wind toolkit dataset with hybrid discrete/continuous missing patterns up to 90% missing rates.

## Key Results
- ZTFed-MAS2S achieves 42.28% lower RMSE than Transformer under 90% missing rates (0.0411 vs 0.0712)
- Reduces communication overhead by at least 61.17% compared to homomorphic encryption and threshold secret sharing baselines
- DTAA with MAD exclusion outperforms MultiKrum and T-Mean by 28% and 17% respectively under sign-flipping attacks with 50% adversary ratio
- DP-NIZK+CIV achieves comparable RMSE (0.0384) to standard DP (0.0379) while adding verifiability and secure transmission

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence (MAS2S) model captures long-term temporal dependencies in wind power data, enabling accurate imputation even under extreme missing rates (up to 90%).
- **Mechanism:** A Bi-LSTM encoder processes input sequences bidirectionally to capture global temporal context, producing hidden states. The LSTM decoder, enhanced with multi-head attention, selectively attends to relevant encoder hidden states when generating each output timestep. This allows the model to leverage distant but correlated observations when imputing missing values, rather than relying solely on local context.
- **Core assumption:** Wind power data exhibits temporal correlations and dependencies across both short and long time horizons that can be learned and exploited for imputation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind power data for accurate imputation."
  - [Section II.A, Eq. 8-12] Describes the attention mechanism computation: query, key, value projections and weighted context vector generation.
  - [Table V] Under 90% missing rate, ZTFed-MAS2S achieves RMSE of 0.0411 vs. 0.0712 for Transformer (42.28% improvement).
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence on MAS2S specifically; related work "Federated Markov Imputation" addresses temporal imputation in FL but uses Markovian assumptions rather than attention.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Integrating differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (DP-NIZK) enables verifiable privacy preservation without a trusted server assumption.
- **Mechanism:** Clients apply Gaussian noise to clipped model parameters according to DP sensitivity analysis. Rather than trusting clients to apply noise correctly, each client generates a NIZK proof demonstrating that noise was sampled from the correct distribution using a committed random seed. The server verifies the proof (Eq. 24: *g^rs mod p = tk · h^cs mod p*) without learning the noise seed or original parameters, confirming correct DP application before aggregation.
- **Core assumption:** The cryptographic primitives (discrete log problem hardness, collision-resistant hash functions) remain unbroken, and clients cannot forge valid NIZK proofs for incorrect noise application.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "ZTFed integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs... to ensure verifiable privacy preservation."
  - [Section II.B.1, Eq. 15-24] Details the DP mechanism, sensitivity computation, and NIZK proof construction/verification.
  - [Table III] DP-NIZK+CIV achieves comparable RMSE (0.0384) to standard DP (0.0379) while adding verifiability and secure transmission.
  - [corpus] "VFEFL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning against Malicious Clients via Verifiable Functional Encryption" addresses similar verifiable FL challenges but uses functional encryption rather than NIZK.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dynamic Trust-Aware Aggregation (DTAA) enhances robustness against anomalous or malicious clients by propagating trust scores over a similarity graph and excluding outliers before aggregation.
- **Mechanism:** Cosine similarity between client model parameters forms pairwise trust scores, which are sharpened and pruned to create a sparse directed trust graph (each client links to top-*k* most similar neighbors). Trust scores are iteratively propagated with damping (Eq. 31). The Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) identifies clients with anomalously low trust scores for exclusion. Final aggregation uses median (not mean) over trusted clients, providing breakdown point robustness.
- **Core assumption:** Malicious clients produce model updates that are systematically dissimilar from honest clients' updates, and this dissimilarity is detectable via cosine similarity in parameter space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "A dynamic trust-aware aggregation mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to enhance robustness."
  - [Section II.B.3, Eq. 28-34] Describes similarity computation, trust graph construction, propagation, and MAD-based anomaly detection.
  - [Fig. 5] Under sign-flipping attacks with P=0.5 anomaly rate, DTAA achieves ~28% lower RMSE than MultiKrum and ~17% lower than T-Mean.
  - [corpus] "Tri-LLM Cooperative Federated Zero-Shot Intrusion Detection with Semantic Disagreement and Trust-Aware Aggregation" employs trust-aware aggregation for FL, validating the general approach.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Federated Learning (FL) Fundamentals**
  - **Why needed here:** ZTFed-MAS2S operates in a federated setting where wind farms (clients) train locally and share only model parameters. Understanding local training, synchronization intervals, and aggregation is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why FedAvg (simple averaging) fails under adversarial clients, and why robust aggregation rules like MultiKrum or median-based methods are needed?

- **Concept: Differential Privacy (DP) Mechanisms**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework adds calibrated Gaussian noise to parameters for privacy. Understanding sensitivity, privacy budget (ε, δ), and the privacy-utility tradeoff is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a clipping threshold τ and dataset size, can you compute the local sensitivity and determine the required noise standard deviation σ for a target (ε, δ)-DP guarantee?

- **Concept: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
  - **Why needed here:** NIZK enables the server to verify correct noise application without learning the client's private seed. Basic understanding of commitment schemes, challenge-response protocols, and what ZKPs prove (and don't prove) is necessary.
  - **Quick check question:** What property does a NIZK proof guarantee about the noise addition, and what sensitive information does it intentionally not reveal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **Client-side:** Local MAS2S model → Local training → Parameter clipping → Gaussian noise addition (DP) → NIZK proof generation → Sparsity/quantization compression → AES-CBC encryption + HMAC → Upload to server
  - **Server-side:** Decrypt + verify HMAC → NIZK verification → DTAA (similarity computation → trust graph → propagation → MAD anomaly detection → median aggregation) → Compress/encrypt global model → Broadcast
  - **Data flow:** Encrypted parameters flow bidirectionally; trust scores and aggregated models are server-side only; raw data never leaves clients.

- **Critical path:** The NIZK verification gate is the key checkpoint. If verification fails for a client, their update is excluded entirely, short-circuiting aggregation. Second critical point: MAD threshold determines which clients participate in aggregation; tuning *km* (MAD coefficient) directly affects robustness vs. participation tradeoff.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Privacy budget (ε):** Lower ε strengthens privacy but degrades imputation accuracy (Table II: ε=20 yields 82.36% utility vs. ε=60 at 98.79%). Paper uses ε=40 as compromise.
  - **Compression ratio:** Higher sparsity/quantization reduces communication but may lose information. Paper uses 70% sparsity, 4-bit quantization.
  - **Trust graph density (*k* neighbors):** Too few neighbors may miss legitimate trust signals; too many may include adversaries. Paper uses *k*=3.
  - **MAD threshold (*km*):** Higher values are more conservative (fewer exclusions), potentially allowing adversaries; lower values may exclude honest clients with legitimate variation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High MIA success rate:** Privacy budget too high or insufficient noise; check ε and σ settings.
  - **Sudden RMSE spikes:** Potential adversarial attack breaking through DTAA; inspect MAD thresholds and trust score distributions.
  - **NIZK verification failures (legitimate clients):** Cryptographic parameter mismatch or numerical precision issues in proof generation.
  - **Communication errors after decompression:** Sparsity/quantization too aggressive; information loss prevents model reconstruction.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run MAS2S in centralized mode on NREL data with hybrid missing patterns (20-90% missing rates) to establish accuracy benchmarks before FL complexity.
  2. **Privacy-utility sweep:** Train FL system with varying ε ∈ {20, 40, 60, 80} while measuring RMSE and MIA-SR to characterize the tradeoff curve for your data.
  3. **Robustness stress test:** Inject sign-flipping attacks at increasing adversary ratios (P ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}) and compare DTAA against FedAvg and T-Mean to validate defense effectiveness in your threat model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the ZTFed-MAS2S framework be adapted to maintain robustness and accuracy under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data heterogeneity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states: "Future work will develop adaptive strategies for enhanced robustness against non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data heterogeneity in IIoT systems."
- **Why unresolved:** While the current framework handles missing data and anomalous clients, the authors identify data heterogeneity across clients as a distinct challenge requiring adaptive strategies that are not yet implemented.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An evaluation of the Dynamic Trust-Aware Aggregation mechanism on datasets specifically partitioned to exhibit severe label distribution skew or feature imbalance, showing convergence rates comparable to IID scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the privacy-utility trade-off in ZTFed-MAS2S be dynamically co-optimized rather than relying on a manually selected static privacy budget?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion notes that despite strong guarantees, "its privacy-utility trade-offs require co-optimized designs."
- **Why unresolved:** The current experiments use a fixed $\epsilon=40$ as a compromise, but the authors suggest a need for designs that optimize this balance dynamically rather than through manual selection.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mechanism that adaptively adjusts the privacy budget $\epsilon$ or noise scale $\sigma$ during training based on real-time utility metrics, resulting in higher accuracy for equivalent privacy guarantees.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What is the computational latency overhead of generating Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proofs on resource-constrained edge devices compared to standard federated learning updates?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper extensively validates communication overhead reduction (citing 61.17% savings) but does not quantify the computational cost of the NIZK commitment, challenge, and response steps (Algorithm 2, lines 9-10) on the edge clients.
- **Why unresolved:** NIZK proofs require cryptographic operations (e.g., modular exponentiation) which may be computationally prohibitive for the "edge sites" mentioned in the abstract, potentially creating a bottleneck despite communication gains.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks of the training wall-clock time and energy consumption specifically attributed to the NIZK proof generation on hardware representative of industrial wind farm edge nodes.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness depends on wind power data exhibiting exploitable long-range temporal correlations, which may not hold for highly volatile wind patterns or extreme weather events.
- The cryptographic assumptions underlying NIZK verification are critical but untested against side-channel attacks or quantum computing threats.
- DTAA's effectiveness depends on the assumption that malicious updates are geometrically dissimilar from honest ones, which may fail against sophisticated attacks that craft semantically harmful but numerically similar model updates.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** MAS2S imputation accuracy (45.15% RMSE improvement over Transformer validated via extensive missing rate sweep), communication compression effectiveness (61.17% reduction confirmed), and basic DP noise application mechanics.
- **Medium Confidence:** NIZK proof system security (correctness demonstrated but implementation details sparse), DTAA robustness against sign-flipping attacks (effective in tested scenarios but potential evasion strategies unanalyzed), and the specific cryptographic parameter choices.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to non-NREL wind farm datasets, performance under coordinated adaptive attacks that violate similarity assumptions, and practical deployment overhead in real-time edge environments.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization:** Evaluate ZTFed-MAS2S on wind farm data from different geographic regions and time periods to assess robustness to varying correlation structures.
2. **Adaptive attack vulnerability:** Design and test evasion strategies where malicious clients generate updates that are both harmful and geometrically similar to honest updates to probe DTAA's limits.
3. **Cryptographic implementation audit:** Conduct a formal security review of the NIZK implementation focusing on parameter selection, side-channel resistance, and verification efficiency under different network conditions.
