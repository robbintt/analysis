# STIMULUS: Achieving Fast Convergence and Low Sample Complexity in Stochastic Multi-Objective Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19883
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19883
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Introduces STIMULUS, a variance-reduced stochastic multi-gradient descent algorithm achieving deterministic-like convergence rates with significantly improved sample efficiency for multi-objective optimization.

## Executive Summary
STIMULUS addresses the challenge of slow convergence in stochastic multi-gradient descent (SMGD) algorithms by introducing a recursive variance reduction framework. The algorithm achieves fast convergence rates (O(1/T) for non-convex, O(exp(-μT)) for strongly convex) and low sample complexity (O(n + √nε⁻¹) and O(n + √n ln(μ/ε))), matching deterministic multi-gradient descent performance while being significantly more sample-efficient. The method employs periodic full gradient evaluations and recursive correction terms to construct accurate stochastic multi-gradient estimators, with enhanced momentum and adaptive batching variants further accelerating convergence and reducing computational overhead.

## Method Summary
STIMULUS is a variance-reduced stochastic multi-gradient descent algorithm for multi-objective optimization that employs periodic full gradient evaluations combined with recursive variance reduction. The algorithm constructs accurate stochastic multi-gradient estimators by periodically computing full gradients and recursively updating estimates using differences between current and previous stochastic gradients. It achieves O(1/T) convergence for non-convex problems and O(exp(-μT)) for strongly convex settings, with sample complexities matching deterministic multi-gradient descent. The method includes momentum-enhanced variants (STIMULUS-M) and adaptive batching versions (STIMULUS+) that eliminate the need for periodic full gradient evaluations while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(1/T) convergence rate for non-convex MOO with sample complexity O(n + √nε⁻¹)
- Establishes O(exp(-μT)) linear convergence for strongly convex settings with sample complexity O(n + √n ln(μ/ε))
- Outperforms existing SMGD methods on MultiMNIST and CelebA datasets in both convergence speed and sample efficiency
- Momentum variant STIMULUS-M provides additional empirical acceleration, though theoretical improvement remains to be proven
- Adaptive batching version STIMULUS+ maintains convergence guarantees while eliminating periodic full gradient evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Recursive Variance Reduction for Multi-Gradient Estimation
The recursive estimator reduces the variance of stochastic multi-gradients sufficiently to achieve deterministic-like O(1/T) convergence rates. Instead of calculating a raw stochastic gradient at every step, the algorithm evaluates a full multi-gradient periodically (every q iterations). Between these full evaluations, it updates the gradient estimate using a recursive correction term based on the difference between stochastic gradients at the current and previous parameters (∇f_sj(x_t) - ∇f_sj(x_{t-1})). This controls the noise accumulation that typically slows SMGD. The core assumption is that objective functions are L-Lipschitz smooth and stochastic gradient variance is bounded. Convergence guarantees break if the inner loop length q is set too large relative to the batch size |A|, or if the Lipschitz constant L is underestimated when setting the learning rate η ≤ 1/2L.

### Mechanism 2: Momentum Integration (STIMULUS-M)
Incorporating a momentum term accelerates convergence by smoothing the update trajectory in the high-dimensional parameter space. The update rule adds a velocity term α(x_t - x_{t-1}) to the standard gradient descent step. In the context of MOO, this helps navigate the conflicting gradients of different objectives by maintaining a consistent direction of travel, mitigating oscillation. The core assumption is that the structure of the multi-gradient estimator u^s_t allows for martingale-style analysis. If the momentum coefficient α is set too high (e.g., approaching 1.0), the update may overshoot the common descent direction, causing instability in the recursive variance estimate.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Batching (STIMULUS+)
Replacing periodic full-gradient evaluations with adaptive large batches reduces computational overhead while maintaining sample complexity bounds. Instead of computing a costly full gradient every q steps (which scales as O(n)), STIMULUS+ calculates a stochastic gradient using an adaptive batch size |N_s|. This batch size grows dynamically based on the variance estimate γ_t and the target error ε, ensuring the estimator remains accurate without needing the full dataset. If the target error ε is set extremely low, the batch size |N_s| may cap out at n, effectively degenerating the algorithm back to a full-batch method and removing efficiency gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pareto Stationarity vs. Optimality**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike single-objective optimization, there is rarely a single "best" solution in MOO. The algorithm aims to find a Pareto-stationary point (where no common descent direction exists) rather than a global minimum.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why minimizing the norm of the weighted multi-gradient ∑λ_s∇f_s(x)² implies finding a Pareto-stationary point?

- **Concept: Bounded Variance Assumption**
  - **Why needed here:** The theoretical convergence relies heavily on the assumption that the stochastic gradient variance is bounded by a constant σ². Without this, the recursive estimator cannot guarantee noise reduction.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the bounded variance assumption hold for the initialization phase of deep networks where gradients might explode?

- **Concept: Sample Complexity**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's main value proposition is lowering the sample complexity (number of IFO calls) to O(n + √nε⁻¹). Understanding this metric is crucial to evaluating the algorithm's efficiency against baselines like MGD or SMGD.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the sample complexity of STIMULUS compare to standard SMGD (O(ε⁻²)) when the dataset size n is very large?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Outer Loop -> Snapshot Module (Full batch for STIMULUS, Adaptive batch for STIMULUS+) -> Recursive Estimator -> QP Solver -> Update weights
- **Critical path:**
  1. Check mod(t, q): If 0, trigger Snapshot Module
  2. If not 0, trigger Recursive Estimator
  3. Pass gradient estimates to QP Solver to get λ*
  4. Compute descent direction d_t = ∑λ*u_t
  5. Update weights x using d_t (and momentum if active)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **STIMULUS vs. STIMULUS+:** STIMULUS requires full passes over data (O(n)) every q steps, which is prohibitive for massive datasets. STIMULUS+ avoids this via adaptive batching but requires tuning the constants c_γ and c_ε.
  - **Convergence vs. Computation:** Smaller batch sizes |A| reduce per-step cost but require smaller learning rates η to maintain stability, potentially slowing convergence.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Gradient Explosion:** If η is set > 1/2L, the recursive error term accumulates faster than it decays, causing divergence.
  - **Stagnation:** If the inner loop q is too long, the "snapshot" gradient becomes stale, and the recursive estimate drifts, reducing convergence speed to standard SMGD levels.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Tuning Loop Length (q):** Run ablation on the inner loop size q (e.g., values like √n, 2√n) on a validation set to balance estimator freshness vs. computation.
  2. **Momentum Sensitivity:** Test momentum coefficient α (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 0.8) on a non-convex task (like MultiMNIST) to observe oscillation vs. acceleration.
  3. **Adaptive Batch Scaling:** Compare STIMULUS vs. STIMULUS+ on a large dataset (CelebA) to verify that the adaptive batch size |N_s| grows stably and approaches the theoretical efficiency of the full-batch version.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the convergence rate upper bound for STIMULUS-M be theoretically tightened to explicitly reflect the empirical acceleration provided by the momentum term?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states in Section 4.2 that the theoretical upper bound for STIMULUS-M "suggests a potentially loose convergence upper bound" because it matches the non-momentum rate despite observed empirical speedups.
- **Why unresolved:** The current proof technique treats the momentum term conservatively, failing to mathematically distinguish the momentum version's theoretical speed from the base STIMULUS algorithm.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A refined proof showing a strictly smaller convergence constant or improved dependency on condition numbers for STIMULUS-M.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the achieved sample complexity of O(n + √nε⁻¹) provably optimal for the class of finite-sum stochastic multi-objective optimization problems?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper establishes "state-of-the-art" sample complexities matching deterministic MGD, but does not provide lower bounds to confirm if these rates are the theoretical limit for the problem class.
- **Why unresolved:** While the method improves upon prior stochastic algorithms, it remains unknown if a lower sample complexity is fundamentally achievable under the stated assumptions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Derivation of a theoretical lower bound for sample complexity in stochastic MOO or an algorithm that provably outperforms this rate.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the reliance on Assumption 4 (the strong growth condition) be relaxed while maintaining the linear convergence guarantees for strongly convex settings?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Theorems 2, 4, and 6 require Assumption 4 (f_j(x) - f_j(x*) ≥ c_j/2 ||x-x*||²) to establish linear convergence, a condition stricter than standard μ-strong convexity.
- **Why unresolved:** Standard strong convexity often suffices for linear rates in single-objective optimization; it is unclear if Assumption 4 is intrinsic to the multi-objective dynamics or a limitation of the current analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A convergence proof requiring only standard strong convexity, or a counterexample demonstrating that the algorithm fails to converge linearly without the growth condition.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation to small-scale datasets (MultiMNIST and CelebA) and style transfer tasks, raising scalability and generalizability questions.
- Heavy dependence on hyperparameter tuning (inner loop length q, learning rate η, momentum coefficient α, adaptive batch constants) without systematic tuning guidance.
- Reliance on bounded variance assumption that may not hold during unstable training phases of deep networks.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in theoretical framework and convergence proofs for base STIMULUS algorithm
- **Medium confidence** in practical efficacy of momentum variant (STIMULUS-M) and adaptive batching (STIMULUS+) due to limited empirical validation and hyperparameter sensitivity
- **Low confidence** in scalability and generalizability to large-scale, high-dimensional problems beyond style transfer tasks

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Benchmark:** Evaluate STIMULUS on a large-scale, multi-task learning problem (e.g., Meta-Dataset for few-shot classification) to assess performance and sample efficiency in a more challenging setting.
2. **Robustness to Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct comprehensive sensitivity analysis of inner loop length q, learning rate η, and adaptive batch constants c_γ and c_ε across multiple MOO tasks to understand their impact and provide practical tuning guidelines.
3. **Variance Assumption Relaxation:** Investigate STIMULUS performance when bounded variance assumption is violated during initial deep network training phases, exploring adaptive techniques to handle changing gradient variance.
