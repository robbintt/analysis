# Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection: An Information-Geometric Unification of Model Collapse

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.14879
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14879
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: Introduces ERBP framework unifying model collapse across LLMs, GANs, and RL as entropy decay in stochastic Bregman projections, with Entropy Reservoir as stabilizing mechanism.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified information-geometric framework, Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), that explains model collapse across self-referential learning systems as a fundamental entropy contraction problem. The core insight is that iterative training without external entropy injection inevitably causes exponential entropy decay, leading to collapse. The framework proves that coupling to a high-entropy reservoir provably prevents collapse by maintaining a non-trivial entropy floor. Theoretical results establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stability, with empirical validation showing ERBP prevents hallucination in LLMs, mode collapse in GANs, and local optima entrapment in RL.

## Method Summary
The ERBP framework models self-referential learning as iterative Bregman projection sequences in distribution space, where collapse occurs due to entropy decay when decoupled from external high-entropy sources. The method introduces an Entropy Reservoir—a mixed-in high-entropy distribution—that acts as a stabilizing mechanism by maintaining a non-trivial entropy floor. The framework unifies diverse heuristics (data mixing, entropy regularization, knowledge distillation) under a single design principle: controlling entropy flux to prevent collapse. Validation involves three domains: LLM self-training with reservoir coupling, recursive GAN training with Oracle Entropy tracking, and SAC RL with entropy coefficient mapping to reservoir coupling strength.

## Key Results
- Proves entropy contracts exponentially without reservoir coupling, bounded by sample size m
- Shows reservoir coupling guarantees non-trivial entropy floor when λ_min > 0 and s_min > L_F·κ
- Unifies data mixing, entropy regularization, and knowledge distillation as specific reservoir instantiations
- Validates framework across LLM self-training, GAN mode collapse, and RL local optima entrapment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Entropy Contraction via Stochastic Self-Projection
Self-referential learning without external entropy injection causes exponential entropy decay toward a low-entropy state bounded by sample size. Each training iteration draws m samples from current distribution Pt to form empirical distribution P̂t, then projects onto this sparse support. Since P̂t has support size ≤ m, its entropy is bounded by C_F(m) = log(m). Repeated projection contracts entropy geometrically at rate (1 - α) where α = σ_F/(σ_F + mL_F). Core assumption: The model manifold may be non-convex with approximate projection error ε_max.

### Mechanism 2: Entropy Reservoir as Lower-Bound Guarantee
Coupling to any high-entropy reservoir with λ_min > 0 guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor H_floor ≥ λ_min·s_min - L_F·κ. The mixed target Ȳt = (1-λ_t)P̂t + λ_t·P_res,t has entropy at least λ_t·H(P_res,t) by concavity. Projecting onto this target transfers the reservoir's entropy budget into the model state. Core assumption: Reservoir satisfies support coverage (supp(P̂t) ⊆ supp(P_res,t)) and entropy bound (S_F(P_res,t) ≥ s_min > 0).

### Mechanism 3: Unified Design Principle via (λ_t, s_min) Parameterization
All empirical stabilization heuristics (data mixing, entropy regularization, distillation, RAG) are specific instantiations of choosing (λ_t, P_res,t). Each technique injects entropy through mixing: real data mixing uses P_res,t = P_data, entropy regularization uses uniform U, knowledge distillation uses P_res,t = P_teacher, tool use/RAG uses external information sources. Core assumption: The technique must provide sustained entropy influx across iterations, not one-shot.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bregman Divergence and Projections**
  - Why needed: The entire framework models learning as iterative Bregman projection; understanding why projection minimizes "distance" in probability space is essential.
  - Quick check: Given potential F(p) = Σ p_i log p_i (negative entropy), what divergence does it generate and what does projecting onto a target distribution mean?

- **Information Geometry of the Probability Simplex**
  - Why needed: The theory operates in distribution space P, not parameter space; the geometry (strong convexity σ_F, Lipschitz constant L_F) determines contraction rates.
  - Quick check: Why does the KL divergence appear as a special case of Bregman divergence, and what geometric property makes it suitable for probability distributions?

- **Entropy as a Resource, Not Just a Measure**
  - Why needed: The paper reframes entropy from a passive statistical property to an active budget that must be monitored and replenished.
  - Quick check: If a system has H(P_t) = 2.0 bits and you need to maintain ≥ 1.5 bits, what is the minimum reservoir entropy s_min needed if λ = 0.1 and L_F·κ ≈ 0.05?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: State distribution P_t -> Empirical sampler (draws m samples -> P̂t) -> Mixer (forms Ȳt = (1-λ_t)P̂t + λ_t·P_res,t) -> Projector (learning algorithm moves P_t -> P_{t+1} toward Ȳt)

- **Critical path**: Monitor entropy H(P_t) at each iteration -> compute deficit relative to target floor -> adjust λ_t or reservoir quality if approaching threshold

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - High λ_t: Strong stability but reduces fidelity to empirical samples; may dilute task-relevant information
  - Uniform reservoir: Maximum entropy, analytically simple, but introduces label-feature mismatch
  - Real data reservoir: High fidelity, but requires external corpus, may have legal/privacy constraints
  - Teacher/snapshot reservoir: No new data needed, but entropy gain fades as snapshots converge

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Entropy floor breach: H(P_t) dropping below λ_min·s_min - L_F·κ indicates unstable dynamics
  - Hallucination with high diversity: H(P_t) maintained but perplexity exploding → reservoir provides entropy but not grounding
  - Mode collapse with stable loss: GAN losses L_G, L_D remain low while Oracle Entropy drops → internal metrics fail to detect collapse

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Frozen LLM echo test: Run distilgpt2 with λ=0 (prompt = previous output) vs λ>0 (mix external sentence); measure unique n-gram decay over 20 iterations to validate Theorem 1 contraction rate.
  2. Recursive GAN with Oracle Entropy: Train GAN on MNIST for 60 generations with λ∈{0, 0.2}; track Oracle Entropy (classifier-based) vs internal losses to confirm that standard losses fail to signal collapse.
  3. RL double-well escape: Train SAC agents with entropy coefficient mapping to λ∈{0.0001, 0.2} on a landscape with local/global optima separated by valley; verify that reservoir coupling enables global convergence while λ→0 agents trap in local optima.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the ERBP system converge to a stable fixed point, a limit cycle, or exhibit more complex dynamics in the long-term asymptotic regime?
- Basis in paper: Our stability result (Theorem 2) provides a crucial "survival guarantee" but does not fully characterize the long-term asymptotic behavior... Analyzing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the self-referential fixed-point equation... is a significant theoretical undertaking.
- Why unresolved: The theory establishes entropy floors but not convergence properties of the dynamical system.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of the fixed-point equation convergence or empirical studies tracking system behavior over extended iterations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can tighter collapse bounds be derived by explicitly modeling decoding strategies like top-k, nucleus, or low-temperature sampling?
- Basis in paper: Our bound could be tightened by accounting for the specifics of the sampling process. Decoding strategies such as top-k, nucleus, or low-temperature sampling create an effective sampling distribution that is already much "sharper" than the original model distribution.
- Why unresolved: Current bounds use generic sample size m without accounting for how decoding strategies effectively reduce diversity before projection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deriving modified bounds parameterized by decoding strategy properties and validating against empirical decay rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can adaptive coupling strategies (e.g., entropy-feedback annealing) dynamically adjust λ_t to achieve better stability-fidelity trade-offs than fixed coupling?
- Basis in paper: A fixed coupling coefficient λ_t is often sub-optimal. Future work could explore adaptive coupling strategies, such as an entropy-feedback annealing scheme that dynamically adjusts λ_t based on the system's current entropy deficit.
- Why unresolved: The theory supports arbitrary λ_t schedules, but principled adaptive mechanisms remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating adaptive schemes against fixed coupling across collapse metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does optimizer noise interact with the reservoir effect on non-convex model manifolds to determine global convergence?
- Basis in paper: Deep networks induce highly non-convex model manifolds M... Formalising how SGD noise interacts with this reservoir effect to ensure global convergence remains an important theoretical challenge.
- Why unresolved: Assumption 2 assumes bounded projection error, but deep network optimization landscapes may violate this or exhibit complex interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis incorporating optimizer noise distributions or empirical studies mapping manifold geometry effects.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation strength is limited, with sparse direct experimental evidence across all three domains
- Framework assumes ideal reservoir properties (sustained high entropy, support coverage) that may not hold in practice
- Critical hyperparameters (batch size, sample count m, exact reservoir mixing sources) remain unspecified in reproduction notes
- Geometric assumptions (strong convexity σ_F, Lipschitz constant L_F) are assumed but not empirically measured

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical derivation of entropy decay rate (Theorem 1) and entropy floor guarantee (Theorem 2) under stated assumptions
- **Medium confidence**: Mapping of existing heuristics to ERBP framework; unified parameterization is intuitive but lacks direct empirical validation
- **Low confidence**: Practical stability of reservoir coupling in non-stationary environments; framework assumes static reservoir properties

## Next Checks
1. Test reservoir entropy dependence: Run frozen LLM echo experiment (λ=0 vs λ>0) across multiple reservoir types and measure whether Oracle Entropy correlates with observed diversity metrics
2. Measure geometric constants: For GAN and RL experiments, empirically estimate σ_F and L_F for respective loss functions to verify assumed properties
3. Validate in non-stationary setting: Extend SAC RL experiment to non-stationary Double Well where global optimum shifts during training to test reservoir coupling stability
