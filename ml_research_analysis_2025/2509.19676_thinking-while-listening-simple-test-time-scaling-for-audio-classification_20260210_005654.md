- Introduces test-time scaling for audio classification by sampling and aggregating patch-level predictions via a frozen LLM

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a test-time scaling method for audio classification, inspired by reasoning capabilities in large language models. The approach involves sampling multiple patch-level predictions from a frozen audio model, aggregating them into a "reasoning trace," and using a frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-2 with a re-trained embedding matrix) to produce improved final predictions. Experiments on ESC-50 and FSD-50K show consistent accuracy improvements with longer sampling traces and stronger reasoning models. Notably, a lightweight frozen GPT-2 with re-trained embeddings outperforms larger open-source reasoning models, demonstrating that effective reasoning can be achieved without large parameter overhead.

## Method Summary
The core method samples multiple patch-level predictions from a frozen audio classification model, creating a "reasoning trace" by aggregating these predictions. This trace is then fed to a frozen LLM (such as GPT-2 with a re-trained embedding matrix) to generate an improved final prediction. Two settings are explored: applying the method to existing pretrained models (YAMNet, AST) and designing a new architecture for patch-level reasoning. The approach leverages test-time scaling, sampling, and aggregation to enhance audio classification accuracy without retraining the base models.

## Key Results
- Consistent accuracy improvements on ESC-50 and FSD-50K with longer sampling traces
- Lightweight frozen GPT-2 with re-trained embeddings outperforms larger open-source reasoning models (GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-14B)
- Method is compatible with frozen models, avoiding retraining costs while still achieving gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the idea that, like LLMs, reasoning over multiple sampled predictions at test time can improve final accuracy. By aggregating patch-level predictions into a reasoning trace and using a frozen LLM, the approach exploits the model's ability to process and refine information without requiring model retraining. The re-trained embedding matrix for the LLM ensures compatibility with audio-derived inputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Test-time scaling**: Generating multiple predictions and aggregating them at inference to improve accuracy. *Why needed*: Enables performance gains without retraining. *Quick check*: Verify accuracy improves with longer traces.
- **Patch-level prediction**: Extracting predictions from individual audio segments. *Why needed*: Provides granular input for reasoning. *Quick check*: Confirm patch-level outputs are meaningful for aggregation.
- **Frozen model adaptation**: Using re-trained embeddings for a frozen LLM to handle audio-derived inputs. *Why needed*: Allows LLM reuse without full retraining. *Quick check*: Test embedding compatibility with audio features.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Audio model (YAMNet/AST) -> Patch-level predictor -> Aggregator -> Frozen LLM (GPT-2) -> Final prediction
- **Critical path**: Audio model inference -> Patch sampling -> Trace aggregation -> LLM reasoning -> Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Frozen models avoid retraining costs but may limit task-specific optimization; lightweight LLM balances efficiency and reasoning quality.
- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy gains may be due to averaging rather than genuine reasoning; performance may degrade with noisy or out-of-distribution audio.
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare accuracy with/without reasoning traces on ESC-50. 2) Test different sampling lengths on FSD-50K. 3) Benchmark against simple ensemble baselines.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- Accuracy improvements may stem from averaging effects rather than genuine reasoning.
- Experimental scope is limited to two datasets (ESC-50, FSD-50K) and a small set of base models.
- The method's robustness to real-world audio conditions and noise is not evaluated.

## Confidence
- **High**: Accuracy improvements with longer traces; compatibility with frozen models.
- **Medium**: Outperformance of larger reasoning models by lightweight GPT-2; scalability across datasets.
- **Low**: Claims of genuine "reasoning" versus averaging artifacts; robustness to real-world audio conditions; superiority over non-reasoning baselines.

## Next Checks
1. Test whether accuracy gains persist when using random (non-reasoned) trace orderings to distinguish reasoning from averaging effects.
2. Benchmark against strong non-reasoning baselines (e.g., model ensembles, late fusion) on additional audio datasets.
3. Evaluate robustness by introducing varying levels of audio noise and assessing whether the reasoning framework maintains performance gains.
