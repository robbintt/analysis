# Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Frameworks: Notion and Limits of AGI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18517
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18517
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current neural network architectures are fundamentally insufficient for AGI due to being static function approximators lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive critique of current artificial intelligence paradigms, arguing that genuine artificial general intelligence (AGI) cannot emerge from existing neural network architectures regardless of scale. The author systematically dismantles the theoretical foundations underpinning current AI development, including the Universal Approximation Theorem and neural scaling laws, demonstrating their limitations at addressing fundamental questions of intelligence. The core argument centers on what the author terms "architectural insufficiency" - current neural networks operate as static function approximators with limited encoding frameworks, exhibiting complex behaviors without the structural richness required for genuine understanding.

## Method Summary
The paper employs conceptual analysis combining philosophy of mind, learning theory, and neural architecture formalism. It proposes a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), introducing a formal neuron class hierarchy (N₀, N₁, N₂) and primitive framework P₀ with layered construction. The method involves theoretical argumentation against the Universal Approximation Theorem's relevance to intelligence questions, critique of neural scaling laws as statistical artifacts, and synthesis of philosophical arguments including Chinese Room and Gödelian critiques of computationalism.

## Key Results
- Current neural networks are static function approximators that cannot achieve genuine understanding regardless of scale
- The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction for intelligence questions
- Scaling laws represent phenomenological observations that fail to capture underlying mechanisms of intelligence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Current neural networks operate as static function approximators lacking dynamic restructuring, which prevents genuine understanding regardless of scale.
- Mechanism: Networks are trained to fixed parameter configurations post-optimization, then deployed as frozen inference machines. The learning process is externalized—the model itself cannot restructure its architecture or interpretive framework in response to novel situations.
- Core assumption: Genuine intelligence requires internal mechanisms that can modify both operational parameters and structural organization autonomously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence."
  - [section 2.3.3] "Generally, neural network and such type of parameterized models are static. They act, just as CRA indicted, to be an algorithmic machine only."
  - [corpus] Related work on cognitive foundations (arXiv:2507.00951) similarly argues pattern learning alone insufficient for AGI.
- Break condition: If architectures can demonstrate autonomous structural reorganization during deployment (not just weight updates), this mechanism weakens.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) addresses the wrong level of abstraction for intelligence arguments.
- Mechanism: UAT proves existence of approximating functions for continuous functions on compact sets, but this concerns expressivity in function space—not whether the architecture can develop interpretive structures or handle out-of-distribution generalization meaningfully.
- Core assumption: Intelligence involves more than approximating continuous functions; it requires structural organization that interprets rather than merely maps inputs to outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities."
  - [section 2.3.3] "UAT and the functional structure deliberately choose and restrict itself around smooth, continuous, well-behaved function. Not taking the impossible domain lies beyond the compact subset."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; this is primarily a theoretical critique within the paper itself.
- Break condition: If future theoretical work proves UAT-like guarantees extend to structural/interpretive capabilities, not just function approximation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures) reveals why scaling compute alone cannot produce AGI.
- Mechanism: Current systems conflate the machine (hardware/software substrate) with the process (state transformations). True intelligence requires separating these so the architectural organization can develop meaningfully on top of—but distinct from—the computational substrate.
- Core assumption: Intelligence emerges from interpretive structures that are not reducible to their implementing substrate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures)."
  - [section 3.2] "A construct is a conceptual encapsulation of two components: The machine in broad term which houses the operational facility, and optionally, the existential facility of the construct, and the process, or rather, its state(s) of being."
  - [corpus] Intelligence Foundation Model paper (arXiv:2511.10119) proposes similar separation between pattern learning and underlying mechanisms.
- Break condition: If empirical work demonstrates interpretive structures emerge automatically from sufficient computational substrate scaling.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chinese Room Argument (Searle, 1980)**
  - Why needed here: Central to the paper's claim that symbol manipulation without understanding cannot produce genuine intelligence, regardless of sophistication.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the "man in the room" following rules to translate Chinese doesn't understand Chinese, and how this maps to neural network operation?

- Concept: **Universal Approximation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: Paper critiques over-reliance on UAT as justification for neural network completeness; understanding what UAT actually guarantees (and doesn't) is essential.
  - Quick check question: What class of functions does UAT guarantee approximation for, and what does "compact subset" mean in this context?

- Concept: **Static vs. Dynamic Systems**
  - Why needed here: Paper's core distinction—current networks are static (fixed post-training), while intelligence supposedly requires dynamic restructuring.
  - Quick check question: What makes a system "static" in this framework, and what would "dynamic restructuring" actually look like architecturally?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Primitive Framework P₀**: Dual (Γ, R) where Γ = (N, F) is cardinality encoding space and R is base field primitive
  - **Neuron Classes**: N₀ (standard/minimal neurons), N₁ (multivariate neurons), N₂ (layer networks)
  - **Layer Hierarchy**: P₀ ⊂ P₁ ⊂ ... ⊂ Pₙ with transformation Φᵢ : Pᵢ → Pᵢ₊₁
  - **Existential Facilities**: Computational substrate (hardware, encoding constraints)
  - **Operational Facilities**: Process dynamics, state transitions
  - **Learning Modules**: Structural learning (architecture adaptation) vs. operational learning (parameter adaptation)

- Critical path:
  1. Understand the distinction between existential and operational facilities (Section 3.2)
  2. Map current neural architectures onto the neuron class hierarchy (N₀ → N₂)
  3. Identify where "static" behavior emerges (post-training freeze)
  4. Design for structural learning capacity, not just operational learning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Interpretability vs. Expressivity**: The formalism prioritizes analyzable structure over raw approximation power
  - **Backward Compatibility vs. Novel Architectures**: Framework explicitly values compatibility with existing systems while enabling extension
  - **External vs. Internal Learning**: Paper argues learning must become internal to the system, not an external optimization process

- Failure signatures:
  - Systems that cannot handle out-of-distribution cases without retraining from scratch
  - Catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks
  - Inability to explain or interpret own decision processes
  - Dependence on ever-larger training sets for marginal capability gains

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Layer Transition Analysis**: Instrument a network to track information flow across the proposed layer hierarchy P₀ → Pₙ. Verify whether lower layers can be shown to lack "understanding" of higher-layer semantics as the paper's layer dilemma predicts.
  2. **Static vs. Dynamic Learning Comparison**: Compare a standard frozen network against one permitted structural modifications during inference. Measure performance on out-of-distribution tasks to test the "static function approximator" claim.
  3. **Existential/Operational Facility Decoupling**: Build a minimal system that explicitly separates substrate constraints (memory, compute limits) from operational dynamics. Test whether this separation enables transfer across different computational substrates without retraining.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the proposed hierarchical neural architecture formalism (classes $N_0$ to $N_2$, primitive framework $P_0$) rigorously unify the analysis of expressive capacity and interpretability better than the Universal Approximation Theorem?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.1 introduces this formalism as a "prototype" to address "inexplainable phenomena" in current models, stating, "It is then the task to develop such theory toward maturity."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper admits the framework is currently conceptual, lacking the rigorous derivation and backward compatibility verification required to replace existing functional approximation treatments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal proofs showing this framework can deduce known limitations (e.g., GNN 1-WL limits) and empirical analysis of interpretability within this specific structure.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does there exist a measurable complexity threshold $Q$ and metric $M$ such that a system exceeding $Q$ develops recursive patterns to overcome the "layer dilemma" (Chinese Room Argument)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix A.2 proposes Conjecture A.1 regarding threshold $Q$ for recursive patterns, but states, "We still need to define the measure M... and furthermore, the complete test implementation."
- **Why unresolved:** The threshold $Q$ and the measure $M$ are hypothetical; the paper provides a conceptual sketch but no operational definition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal definition of metric $M$ and a demonstration of a system crossing $Q$ to interpret higher-level abstractions not explicitly encoded in its initial layer.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can a computational construct implement "structural learning" (autonomous architectural modification) distinct from "operational learning" without relying on external optimization heuristics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.2 distinguishes between structural and operational learning, arguing current systems rely on "external modification" (e.g., backpropagation), rendering them "static" and insufficient.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies the need for systems that generate "purpose" via internal logic rather than external fitting, but provides no concrete mechanism for this autonomy.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model architecture that autonomously reconfigures its topology based on internal state logic rather than a global error signal.

## Limitations
- The formalism remains underdeveloped with incomplete transformation function specifications
- Limited testable predictions for distinguishing genuine understanding from pattern matching
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis may not translate philosophical objections to technical constraints

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Current neural networks operate as static function approximators post-training
- The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses expressivity, not understanding
- Scaling compute alone cannot overcome fundamental architectural limitations

**Medium Confidence:**
- The existential/operational facility distinction provides useful conceptual separation
- The neuron class hierarchy (N₀ → N₂) captures relevant architectural dimensions
- Static vs. dynamic system distinction identifies a genuine architectural gap

**Low Confidence:**
- Specific mechanisms for achieving dynamic restructuring remain unspecified
- Concrete architectural modifications required are not fully articulated
- Empirical validation protocols for the theoretical claims are underdeveloped

## Next Checks

1. **Implement the neuron class hierarchy** (Definitions 3.1-3.5) and verify that the proposed structural operations (composition, extension, type signatures) are mathematically consistent and permit the claimed architectural transformations.

2. **Design comparative experiments** between static networks and architectures permitted structural modifications during inference. Focus on out-of-distribution generalization tasks where the "static function approximator" critique predicts systematic failure.

3. **Replicate and extend the scaling law critique** by analyzing whether log-log plotting artifacts explain observed power-law relationships. Use synthetic data with known non-power-law distributions to test whether the claimed "laws" emerge from statistical artifacts versus genuine scaling principles.
