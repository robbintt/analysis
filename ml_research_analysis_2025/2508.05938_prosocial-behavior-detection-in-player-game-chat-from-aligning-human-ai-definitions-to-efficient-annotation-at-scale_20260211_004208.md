# Prosocial Behavior Detection in Player Game Chat: From Aligning Human-AI Definitions to Efficient Annotation at Scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05938
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05938
- Reference count: 40
- First large-scale deployment-oriented effort to detect prosocial behavior in game chat

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting prosocial behavior in player game chat, an area with no established definitions or labeled datasets. The authors develop a three-stage pipeline combining human-in-the-loop label refinement, LLM-assisted annotation, and a cost-efficient hybrid classification system. Through an iterative process of defining prosocial behavior and reducing annotation disagreement, they achieve significant cost savings while maintaining high precision in detecting helpful, cooperative, and supportive player interactions.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-stage pipeline for prosocial behavior detection: (1) an iterative human-in-the-loop label refinement process where human experts review high-disagreement cases between GPT-4o and human annotations to clarify and expand the task definition; (2) LLM-assisted annotation using retrieval-augmented generation with 16 examples per class achieving strong performance metrics; and (3) a cost-efficient hybrid classification system that routes only 35% of uncertain cases to GPT-4o, reducing inference costs by approximately 70% while maintaining ~0.90 precision. The approach represents the first large-scale deployment-oriented effort in this domain.

## Key Results
- RAG prompting strategy with 16 examples per class achieves AUC of 0.85 and precision of 0.93
- Iterative definition refinement reduces disagreement by 63% from 25.4% to 9.7%
- Hybrid system routes only 35% of cases to GPT-4o, reducing costs by ~70% while maintaining ~0.90 precision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing the fundamental challenge that prosocial behavior lacks clear, universally accepted definitions. By using an iterative process where human experts refine definitions based on LLM-human disagreements, the system gradually converges on a more precise understanding. The RAG prompting provides context-rich examples that help the LLM make more accurate judgments, while the hybrid classification system leverages the strengths of both SVM (for common, clear cases) and LLM (for ambiguous cases) to optimize for both cost and accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Iterative definition refinement**: Needed to establish shared understanding of prosocial behavior across human and AI systems; quick check is measuring reduction in annotation disagreement rates
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Needed to provide contextual examples that improve LLM judgment quality; quick check is performance comparison with and without RAG
- **Hybrid classification systems**: Needed to balance cost and accuracy by routing only uncertain cases to expensive LLM inference; quick check is precision-recall tradeoff at different routing thresholds
- **Synthetic data generation**: Needed to scale annotation when human-labeled data is scarce; quick check is agreement rates between synthetic and human labels on validation sets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Human Experts <-> Definition Refinement Loop <-> SVM Classifier <-> LLM Router -> GPT-4o

**Critical Path:**
Annotation Disagreement → Human Review → Definition Update → SVM Training → Inference Routing

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Cost vs. Accuracy (35% LLM usage vs. 100% precision), Speed vs. Thoroughness (iterative refinement takes time but improves quality), Human Effort vs. Automation (expert review is expensive but necessary for definition quality)

**Failure Signatures:**
High disagreement rates indicate poor definition quality, SVM misclassifications reveal gaps in synthetic training data, LLM inconsistencies suggest context understanding issues, routing errors indicate threshold miscalibration

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test RAG performance with varying numbers of examples (1, 4, 16, 32) to find optimal tradeoff
2. Measure agreement rates between human experts and GPT-4o on test set using final definitions
3. Deploy hybrid system in controlled environment and monitor cost savings vs. precision degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Circular dependency where LLM outputs help define prosocial behavior, then validate the same definition
- SVM trained on synthetic labels may inherit LLM biases and blind spots
- Calibration stability across different game contexts and player populations not empirically validated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: RAG prompting strategy with 16 examples achieving 0.85 AUC and 0.93 precision
- **Medium confidence**: Iterative definition refinement process and its impact on reducing disagreement
- **Medium confidence**: Cost-efficiency claims of hybrid system due to assumptions about inference patterns

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind validation where uninvolved human annotators evaluate test sets using final definitions, comparing agreement with SVM and GPT-4o
2. Test hybrid system performance across different game genres and communities to assess SVM calibration stability
3. Measure actual inference costs and latency in live deployment, accounting for routing overhead and LLM response time variability
