# Synthetic Data and the Shifting Ground of Truth

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13355
- Reference count: 10
- This paper critically examines how synthetic data fundamentally challenges traditional notions of ground truth, shifting from representation to imitation and from evidence to training signal.

## Executive Summary
This conceptual paper argues that synthetic data—artificially generated data for training machine learning models—fundamentally challenges traditional notions of ground truth, data fidelity, and representation. The paper identifies three key inversions: from representation to imitation, from evidence to training signal, and the shifting nature of ground truth itself. It distinguishes between three ways ground truth is conceptualized: as the best available measure of external validity, as whatever labelers (human or automatic) assign, and as disagreement about truth being productive for training. The paper concludes that synthetic data requires rethinking data as interventions that generate, perturb, and reconstitute the grounds on which claims to knowledge are made, rather than serving as guarantees of truth.

## Method Summary
This is a conceptual analysis paper that critiques how synthetic data challenges traditional ground truth notions in machine learning. The paper does not provide empirical experiments or implementation details. It references synthetic datasets and existing literature on domain randomization, brain tumor MRI synthesis, and multi-annotator frameworks as examples. The method involves theoretical argumentation about the philosophical implications of synthetic data on truth, representation, and validation.

## Key Results
- Synthetic data fundamentally challenges traditional notions of ground truth, shifting from representation to imitation and from evidence to training signal
- Ground truth becomes self-referential when synthetic data is labeled by other AI models, creating cascading error propagation
- Disagreement among annotators should be treated as signal rather than noise, providing information about model uncertainty and task ambiguity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Injecting synthetic data with high variability—not high realism—can improve model generalization by forcing focus on robust features rather than spurious correlations.
- Mechanism: Synthetic data expands the parameter space beyond what naturally occurs in observational data. When a model encounters sufficient variation during training, real-world inputs appear as "just another variation" rather than a distribution shift, reducing overfitting to dataset-specific artifacts.
- Core assumption: The synthetic variations span the relevant dimensions of the problem space; irrelevant variations do not introduce confounding signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "injecting noisy and outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the model"
  - [section 3] Tobin et al. (2017): "With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—neighboring papers address concept drift and stability but not synthetic data variability mechanisms specifically
- Break condition: If synthetic variations cluster around irrelevant dimensions or introduce systematic artifacts not present in deployment, model may overfit to synthetic-specific patterns (sim-to-real gap widens rather than narrows).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synthetic data shifts evaluation from representational correspondence (does data match reality?) to teleological performance (does the trained model behave correctly?).
- Mechanism: Data quality becomes a posteriori—determined only after measuring downstream model performance—rather than a priori verifiable through provenance chains. The "ground truth" label is assigned by whatever process produces the training signal, including other AI models, without requiring external validation.
- Core assumption: Model performance metrics on test sets accurately predict deployment behavior; the test distribution adequately represents deployment conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the labels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products"
  - [section 4.2] "instead of a correspondence theory of truth... we have a teleological theory of truth... the correspondence requirement has shifted from data to the trained model"
  - [corpus] MARIA framework (2510.27163) addresses risk assessment without ground truth—relevant to evaluation when correspondence is unavailable
- Break condition: If the performance metrics being optimized do not correlate with actual deployment requirements, the teleological feedback loop optimizes for the wrong objective (Goodhart's Law applied to synthetic data generation).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Disagreement among annotators—rather than being noise to be resolved—provides signal about meaningful ambiguity and model uncertainty.
- Mechanism: Multi-annotator frameworks capture uncertainty distributions rather than forcing consensus. Training on disagreement patterns helps models learn when to defer or express uncertainty, improving calibration on edge cases.
- Core assumption: Annotator disagreement reflects genuine ambiguity in the task rather than labeling error or poor instructions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] Aroyo and Welty (2015): "disagreement is not noise but signal"
  - [section 4.3] Peterson et al. (2019): "errors in classification can be just as informative as the correct answers"
  - [corpus] P-StaT framework (2511.19166) tests belief stability under perturbations—conceptually related to handling disagreement
- Break condition: If disagreement stems from systematic bias in annotator pool (e.g., cultural homogeneity) rather than genuine task ambiguity, the model learns a biased uncertainty distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Correspondence vs. Pragmatic Theories of Truth**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument requires understanding that synthetic data abandons correspondence (data matches world) for pragmatism (data produces desired model behavior). Without this distinction, the "paradox" of fake data improving models is unintelligible.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "the model works" and "the training data is accurate" might be independent claims?

- Concept: **Sim-to-Real Transfer**
  - Why needed here: The medical imaging and robotics examples rely on simulation-to-reality transfer. Understanding why this sometimes works (domain randomization) and sometimes fails (domain gap) is essential for evaluating synthetic data claims.
  - Quick check question: What conditions make a model trained on rendered 3D faces likely to recognize real faces?

- Concept: **Labeling Cascades / Model-Based Labeling**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes synthetic ground truth is often "entirely AI-generated" from major tech firms. Understanding how errors compound when models label data for other models is critical for risk assessment.
  - Quick check question: What happens to error rates when Model A's predictions become training labels for Model B?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
```
[Generation Layer] → [Validation Layer] → [Integration Layer] → [Performance Layer]
      ↓                     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
 Parameter space      Fidelity metrics     Training pipeline     Deployment metrics
 (not realism)        (purpose-specific)   (mixed real/synth)    (correspondence check)
```

- Critical path:
  1. Define the performance objective the synthetic data must serve (not "realism")
  2. Identify parameter dimensions where variability matters vs. introduces artifacts
  3. Generate synthetic samples with controlled variation
  4. Validate on held-out real data (not synthetic validation set)
  5. Monitor for synthetic-specific overfitting signatures

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Coverage vs. artifact risk: Maximum variability explores more of parameter space but increases chance of synthetic-specific patterns
  - Cost vs. verifiability: AI-generated labels are cheap but untraceable; human labels provide provenance but don't scale
  - Privacy vs. fidelity: Differential privacy injection preserves statistical properties but may destroy edge-case signal

- Failure signatures:
  - Model performs well on synthetic test sets but poorly on real-world edge cases (synthetic test set contamination)
  - Confidence calibration degrades on out-of-distribution inputs (learned synthetic uncertainty distribution doesn't transfer)
  - Performance plateaus despite increased synthetic data volume (saturation on synthetic-specific patterns)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation by variability dimension**: Generate synthetic data varying one parameter axis at a time; measure which variations improve vs. degrade real-world performance to identify relevant vs. spurious dimensions.
  2. **Synthetic ratio titration**: Train models with incrementally increasing proportions of synthetic data (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%); identify the threshold where real-world performance degrades.
  3. **Disagreement signal extraction**: Compare models trained on consensus labels vs. uncertainty-preserving multi-annotator labels; measure calibration differences on ambiguous test cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can data quality be evaluated a priori when synthetic data functions mimetically rather than representationally?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that for synthetic data, "quality depends on the goal" and cannot be measured by how well it represents a population, yet it observes that quality is currently only determinable "after use in a particular scenario."
- Why unresolved: The shift from representation to imitation removes the standard criteria for fidelity (correspondence to reality), leaving a gap in methodologies for pre-deployment validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of new standard metrics that correlate with model generalization independent of representational fidelity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the shift toward a "teleological theory of truth" (validating data by the model's resulting performance) introduce systematic risks that are masked by short-term performance gains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies a "contradiction" in the inversion of provenance where data is constructed based on desired results, reversing the chain of custody required for evidence.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes that this inversion complicates "garbage in, garbage out" assumptions, it leaves open the long-term implications of decoupling training data from evidentiary provenance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking bias propagation or concept drift in models trained exclusively on teleologically-optimized synthetic data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can frameworks that treat annotator disagreement as signal effectively replace the need for a gold standard in training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper cites Uma et al. (2022), who emphasize that even without a gold standard, "it remains essential to agree on how to assess model performance," questioning if the problem is merely shifted.
- Why unresolved: While "disagreement is not noise but signal" offers a path forward, the paper suggests the operationalization of this approach (evaluating the model without a ground) remains a central challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of evaluation benchmarks that rely on uncertainty distributions rather than binary accuracy.

## Limitations

- The paper is primarily conceptual rather than empirical, lacking quantitative validation of its claims about synthetic data mechanisms
- No specific datasets, models, hyperparameters, or evaluation protocols are provided for reproduction
- The claims about synthetic data variability benefits lack quantitative thresholds or boundary conditions
- Limited direct evidence supporting the specific mechanisms—corpus analysis reveals minimal supporting research

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical framing of ground truth shifts and the three inversions
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanisms connecting synthetic data properties to model behavior changes  
- **Low confidence**: Specific quantitative boundaries and failure conditions without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Boundary Testing**: Systematically vary synthetic data realism and variability to identify the precise thresholds where sim-to-real transfer breaks down or improves.

2. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Trace error compounding in model-based labeling cascades using controlled synthetic ground truth to quantify the "self-referential" ground truth problem.

3. **Disagreement Value Quantification**: Empirically measure whether multi-annotator disagreement patterns improve uncertainty calibration compared to consensus labels across diverse tasks.
