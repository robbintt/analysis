# Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.16059
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MSEF framework reduces forecasting MSE by 31.8% average across seven benchmarks by enabling deep LLM access to time series patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of shallow time series integration in large language models (LLMs), where temporal information is only accessed at the input layer, leading to progressive information loss in deeper layers. The proposed Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF) framework overcomes this by injecting time series embeddings at multiple intermediate layers of LLMs through learned steering vectors. By leveraging time series foundation models for semantically rich embeddings and continuously optimizing their alignment with textual representations, MSEF enables LLMs to maintain access to temporal patterns throughout their depth. The framework achieves substantial performance improvements across seven forecasting benchmarks while maintaining parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
The MSEF framework introduces a novel approach to integrate time series data into LLMs by addressing the shallow integration problem. It extracts semantically rich time series embeddings from a frozen Time Series Foundation Model (MOMENT), then fuses these embeddings with intermediate text representations across all LLM layers using layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are continuously optimized to align the time series and textual modalities, enabling a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that prevents information loss in deeper layers. The method maintains parameter efficiency by keeping the TSFM frozen while only training the steering vectors, allowing for efficient few-shot learning and effective forecasting performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 31.8% average reduction in MSE across seven forecasting benchmarks compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates effective few-shot learning capabilities through parameter-efficient adaptation
- Maintains performance improvements across diverse time series forecasting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MSEF framework succeeds by addressing the fundamental mismatch between how LLMs process sequential text versus time series data. By extracting semantically rich embeddings from a specialized Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) and injecting them at multiple layers rather than just the input, the framework ensures that time series patterns remain accessible throughout the LLM's depth. The layer-specific steering vectors act as learned bridges that continuously align the temporal and textual modalities, preventing the progressive information loss that occurs with shallow integration. This deep fusion approach leverages the LLM's hierarchical feature abstraction capabilities while maintaining the specialized temporal understanding captured by the TSFM.

## Foundational Learning

**Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)** - Specialized models trained on large temporal datasets to capture complex temporal patterns and generate rich embeddings. Why needed: Standard LLM embeddings lack the temporal domain expertise required for accurate forecasting. Quick check: Verify the frozen TSFM can generate semantically meaningful representations for diverse time series patterns.

**Layer-wise Semantic Abstraction in LLMs** - The progressive transformation of input representations through multiple layers, where early layers capture local patterns and deeper layers encode abstract semantic concepts. Why needed: Understanding how information flow changes across layers is crucial for effective multi-layer fusion. Quick check: Confirm that different layers capture different levels of temporal abstraction when combined with TSFM embeddings.

**Cross-modal Alignment Optimization** - The process of learning transformations that map representations from one modality (time series) to be compatible with another (textual). Why needed: Ensures the injected temporal information is properly interpreted by the LLM's processing mechanisms. Quick check: Validate that steering vectors converge to meaningful alignments rather than degenerate solutions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** TSFM (frozen) -> Time Series Embeddings -> Layer-specific Steering Vectors -> LLM Intermediate Layers

**Critical Path:** The sequence of operations from time series input through TSFM extraction, steering vector application, and fusion with LLM representations at each layer represents the critical path for information flow and performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances between depth of fusion (more layers = better information retention but higher computational cost) and parameter efficiency (keeping TSFM frozen vs. fine-tuning). The choice of layer-specific versus shared steering vectors represents another key tradeoff between specialization and efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor cross-modal alignment manifests as unstable training of steering vectors or degradation in LLM performance on pure text tasks. Overfitting to specific time series patterns may occur if steering vectors are not properly regularized. Information bottleneck at fusion points can limit the effectiveness of temporal signal propagation.

**First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing steering vectors at different layers to identify critical fusion points. 2) Comparison of frozen vs. fine-tuned TSFM performance to validate parameter efficiency claims. 3) Transfer learning experiments across different time series domains to test the robustness of learned steering vectors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the MSEF framework's performance scale effectively to significantly larger LLM architectures (e.g., 7B+ parameters) or different architectures beyond the tested Pythia-1B?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental section explicitly utilizes only the Pythia-1B model, leaving the behavior of the steering mechanism on larger or structurally different models unverified.
- **Why unresolved:** Larger models exhibit different layer-wise semantic abstraction capabilities, which may interact unpredictably with the layer-specific steering vectors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical benchmarks on larger foundation models (e.g., Llama-3-8B) demonstrating whether the parameter-efficient adaptation and performance gains hold.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can a sparse injection strategy (skipping layers) achieve comparable accuracy with lower inference latency than the proposed continuous injection at all layers?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The methodology injects vectors at every layer to prevent information loss, but this increases the sequence length processed by attention mechanisms at every step.
- **Why unresolved:** The trade-off between the depth of continuous fusion and computational overhead (inference speed) is not quantified in the efficiency claims.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of MSE/MAE versus wall-clock inference time when applying steering vectors only at strategic layer intervals.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How sensitive is the framework to the specific choice of the frozen Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) used for embedding extraction?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The method relies heavily on MOMENT for representations, while the related work section notes that effectively leveraging TSFMs with LLMs remains underexplored.
- **Why unresolved:** The steering vectors' ability to bridge the modality gap is likely dependent on the semantic richness of the specific TSFM embeddings used.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation experiments replacing MOMENT with other TSFMs (e.g., TimesFM or MOIRAI) to observe variance in alignment effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation focuses on MSE reduction without statistical significance testing or confidence intervals across benchmarks
- Claims of "efficient few-shot learning" lack quantitative validation with varying shot counts and baseline comparisons
- Computational overhead and inference-time efficiency are not discussed, which is critical for practical deployment
- Performance comparisons lack detailed baseline specifications and parameter count information

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core problem statement about shallow integration leading to information loss in deeper LLM layers is well-established in multimodal learning literature. The MSEF architecture description appears technically sound with clear mechanisms for layer-wise fusion and steering vector optimization.

**Medium confidence:** The claimed 31.8% average MSE reduction across seven benchmarks appears substantial, but without detailed baseline specifications, statistical validation, or individual benchmark results, the practical significance remains uncertain. The assertion that this enables "efficient few-shot learning" lacks supporting experimental evidence.

**Low confidence:** The paper's claim about continuous optimization of steering vectors facilitating "layer-specific adaptation" is theoretically plausible but lacks empirical validation showing how these adaptations improve over training or transfer across different time series domains.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing across all seven benchmarks with confidence intervals to verify the claimed 31.8% MSE reduction is robust and not due to random variation.

2. Design and execute controlled few-shot learning experiments with varying shot counts (1-5 shots) to empirically validate the claimed efficiency improvements, comparing against few-shot adapted baselines.

3. Measure and report inference-time computational overhead (FLOPs, latency, memory) of the MSEF framework compared to shallow integration methods to assess practical deployment feasibility.
