# RADAR: A Reasoning-Guided Attribution Framework for Explainable Visual Data Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16850
- Reference count: 27
- Introduces a framework that improves visual attribution accuracy by 15% through reasoning-guided decomposition

## Executive Summary
RADAR addresses the challenge of explainable visual data analysis by introducing a reasoning-guided framework that links generated answers and intermediate reasoning steps to specific chart regions through bounding boxes. The framework decomposes complex mathematical queries into sequential sub-operations, generating reasoning steps that guide the model to identify relevant visual regions with improved precision. By leveraging both the reasoning process and the final answer, RADAR achieves attribution quality that correlates strongly with improved answer generation performance (BERTScore ~0.90).

## Method Summary
RADAR employs a semi-automatic approach to curate a benchmark dataset of 17,819 samples spanning line and bar charts, questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. The framework uses a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with partial Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied exclusively to visual tokens while preserving the pre-trained language model's reasoning capabilities. The attribution process extracts hidden states from Layer 16 of the model, using cosine similarity between text embeddings (reasoning/answers) and spatial visual patches to generate bounding boxes that highlight the chart regions supporting the answer.

## Key Results
- Attribution accuracy improves by 15% over baseline methods (from ~0.02 to ~0.15 IoU)
- Attribution quality correlates with improved answer generation (BERTScore ~0.90)
- Successfully processes 1,068 pie charts with similar performance metrics
- Dataset covers 17,819 samples spanning line and bar charts with annotations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Reasoning-Guided Visual Search Decomposition
The framework forces the model to decompose complex mathematical queries into sequential sub-operations, reducing search space and ambiguity. Each text step is separately aligned to visual regions using cosine similarity, improving precision over direct answer-to-region mapping. This approach assumes the generated reasoning steps are factually correct and logically sound.

### Mechanism 2: Partial Adaptation of Visual Features (Partial-LoRA)
LoRA matrices are applied exclusively to visual tokens while keeping the pre-trained language model (InternLM-2) frozen, isolating visual feature adaptation from textual reasoning logic. This assumes the pre-trained LLM possesses sufficient mathematical reasoning capability and that the primary bottleneck is visual alignment.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Alignment via Hidden State Similarity
Attribution is generated by computing semantic similarity between text embeddings and spatial visual patches using internal model hidden states from Layer 16. A sliding window approach over the visual patch grid computes cosine similarity between text representation and visual regions, selecting high-similarity regions as bounding boxes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**
  - Why needed: RADAR is built on InternLM-XComposer2, requiring understanding of how vision encoders map images to tokens the LLM processes
  - Quick check: How does the CLIP ViT-Large encoder transform a chart image into a format the InternLM-2 language model can "read"?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed: The core innovation relies on reasoning-guided attribution, requiring the model to generate step-by-step textual explanations before drawing bounding boxes
  - Quick check: Why does prompting a model to "think step-by-step" change the internal hidden states used for attribution?

- **Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU)**
  - Why needed: The paper evaluates attribution success using "Multi-Box IoU," requiring understanding to interpret the 15% improvement and baseline scores
  - Quick check: If a predicted bounding box completely misses the ground truth region but covers an adjacent axis label, would the IoU score be high or low?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Chart Image + (Question, Answer) Pair -> CLIP ViT-Large (Visual) + InternLM-2 (Text) -> Partial-LoRA (visual tokens only) -> Layer 16 Hidden State Extraction -> Sliding Window (3x3 to 35x35) -> Cosine Similarity Scoring -> Bounding Box Coordinates + Reasoning Text

- **Critical path:** 1. Reasoning Generation from (C, Q, A) 2. State Extraction from Layer 16 3. Similarity Scoring via sliding window 4. Thresholding to select bounding boxes

- **Design tradeoffs:** Restrictive coordinate prompting format may degrade performance vs. natural language; fixed Layer 16 selection assumes universal optimality; semi-automatic data generation introduces teacher-student gap

- **Failure signatures:** Low IoU on VQA vs. VQR indicates failed visual search decomposition; numerical hallucination in reasoning leads to highlighting irrelevant regions; over-segmentation from sliding window getting stuck on high-frequency features

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Layer ablation (8, 16, 24) to validate Layer 16 optimality 2. Reasoning noise injection to quantify dependency on reasoning quality 3. Masked answer recovery to confirm bounding boxes contain necessary information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Can multi-layer feature extraction or alternative architectural choices improve attribution accuracy over the current reliance on layer 16 hidden states?
2. How does framework performance scale to complex chart types beyond the evaluated line, bar, and pie charts?
3. To what extent does the failure of automated reasoning generation bottleneck the final attribution performance in multi-step mathematical operations?

## Limitations
- Framework performance fundamentally constrained by quality of semi-automatically generated reasoning steps and attribution labels
- Generalization to complex chart types (scatter plots, heatmaps, multi-panel figures) not yet validated
- Fixed Layer 16 selection for semantic alignment lacks theoretical justification and may not be universally optimal

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** 15% improvement in attribution accuracy and correlation with answer generation are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence:** Scalability to pie charts and reasoning-guided attribution improvement are supported but need more rigorous testing
- **Low Confidence:** Claim that LoRA preserves language model reasoning capabilities lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic human audit of 500 randomly sampled reasoning steps to quantify hallucination rates and error types, then measure correlation with attribution failure modes

2. Evaluate RADAR on held-out test set containing scatter plots, heatmaps, and multi-panel figures to identify failure modes with non-standard visual layouts

3. Perform comprehensive ablation across all 32 layers to determine whether Layer 16 is universally optimal or varies by chart type, question category, or visual complexity
