# Solar PV Installation Potential Assessment on Building Facades Based on Vision and Language Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00797
- Reference count: 40
- SF-SPA framework achieves 6.2% ± 2.8% mean area estimation error on 80 buildings across 4 countries

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SF-SPA, an automated framework that uses street-view images to assess solar PV potential on building facades. The method corrects perspective distortion via homographic transformation, segments facade components using a vision-language model (zero-shot segmentation), and employs an LLM to generate PV layout plans. The framework was validated on 80 buildings across four countries, achieving a mean area estimation error of 6.2% ± 2.8% compared to expert annotations. Processing time averaged 100 seconds per building. Energy yield estimates were consistent with realistic meteorological data. The approach is efficient, scalable, and avoids the need for domain-specific training data or manual annotation, enabling city-scale BIPV potential assessments.

## Method Summary
The SF-SPA framework processes street-view images through a pipeline that begins with perspective correction using homographic transformation. It then applies zero-shot segmentation via a vision-language model to identify facade components. An LLM analyzes the segmented components to generate feasible PV layout plans, considering both technical constraints and aesthetic considerations. The framework estimates energy yield based on meteorological data and assumed panel characteristics. Validation was performed on 80 buildings across four countries, comparing automated assessments against expert annotations to measure accuracy and processing efficiency.

## Key Results
- Mean area estimation error of 6.2% ± 2.8% compared to expert annotations
- Average processing time of 100 seconds per building
- Energy yield estimates consistent with realistic meteorological data
- Validated on 80 buildings across four countries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages foundation models' ability to understand complex visual scenes and generate structured outputs without requiring task-specific training data. By combining geometric correction with semantic understanding, it can accurately identify viable installation surfaces even in challenging urban environments. The LLM component bridges the gap between component detection and practical installation planning by incorporating domain knowledge about PV system requirements, building codes, and aesthetic constraints. This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for multiple specialized models and manual intervention, making it scalable for city-wide assessments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Homographic transformation**: Why needed - corrects perspective distortion in street-view images to obtain accurate facade geometry. Quick check - verify straight building edges become truly parallel after transformation.
- **Zero-shot segmentation**: Why needed - identifies facade components without requiring labeled training data for each building type. Quick check - test segmentation accuracy on buildings with varied architectural styles.
- **LLM-based layout generation**: Why needed - translates component analysis into feasible PV installation plans considering technical and aesthetic constraints. Quick check - validate generated layouts against professional BIPV designs.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Street-view image -> Homographic transformation -> Zero-shot segmentation -> Component analysis -> LLM layout generation -> Energy yield estimation

**Critical path**: The homographic transformation and zero-shot segmentation steps form the critical path, as errors in geometric correction or component identification propagate through the entire pipeline and directly impact the quality of the final PV layout recommendations.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using a single LLM rather than specialized models for each task. This simplifies deployment but may limit performance on edge cases. The zero-shot approach avoids data collection overhead but may struggle with highly unusual architectural features.

**Failure signatures**: Common failure modes include perspective correction errors when buildings are significantly tilted, segmentation failures on facades with complex textures or colors, and LLM layout generation that violates local building codes or practical installation constraints.

**First experiments**:
1. Test framework on buildings with extreme perspective angles to measure geometric correction accuracy
2. Evaluate segmentation performance on buildings with unusual architectural features not present in the training corpus
3. Compare LLM-generated layouts against professional designs for a small sample of buildings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small validation sample size (80 buildings) may not represent full urban diversity
- Performance may degrade with obstructed views, poor lighting, or unusual architectural styles
- Energy yield predictions depend on external meteorological data quality and resolution
- Assumes uniform PV panel efficiency that may not reflect real-world installation conditions

## Confidence
- **High**: Core methodology combining homographic transformation, zero-shot segmentation, and LLM layout generation is technically sound
- **Medium**: Energy yield estimates depend on external meteorological datasets whose quality may vary by region
- **Low**: City-scale deployment readiness and comparative advantages require broader validation beyond current dataset

## Next Checks
1. Validate framework performance on a larger, more diverse dataset (>500 buildings) spanning additional geographic regions and architectural styles, with systematic testing of performance degradation under varying weather conditions and occlusion scenarios.

2. Conduct field validation by comparing framework predictions with actual installed BIPV systems on a sample of buildings, measuring both predicted versus actual energy yield and installation costs.

3. Perform sensitivity analysis on the LLM-generated layouts by comparing them against professional BIPV design solutions for the same buildings, evaluating both technical feasibility and aesthetic considerations.
