# SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.03791
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: Embedding-based metric achieves ROC AUC=0.99 and <7% overlap in discriminating correct vs random sign-text pairs

## Executive Summary
SiLVERScore addresses the fundamental challenge of evaluating sign language generation quality by replacing error-prone back-translation pipelines with direct video-text alignment in a joint embedding space. The metric uses contrastive learning to map sign videos and text to a shared semantic space, enabling direct similarity comparison that captures multimodal nuances like prosody and semantic variations. Experiments on PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets demonstrate that SiLVERScore substantially outperforms traditional text-based metrics in distinguishing correct from random pairs while maintaining robustness to word reordering and prosodic intensity.

## Method Summary
SiLVERScore computes a semantically-aware similarity score between generated sign videos and reference text by leveraging a pre-trained contrastive alignment model (CiCo) that maps both modalities to a joint embedding space. The video encoder combines domain-agnostic I3D features with domain-aware I3D features fine-tuned on the target dataset, processed through a Transformer initialized from CLIP ViT-B. Text is lowercased, BPE-tokenized, and translated to English to align with CLIP pretraining. The similarity is computed using a fine-grained matrix between video clips and word embeddings with softmax re-weighting, then scaled to [0,100]. The method requires dataset-specific fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance and cannot generalize well across different sign languages without adaptation.

## Key Results
- SiLVERScore achieves ROC AUC = 0.99 in discriminating correct vs random sign-text pairs with overlap < 7%
- The metric shows near-perfect robustness to word reordering (preserving semantic meaning) compared to sharp performance drops in BLEU and ROUGE
- SiLVERScore demonstrates less correlation with prosodic intensity than back-translation methods, maintaining stable score distributions across intensity levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Direct Cross-Modal Alignment via Contrastive Learning
- **Claim:** If sign videos and text are mapped to a shared embedding space using contrastive learning, semantic alignment can be measured directly, bypassing the error propagation inherent in back-translation pipelines.
- **Mechanism:** The system uses a pre-trained video-text alignment model (CiCo) trained with InfoNCE loss. This loss maximizes similarity for matched video-text pairs while minimizing it for unmatched pairs, creating a "joint embedding space" where distance equates to semantic difference.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained alignment model (CiCo) has successfully generalized the relationship between visual signing features and textual semantics within the target domain.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "SiLVERScore... assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space."
  - [section 3] "CiCo aligns video and text embeddings through a contrastive learning objective... maximizing the similarity of matched video-text pairs."
- **Break condition:** If the underlying alignment model is not fine-tuned on the specific sign language dataset, the embeddings may lack discriminative power, leading to poor metric performance.

### Mechanism 2: Fine-Grained Similarity Re-weighting
- **Claim:** Calculating similarity using a fine-grained matrix with softmax re-weighting allows the metric to focus on the most relevant cross-modal features rather than averaging all features indiscriminately.
- **Mechanism:** The model computes a similarity matrix $E$ between video clips and word embeddings. Instead of simple averaging, it applies softmax re-weighting ($E'$) to emphasize high-similarity alignments. This ensures that the final score reflects the strongest semantic correspondences (e.g., specific signs matching specific words) rather than diluting the score across mismatched segments.
- **Core assumption:** The "hard" alignment (high similarity) between specific video segments and text tokens is a reliable proxy for overall semantic correctness.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3] "To emphasize similarities, softmax re-weighting is applied... Row-wise summation followed by averaging yields the video-to-text similarity."
- **Break condition:** If the generated sign video contains spurious or highly active movements that accidentally match text tokens with high confidence (false positives), the re-weighting may overestimate the true semantic alignment.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Invariance to Surface Form
- **Claim:** Embedding-based metrics are inherently more robust to syntactic variations (like word reordering) than n-gram metrics, provided the underlying semantic meaning is preserved in the vector space.
- **Mechanism:** Unlike BLEU or ROUGE, which rely on exact token sequence matches, SiLVERScore compares high-level semantic vectors. Experiments show that when text is reordered (preserving meaning), SiLVERScore maintains high overlap scores, whereas rule-based metrics drop significantly.
- **Core assumption:** The embedding space is structured such that paraphrases or reordered sentences occupy a similar vector region to the original reference.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2] "SiLVERScore exhibits the highest score distribution, suggesting its robustness to reordering... In contrast, BLEU and ROUGE display sharp peaks... in the lower score range."
- **Break condition:** If the embedding model is sensitive to syntactic structure (e.g., strictly sequential encoders without robust pooling), reordering might alter the embedding significantly, breaking the invariance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the engine that creates the "joint embedding space." Without understanding that the model learns by pulling matched pairs together and pushing others apart, the mechanism for how the metric distinguishes "correct" from "random" pairs is opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the InfoNCE loss increase or decrease when a generated sign video is semantically distant from its reference text?

- **Concept: Back-Translation Error Propagation**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the problem the paper solves. One must understand that traditional metrics rely on an intermediate translation step which introduces noise (ambiguity in error attribution) and loses multimodal info (prosody).
  - **Quick check question:** If a back-translation model mistranslates a perfect sign video, will a text-based metric like BLEU correctly score the video generation model?

- **Concept: Multimodal Alignment (Video-Text)**
  - **Why needed here:** Sign Language is visual-spatial. Evaluating it requires bridging the gap between visual features (poses, movements) and linguistic features (text).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a simple Euclidean distance between raw video pixels and text indices fail to serve as a metric?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generated Sign Video + Reference Text -> Video Encoder (I3D + Transformer) -> Text Encoder (CLIP pipeline) -> Similarity Head (Matrix E + Softmax) -> Global Score (ZV2T) -> SiLVERScore (scaled 0-100)

- **Critical path:** The quality of the metric depends entirely on the Video Encoder's ability to extract meaningful temporal features and the Similarity Head's alignment logic. The scaling factor (3.5) is a post-hoc adjustment for human interpretability, not a functional component.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **CiCo vs. SignCLIP:** The authors chose CiCo because it avoids pose-estimation dependency and includes a sliding window for local alignment. However, Section 5 suggests SignCLIP may have different generalization properties; CiCo requires dataset-specific fine-tuning to avoid the "generalization problem."
  - **English-Centric:** The text side is translated to English to leverage CLIP embeddings. This introduces a dependency on translation quality for non-English source datasets (like PHOENIX-14T German).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Negation:** Case studies (Section G.1) show SiLVERScore fails on negations (e.g., "not quite" vs "is clear"), likely because the embedding space emphasizes content words over functional modifiers.
  - **Short Utterances:** Performance degrades on very short utterances where semantic distinctions are subtle.
  - **Generalization Drop:** Without fine-tuning on the target domain, the alignment is diffuse (Section 5.1); the metric will fail to distinguish correct from random pairs (AUC drops).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Discrimination Test:** Calculate ROC AUC and overlap percentage between ground-truth pairs and randomized (mismatched) pairs on PHOENIX-14T to verify the embedding space separates signal from noise.
  2. **Semantic Robustness Test:** Use GPT-4o to reorder reference sentences (preserving meaning) and measure the correlation drop between SiLVERScore and BLEU. Expect SiLVERScore to remain stable while BLEU drops.
  3. **Prosody Stress Test:** Group samples by prosodic intensity (None, Low, High) and plot score distributions. Verify that SiLVERScore distributions remain stable while back-translation-based scores degrade as intensity increases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does SiLVERScore correlate more strongly with human judgments of semantic correctness and naturalness than back-translation-based metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state in the Limitations section that "it remains crucial to validate its alignment with human judgments" and note the complete "absence of human evaluation" in the current study.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper relies on automated proxies for evaluation, such as discrimination between correct/random pairs and robustness to word reordering, rather than conducting user studies with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing signers.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Correlation coefficients (e.g., Kendall’s Tau) between SiLVERScore outputs and human expert ratings of generated sign language videos on a standardized test set.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can embedding-based metrics for sign language generation generalize effectively across diverse datasets without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5 ("The Generalization Problem") demonstrates that existing models like SignCLIP fail to generalize, leading to the conclusion that "tailoring metrics to specific datasets is necessary" under current constraints.
- **Why unresolved:** While SiLVERScore uses a joint embedding space, the underlying video encoder (CiCo) utilizes domain-aware features fine-tuned on specific datasets (PHOENIX-14T/CSL-Daily), and the authors note that conventional data augmentation fails to solve this lack of generalization.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful evaluation performance (e.g., high ROC AUC) of a single SiLVERScore model trained on one dataset (e.g., PHOENIX-14T) when applied zero-shot to a completely unrelated domain (e.g., How2Sign).

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can explicit prosodic modeling be integrated into embedding-based metrics to distinguish between semantic equivalence and expressive variation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section notes that while SiLVERScore is robust to prosody (it does not penalize it), "this does not imply that the metric explicitly models prosody," and calls for future research to investigate this incorporation.
- **Why unresolved:** The current metric treats high-intensity and low-intensity signing as equally valid matches for the reference text, failing to capture the "expressive nuances" identified by the authors as critical for comprehensive evaluation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified metric that can independently score or weight prosodic accuracy alongside semantic accuracy, showing a correlation with human ratings of expressive quality.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can evaluation metrics be adapted to capture discourse-level dependencies and references that extend beyond the sentence level?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors acknowledge in the Limitations that they "currently assess alignment at the sentence level," which "overlooks discourse-level dependencies," and state that capturing long-range dependencies is "crucial for a truly comprehensive evaluation."
- **Why unresolved:** Sign language frequently uses spatial referents established in earlier sentences, but the current similarity calculation (ZV2T) operates on individual video-text pairs, missing these cross-sentence spatial relationships.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A metric architecture that incorporates context from preceding signs (e.g., a sliding context window) demonstrating improved accuracy on datasets containing multi-sentence discourse.

## Limitations
- **Generalization Dependency:** Performance heavily depends on fine-tuning the alignment model on the target sign language dataset, limiting zero-shot capability.
- **Negation Sensitivity:** The metric struggles with sentences containing negations or functional elements where semantic meaning relies on specific word order.
- **English-Centric Design:** Translation to English for CLIP alignment introduces potential error propagation from translation quality.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Superior discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC = 0.99)
- **Medium Confidence:** Robustness to semantic variations from synthetic reorderings
- **Medium Confidence:** Advantage over back-translation methods for prosodic intensity

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test:** Evaluate SiLVERScore on a sign language dataset (e.g., American Sign Language) without fine-tuning the alignment model to quantify performance degradation and establish the true generalization gap.
2. **Negation Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically generate sign language videos containing various negation patterns and measure SiLVERScore's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect negations, comparing against human judgments.
3. **Real-World Paraphrasing Test:** Collect human-generated paraphrases of reference sentences and measure SiLVERScore's consistency across these variations, comparing against back-translation baselines to validate robustness claims beyond synthetic reorderings.
