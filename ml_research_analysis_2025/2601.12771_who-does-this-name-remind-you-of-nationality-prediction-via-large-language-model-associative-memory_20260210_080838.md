# Who Does This Name Remind You of ? Nationality Prediction via Large Language Model Associative Memory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12771
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12771
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: LAMA achieves 0.817 accuracy on 99-country nationality prediction, outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LAMA (LLM Associative Memory Agents), a framework that improves nationality prediction from names by leveraging large language models' world knowledge as associative memory rather than relying on direct reasoning. The method uses a dual-agent architecture to recall famous individuals with similar names and aggregates their nationalities via voting. LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy on a 99-country classification task, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. The key insight is that LLMs are more reliable at recalling concrete examples than applying abstract linguistic rules.

## Method Summary
LAMA uses a dual-agent architecture where the Person Agent recalls politicians, scientists, and historical figures while the Media Agent focuses on athletes and entertainers. Each agent recalls up to four individuals with similar names and their nationalities via JSON-formatted LLM calls. The recall results are aggregated through majority voting, with conditional prediction strategies applied depending on recall success. For cases where no individuals are recalled, the system falls back to direct LLM prediction. A completion phase generates Top-K predictions considering cultural and geographic similarity.

## Key Results
- LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy on 99-country nationality prediction task
- Outperformed conventional LLM methods (CoT, Self-Consistency, Self-Reflection) by 5-8 percentage points
- Demonstrated robustness to low-frequency nationalities and effectiveness across multiple granularity levels (nationality, region, continent)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete factual examples than in applying abstract linguistic rules
- The system queries LLM's stored knowledge of specific famous individuals rather than inferring from phonological patterns
- Core assumption: Concrete entity knowledge is more robustly encoded than procedural linguistic rules
- Evidence: LAMA outperforms reasoning-based methods; direct recall of famous individuals is more reliable than rule abstraction

### Mechanism 2
- Dual-agent architecture with domain-specialized prompts yields complementary recall coverage
- Person Agent targets politicians/scientists; Media Agent targets athletes/entertainers
- Core assumption: Knowledge is distributed across domain-associated representations
- Evidence: Removing either agent individually drops accuracy by only 0.002; removing both drops it by 0.064

### Mechanism 3
- Voting aggregation over multiple recalled nationalities improves Top-1 prediction stability
- Frequency counting across up to 8 recalled individuals provides empirical distribution
- Core assumption: Nationality labels of correctly recalled individuals are more often correct than incorrect
- Evidence: LAMA's recall-based evidence is more reliable than reasoning paths used in Self-Consistency

## Foundational Learning

- **Associative Memory in Cognitive Science**: Why needed: LAMA mimics human cognitive processes—when humans see a name, they recall famous individuals rather than applying phonological rules. Quick check: Can you explain why recalling "Kakuei Tanaka" is more reliable than analyzing "Tanaka" phonologically?

- **Ensemble Methods and Majority Voting**: Why needed: The voting mechanism over recalled nationalities is an ensemble technique. Quick check: If 5 recalled individuals have nationalities [Japanese, Japanese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese], what is the Top-1 prediction and why?

- **LLM Prompting Strategies (CoT, Self-Consistency, Self-Reflection)**: Why needed: These are the baselines LAMA outperforms. Quick check: How does Self-Consistency differ from LAMA's voting, given both use aggregation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input name → parallel Person/Media Agent calls (2 API calls) → aggregation → voting for Top-1 → completion for ranks 2-5 (1 API call)
- **Critical path**: 3 API calls on success, 4 on recall failure (includes fallback)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Completion phase slightly reduces Top-1 accuracy (+0.001) but improves Precision@5 by +0.043
- **Failure signatures**: Empty recall triggers fallback path; hallucinated individuals may introduce errors; wrong-nationality recall can be amplified by voting
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate single-agent vs. dual-agent ablation to verify drop patterns. 2) Measure recall success rate stratified by name frequency. 3) Swap completion prompt for null prompt to isolate reasoning contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How does LAMA's performance generalize across different large language models (Claude, Gemini, Llama, smaller open-source models)? The paper only tested GPT-4.1-mini.

2. Is the recall-based associative memory approach effective for attribute prediction tasks beyond nationality (e.g., industry from organization names)? The paper only tested nationality prediction.

3. What is the optimal number of recalled individuals (M) per agent, and how does this affect accuracy versus computational cost? The paper set M=4 empirically without systematic optimization.

4. Can multiple recall attempts or reliability scoring of recalled individuals mitigate LAMA's dependency on nationality distribution in LLM training data? This remains as future work.

## Limitations

- Reliance on concrete knowledge coverage: Method fails when target names or nationalities are absent from LLM pre-training data (~17-18% fallback rate)
- Arbitrary 99-class nationality taxonomy may limit generalizability to different granularity levels
- No external validation of whether domain-specialized prompts truly access disjoint knowledge regions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Empirical performance superiority over conventional LLM prompting methods
- **Medium Confidence**: LLMs encode concrete entity knowledge more robustly than abstract linguistic rules
- **Medium Confidence**: Dual-agent architecture provides complementary coverage through domain-specialized prompts
- **Medium Confidence**: Voting aggregation improves stability, but systematic bias in errors requires investigation

## Next Checks

1. Replicate single-agent vs. dual-agent ablation on held-out subset to verify 0.002 vs. 0.064 drop pattern

2. Measure and stratify recall success rate and accuracy by name frequency (Head/Mid/Tail categories)

3. Swap completion prompt for null prompt while maintaining candidate generation to isolate reasoning contribution
