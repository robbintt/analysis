# Geological Inference from Textual Data using Word Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07490
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Autoencoder reduces prediction error to 511.8 km vs. 1033.7 km baseline for locating lithium deposits

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that Natural Language Processing can identify cities near lithium deposits by analyzing word embeddings trained on geological text data. The approach uses GloVe to create semantic representations of words, then applies dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoder, VAE, VAE-LSTM) to enhance feature extraction. Cities semantically related to "lithium" are identified via cosine similarity and validated against actual lithium mine locations using the haversine equation. The Autoencoder method achieves the lowest prediction error (511.8 km), significantly outperforming PCA and other methods, though further refinement is needed to address city name ambiguity and improve spatial accuracy.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves training GloVe word embeddings (200 dimensions) on a corpus of geological texts from the British Geological Survey, then reducing dimensionality to 2D using four different methods. Cities are filtered from the vocabulary and ranked by cosine similarity to the "lithium" vector in the reduced space. The top-10 cities are validated against known lithium deposit locations using haversine distance calculations. The approach addresses the challenge of extracting spatial-resource relationships from unstructured geological text by leveraging semantic associations captured in word embeddings.

## Key Results
- Autoencoder achieves lowest prediction error at 511.8 km, outperforming PCA (1033.7 km baseline)
- Non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (Autoencoder, VAE) outperform linear PCA
- Semantic ranking correlates with physical proximity to lithium deposits
- City name ambiguity identified as a limitation affecting prediction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Co-occurrence patterns in geological text encode spatial-resource relationships
If geological literature discusses mineral deposits alongside location names with sufficient frequency, word co-occurrence statistics will encode latent spatial associations. GloVe constructs a co-occurrence matrix from the corpus; words appearing in similar geological contexts receive proximal vector representations. Cities frequently mentioned near "lithium" in geological reports develop vector similarity to the target keyword. This works when geological texts exhibit consistent patterns linking specific locations to mineral resources, and these patterns are not overwhelmed by noise from unrelated co-occurrences.

### Mechanism 2: Non-linear dimensionality reduction preserves task-relevant features while discarding noise
Autoencoders may outperform linear methods (PCA) because geological semantic relationships are non-linearly structured in embedding space. The autoencoder's hidden layers (128→64→32→16→8→2) learn compressed representations by minimizing reconstruction error. Non-linear activations (ReLU) enable capture of complex manifold structures that linear PCA cannot represent. This is effective when the 200-dimensional GloVe space contains both signal (geological-spatial relationships) and noise (irrelevant semantic associations), and these are non-linearly separable.

### Mechanism 3: Cosine similarity in reduced space predicts physical proximity when benchmarked against known deposits
Higher cosine similarity between "lithium" and city vectors in the reduced space correlates with smaller haversine distances to actual lithium mines. After dimensionality reduction, cosine similarity ranks cities by semantic relatedness. The haversine equation converts latitude/longitude pairs to kilometer distances, enabling validation against the BGS Global Lithium Deposit Map. This correlation works when semantic proximity in geological text correlates with physical proximity to resources; the relationship is strong enough that top-10 similar cities will be measurably closer to mines than random cities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Word embeddings (GloVe)**: Why needed here: GloVe is the core representation; understanding that it encodes co-occurrence statistics as vector geometry is prerequisite to interpreting why "lithium" and city names become proximal. Quick check: If two words never co-occur in the training corpus but share similar neighboring words, will GloVe assign them similar vectors? (Answer: Yes, through indirect co-occurrence structure.)

- **Dimensionality reduction trade-offs (PCA vs. Autoencoder vs. VAE)**: Why needed here: The paper's central finding is that non-linear reduction (autoencoder) outperforms linear (PCA); understanding why requires grasping manifold learning vs. variance maximization. Quick check: Why might PCA place two semantically unrelated cities close together in 2D space? (Answer: If they share high-variance dimensions unrelated to the target concept.)

- **Cosine similarity vs. Euclidean distance**: Why needed here: The paper uses cosine similarity for semantic ranking but haversine for physical distance; understanding normalization-by-magnitude is critical. Quick check: If city A's embedding has magnitude 10 and city B's has magnitude 2, but both point in the same direction, which distance metric treats them as equivalent? (Answer: Cosine similarity; Euclidean distance would show large separation.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: BGS geological texts → GloVe training corpus → 200-dim embeddings → dimensionality reduction (PCA/Autoencoder/VAE/VAE-LSTM) → 2D latent space → cosine similarity ranking → top-10 cities → haversine validation vs. known mines

- **Critical path**: GloVe training quality → dimensionality reduction method selection → cosine similarity threshold for city ranking. The autoencoder's architecture (5 hidden layers, 2D latent) is the most sensitive design choice affecting prediction error.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Embedding dimensionality (200 vs. 300)**: Lower dimension reduces complexity but may lose fine-grained semantic distinctions
  - **Latent space dimensionality (2D)**: Chosen for visualization; higher dimensions might preserve more information but complicate interpretation
  - **City name filtering**: Using cities as location proxies introduces ambiguity (e.g., multiple cities named "Laval") but provides standardized coordinate lookup

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **City name ambiguity**: Multiple cities sharing names (e.g., "Laval" in Quebec and Pays de la Loire) receive identical similarity scores, inflating false positives
  - **Polysemous city names**: Words like "Formosa" may appear as geographic references or in unrelated contexts, contaminating similarity scores
  - **Regional corpus bias**: Training only on BGS publications (British Columbia focus) may limit generalization to global lithium deposits
  - **Non-spatial semantic associations**: "Lithium" may associate with battery manufacturing cities rather than mining locations

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce baseline**: Train GloVe on the BGS corpus, compute top-10 cities for "lithium" without dimensionality reduction, validate haversine RMSE against reported 1033.7 km
  2. **Ablate autoencoder architecture**: Test whether reducing hidden layers (e.g., 64→32→2) or increasing latent dimensionality (e.g., 4D, 8D) improves prediction error beyond 511.8 km
  3. **Disambiguate city names**: Add country/region suffixes to city vectors (e.g., "Laval_Quebec" vs. "Laval_France") and measure impact on cosine similarity distribution and haversine accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the spatial accuracy be improved by implementing methods to disambiguate cities with shared names (homonyms) or cities named after common nouns?
- Basis in paper: The authors identify "ambiguity in the city names" as a limitation where different cities sharing a name are treated as identical, skewing similarity scores.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology treats city names as unique string identifiers without utilizing surrounding context or metadata to separate distinct locations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A revised model using context-aware disambiguation that yields a lower haversine distance error compared to the current 511.8 km autoencoder baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP outperform the autoencoder in mapping semantic relationships to physical proximity?
- Basis in paper: The discussion suggests exploring these techniques in future work to potentially "improve separation without over-compressing relevant features."
- Why unresolved: The study only benchmarked PCA, Autoencoder, VAE, and VAE-LSTM, leaving other non-linear methods untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking t-SNE or UMAP on the same dataset using the haversine distance metric to see if they lower the prediction error below that of the autoencoder.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating non-city geographical predictors (e.g., districts, roads) improve prediction accuracy despite the risk of lower term frequency in the corpus?
- Basis in paper: The authors note a limitation where using only city names restricts accuracy, but suggest that other indicators could be used "if such words... appear in the original texts."
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between the spatial precision of specific location markers (districts) and their data availability in the text corpus remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of model performance when the vocabulary is expanded to include administrative regions or physical landmarks.

## Limitations
- City name ambiguity affects prediction accuracy when multiple locations share identical names
- Corpus bias toward British Columbia geological reports may limit global generalizability
- Semantic associations may reflect industrial/technological contexts rather than actual mining locations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The Autoencoder outperforms PCA in reducing prediction error (511.8 km vs. 1033.7 km baseline), and the methodology for benchmarking against known lithium deposits using haversine distance is sound
- **Medium confidence**: The GloVe embeddings successfully capture geological semantic relationships from the BGS corpus, though validation is limited to this specific domain without comparison to other geological text sources
- **Low confidence**: The claim that non-linear dimensionality reduction is inherently superior for this task requires further validation, as the improvement may stem from specific architectural choices rather than non-linearity per se

## Next Checks
1. Disambiguate city names by adding country/region suffixes (e.g., "Laval_Quebec") and measure impact on prediction accuracy and false positive rates
2. Test corpus generalization by training GloVe on diverse geological publications from multiple regions and comparing prediction performance against the BGS-only baseline
3. Compare autoencoder performance against other non-linear methods (t-SNE, UMAP) while varying latent dimensionality to determine if 2D compression is optimal for this task
