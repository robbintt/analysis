# Tensor Dynamic Mode Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02627
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02627
- Reference count: 23
- The paper proposes tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel extension of dynamic mode decomposition to third-order tensors using the T-product framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel extension of dynamic mode decomposition that operates directly on third-order tensor data using the T-product framework. Unlike standard DMD which flattens multiway data into matrices, TDMD preserves spatial-temporal structures through tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD) and tensor eigenvalue decomposition (TEVD). The method demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage compared to standard DMD with data flattening.

The approach is particularly suited for analyzing images, videos, and higher-order networks, offering applications in video processing, biomedical imaging, and sensor networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and a video dataset with 20 frames demonstrate that TDMD achieves significantly lower reconstruction errors and successfully separates static background from moving foreground, whereas standard DMD fails to achieve clean separation.

## Method Summary
TDMD extends the dynamic mode decomposition framework to third-order tensors by leveraging the T-product framework, which enables matrix-like operations on tensors. The method operates directly on tensor-structured data rather than flattening it into matrices, preserving the inherent multiway structure through tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD) and tensor eigenvalue decomposition (TEVD). This approach maintains spatial-temporal relationships within the data while enabling efficient computation and better structural information preservation compared to standard DMD approaches that rely on data flattening.

## Key Results
- TDMD achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of structural information compared to standard DMD with data flattening
- On a video dataset with 20 frames, TDMD achieved significantly lower reconstruction errors and successfully separated static background from moving foreground
- The method can be extended to higher-order tensors beyond third-order, offering potential applications in video processing, biomedical imaging, and sensor networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TDMD leverages the T-product framework to perform matrix-like operations on third-order tensors while preserving their inherent structure. By avoiding the information loss associated with flattening multiway data into matrices, TDMD maintains spatial-temporal relationships that are crucial for accurate dynamic mode decomposition. The tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD) and tensor eigenvalue decomposition (TEVD) enable efficient computation while capturing the essential modes of variation in the tensor data, leading to improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard DMD approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- T-product framework: A mathematical framework enabling matrix-like operations on tensors, essential for extending linear algebra concepts to higher-order data structures
- Tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD): Extension of SVD to tensors that captures multiway data structure, critical for dimensionality reduction and mode extraction
- Tensor eigenvalue decomposition (TEVD): Extension of eigenvalue decomposition to tensors, necessary for dynamic mode analysis in tensor space
- Data flattening: Process of converting multiway data into matrices, which can lead to information loss and structural distortion
- Spatial-temporal structure preservation: Maintaining relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions in multiway data, crucial for accurate dynamic analysis

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input tensor -> T-product operations -> TSVD/TEVD -> Dynamic modes -> Output
- Critical path: Tensor data → T-product framework → Tensor decompositions → Mode extraction → Reconstruction/Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Direct tensor operation (preserves structure) vs. data flattening (simpler but lossy), computational complexity vs. accuracy
- Failure signatures: Poor separation of background/foreground in video, high reconstruction error, computational inefficiency for very large tensors
- First experiments: 1) Apply TDMD to synthetic third-order tensor data with known modes, 2) Test TDMD on video frames for background-foreground separation, 3) Compare computational time and memory usage with standard DMD on tensors of varying sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation relies primarily on synthetic data and a single video dataset, potentially limiting generalizability
- Computational complexity analysis lacks detailed empirical verification across different tensor sizes and ranks
- Comparison with standard DMD is based on data flattening, but alternative tensor-based DMD approaches are not explored as baselines
- Extension to higher-order tensors is theoretically proposed but not empirically validated for very high-dimensional data

## Confidence
- TDMD framework and mathematical formulation: High
- Computational efficiency claims: Medium (based on limited experiments)
- Superiority over standard DMD: Medium (single comparison scenario)
- Extension to higher-order tensors: Low (theoretical only)

## Next Checks
1. Implement TDMD on multiple real-world datasets beyond video, including biomedical imaging and sensor network data, to verify cross-domain applicability
2. Compare TDMD against other tensor-based DMD variants and deep learning approaches for video background-foreground separation
3. Conduct extensive scalability testing with tensors of varying orders, dimensions, and ranks to characterize computational complexity bounds and memory requirements
