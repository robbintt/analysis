# An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Text Summarization Tasks Using Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.05123
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05123
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets reveals significant performance variations based on dataset characteristics, prompt design, and context length, with Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Llama-2-70b-chat showing strongest overall performance.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates six large language models (LLMs) - Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, Llama-2-70b-chat, Llama-2-13b-chat, Llama-3-8b-instruct, Gemma-7b-it, and Zephyr-7b-beta - across four datasets spanning news, dialogue, and scientific domains using prompt engineering techniques. The evaluation employs both zero-shot learning and in-context learning with multiple prompts to assess model performance. Key findings reveal that model effectiveness varies significantly based on dataset characteristics, with in-context learning generally outperforming zero-shot approaches. The study introduces a sentence-based chunking strategy for handling long scientific documents, which improves summarization quality for certain models while showing inconsistent effects for others. The research provides actionable insights into optimizing LLMs for text summarization tasks, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and architectural considerations for handling different document types and lengths.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic evaluation framework testing six LLMs across four datasets (CNN/DailyMail, SAMSum, ArXiv, and PubMed) using both zero-shot and in-context learning approaches. Multiple prompts are designed for each dataset to assess prompt effectiveness, with a particular focus on scientific documents requiring long-context handling. The evaluation methodology includes automatic metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, MoverScore) and qualitative analysis of generated summaries. A sentence-based chunking strategy is introduced for long documents, splitting text into 100-word chunks with 50-word overlaps to preserve context. The study compares model performance across different prompt types, context lengths, and dataset characteristics to identify optimal configurations for text summarization tasks.

## Key Results
- Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Llama-2-70b-chat demonstrate strong overall performance across all datasets, with Mixtral excelling particularly in scientific document summarization
- In-context learning consistently outperforms zero-shot approaches across most datasets, though the performance gap varies significantly by dataset type
- The sentence-based chunking strategy improves summarization quality for Mixtral-8x7B and Llama-2-70b-chat but shows inconsistent or negative effects for smaller models (Llama-2-13b, Gemma-7b)
- ROUGE-1 scores vary by up to 14 points across different prompts for the same model-dataset pair, highlighting the critical importance of prompt engineering
- Scientific document summarization presents unique challenges, with ROUGE scores typically 10-15 points lower than news and dialogue domains due to domain complexity and document length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that LLM performance in text summarization is highly dependent on the alignment between model architecture, prompt design, and dataset characteristics. Models with larger context windows and more sophisticated attention mechanisms (Mixtral-8x7B, Llama-2-70b) better handle long scientific documents through effective information retention across document segments. The chunking strategy works by preserving local context while maintaining global coherence through overlap regions, though its effectiveness depends on how well the model's attention mechanism can integrate information across chunks. Prompt engineering influences performance by providing appropriate task framing, output constraints, and context guidance that align with the model's training distribution and capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
**Prompt Engineering for LLMs**
*Why needed*: Different prompt formulations can lead to performance variations of up to 14 ROUGE-1 points for the same model-dataset combination
*Quick check*: Test multiple prompt variants (instructional, role-based, constraint-focused) on a validation sample to identify optimal formulation

**Context Window Management**
*Why needed*: Scientific documents often exceed standard context windows, requiring strategies to maintain coherence across document segments
*Quick check*: Compare summarization quality using full context versus chunked approaches with varying overlap percentages

**Evaluation Metric Selection**
*Why needed*: Different metrics capture different aspects of summary quality, with ROUGE favoring lexical overlap while BERTScore captures semantic similarity
*Quick check*: Run all three metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, MoverScore) on sample outputs to understand their agreement patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Models -> Prompt Templates -> Context Processing (chunking) -> Summarization Output -> Evaluation Metrics (ROUGE/BERTScore/MoverScore) -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path**
Prompt Design -> Context Preparation (including chunking if needed) -> Model Inference -> Evaluation -> Analysis of results and optimization

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Zero-shot vs. in-context learning: Zero-shot offers simplicity but in-context provides better performance through demonstration
- Chunk size and overlap: Larger chunks preserve more context but increase computational cost and may exceed context limits
- Prompt specificity vs. flexibility: More specific prompts constrain output but may limit creativity; general prompts offer flexibility but risk off-topic content

**Failure Signatures**
- Low ROUGE scores with high BERTScore may indicate effective paraphrasing that lexical metrics fail to capture
- Consistent degradation across multiple prompts suggests model limitations for the dataset domain
- Performance drop when exceeding context window indicates need for chunking strategy

**First Experiments**
1. Test all six models with zero-shot prompts on CNN/DailyMail to establish baseline performance rankings
2. Apply sentence-based chunking to long documents and compare performance with full-context processing
3. Evaluate the same model-dataset pairs with multiple prompts to quantify prompt sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What architectural and training characteristics determine whether a chunking strategy improves long-document summarization, given that Mixtral-8x7B and Llama-2-70B benefit while Llama-2-13B and Gemma-7B show no improvement or slight degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 states: "the benefits of chunking can vary depending on model architecture and inherent handling of long contexts" and Table 15 shows inconsistent gains across models.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the variability but does not investigate which specific architectural properties (e.g., attention mechanisms, positional encoding strategies, mixture-of-experts routing) explain why certain models benefit from chunking while others do not.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies across models with controlled architectural variations, correlation analysis between chunking effectiveness and architectural features like context window utilization patterns or attention head behavior.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can prompt design be systematically optimized for each domain-dataset combination, given the observed performance variability of up to 14 ROUGE-1 points across different prompts for the same model-dataset pair?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1.1 discusses prompt effectiveness, and Section 5.1 notes "noticeable variations are observed in model performance across different prompts within the same dataset" without providing systematic optimization guidelines.
- Why unresolved: The paper tests multiple prompts per dataset but treats prompt selection as empirical trial-and-error rather than a principled optimization problem; no framework predicts which prompt characteristics will work best for which domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments systematically varying prompt linguistic features (length, specificity, role-framing, output constraints) and correlating these with performance across datasets, potentially using automated prompt optimization methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What evaluation metrics can better capture the quality of LLM-generated summaries that paraphrase content effectively but achieve low lexical overlap with reference summaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.5 discusses that "ROUGE tends to favor shorter summaries and may penalize models that generate longer but equally valid summaries" and notes "its reliance on exact word matches makes it less effective for capturing paraphrased content." Section 5.6 shows generated summaries that are "paraphrased from the reference summaries but remain informative."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the metric limitations but only uses ROUGE and BERTScore, leaving open how to properly evaluate paraphrased yet semantically accurate LLM outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation studies between automated metrics and human evaluations specifically focusing on paraphrased summaries, development of metrics that penalize factual errors while rewarding valid semantic preservation regardless of lexical overlap.

## Limitations
- The study relies primarily on automated evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, MoverScore) that may not fully capture semantic fidelity or factual consistency of generated summaries
- The sentence-based chunking strategy may introduce context fragmentation affecting summary coherence, particularly for models that don't benefit from this approach
- The evaluation focuses on prompt engineering techniques without exploring model-specific architectural adaptations or fine-tuning strategies that could further improve performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The comparative performance rankings between Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Llama-2-70b-chat across datasets are well-supported by consistent metric improvements across multiple evaluation measures
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that in-context learning generally outperforms zero-shot approaches requires qualification, as performance gains vary significantly across dataset types and prompt designs, with some zero-shot configurations showing competitive results
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that sentence-based chunking universally improves summarization quality for long scientific documents needs further validation, as the improvement may be dataset-specific rather than a generalizable technique

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing the sentence-based chunking strategy against sliding window and hierarchical approaches on additional long-document datasets to determine optimal context preservation techniques
2. Implement human evaluation studies focusing on factual consistency and coherence metrics alongside automated scores to validate whether ROUGE and embedding-based metrics accurately reflect summary quality
3. Test the prompt engineering configurations across a broader range of model sizes and architectures (including smaller models) to assess whether findings generalize beyond the specific models evaluated in this study
