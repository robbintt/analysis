# Advancing physiological time series reconstruction and imputation via mixture of receptive fields and experts fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07873
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07873
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel Diffusion-based MoE framework with RFAMoE and Fusion MoE achieves superior reconstruction/imputation on ECG/PSG, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy metrics

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of reconstructing and imputing physiological time series data, which often exhibit high variability and noise across channels. The authors propose a novel Diffusion-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that integrates a Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module to adaptively select convolution kernels for each channel and a Fusion MoE module to generate fused denoising factors in a single inference step. The method is validated on ECG and PSG datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models in reconstruction and imputation tasks. On the PTB dataset, it achieves a PRD of 7.21, SSD of 21.63, and MAD of 0.66, significantly surpassing existing approaches while reducing computational cost.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach combines a Diffusion-based Mixture of Experts framework with two key innovations: the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module and the Fusion MoE module. The RFAMoE adaptively selects convolution kernels for each channel based on its specific characteristics, addressing the heterogeneity of physiological signals. The Fusion MoE generates fused denoising factors in a single inference step, improving computational efficiency compared to traditional diffusion models. The framework processes each channel independently while maintaining global coherence through the MoE architecture, allowing for effective reconstruction and imputation of missing or corrupted physiological time series data.

## Key Results
- On PTB dataset: PRD of 7.21, SSD of 21.63, and MAD of 0.66
- Achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models
- Reduces computational cost while maintaining or improving accuracy metrics
- Effective on both ECG and PSG datasets demonstrating broad applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the strengths of mixture of experts architectures combined with diffusion models. The RFAMoE module allows each channel to be processed with specialized convolution kernels that match its unique characteristics, while the Fusion MoE enables efficient single-step inference by generating fused denoising factors. This approach addresses the key challenges in physiological time series reconstruction: channel heterogeneity, noise patterns, and computational efficiency. The diffusion process provides robust denoising capabilities while the MoE structure allows for adaptive, specialized processing of different signal types within the same framework.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models**
- Why needed: Provide robust denoising and generation capabilities for time series data
- Quick check: Can the model progressively remove noise and reconstruct clean signals?

**Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
- Why needed: Allows specialized processing for different signal channels with varying characteristics
- Quick check: Does each expert contribute meaningfully to the reconstruction?

**Receptive Field Adaptation**
- Why needed: Enables channel-specific processing by selecting appropriate convolution kernels
- Quick check: Are different channels receiving appropriately tailored kernel sizes?

**Single-step Inference**
- Why needed: Reduces computational cost compared to iterative diffusion approaches
- Quick check: Can the model generate accurate reconstructions in one forward pass?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
RFAMoE Module -> Fusion MoE Module -> Denoising Network -> Reconstructed Signal

**Critical Path**
Input signal → RFAMoE kernel selection → Channel-wise processing → Fusion MoE integration → Denoising → Output

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework balances computational efficiency (single-step inference) with reconstruction accuracy. Using MoE allows for specialized processing without excessive parameter growth, while the fusion approach trades some flexibility for speed. The adaptive kernel selection in RFAMoE adds complexity but improves channel-specific handling.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failure modes include: kernel selection errors in RFAMoE leading to inappropriate processing, fusion module creating artifacts in the denoised output, and generalization issues to signals with characteristics very different from training data.

**First Experiments**
1. Test reconstruction accuracy on clean signals with synthetic noise injection
2. Evaluate performance with different levels of missing data (20%, 50%, 80% gaps)
3. Compare computational efficiency against standard diffusion models on identical hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on relatively short-duration signals, raising questions about scalability to longer monitoring periods typical in clinical settings
- Performance gains need validation across more diverse physiological signals beyond ECG and PSG
- Computational efficiency claims are based on limited comparisons without broader benchmarking against non-diffusion alternatives

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The methodology is technically sound and the ablation studies are rigorous
**Medium confidence:** The performance improvements are real but may be dataset-dependent
**Low confidence:** Generalizability to other physiological signals and clinical deployment scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on longer-duration physiological signals (10+ minutes) to assess temporal consistency and computational scalability
2. Validate across additional physiological modalities (e.g., PPG, EMG, respiration) to confirm broad applicability
3. Conduct user studies with clinicians to evaluate the practical utility and interpretability of reconstructed signals in diagnostic contexts
