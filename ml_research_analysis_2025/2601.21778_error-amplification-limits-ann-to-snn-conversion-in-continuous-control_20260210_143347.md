# Error Amplification Limits ANN-to-SNN Conversion in Continuous Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21778
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Error amplification from temporally correlated action approximation errors causes performance degradation in ANN-to-SNN conversion for continuous control; CRPI decorrelates these errors to recover performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies error amplification as the key limitation in converting trained ANN policies to SNNs for continuous control tasks. Small approximation errors at each decision step become temporally correlated across steps, leading to cumulative state distribution shifts and significant performance degradation. The authors propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free method that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress these temporally correlated errors. Experiments on MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance.

## Method Summary
The method involves converting pretrained ANN policies (TD3, SAC, DrQ-v2) to SNN layers using rate-coded ANN-to-SNN conversion with Integrate-and-Fire neurons. CRPI modifies the membrane potential initialization at each decision step by adding a scaled residual from the previous step: v_l^{k+1}[0] ← clip(0.5θ_l + α(v_l^k[T] − v_l^k[0]), 0, θ_l). The threshold θ is set to the maximum ReLU activation per channel from calibration data. The hyperparameter α is selected via grid search over {0, 0.1, ..., 1.0}. The SNN runs for T simulation steps per decision, averaging output spikes to produce actions.

## Key Results
- CRPI recovers 10-50% performance loss in converted SNNs across multiple MuJoCo and DMC benchmarks
- SNNs with CRPI outperform directly trained SNNs on challenging vision-based tasks while maintaining energy efficiency
- CRPI consistently improves performance across diverse settings, with optimal α values varying by environment
- Error decomposition shows cumulative state distribution shift (not instantaneous action errors) dominates performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Performance degradation in ANN-to-SNN conversion for continuous control is dominated by cumulative state distribution shift, not instantaneous action errors. Small conversion errors at each decision step introduce correlated action deviations that compound through environment dynamics, causing trajectories to progressively diverge from the ANN's reference trajectory. Replacing the policy alone causes <0.5% degradation, while state distribution shift causes >30% degradation.

### Mechanism 2
Converted SNNs exhibit positively correlated action errors across consecutive steps, whereas ANN policies show negative correlation (error-correcting behavior). Standard conversion resets membrane potentials at each decision step, causing residual errors from quantization/rate-coding to become systematically aligned with previous errors. SNN Consistency values are positive (0.101-0.481) while ANN Correction values are negative (-0.070 to -0.256).

### Mechanism 3
CRPI suppresses temporal error correlation by initializing membrane potentials with a scaled residual from the previous decision step. Initialize v^l_{k+1}[0] ← v^l_{k+1}[0] + α(v^l_k[T] − v^l_k[0]). This introduces a negative correlation component (-α·ε^l_k) that decorrelates successive errors. Cosine similarity of residual errors decreases monotonically with α.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rate-coded ANN-to-SNN conversion** - Understanding how ReLU activations map to IF neuron firing rates is prerequisite for grasping why residual errors arise.
- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes and state visitation distributions** - The analysis decomposes returns into policy vs. state distribution effects; you need to understand P_π(s).
- **Concept: Integrate-and-Fire neuron dynamics** - CRPI operates directly on membrane potential variables (m, v, θ); you need fluency with the update equations.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pretrained ANN actor -> SNN layers (IF neurons) -> CRPI module -> Environment (MuJoCo/DMC)
- **Critical path:** Load pretrained ANN weights into SNN layers -> At each decision step k: observe s_k → run SNN for T simulation steps → aggregate output as action a_k -> CRPI injection: Before step k+1, compute residuals and reinitialize v^l_{k+1}[0] -> Repeat for episode horizon
- **Design tradeoffs:** α parameter: Too low → insufficient decorrelation; too high → overcorrection instability; Simulation steps T: Higher T reduces per-step error but increases latency; Neuron model: IF is simplest; MT/DC provide better accuracy at cost of complexity
- **Failure signatures:** Trajectory divergence visible in t-SNE; SNN Drift metric positive and increasing; Performance plateau or degradation at high α
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline validation: Convert TD3 policy to IF-SNN on HalfCheetah-v4; confirm ~30-50% return degradation vs ANN; 2) CRPI ablation: Add CRPI with α ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0}; plot return vs α to find optimal range; 3) Error correlation check: Log residual potential errors ε^l_k across 100 episodes; compute cosine similarity between consecutive steps to verify decorrelation with CRPI enabled.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the correlation coefficient α in CRPI be determined adaptively or theoretically rather than through grid search? The paper selects α via coarse grid search over {0, 0.1, ..., 1.0}, and notes that excessive values overcompensate residual errors. Optimal α varies across tasks without a principled selection method.

### Open Question 2
Why do converted SNNs occasionally outperform their source ANN policies, and can this phenomenon be systematically exploited? The authors note SNNs can slightly outperform ANNs due to stochasticity and robustness of event-driven dynamics, but the explanation remains speculative without investigation into regularization effects or implicit exploration.

### Open Question 3
Does error amplification limit ANN-to-SNN conversion in other sequential decision-making settings beyond continuous control, such as partially observable environments or multi-agent systems? The paper demonstrates error amplification is specific to continuous control but does not explore whether similar temporal error correlation issues arise in other settings with sequential dependencies and long horizons.

## Limitations

- Error correlation mechanism assumes residual potential errors dominate conversion artifacts; ablation studies isolating error sources are absent
- CRPI effectiveness relies on assumptions about membrane potential distributions that are empirically validated but theoretically limited
- Results may not generalize to environments with different action sensitivities or non-standard ANN architectures
- Grid search for α parameter is computationally expensive and environment-specific

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Error amplification occurs in continuous control but not discrete control; CRPI is training-free and improves performance across multiple benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: Temporal correlation of residual errors is the dominant mechanism; CRPI's effectiveness stems from decorrelating these errors
- **Medium confidence**: CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines without architectural changes

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of residual error sources**: Modify the conversion process to eliminate residual potential errors (e.g., through alternative initialization schemes) and measure whether performance improves without CRPI.

2. **Cross-environment robustness**: Test CRPI on continuous control tasks with varying action sensitivities (e.g., low-gain vs high-gain environments) to validate whether the mechanism generalizes beyond the tested MuJoCo and DMC benchmarks.

3. **Temporal correlation measurement**: Implement fine-grained logging of residual potential errors across decision steps in converted SNNs, computing both autocorrelation and cross-correlation with ANN residuals to verify the proposed correlation mechanism.
