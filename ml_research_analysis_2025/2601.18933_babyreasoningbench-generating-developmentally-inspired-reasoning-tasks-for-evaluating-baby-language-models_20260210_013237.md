# BabyReasoningBench: Generating Developmentally-Inspired Reasoning Tasks for Evaluating Baby Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Introduces benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks for baby language models based on developmental psychology paradigms

## Executive Summary
BABYREASONINGBENCH addresses the evaluation gap between traditional adult-centric language model benchmarks and the developmentally grounded capabilities of baby language models trained on child-directed speech. It introduces a benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks inspired by classic developmental psychology paradigms, including theory of mind, analogical reasoning, causal inference, and core reasoning primitives. The benchmark uses GPT-5.2 to generate multiple-choice questions based on human developmental tasks, enabling systematic variation while preserving experimental logic.

Evaluation on two BabyLM GPT-2 models (pretrained on 10M and 100M child-directed speech tokens) reveals overall low performance but significant dissociations: scaling improves causal and physical reasoning tasks substantially, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. The 100M model achieves 100% accuracy on physical cause-effect tasks and shows large gains on evidence-integration tasks, but struggles with explicit false-belief scenarios and class-inclusion wording effects. This task-level dissociation underscores the benchmark's value in separating reasoning competence from language form and pragmatic confounds.

## Method Summary
The benchmark consists of 19 reasoning tasks derived from classic developmental psychology experiments, including theory of mind, analogical reasoning, causal inference, and core reasoning primitives. Tasks were generated using GPT-5.2 based on human developmental tasks, creating multiple-choice questions while preserving the logical structure of original experiments. The benchmark was evaluated on two BabyLM GPT-2 models pretrained on 10M and 100M tokens of child-directed speech. Evaluation focused on task-level performance patterns and scaling effects between model sizes.

## Key Results
- BabyLM models show overall low performance on reasoning tasks but exhibit significant dissociations between task types
- Scaling from 10M to 100M tokens substantially improves performance on causal and physical reasoning tasks (100% accuracy on physical cause-effect)
- Models struggle with explicit false-belief scenarios and class-inclusion wording effects despite improvements in evidence-integration tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its grounding in developmental psychology, which provides ecologically valid tasks that map directly to cognitive milestones. By using GPT-5.2 to generate multiple-choice versions of human developmental tasks, the benchmark maintains the logical structure and experimental controls of original paradigms while enabling systematic variation and scalability. The multiple-choice format allows for precise measurement of reasoning capabilities while controlling for language generation artifacts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Developmental psychology paradigms**: Classic experiments like false-belief tasks and analogical reasoning provide validated cognitive benchmarks
  - Why needed: Offers ecologically valid tasks that map to human cognitive development
  - Quick check: Verify tasks align with established developmental milestones

- **Child-directed speech characteristics**: Simplified syntax, concrete vocabulary, and interactive patterns shape early language acquisition
  - Why needed: Understanding training data properties explains model capabilities and limitations
  - Quick check: Analyze token distribution and linguistic features of training corpus

- **Theory of mind development**: Progression from implicit to explicit belief attribution typically occurs around age 4-5
  - Why needed: Provides framework for interpreting model performance on belief reasoning tasks
  - Quick check: Compare model performance to developmental timelines

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Child-directed speech corpus -> BabyLM GPT-2 pretraining -> Task-specific evaluation -> Performance analysis

**Critical path**: Pretraining data selection and preprocessing -> Model architecture configuration -> Benchmark task generation -> Evaluation and analysis

**Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic task generation via GPT-5.2 vs. human-designed tasks (scalability vs. ecological validity), multiple-choice format vs. open-ended responses (precision vs. natural language generation), small-scale pretraining vs. adult-sized models (developmental grounding vs. general reasoning capacity)

**Failure signatures**: Low performance across tasks indicates insufficient pretraining, task-specific failures suggest reasoning limitations vs. language form issues, scaling effects reveal which capabilities benefit from additional data

**First experiments**:
1. Evaluate models on original human developmental tasks rather than GPT-generated versions
2. Test instruction-tuned models on benchmark to distinguish data scarcity from fundamental limitations
3. Compare baby models to models trained on mixed adult-child corpora to isolate child-directed speech effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on GPT-5.2-generated questions which may introduce unintended biases
- Small pretraining scale (10M-100M tokens) limits developmental trajectory conclusions
- Performance patterns may reflect language form constraints rather than genuine reasoning limitations

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Baby models perform below adult benchmarks on reasoning tasks | High |
| Task-level dissociations and scaling effects observed | Medium |
| Developmental grounding explains reasoning failures | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test models on original human developmental tasks rather than GPT-generated versions to validate ecological relevance
2. Evaluate whether instruction tuning on benchmark questions improves performance to distinguish data scarcity from fundamental reasoning limitations
3. Compare baby model performance to models trained on mixed adult-child corpora to isolate impact of child-directed speech exposure on reasoning development
