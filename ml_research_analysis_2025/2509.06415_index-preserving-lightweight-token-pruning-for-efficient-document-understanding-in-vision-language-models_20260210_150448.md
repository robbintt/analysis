# Index-Preserving Lightweight Token Pruning for Efficient Document Understanding in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06415
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06415

- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 60%+ FLOPs reduction in document understanding tasks with minimal performance degradation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lightweight token pruning method specifically designed for vision-language models in document understanding tasks. The approach uses a binary patch-level classifier to filter out non-text regions, followed by max-pooling to refine fragmented text regions while preserving original token indices. This index preservation is crucial for maintaining spatial coherence in document layout understanding. The method demonstrates significant efficiency gains, achieving over 60% FLOPs reduction across multiple datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing pruning and merging techniques.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a two-stage pruning process for vision-language models handling document understanding. First, a binary patch-level classifier identifies and removes patches corresponding to non-text regions. Second, max-pooling is applied to merge fragmented text regions while preserving the original token indices. This index preservation is critical because it maintains the spatial relationships between text elements in document layouts. The approach is designed to be lightweight, adding minimal computational overhead while achieving substantial FLOPs reductions. The method is evaluated across multiple document understanding benchmarks and compared against state-of-the-art pruning and merging techniques.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 60% FLOPs reduction across multiple document understanding datasets
- Reduces token count by up to 41.6% using max-pooling refinement
- Maintains competitive accuracy with only minor performance degradation compared to baseline models
- Outperforms existing pruning methods like ToMe and DocKylin in both efficiency and accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental challenge of maintaining spatial coherence in document layouts while reducing computational overhead. The binary patch-level classifier effectively identifies non-text regions that contribute little to document understanding tasks, removing them early in the processing pipeline. The max-pooling step then refines the remaining patches by merging fragmented text regions, reducing redundancy while preserving the semantic meaning. Critically, the index preservation ensures that the spatial relationships between text elements are maintained, which is essential for tasks like OCR and document parsing where layout information is crucial.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models**: AI models that process both visual and textual information simultaneously. Needed because document understanding requires interpreting both images and text. Quick check: Can the model handle both image features and text embeddings effectively?
- **Token Pruning**: The process of removing unnecessary tokens from the input sequence to reduce computational load. Needed to improve efficiency without significant accuracy loss. Quick check: Does pruning maintain essential information while reducing FLOPs?
- **Spatial Coherence**: The preservation of spatial relationships between elements in a document layout. Needed because document understanding relies heavily on layout information. Quick check: Are text elements still properly aligned after pruning?
- **Binary Classification**: A two-class classification task used to distinguish between text and non-text regions. Needed to identify which patches can be safely removed. Quick check: Is the classifier achieving high accuracy in distinguishing text from background?
- **Max-Pooling**: A downsampling operation that takes the maximum value in each patch, used here to merge fragmented regions. Needed to reduce token count while preserving important features. Quick check: Does max-pooling effectively merge fragmented text without losing semantic information?
- **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations)**: A measure of computational complexity. Needed to quantify efficiency improvements. Quick check: Are FLOPs reductions consistent across different document types and model architectures?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input document -> Binary patch classifier -> Max-pooling refinement -> Index-preserving token stream -> Vision-language model

Critical path: Document patches → Binary classification (text vs non-text) → Max-pooling for fragmented text → Preserved index mapping → Model input

Design tradeoffs: The method prioritizes efficiency and spatial preservation over potential accuracy gains from more complex pruning strategies. By using a binary classifier and simple max-pooling, the approach adds minimal overhead while achieving significant FLOPs reduction.

Failure signatures: The method may struggle with documents containing complex layouts, mixed text orientations, or non-standard font sizes. Performance could degrade if the binary classifier has difficulty distinguishing subtle text-background differences or if max-pooling merges semantically distinct text regions.

First experiments to run:
1. Test the binary classifier's accuracy on diverse document types with varying text sizes and backgrounds
2. Evaluate max-pooling's effectiveness on documents with fragmented text regions and overlapping elements
3. Measure FLOPs reduction and accuracy trade-offs across different document understanding tasks (OCR, layout analysis, etc.)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Primarily evaluated on document understanding tasks, limiting generalizability to other vision-language applications
- Binary classifier's performance may vary across diverse document types and layouts not represented in standard datasets
- Max-pooling refinement could potentially merge semantically distinct text regions in complex layouts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Index preservation methodology and FLOPs reduction calculations are well-supported by the technical details provided
- **Medium confidence**: Performance degradation metrics and comparisons with ToMe/DocKylin are reasonable but could benefit from more extensive ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: Generalization across diverse document types and real-world deployment scenarios remains uncertain based on current evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the pruning method on non-document vision-language tasks (e.g., image captioning, visual question answering) to assess generalization beyond document understanding
2. Test robustness across diverse document layouts, font sizes, and noise conditions not represented in standard datasets to validate real-world applicability
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of binary classifier accuracy versus max-pooling effectiveness to overall performance gains
