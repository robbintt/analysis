# Algorithms for dynamic scheduling in manufacturing, towards digital factories Improving Deadline Feasibility and Responsiveness via Temporal Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16047
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16047
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Hybrid CP+STNU pipeline achieves 20–30% deadline misses (vs. ~100% baseline) with ≤5% makespan overhead and provable hard-deadline guarantees via closed-form slack bound.

## Executive Summary
This work tackles the challenge of meeting deadlines in flexible job-shop manufacturing under uncertain task durations. The authors propose a hybrid scheduling pipeline that first uses offline constraint programming to optimize task routing and timing under soft deadline penalties, then converts the schedule into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) for robust online execution. By deriving a closed-form slack bound Δ* that ensures both constraint feasibility and dynamic controllability, the approach provably satisfies hard deadlines while reducing deadline misses. Experiments on Kacem benchmarks show significant improvements in deadline adherence with minimal makespan cost.

## Method Summary
The pipeline combines proactive planning and reactive execution: Constraint Programming (CP) solves the routing and timing problem offline, minimizing weighted penalties for deadline violations. The resulting schedule is translated into an STNU, where temporal constraints capture uncertainties in task durations. A closed-form slack bound Δ* = Σt(dt - dₜ) is derived to guarantee both CP feasibility and STNU dynamic controllability. During execution, the STNU is monitored and adapted in real time to absorb duration variations while preserving deadline guarantees. This bridges the gap between buffered proactive scheduling and robust dynamic execution.

## Key Results
- Deadline misses reduced from ~100% to 20–30% using soft deadline weights (wₑ, wₜ).
- Makespan overhead remains below 5% relative to baseline.
- Closed-form slack bound Δ* ensures hard deadline satisfaction and dynamic controllability.
- Pipeline scales near-linearly; CP and simulation dominate runtime, DC checking remains sub-second.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages CP's strength in finding high-quality, feasible schedules under soft constraints, while STNUs provide a rigorous framework for handling uncertainties during execution. The closed-form slack bound Δ* acts as a buffer that absorbs worst-case deviations without violating hard deadlines, ensuring dynamic controllability. This combination enables both proactive optimization and reactive robustness, addressing the dual challenges of deadline feasibility and responsiveness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constraint Programming (CP)**: Needed for global optimization of routing and timing under complex constraints; check by verifying constraint satisfaction and objective improvement.
- **Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNU)**: Needed to model and manage temporal uncertainties during execution; check by validating controllability and constraint propagation.
- **Dynamic Controllability (DC)**: Needed to ensure schedules remain feasible under worst-case duration variations; check via DC algorithms or validation tools.
- **Slack Bound Δ***: Needed to quantify allowable deviations while preserving deadline guarantees; check by verifying Δ* sufficiency for both CP and STNU constraints.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: CP Solver -> Schedule Translation -> STNU Construction -> DC Checking -> Online Execution Monitor
- **Critical Path**: CP Solve → STNU Build → DC Verify → Execution
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Offline CP optimization vs. online execution flexibility; tighter slack bounds vs. feasibility; computational cost of DC checking vs. robustness.
- **Failure Signatures**: CP infeasibility (no feasible routing), STNU uncontrollability (insufficient slack), DC check timeout (dense constraints).
- **First Experiments**: (1) Run CP solver on small Kacem instance and verify objective improvement; (2) Translate schedule to STNU and check controllability; (3) Simulate execution under perturbed durations and measure deadline satisfaction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Closed-form slack bound Δ* proven only for discrete-time STNUs with unit-duration arcs; extension to continuous-time or arbitrary uncertainties not validated.
- Experiments limited to small Kacem benchmarks (≤10 jobs, ≤10 machines); scalability to industrial-sized factories untested.
- CP routing assumes complete job release information; real-world dynamic arrivals not evaluated.
- DC checking relies on off-the-shelf algorithms; worst-case computational overhead under dense constraints unassessed.

## Confidence
- Deadline reduction (100% → 20–30%): High
- Δ* bound universal applicability: Medium
- Scalability and robustness under dynamic arrivals: Low

## Next Checks
- Test pipeline on larger, industry-scale benchmarks (≥50 jobs, ≥20 machines) to assess scalability.
- Evaluate Δ* under continuous-time and non-unit-duration uncertainties to verify bound tightness.
- Conduct experiments with dynamic job arrivals and disruptions to measure robustness in realistic shop-floor conditions.
