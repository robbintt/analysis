## Executive Summary
This paper presents large language models for summarizing Czech historical documents, introducing the novel Posel od Čerchova dataset and achieving state-of-the-art results on the modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech. The authors fine-tune Mistral and mT5 models on both modern and historical Czech text, demonstrating that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves performance on respective tasks. The M7B-SC model establishes a new benchmark for SumeCzech, while the M7T-POC model significantly outperforms mT5-SC on the historical document dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tuned two pre-trained models (Mistral-7B and mT5) on two distinct Czech summarization datasets. For modern Czech text, they trained M7B-SC and mT5-SC models on the SumeCzech dataset containing journalistic articles and summaries. For historical Czech documents, they created and used the Posel od Čerchova dataset, fine-tuning M7T-POC and mT5-SC models specifically on this historical corpus. The historical dataset was generated using LLM-generated summaries from GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, with manual corrections for accuracy. Both models were evaluated using ROUGE metrics on their respective test sets.

## Key Results
- M7B-SC model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SumeCzech dataset (40.12 R-1, 17.08 R-2, 34.44 R-L)
- M7T-POC model significantly outperforms mT5-SC on Posel od Čerchova historical document dataset
- Domain-specific fine-tuning shows clear performance advantages over cross-domain approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Domain-specific fine-tuning allows language models to adapt to the unique linguistic characteristics of historical Czech text, including outdated vocabulary and inconsistent syntax that differ significantly from modern journalistic Czech.

## Foundational Learning
- Fine-tuning vs. zero-shot learning: Why needed - adapting pre-trained models to specific domains; Quick check - compare fine-tuned vs. zero-shot performance
- ROUGE metrics: Why needed - standard evaluation for summarization tasks; Quick check - verify ROUGE score calculations
- Cross-lingual pre-training: Why needed - foundation for Czech-specific models; Quick check - confirm pre-training data includes Czech text

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Pre-trained model → Fine-tuning dataset → ROUGE evaluation

**Critical path:** Model initialization → Fine-tuning → Inference → ROUGE scoring

**Design tradeoffs:** Domain-specific vs. cross-domain fine-tuning; larger model capacity vs. computational efficiency

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on domain-specific terminology; overfitting to training data

**First experiments:**
1. Compare zero-shot performance vs. fine-tuned models on both datasets
2. Test different learning rates during fine-tuning
3. Evaluate model performance on a held-out validation set during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can cross-temporal training strategies effectively bridge the linguistic gap between the modern SumeCzech dataset and the historical Posel od Čerchova dataset?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion explicitly states that future work should focus on "extending the dataset for multilingual and cross-temporal studies."
- Why unresolved: The current experiments treat the modern and historical domains separately, fine-tuning models on one or the other to establish baselines, without exploring shared feature representations across time periods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing joint training or domain adaptation techniques on both datasets, showing improved performance on historical text compared to single-domain training.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What performance gains can hybrid modeling approaches offer for Czech historical text summarization compared to the current pure abstractive baselines?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion lists "exploring hybrid modeling approaches" as a primary direction for future research to enhance summarization quality.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses exclusively on evaluating abstractive Transformer models (Mistral and mT5) against extractive or abstractive baselines, without investigating combinations of these methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of a hybrid system (e.g., extract-then-abstractive) on the Posel od Čerchova dataset that exceeds the current M7B-POC baseline scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does fine-tuning on modern journalistic Czech (SumeCzech) hinder or help the comprehension of "outdated vocabulary" and "inconsistent syntax" in historical documents?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes historical documents have "linguistic shifts" and "outdated vocabulary," yet the mT5-SC model (fine-tuned on modern text) performed significantly worse on the historical dataset than the model fine-tuned on historical text.
- Why unresolved: The results show a performance drop but do not analyze whether the modern training data acts as a negative transfer or simply fails to provide relevant historical features.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing token-level errors or vocabulary coverage of models fine-tuned on modern vs. historical data when processing historical input.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the reliance on LLM-generated reference summaries (GPT-4/Claude) introduce systematic biases when evaluating other LLMs on the Posel od Čerchova dataset?
- Basis in paper: The authors used GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus to generate the "gold standard" summaries, noting that while they were manually corrected, the style was dictated by the LLMs.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating LLMs using references created by other LLMs may artificially inflate ROUGE scores for models that share similar stylistic tendencies or hallucinations, a limitation not addressed by the ROUGE-raw metric.
- What evidence would resolve it: A human evaluation study comparing the factual consistency and linguistic quality of the model outputs against the LLM-generated references.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies exclusively on ROUGE metrics, which may not capture semantic coherence or factual accuracy adequately
- The historical document dataset appears relatively small (1,043 training samples), potentially limiting generalizability
- Direct performance comparisons with specific prior models on SumeCzech are not provided

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: M7B-SC achieves state-of-the-art results on SumeCzech with reported ROUGE scores
- **Medium Confidence**: M7T-POC significantly outperforms mT5-SC on Posel od Čerchova, though statistical significance testing could strengthen this claim

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate the quality of generated summaries beyond ROUGE metrics, particularly focusing on factual accuracy and coherence in historical document summarization
2. Perform ablation studies to determine the specific contribution of model size and fine-tuning approaches to the observed performance improvements
3. Test model generalization by evaluating the trained models on out-of-domain Czech documents or cross-lingual summarization tasks to assess their broader applicability
