## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating complete and feasible solutions for complex engineering problems with multiple real-world constraints, a gap in prior retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) research. To evaluate systems' capabilities in this domain, the authors introduce SolutionBench, a benchmark constructed from authoritative engineering reports across eight domains, capturing real-world requirements, expert solutions, and domain knowledge. To advance solution design, they propose SolutionRAG, a system leveraging tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking to iteratively refine solutions through alternating design and review processes, with pruning to balance efficiency and performance. Experiments show that SolutionRAG significantly outperforms deep reasoning models and standard/multi-round RAG methods across all eight engineering domains on SolutionBench, achieving state-of-the-art analytical and technical scores. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking mechanisms.

## Method Summary
SolutionRAG employs a tree-based exploration framework that generates multiple solution paths through iterative refinement. The system uses bi-point thinking, alternating between design processes that generate solution proposals and review processes that critique them against requirements and retrieved knowledge. Each iteration involves generating proposals, retrieving relevant knowledge from a domain-specific corpus, and creating either solution nodes or comment nodes. A pruning mechanism retains only the top W highest-scoring nodes at each layer to manage computational efficiency. The final output is the highest-scoring leaf node solution after reaching maximum tree depth L.

## Key Results
- SolutionRAG significantly outperforms deep reasoning models and standard/multi-round RAG methods across all eight engineering domains on SolutionBench
- The system achieves state-of-the-art analytical and technical scores on the benchmark
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Tree-based Exploration
- Claim: Tree-based exploration enables flexible improvement paths from suboptimal to reliable solutions.
- Mechanism: The system generates multiple child nodes at each step, representing different improvement directions. Each node can spawn new branches, creating a tree structure rather than a linear chain. A pruning mechanism (keeping top W nodes) balances efficiency by discarding low-promise paths.
- Core assumption: Complex engineering solution design benefits from exploring multiple improvement trajectories rather than a fixed reasoning path.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...leverages the tree-based exploration... to iteratively refine solutions..."
  - [section]: "Therefore, SolutionRAG conducts the tree-based exploration, where each branch represents a different improvement direction." (Page 2, Introduction)
  - [section]: "...for each layer we only keep the W highest-scoring nodes..." (Page 6, Section 3.2, Node Evaluation)
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific tree+pruning combination in RAG for engineering design. Related work mentions MCTS-based RAG but lacks a mechanism to ensure all engineering requirements are met (Page 8, Section 5).
- Break condition: If the best solution is reached in a single step, or if the solution space is convex/smooth enough that gradient descent-like linear refinement is sufficient, a tree structure introduces unnecessary overhead.

### Mechanism 2: Bi-point Thinking (Design-Review Alternation)
- Claim: Alternating between "design" and "review" processes systematically improves solution completeness and feasibility by iteratively identifying and addressing deficiencies.
- Mechanism: The tree structure has two types of nodes: Solution Nodes and Comment Nodes. Solution Nodes are created by a "design" process. Comment Nodes are created by a "review" process that critiques a solution against the original requirements and retrieved knowledge. New Solution Nodes are then designed to address the critiques.
- Core assumption: Generated solutions cannot satisfy all constraints in a single pass and benefit from an explicit adversarial or critical review phase.
- Evidence anchors:
