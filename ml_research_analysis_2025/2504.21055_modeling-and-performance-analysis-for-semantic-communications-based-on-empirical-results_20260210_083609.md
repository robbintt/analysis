# Modeling and Performance Analysis for Semantic Communications Based on Empirical Results

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21055
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21055
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between transmission SNR and semantic communication performance metrics, enabling adaptive power control and optimization for OFDMA networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of analyzing and optimizing semantic communications by proposing a novel Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula that models the relationship between end-to-end performance metrics (such as MS-SSIM for image reconstruction and accuracy for inference tasks) and transmission SNR. The ABG formula captures the nonlinear behavior of deep learning-based semantic encoders and decoders, revealing that performance increases rapidly with SNR initially and then plateaus due to noise reduction and signal dominance. The study also derives a closed-form expression for the upper bound of performance, which depends on the number of quantized output bits of the semantic encoder. Using this model, the paper designs adaptive power control schemes for single-user systems to ensure quality of service and optimal power allocation strategies to maximize energy efficiency and the minimum performance among multiple users in OFDMA downlink networks.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a data-driven modeling approach using empirical results from semantic communication systems. Four different semantic encoder/decoder architectures (CNN, SCUNet, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer) are evaluated across SNR values 0-40 dB using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The ABG formula φ(ρ, nb) = α(nb) - γ/(1 + (βρ)^τ) is fitted to measured performance data using nonlinear least squares optimization. The upper bound α(nb) is modeled as a function of quantization bits using the expression α(nb) = c₁ - c₃/(1 + (c₂nb)^c₄). Power control and optimization schemes are then derived based on these empirical models to ensure QoS or maximize energy efficiency.

## Key Results
- The ABG formula achieves SSE < 1e-5 when fitting semantic communication performance across SNR ranges
- The upper bound α(nb) saturates as quantization bits increase, with the function α(nb) = c₁ - c₃/(1 + (c₂nb)^c₄) accurately capturing this relationship
- Adaptive power control using the inverted ABG formula eliminates QoS outage events compared to fixed-power baselines
- Energy efficiency optimization in multi-user OFDMA systems achieves significant gains over traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The relationship between transmission SNR and semantic performance follows a specific nonlinear saturation curve that can be modeled empirically. The system transitions from a noise-dominated regime (where performance rises rapidly with SNR) to a signal-dominated regime where performance plateaus. This plateau occurs because the semantic encoder-decoder architecture has a finite capacity to represent information, limited by quantization bits, regardless of how clean the channel is. The deep learning networks behave such that mutual information I(s; y) is bounded by the source entropy H(s) and the quantization constraints, creating an upper bound on reconstruction quality.

### Mechanism 2
The upper bound of reconstruction quality is strictly determined by the number of quantized output bits (nb) in the digital semantic encoder. Increasing SNR reduces channel errors but cannot recover information lost during the initial quantization step at the transmitter. The performance ceiling α(nb) rises as nb increases but saturates as the representation approaches the information content of the source. The specific functional form α(nb) = c₁ - c₃/(1 + (c₂nb)^c₄) accurately captures the diminishing returns of adding quantization bits.

### Mechanism 3
Power allocation can be optimized deterministically using the ABG formula to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) or maximize Energy Efficiency (EE). By inverting the ABG formula, the system calculates the exact transmit power required to achieve a target MS-SSIM threshold η for a given channel realization h(t). For EE, the quasi-concave nature of the efficiency function allows the use of Dinkelbach-type algorithms to find the global optimum. The channel state information (CSI) h(t) is available at the transmitter to perform the inversion calculation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Nonlinear Least Squares Fitting**
  - **Why needed here**: The ABG formula parameters (α, β, γ, τ) and the upper bound parameters (c₁...c₄) are not derived from first principles but are obtained by fitting the formula to empirical data points (SNR vs. MS-SSIM)
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is used to validate the "goodness of fit" for the ABG model?

- **Concept**: **Quasi-Concavity and Fractional Programming**
  - **Why needed here**: The Energy Efficiency (EE) metric is a fraction (Performance / Power). Understanding that the ABG numerator creates a quasi-concave structure is essential to justify why the Dinkelbach-type algorithm converges to the global optimum rather than a local one
  - **Quick check question**: Why can't standard convex optimization solvers be directly applied to the fractional form of Energy Efficiency without transformation?

- **Concept**: **Semantic Metrics (MS-SSIM vs. Accuracy)**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper applies the same ABG structure to different tasks (reconstruction vs. inference) but uses different metrics (MS-SSIM vs. Accuracy). Understanding that these metrics represent "semantic fidelity" is crucial for interpreting the α upper bound
  - **Quick check question**: Does a higher α (upper bound) in an inference task imply a higher maximum classification accuracy, and what limits this α?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input u -> Semantic Encoder -> Quantizer -> ABG Model Interface -> Power Controller -> Channel -> Power Controller -> ABG Model Interface -> Quantizer -> Semantic Decoder -> Output ū

- **Critical path**: The validity of the entire resource allocation system rests on the Fitting Phase. If the ABG parameters are not fitted accurately to the specific DL model (CNN, ViT, etc.) being deployed, the power control will be miscalibrated, leading to wasted energy or failure to meet QoS.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Quantization Bits (nb) vs. Bandwidth**: Increasing nb raises the performance ceiling α but requires higher bandwidth
  - **Model Complexity vs. ABG Generality**: The ABG parameters are model-specific. A new model architecture requires re-running the simulation sweep to re-fit α, β, γ, τ

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **QoS Outage in Low SNR**: If the required power p*(t) exceeds the hardware limit PU, the system fails to meet the threshold η
  - **Model Mismatch**: If the channel distribution changes (e.g., non-Gaussian interference) or the DL model is updated without updating ABG parameters, the predicted performance will diverge from actual performance (high SSE)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Fitting Validation**: Run the CNN-based semantic comm system over a range of fixed SNRs (0-40dB) on CIFAR-10. Collect (SNR, MS-SSIM) data points and fit the ABG parameters using nonlinear least squares. Calculate the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) to verify it matches the paper's low error rates (e.g., ~10^-5)
  2. **Upper Bound Verification**: Fix a high SNR (e.g., 40dB) and vary the number of quantization bits (nb). Plot MS-SSIM vs. nb and fit the α(nb) function to verify the saturation behavior described in Eq. (9)
  3. **Adaptive Power Control Test**: Implement the adaptive power formula p*(t) from Eq. (16) in a simulation with Rayleigh fading. Compare the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of MS-SSIM against a fixed-power baseline to confirm that the adaptive scheme eliminates "outage" events below the threshold η

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the parameters of the ABG formula be theoretically derived from the structure of the neural network rather than determined through empirical curve fitting?
- Basis: Section III.A states that due to the "high nonlinearity of deep learning networks," it is challenging to theoretically derive the parameters (α, β, γ, τ), which are currently obtained via non-linear least squares
- Why unresolved: The "black-box" nature of DL prevents analytical mapping of network weights to the proposed empirical model parameters
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical proof linking specific network architectural properties (e.g., layer depth, activation functions) directly to the ABG parameter values

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed power allocation scheme perform in multi-user scenarios with joint subcarrier assignment, rather than the fixed assignment assumed in the analysis?
- Basis: Section IV.C explicitly assumes a fixed subcarrier allocation ("assume that the i-th subcarrier is allocated to user i") to formulate the optimization problem, leaving dynamic resource block allocation unexplored
- Why unresolved: The optimization problem was simplified by pre-assigning subcarriers to users to facilitate a bisection-based solution
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the optimization framework to include subcarrier indices as variables and demonstrating convergence

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the relationship between the performance upper bound (α) and the number of quantized bits (nb) robust across different quantization architectures?
- Basis: Section II and III specify the use of a particular "one-bit quantization module" and the upper bound formula (Eq. 9) is fitted based on this specific method
- Why unresolved: The derived closed-form expression for the upper bound is empirical and may not capture the non-linearities of different quantization strategies (e.g., entropy coding, variable-rate quantization)
- What evidence would resolve it: Fitting the α(nb) curve using alternative quantization methods to see if the proposed formula (Eq. 9) remains valid

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the ABG model accurately capture performance trends for video semantic communication tasks that rely on temporal correlations?
- Basis: The Introduction reviews video transmission literature, but the Methodology and Simulation sections (III, V) restrict validation to static image reconstruction and single-frame inference tasks
- Why unresolved: Video introduces temporal dependencies and metrics (e.g., PSNR over time) that may not follow the same saturation curve as static MS-SSIM
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results fitting the ABG formula to video semantic communication datasets

## Limitations
- The ABG formula parameters are model-specific and require re-fitting when changing semantic encoder architectures or training datasets
- The upper bound relationship α(nb) is derived from limited quantization bit counts (1-8 bits shown in Fig. 3)
- The power control scheme assumes perfect channel state information and Gaussian noise, which may not hold in real deployments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The basic ABG formula structure φ(ρ, nb) = α(nb) - γ/(1 + (βρ)^τ) effectively captures the SNR-performance relationship for tested semantic models
- **Medium confidence**: The upper bound α(nb) function accurately represents quantization limitations across different architectures
- **Low confidence**: The energy efficiency optimization results generalize beyond the specific simulation conditions (Rayleigh fading, OFDMA configuration)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Apply the ABG fitting procedure to a different semantic encoder (e.g., MobileNet) and verify whether the same formula structure maintains low SSE across SNR ranges

2. **Real-World Channel Testing**: Implement the adaptive power control scheme in a software-defined radio testbed with measured channel conditions rather than simulated Rayleigh fading

3. **Robustness to CSI Errors**: Simulate the power control performance under imperfect channel state information (quantized CSI or outdated estimates) to assess sensitivity to estimation errors
