# Out-of-the-box: Black-box Causal Attacks on Object Detectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03730
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03730
- Authors: Melane Navaratnarajah; David A. Kelly; Hana Chockler
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: BlackCAtt achieves 2.7× better removal, 3.86× better modification, and 5.75× better addition of spurious detections compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
BlackCAtt is a black-box, causally grounded method for generating adversarial attacks on object detectors. It identifies minimal, sufficient pixel sets (MSPSs) that explain a detection, then perturbs these causal pixels to remove, modify, or add detections. The method works across different architectures without needing access to internal model states. MSPSs often lie partially outside the detector's bounding box, revealing that contextual pixels are crucial to the detection.

## Method Summary
BlackCAtt uses minimal sufficient pixel sets (MSPSs) as causal priors to generate targeted adversarial attacks on object detectors. The method employs ReX or DRISE to generate responsibility/saliency maps, extracts MSPSs via ReX's algorithm, and applies two perturbation strategies: Blended (combines positive and negation maps) and MoG (fits mixture of Gaussians to top peaks). The attack iteratively refines perturbations while reducing distortion, targeting checkpoints inside/outside/full MSPS regions. This approach achieves higher success rates with lower perceptual distortion compared to random or saliency-based baselines.

## Key Results
- BlackCAtt achieves 2.7× better removal, 3.86× better modification, and 5.75× better addition of spurious detections compared to baselines
- Contextual MSPS pixels outside bounding boxes are crucial for detection (62.45% of MSPSs are not fully contained in bbox)
- At LPIPS ≤0.005, BlackCAtt achieves up to 53% success for adding detections vs ~10% for targeted noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Minimal Sufficient Pixel Set (MSPS) Identification
MSPSs provide a targeted attack surface that is causally sufficient for detection, enabling more efficient perturbations than global or random approaches. The ReX algorithm ranks pixels by approximate causal responsibility and extracts minimal subsets that, alone, reproduce the original detection when other pixels are masked. These MSPSs localize the cause of the decision rather than correlating with salient regions. Core assumption: A detection is causally dependent on a finite, discoverable set of pixels (grounded in actual causality theory).

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Dependence Outside Bounding Boxes
Object detectors regularly rely on pixels outside their own bounding boxes, and these contextual causal pixels can be exploited for efficient attacks. The fraction of MSPS inside the bbox (FIN) correlates positively with confidence, but Dice coefficient shows weak/negative correlation, indicating contextual regions remain causally relevant even for high-confidence detections. Core assumption: The detector's bounding box is a localization output, not the full causal explanation of the decision.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Refinement Guided by Causal Rankings
Using causal pixel rankings as spatial priors enables lower-distortion, higher-success attacks than undirected baselines. Both Blended and MoG algorithms start from checkpoints (outside-MSPS, inside-MSPS, full MSPS), apply perturbations ranked by importance, then refine by reducing perturbation strength while preserving attack success. Core assumption: The underlying XAI tool provides meaningful rankings; extremely noisy rankings degrade attack efficacy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Actual Causality and Minimal Sufficiency
  - **Why needed here:** MSPS is defined through actual causality theory; understanding "sufficient" vs "necessary" sets clarifies why attacking a sufficient set can fail if over-determination exists.
  - **Quick check question:** If two independent pixel sets each suffice for detection, will attacking one necessarily remove the detection?

- **Concept:** Black-box vs White-box Threat Models
  - **Why needed here:** BlackCAtt treats the detector as a black box (no gradients, no internal access); this constrains the explanation methods (ReX, DRISE) and attack algorithms to query-based approaches.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't BlackCAtt use Grad-CAM for saliency maps?

- **Concept:** Object Detector Architectures (One-stage, Two-stage, Transformer-based)
  - **Why needed here:** Results vary across YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR; architectural differences affect robustness and attack success patterns.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is RT-DETR empirically more robust to localized perturbations than YOLO?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Image → Detection → Map generation (ReX/DRISE) → MSPS extraction → Checkpoint selection → Ranked perturbation → Model query → Success check → Refinement → Final adversarial image

- **Critical path:** The attack flow moves from input image through object detection, causal explanation generation, MSPS extraction, perturbation application at multiple spatial checkpoints, and iterative refinement based on query responses.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Blended vs MoG:** Blended requires two maps (positive + negation), only works with ReX; MoG works with any single map but requires tuning σ and peak count.
  - **Outside vs Inside attack:** Outside attacks are less reliable but require smaller perturbed areas and lower LPIPS.
  - **XAI backbone choice:** ReX provides causally grounded MSPS directly; DRISE requires extraction algorithm but may generalize better to other tools.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Noisy rankings:** Attack success drops or distortion increases disproportionately.
  - **Over-determination:** Attacking one MSPS fails; detection persists due to alternative sufficient causes.
  - **Architecture mismatch:** RT-DETR shows lower absolute success; transformer-based detectors may require different perturbation strategies.
  - **Domain shift:** COCO-only validation; performance on other datasets unknown.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Spatial validation:** Reproduce FIN and DC statistics on a held-out subset to confirm MSPS-bbox relationship (Section 3.2).
  2. **Architecture sweep:** Run BlackCAtt MoG on YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR with identical distortion budgets to verify relative robustness (Section 6, Figure 5).
  3. **XAI backbone ablation:** Compare ReX vs DRISE as the map source for MSPS extraction, measuring success rate and LPIPS trade-offs (Section 6, Table 1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can BlackCAtt be extended to efficiently manage interactions between multiple detections?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Future Work: "We can extend BlackCAtt to manage the interaction between multiple detections... making the attacks efficient on multiple goals remains to be studied."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments simplify analysis by filtering for single detections; the algorithm's efficiency on complex scenes with overlapping or competing causal regions is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the method on images with multiple bounding boxes, demonstrating efficient query usage and simultaneous multi-target attack success.

### Open Question 2
Does targeting necessary and sufficient pixel sets yield higher success rates than using sufficient sets alone?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes: "ReX can also compute necessary and sufficient pixel sets... These carry more information than MSPSs and should increase the success rate of BlackCAtt."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation attacks only one Minimal Sufficient Pixel Set (MSPS), which may fail if the detection has multiple independent causes (over-determination) that are not all targeted.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing attack success rates and distortion levels when targeting necessary/sufficient sets versus the current MSPS-only methodology.

### Open Question 3
Does the causal attack efficacy generalize to domains outside of standard object detection benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors concede in the Discussion: "Our experiments are on COCO; more cross-domain validation is required to claim generality."
- Why unresolved: Model robustness varies significantly by architecture and data domain; findings specific to the COCO dataset may not hold in specialized or safety-critical contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from applying BlackCAtt to diverse domains (e.g., medical imaging, autonomous driving) showing consistent success rates and low distortion.

## Limitations

- MSPS extraction algorithm and bbox-aware ReX variant are not fully detailed, requiring significant implementation effort to reproduce faithfully.
- Over-determination remains a fundamental limitation - attacking a single MSPS may fail if multiple independent sufficient causes exist for a detection.
- Cross-domain generalization is unvalidated; all experiments use COCO dataset, with unknown performance on other domains.
- RT-DETR's lower vulnerability to localized perturbations suggests transformer-based detectors may require different attack strategies.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The mechanism showing contextual pixels outside bounding boxes are causally relevant to detections (supported by FIN/DC statistics across 5437 images).
- **Medium confidence:** The 2.7×/3.86×/5.75× improvement claims, as these depend on faithful implementation of the MSPS extraction and refinement procedures which are not fully specified.
- **Medium confidence:** The causal grounding of MSPSs, as the theoretical foundation is sound but practical extraction quality depends on the underlying XAI tool performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Spatial validation:** Reproduce FIN and DC statistics on a held-out subset to confirm MSPS-bbox relationship (Section 3.2).
2. **Architecture sweep:** Run BlackCAtt MoG on YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR with identical distortion budgets to verify relative robustness (Section 6, Figure 5).
3. **XAI backbone ablation:** Compare ReX vs DRISE as the map source for MSPS extraction, measuring success rate and LPIPS trade-offs (Section 6, Table 1).
