- Primary result: AI functions as procedural scaffold while human researchers retain epistemic authority through five analytic actions: modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting

## Executive Summary
This study empirically examines how experienced researchers interact with an AI tool during inductive thematic analysis, shifting focus from AI outputs to analytic interaction as the object of study. The ITA-GPT tool guided coders through familiarization, verbatim coding, and theme development, while researchers exercised epistemic authority through five recurring actions: modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting. Results show that AI functioned as a procedural scaffold, enhancing transparency and structure, but human analysts remained the final arbiters of meaning. Verbatim codes were most reliable, while AI-generated abstractions required systematic human refinement to recover contextual and emotional nuance.

## Method Summary
The study employed GPT-4 Turbo with temperature 0.3 and max tokens 1,000, configured as a qualitative researcher following inductive thematic analysis principles. Researchers uploaded interview transcripts from Ghanaian teacher education research, which were segmented into 10-paragraph units. The workflow enforced Naeem's Exact Keyword Principle and Braun & Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis through sequential phases: familiarization, verbatim (in-vivo) coding, gerund-based descriptive coding, and theme development. Human coders exercised epistemic authority through modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting actions, with all interactions tracked for auditability.

## Key Results
- AI functioned as procedural scaffold, structuring workflow while preserving human interpretive authority
- Researchers consistently exercised epistemic authority through five recurrent analytic actions: modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting
- Verbatim codes were consistently viewed as the most reliable analytic starting point, while AI-generated abstractions required systematic human refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured procedural scaffolding from AI enhances analytic workflow transparency without usurping interpretive authority.
- Mechanism: The ITA-GPT enforces methodological guardrails (verbatim extraction, trace-to-text integrity, phase progression with explicit coder consent) that externalize analytic structure while deferring all meaning-making to human judgment. This separation allows the AI to handle organizational labor while researchers retain epistemic control.
- Core assumption: Researchers possess sufficient methodological expertise to recognize when AI outputs require revision; novice users may not exercise equivalent critical oversight.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ITA-GPT functioned as a procedural and methodological scaffold, structuring analytic workflow and enhancing transparency. However, interpretive authority remained with human researchers."
  - [section 4.1.1] "The tool operationalised key methodological principles by structuring the workflow across familiarisation, initial coding, and theme development... implementing Naeem's Exact Keyword Principle by extracting verbatim expressions... creating a transparent audit trail."
  - [corpus] DeTAILS paper confirms similar mechanism: LLM assistance integrated into Braun & Clarke's framework with iterative human oversight (FMR 0.497).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Five recurrent analytic actions (modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, commenting) operationalize human epistemic authority through observable, auditable revision traces.
- Mechanism: Each action type addresses a specific failure mode of AI-generated codes—literalism (correction via modification), hallucination (deletion/rejection), omission (insertion), and opacity (commenting). Together they form a distributed cognition system where meaning-making is tracked across human-AI-artifact interactions.
- Core assumption: The revision traces accurately reflect researchers' interpretive reasoning; without structured capture, epistemic labor becomes invisible.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Researchers consistently exercised epistemic authority through five recurrent analytic actions: modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting."
  - [section 4.3.1] "Across cases, the researchers positioned AI as a scaffold rather than an autonomous analyst... stated that if the AI 'did not maintain the contextual meaning, I deleted that code' and replaced it with a human-generated one."
  - [corpus] "Not a Collaborator or a Supervisor, but an Assistant" paper similarly frames AI as assistant balancing efficiency and ownership (FMR 0.422).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Verbatim (in-vivo) codes provide the most reliable foundation for human-AI collaboration; AI-generated abstractions require systematic human refinement.
- Mechanism: Verbatim codes preserve participant language directly, minimizing AI interpretive distortion. As the system moves toward gerund-based and categorical codes, abstraction introduces cumulative risk of decontextualization, emotional flattening, and institutional blindness—each requiring human correction.
- Core assumption: Participants' exact language carries meaning that AI cannot reliably interpret without human mediation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4.3] "Across coders, in-vivo (verbatim) codes were consistently viewed as the most reliable analytic starting point... Coder 1 reported that in-vivo codes were preferable because they 'preserved the participant's exact language.'"
  - [section 4.3.3] "All three coders observed that the AI tended to 'pick the literal meanings and not the implicit meanings.'"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus signal for this specific gradient; related work on LLM-assisted thematic analysis mentions limitations in capturing nuanced interpretation but does not explicitly test verbatim vs. abstraction reliability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reflexive Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke)**
  - Why needed here: The entire ITA-GPT workflow is built on this framework's phases (familiarization, coding, theme development) and epistemic stance that codes are provisional, researcher-constructed, not "discovered."
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why thematic analysis treats coding as an active construction rather than mechanical extraction?

- Concept: **Human-in-the-Loop AI**
  - Why needed here: The HACITA framework assumes AI outputs are always provisional and require human evaluation, revision, and accountability. Understanding this paradigm prevents treating AI as an autonomous analyst.
  - Quick check question: What specific decision points in the ITA workflow require explicit human authorization before proceeding?

- Concept: **Distributed Cognition (Hutchins)**
  - Why needed here: The study treats meaning-making as distributed across researchers, AI, prompts, and artifacts. Understanding this helps recognize where analytic reasoning actually occurs and how to design for traceability.
  - Quick check question: In the HACITA system, which artifacts carry cognitive load that would otherwise be purely internal to the researcher?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - API Layer (GPT-4 Turbo) -> Segmentation Engine (10-paragraph units) -> Phase Controller (6 phases) -> Code Generator (verbatim enforcement) -> Coverage Auditor -> Revision Layer -> Reflexive Memo System

- Critical path:
  1. Upload transcript -> specify research questions -> select coding mode (verbatim first)
  2. Phase 1: AI generates summaries + emotional tone detection -> human reviews
  3. Phase 2: AI extracts verbatim keywords with trace columns -> human audits exactness
  4. Phase 3: AI proposes gerund-based codes -> human refines for contextual/emotional accuracy
  5. Phase 4-5: AI clusters into candidate themes -> human corrects institutional/professional misalignments
  6. Coverage audit -> human verifies complete transcript treatment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Verbatim enforcement vs. efficiency: Strict exact-keyword extraction slows workflow but protects trace-to-text integrity; relaxation accelerates output but increases human correction burden
  - Low temperature (0.3) vs. creative exploration: Deterministic outputs improve consistency but may miss alternative interpretations; higher temperature introduces variability requiring more rejection/deletion
  - 10-paragraph segmentation vs. thematic coherence: Smaller units improve traceability but may fragment cross-segment themes; larger units risk token limits

- Failure signatures:
  - AI literalism: Codes capture surface meaning but miss implicit/emotional dimensions (requires contextual reframing via modification)
  - Verbatim drift: AI substitutes near-verbatim paraphrases for exact phrases (requires rejection + re-prompting)
  - Category misalignment: AI-generated themes contradict institutional/professional realities (requires categorical deletion and replacement)
  - Coverage gaps: Uncoded transcript segments (requires coverage audit trigger)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verbatim integrity test: Run ITA-GPT on a test transcript with known participant phrases; manually verify that ≥95% of extracted keywords are character-exact matches. Log all drift instances and classify error types.
  2. Revision action profiling: Engage 3 analysts with varying qualitative expertise on identical transcripts; quantify and compare distribution of modification/deletion/rejection/insertion/commenting actions to identify expertise-dependent patterns.
  3. Abstraction gradient stress test: Compare human revision rates for verbatim codes vs. gerund-based codes vs. candidate themes; calculate the ratio of substantive edits required at each level to validate the verbatim-first reliability claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do analytic actions (rejection, insertion, reframing) differ between novice and expert researchers during AI-assisted thematic analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Studies comparing novice and expert researchers would help clarify how analytic actions... develop with methodological expertise."
- Why unresolved: This study exclusively involved three experienced qualitative researchers, so it cannot speak to how less experienced analysts exercise epistemic authority.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative empirical studies using the HACITA framework to track interaction logs of distinct novice and expert cohorts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do AI-assisted workflows produce higher-quality or more valid themes compared to fully human analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the study "did not evaluate whether AI-assisted analysis produces higher-quality themes compared to fully human analysis" and call for "comparative research."
- Why unresolved: The research focused on the *process* of interaction rather than the *substantive outcome* or validity of the final themes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that compares themes generated by human-only, AI-assisted, and hybrid groups against a criterion standard of validity or expert consensus.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which specific interface design features (e.g., reflexive prompts, audit trails) most effectively support epistemic control?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Further work is needed to examine design features and interface affordances... that support epistemic control and transparency."
- Why unresolved: The study tested a single, specific tool configuration (ITA-GPT) and could not isolate which design elements were most critical for maintaining authority.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled A/B testing of AI tools with varying interface features to measure their impact on researcher intervention rates and interpretive depth.

## Limitations

- Transferability to novice researchers remains unclear since all coders were experienced qualitative analysts
- Exact system prompts and Python integration scripts were not shared, preventing direct replication
- While verbatim codes showed highest reliability, the quantitative threshold for acceptable verbatim-to-abstract transition remains undefined

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: AI as procedural scaffold with human epistemic authority
- **Medium confidence**: Five analytic action framework for operationalizing epistemic authority
- **Low confidence**: Verbatim-first reliability gradient

## Next Checks

1. Test the verbatim-to-abstract reliability gradient with 30 researchers across expertise levels, measuring edit distances between AI outputs and human refinements at each coding stage
2. Implement blinded review where independent coders evaluate the same transcripts using ITA-GPT vs. manual coding to quantify efficiency gains without accuracy loss
3. Conduct think-aloud protocols during ITA-GPT usage to capture real-time epistemic reasoning behind modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting actions
