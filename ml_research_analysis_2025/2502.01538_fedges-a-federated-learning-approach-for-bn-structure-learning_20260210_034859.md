# FedGES: A Federated Learning Approach for BN Structure Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.01538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01538
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: FedGES outperforms federated learning algorithms and non-federated baselines in BN structure learning, particularly in high-dimensional and sparse data scenarios

## Executive Summary
FedGES introduces a federated learning approach for Bayesian Network (BN) structure learning in privacy-sensitive, decentralized environments. The method addresses the challenge of learning BN structures without centralizing data by exchanging only evolving network structures, not parameters or data. FedGES employs the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm and uses iterative structural fusion to combine limited models generated by each client. A controlled structural fusion mechanism enhances client consensus when adding edges.

## Method Summary
FedGES employs a federated learning approach to Bayesian Network structure learning, addressing the challenge of learning BN structures without centralizing data. The method uses the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm locally on each client's data to generate limited models, which are then iteratively fused across clients. The key innovation is a controlled structural fusion mechanism that enhances client consensus when adding edges to the BN structure. This approach allows for privacy-preserving learning of BN structures while maintaining model accuracy and reducing computational overhead compared to traditional federated learning methods.

## Key Results
- FedGES consistently outperforms alternative federated learning algorithms (FedPC, RFcd) and non-federated baselines in terms of Structural Moralized Hamming Distance (SMHD) scores
- The method demonstrates superior performance in high-dimensional and sparse data scenarios
- FedGES achieves execution times several orders of magnitude faster than competing federated approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedGES works by leveraging the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm locally on each client's data to generate limited models. These models are then iteratively fused across clients using a controlled structural fusion mechanism. This approach allows for the exchange of only evolving network structures, not parameters or data, ensuring privacy while maintaining model accuracy. The controlled structural fusion enhances client consensus when adding edges to the BN structure, leading to improved overall performance.

## Foundational Learning

### Bayesian Networks
- Why needed: Core representation of probabilistic relationships between variables
- Quick check: Ensure understanding of DAG structure and conditional independence

### Federated Learning
- Why needed: Enables distributed learning without centralizing data
- Quick check: Understand the difference between centralized and federated approaches

### Greedy Equivalence Search (GES)
- Why needed: Local algorithm for BN structure learning on each client
- Quick check: Grasp the two-phase approach (forward, backward) of GES

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Client (GES) -> Local Model Generation -> Model Fusion Server -> Global Model Update -> Client Update

### Critical Path
GES algorithm execution on clients → Local model generation → Model fusion server processing → Global model update → Client model update

### Design Tradeoffs
- Privacy vs. Model Accuracy: Exchanging only structures preserves privacy but may limit information sharing
- Computational Efficiency vs. Model Complexity: Local GES reduces computational load but may produce simpler models
- Consensus Building vs. Model Diversity: Controlled fusion enhances consensus but may reduce model diversity

### Failure Signatures
- Poor convergence: Indicates insufficient consensus building or highly heterogeneous data
- High SMHD scores: Suggests ineffective fusion strategy or inadequate local model generation
- Slow execution: May indicate inefficient implementation or excessive model complexity

### First 3 Experiments
1. Test FedGES on a simple BN with 5-10 variables and 2-3 clients
2. Evaluate performance on a medium-sized BN (20-30 variables) with varying client numbers
3. Compare FedGES with non-federated GES on a large BN (50+ variables) to assess computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation focuses on synthetic and curated datasets, raising questions about real-world applicability
- Controlled structural fusion mechanism may not generalize well to highly heterogeneous client data distributions
- Comparison with non-federated baselines assumes similar computational resources and time constraints

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The core methodology of FedGES and its federated learning approach

**Medium Confidence:**
- Experimental results and performance comparisons
- The effectiveness of controlled structural fusion in enhancing consensus

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FedGES on real-world datasets with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and noise to assess practical applicability
2. Test the algorithm's performance and convergence with a larger number of clients and highly unbalanced data distributions
3. Investigate the impact of different edge addition policies in the GES algorithm on the overall performance and consensus building process
