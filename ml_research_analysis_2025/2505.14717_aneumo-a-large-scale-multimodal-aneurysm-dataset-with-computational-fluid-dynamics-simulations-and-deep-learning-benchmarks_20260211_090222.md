# Aneumo: A Large-Scale Multimodal Aneurysm Dataset with Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations and Deep Learning Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14717
- Reference count: 40
- Large-scale multimodal aneurysm dataset integrating synthetic 3D geometries, CFD simulations, and segmentation masks for AI-driven hemodynamic modeling

## Executive Summary
Aneumo is a comprehensive dataset designed to address the shortage of large-scale, multimodal data for intracranial aneurysm research. It combines 10,660 synthetic 3D aneurysm geometries, 85,280 high-fidelity CFD simulations under eight physiological flow conditions, and corresponding segmentation masks. The synthetic geometries were derived from 427 real cases via controlled deformation and validated by neurosurgeons. The dataset enables deep learning applications in computational hemodynamics, biofluids, and clinical risk assessment, with benchmark models (DeepONet and DeepONet-SwinT) achieving robust hemodynamic predictions on unseen real aneurysm data.

## Method Summary
Aneumo was constructed by generating synthetic 3D aneurysm geometries through controlled deformation of 427 real patient anatomies, followed by expert validation. These geometries were used as inputs for high-fidelity CFD simulations under eight physiologically relevant flow conditions, producing velocity and pressure field data. Segmentation masks were also generated for each geometry. The dataset was benchmarked using two deep learning architectures—DeepONet and DeepONet-SwinT—to predict hemodynamic parameters from geometry. DeepONet-SwinT demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to DeepONet on real aneurysm test cases.

## Key Results
- 10,660 synthetic 3D aneurysm geometries and 85,280 CFD simulations under eight physiological flow conditions
- DeepONet-SwinT outperformed DeepONet with lower L2 and MNAE errors on unseen real aneurysm data
- Dataset supports multimodal learning tasks in computational hemodynamics, biofluids, and clinical risk assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset integrates synthetic geometry generation, high-fidelity CFD simulations, and multimodal learning to enable data-driven hemodynamic modeling. By combining diverse aneurysm morphologies with extensive flow simulations, it provides rich, structured data for training and benchmarking deep learning models. The inclusion of segmentation masks and multiple flow conditions allows for comprehensive analysis of aneurysm hemodynamics and risk stratification.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Geometry Generation -> CFD Simulation -> Segmentation -> Deep Learning Benchmark (DeepONet/DeepONet-SwinT)

**Critical Path**
Synthetic geometry generation → CFD simulation → Deep learning training → Benchmark evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Synthetic vs. real geometries: Synthetic data enables scale but may lack anatomical complexity.
- Rigid walls vs. compliance: Simplifies CFD but omits biomechanical realism.
- Newtonian vs. non-Newtonian blood: Reduces computational cost but sacrifices rheological accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor generalization to real anatomies if synthetic data lacks diversity.
- Inaccurate hemodynamic predictions if CFD assumptions (e.g., rigid walls) are violated.
- Benchmark overfitting if training data distribution differs from real clinical cases.

**First Experiments**
1. Train DeepONet on synthetic data and test on a small set of real aneurysm geometries.
2. Compare DeepONet and DeepONet-SwinT performance on velocity field prediction.
3. Evaluate segmentation mask prediction accuracy across different aneurysm morphologies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exclusive use of synthetic geometries, which may not fully capture real patient anatomical complexity.
- Reliance on idealized boundary conditions without patient-specific flow rates or vessel wall properties.
- Benchmark limited to two architectures and a small set of real aneurysm test cases.

## Confidence
- Dataset construction and synthesis methodology: High
- CFD simulation pipeline and dataset completeness: High
- Benchmark results: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Validate predictive performance on a larger, more diverse cohort of real patient aneurysm geometries with varying morphologies and flow conditions.
2. Incorporate patient-specific boundary conditions, vessel wall compliance, and non-Newtonian blood rheology into CFD simulations to assess impact on hemodynamic predictions.
3. Expand the benchmark to include additional hemodynamic parameters, model architectures (e.g., graph neural networks, hybrid physics-informed models), and clinically relevant risk stratification tasks.
