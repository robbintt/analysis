# Entropy-Guided Token Dropout: Training Autoregressive Language Models with Limited Domain Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.23422
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23422
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: EntroDrop outperforms standard baselines on math reasoning and code generation benchmarks across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters

## Executive Summary
EntroDrop addresses performance degradation in autoregressive language models during multi-epoch training on limited domain data. The method tackles an imbalance where low-entropy, predictable tokens dominate learning while high-entropy tokens lose generalization capability. By selectively masking low-entropy tokens and using a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength over time, EntroDrop preserves informative gradients for uncertain tokens and extends effective training duration. The approach consistently improves performance across model scales and benchmarks while better maintaining general capabilities compared to other regularization techniques.

## Method Summary
EntroDrop is a token dropout strategy that uses entropy-based masking to selectively drop low-entropy tokens during autoregressive language model training. The method estimates token entropy during training and masks tokens below a certain entropy threshold, preventing them from contributing to the loss function. A curriculum schedule gradually adjusts the entropy threshold and dropout rate over training epochs, starting with stronger regularization and easing it as training progresses. This dynamic approach ensures that early training focuses on challenging tokens while preventing overfitting to predictable patterns in limited data. The entropy estimation is computed online during training, making the method computationally tractable for large-scale models.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms standard baselines on math reasoning and code generation benchmarks
- Effective across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters
- Extends effective training duration by preventing early overfitting
- Better preserves general capabilities compared to other regularization techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core mechanism addresses a fundamental training imbalance in autoregressive models: low-entropy tokens (predictable words like "the", "is", etc.) dominate gradient updates because they appear frequently and have low uncertainty, while high-entropy tokens (rare, informative words) receive insufficient gradient signal. This creates a positive feedback loop where the model overfits to common patterns while failing to learn rare but important tokens. EntroDrop breaks this cycle by selectively masking low-entropy tokens, forcing the model to focus on uncertain, high-entropy tokens that carry more information. The curriculum schedule ensures the model doesn't get stuck in local minima by gradually reducing regularization as training progresses, allowing it to refine learned patterns while maintaining generalization.

## Foundational Learning

**Token Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty in token prediction, calculated from the model's probability distribution over the vocabulary. Higher entropy indicates more uncertainty and potentially more information content. Why needed: Forms the basis for identifying which tokens should be masked to improve learning efficiency. Quick check: Verify entropy values align with intuitive notions of token predictability.

**Autoregressive Training**: Sequential prediction where each token is predicted based on previous tokens. Why needed: The training paradigm that EntroDrop modifies through selective masking. Quick check: Confirm the model maintains autoregressive property after dropout modifications.

**Curriculum Learning**: Training strategy that starts with easier examples or tasks and progressively increases difficulty. Why needed: Guides the regularization strength schedule to prevent premature convergence. Quick check: Validate that the curriculum schedule improves convergence compared to static approaches.

**Gradient Imbalance**: Phenomenon where frequent, predictable tokens dominate gradient updates more than rare, informative tokens. Why needed: The core problem EntroDrop solves through selective masking. Quick check: Measure gradient contributions from different entropy ranges before and after dropout.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input tokens -> Entropy Estimation -> Threshold Comparison -> Token Masking -> Loss Computation -> Backpropagation -> Model Parameters

**Critical Path**: During each forward pass, tokens flow through the model to generate probability distributions, which are used to estimate entropy. Tokens below the current threshold are masked (set to zero contribution in loss). The masked loss is computed and backpropagated only through unmasked tokens, updating model parameters selectively.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The entropy threshold and curriculum schedule parameters require careful tuning - too aggressive masking prevents learning common patterns, while too conservative masking fails to address the core imbalance. Online entropy estimation adds computational overhead but enables adaptive masking without requiring additional data passes.

**Failure Signatures**: If masking is too aggressive, the model fails to learn basic language patterns and produces grammatically incorrect or nonsensical output. If the curriculum schedule is too slow, the model overfits to low-entropy tokens before reaching higher thresholds. Poor threshold calibration leads to either excessive masking (losing useful information) or insufficient masking (failing to address the core problem).

**First Experiments**: 1) Measure entropy distribution of tokens in limited domain data to establish baseline patterns. 2) Test different static entropy thresholds to find optimal masking rates. 3) Implement and validate the curriculum schedule by monitoring training loss curves and validation performance across epochs.
