# Deep Learning for Perishable Inventory Systems with Human Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.15589
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15589
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: E2E-PIL model with structure-guided learning outperforms black-box approaches in perishable inventory ordering

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of developing data-driven ordering policies for perishable inventory systems with unknown demand and lead time processes. The authors propose using marginal cost accounting to create a per-order loss function suitable for end-to-end learning, enabling direct optimization of inventory management policies. They develop two neural network architectures - a black-box model (E2E-BB) and a structure-guided model (E2E-PIL) that embeds the projected inventory level policy. The structure-guided approach leverages human knowledge about effective inventory heuristics while learning optimal parameters from data.

The research demonstrates that embedding structure-informed heuristics into neural network architectures can significantly improve learning efficiency and performance compared to purely black-box approaches. The authors further show that their induced objective is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a constant scaling enhancement (E2E-BPIL) that improves performance further based on operational data analytics. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data validate the effectiveness of their approach.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle perishable inventory management by formulating the problem as an end-to-end learning task. They use marginal cost accounting to derive a per-order loss function that enables direct optimization of ordering decisions. Two neural network architectures are proposed: E2E-BB, a fully black-box approach, and E2E-PIL, which incorporates the projected inventory level policy structure. The E2E-PIL model uses inventory state only to compute projected on-hand inventory while learning a target level from features. A key theoretical contribution is showing that the induced objective is homogeneous of degree one, which enables a constant scaling enhancement (E2E-BPIL) based on operational data analytics. The models are trained using real and synthetic data, with performance evaluated across multiple metrics including cost reduction and learning efficiency.

## Key Results
- E2E-PIL consistently outperforms E2E-BB across all experimental settings, demonstrating the value of structure-guided learning
- E2E-BPIL further improves upon E2E-PIL through constant scaling enhancement derived from homogeneity properties
- Theory-guided structure reduces model complexity and improves learning efficiency while maintaining or improving performance
- The excess risk decomposition shows that embedding effective heuristic structure reduces generalization error without increasing approximation error

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by bridging the gap between human expertise in inventory management and data-driven learning. By embedding the projected inventory level policy - a well-established heuristic in operations management - into the neural network architecture, the model benefits from both the flexibility of deep learning and the proven effectiveness of domain knowledge. The marginal cost accounting method solves the intertemporal cost attribution problem that typically plagues reinforcement learning approaches to inventory management. The homogeneity property of the objective function enables a simple yet effective scaling enhancement that further improves performance without requiring additional model complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Marginal cost accounting**: Needed to address intertemporal cost attribution in sequential decision-making; quick check: verify cost attribution is correctly allocated to individual ordering decisions
- **Projected inventory level policy**: Traditional heuristic for perishable inventory; quick check: ensure projected inventory calculations correctly account for demand and lead time
- **Homogeneity of degree one**: Mathematical property enabling constant scaling enhancement; quick check: verify objective function satisfies homogeneity conditions
- **End-to-end learning**: Direct optimization of ordering policies from data; quick check: confirm gradient flow through the entire ordering decision pipeline
- **Structure-guided vs black-box learning**: Comparison of knowledge-embedded vs pure data-driven approaches; quick check: evaluate performance gap between E2E-PIL and E2E-BB
- **Excess risk decomposition**: Analysis framework for understanding generalization vs approximation trade-offs; quick check: validate decomposition components sum correctly

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Features -> Neural Network -> Projected Inventory Calculation -> Order Quantity -> Cost Calculation -> Loss Function

**Critical Path**: Demand features → Neural network → Target level learning → Projected inventory calculation → Order quantity decision → Cost evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Black-box (E2E-BB) offers maximum flexibility but requires more data and may struggle with generalization; structure-guided (E2E-PIL) incorporates domain knowledge for better sample efficiency and interpretability but may be limited by the quality of the embedded heuristic

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on E2E-PIL may indicate misalignment between the projected inventory level policy and true optimal policy; failure of constant scaling enhancement may suggest violation of homogeneity assumptions or heterogeneous cost structures across products

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare E2E-PIL vs E2E-BB on synthetic data with known optimal policy to quantify benefit of structure guidance
2. Test constant scaling enhancement on data with varying cost ratios to validate homogeneity-based improvement
3. Evaluate model transfer from synthetic to real data to assess practical applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Assumes deterministic lead times in E2E-PIL model formulation, limiting applicability to settings with high lead time variability
- Relies on specific assumptions about cost structure that may not hold in all perishable inventory contexts
- Synthetic data experiments may not fully capture real-world complexity with heterogeneous products and operational constraints

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Theoretical results on homogeneity of degree one and constant scaling enhancement are mathematically rigorous. Performance superiority of structure-informed learning is consistently demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence**: Transferability from synthetic to real-world data requires additional validation, particularly for constant scaling enhancement across heterogeneous operational data. Known cost parameters assumption may not hold in practice.

**Low Confidence**: Does not address demand censoring or stockout patterns common in perishable systems. Impact of model misspecification when projected inventory policy misaligns with optimal policy remains unclear.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-validation on heterogeneous operational data**: Test constant scaling enhancement across multiple product categories with varying cost structures and demand patterns to assess generalizability.

2. **Robustness to lead time uncertainty**: Evaluate model performance under stochastic lead times and compare against methods that explicitly handle lead time variability.

3. **Transfer learning assessment**: Implement sequential learning framework where models are first trained on synthetic data then fine-tuned on limited real-world data to evaluate practical applicability.
