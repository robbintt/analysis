## Executive Summary
This paper develops an online statistical inference method for constrained stochastic optimization using Random Scaling with Adaptive Inexact Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (AI-SSQP). The approach leverages sketching to approximately solve expensive quadratic subproblems and employs an adaptive random stepsize for updates. The method establishes asymptotic normality for averaged AI-SSQP iterates, showing they achieve better statistical efficiency than last iterates with a smaller limiting covariance matrix. A key contribution is the random scaling technique that constructs a test statistic whose limiting distribution is free of unknown parameters, enabling asymptotically valid confidence intervals without covariance matrix estimation.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP) with random scaling to enable statistical inference in constrained stochastic optimization. The AI-SSQP algorithm uses adaptive inexact solutions to quadratic subproblems through sketching techniques, reducing computational cost while maintaining theoretical guarantees. The random scaling component generates test statistics whose limiting distributions are parameter-free, eliminating the need for covariance matrix estimation. The method employs averaged iterates rather than final iterates, achieving improved statistical efficiency. The overall computational complexity is O((d+m)²), matching first-order methods, making it suitable for large-scale problems.

## Key Results
- Establishes asymptotic normality for averaged AI-SSQP iterates with smaller limiting covariance than last iterates
- Introduces random scaling technique enabling asymptotically valid inference without covariance estimation
- Achieves O((d+m)²) computational complexity, matching first-order methods while providing statistical inference
- Validated on nonlinearly constrained regression problems with superior coverage rates and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining adaptive inexact optimization with random scaling for statistical inference. The sketching technique approximates quadratic subproblems efficiently, while the adaptive stepsize rule balances convergence and statistical accuracy. Random scaling transforms the test statistic into a parameter-free distribution, enabling valid inference without estimating the limiting covariance matrix. The averaging of iterates rather than using final values reduces the limiting covariance, improving statistical efficiency. This combination allows simultaneous optimization and inference in a computationally efficient manner.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP): A method for solving stochastic optimization problems with constraints by iteratively solving quadratic approximations. Needed to handle the constrained nature of the problem while maintaining computational efficiency. Quick check: Verify quadratic subproblem formulation matches problem structure.
- Sketching techniques: Methods for dimensionality reduction that approximate large matrices or operators with smaller ones. Required to make quadratic subproblem solutions computationally tractable. Quick check: Confirm sketching preserves essential problem structure.
- Random scaling: A technique that applies random transformations to construct test statistics with parameter-free limiting distributions. Essential for enabling inference without covariance matrix estimation. Quick check: Verify limiting distribution independence from unknown parameters.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Random Scaling -> Adaptive Inexact SSQP -> Averaged Iterates -> Statistical Inference

Critical Path:
1. Problem formulation and constraint verification
2. Adaptive stepsize selection and parameter tuning
3. Quadratic subproblem sketching and solution
4. Iterate averaging and test statistic construction
5. Confidence interval computation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational efficiency vs. solution accuracy in sketching
- Adaptivity vs. theoretical guarantees in stepsize selection
- Averaging vs. last iterate convergence rates
- Random scaling vs. traditional covariance estimation

Failure Signatures:
- Poor constraint qualification leading to infeasible iterates
- Sketch dimension too small causing inaccurate subproblem solutions
- Stepsize parameters poorly chosen affecting convergence
- Random scaling test function inappropriate for problem structure

First Experiments:
1. Test on simple constrained quadratic problem with known solution
2. Validate asymptotic normality on synthetic constrained regression
3. Compare computational time vs. accuracy tradeoff with varying sketch dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Adaptive stepsize rule relies on unknown tuning parameters requiring careful selection
- Theoretical guarantees assume Lipschitz continuity of constraint functions and bounded second moments
- Limited empirical validation restricted to nonlinearly constrained regression problems
- Does not address constraint qualification violations or ill-conditioned problem performance

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical framework and asymptotic normality results | High |
| Computational efficiency claims | Medium |
| Practical applicability across domains | Medium |
| Method robustness to constraint violations | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test the method's performance on additional constrained optimization problems beyond regression, including applications with inequality constraints and higher-dimensional problems.

2. Evaluate the method's sensitivity to initialization and early iterations by varying starting points and measuring convergence rates.

3. Investigate the impact of constraint qualification violations and ill-conditioned problems on the method's stability and accuracy.
