## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SELFORG, a multi-agent LLM collaboration framework that dynamically constructs communication graphs based on agents' current responses without requiring external judges, pretrained graph generators, or reinforcement learning. The key innovation is a response-conditioned, decentralized approach that estimates agent contributions via Shapley-inspired cosine similarity, then forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to route information from high-contributing agents to others. This enables lightweight, model-agnostic credit assignment and stable message propagation. The method achieves strong performance across various reasoning benchmarks, particularly excelling in the weak-agent regime where prior methods fail.

## Method Summary
SELFORG implements a dynamic multi-agent collaboration system where agents iteratively refine their responses through a response-conditioned communication graph. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: contribution estimation via cosine similarity between responses and their centroid, DAG-based information flow from high-contributing to low-contributing agents, and consensus-based early stopping. Agents independently generate initial responses, then participate in rounds of information exchange where the communication topology adapts based on current contribution scores. The system aggregates final responses by selecting the one nearest to the centroid of all agents' embeddings.

## Key Results
- Achieves strong performance across reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, MMLU-Pro) using weak-to-strong LLM backbones
- Outperforms all baselines by up to +4 points in average accuracy, particularly in the weak-agent regime
- Demonstrates effective scaling with model size and handles heterogeneous agent pools
- Includes efficient early-stopping variant based on peer consensus, improving token efficiency while preserving accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Response-Conditioned Contribution Estimation
If correct responses cluster tightly in semantic space while incorrect responses disperse, a cosine-similarity metric can approximate agent contribution without external supervision. Agents generate initial responses independently, then the system computes estimated contribution scores via cosine similarity to the average response. Theoretical analysis suggests that if correct answers form a cluster, agents in that cluster will have strictly higher contribution scores than those outside it.

### Mechanism 2: Directed Acyclic Flow for Correctness Propagation
Enforcing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure based on contribution scores allows high-value information to flow downstream to weaker agents, creating a self-correcting loop. A communication graph is formed where edges connect agents only if their responses are semantically similar, directed from high-contribution to low-contribution agents. Cycle removal ensures that "leaders" (high contribution) influence others without being polluted by low-contribution nodes upstream.

### Mechanism 3: Agreement-Based Early Stopping
If the system detects high semantic consensus (minimum pairwise similarity above threshold), further rounds of debate yield diminishing returns, allowing for efficient termination. An efficient variant monitors minimum consensus across all agent pairs and halts when consensus is reached, selecting the response nearest the centroid.

## Foundational Learning

- **Shapley Values in Cooperative Game Theory**: The paper uses a Shapley-inspired metric to value agent contributions. Understanding the original intent (marginal contribution of a player to a coalition) explains why the metric is designed to identify "value" rather than just "difference." *Quick check: Why does the paper approximate Shapley values with cosine similarity rather than computing exact values?*

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: The communication topology is strictly a DAG. This prevents circular arguments and ensures information flows from "sources" (high contribution) to "sinks," stabilizing the multi-round process. *Quick check: How does the cycle-removal heuristic ensure the "best" agent remains upstream?*

- **Semantic Embeddings & Cosine Similarity**: The entire contribution estimation and graph construction relies on embedding agent responses and comparing angles. Understanding that this captures semantic alignment rather than keyword matching is crucial. *Quick check: What does it imply for the mechanism if the embedding model fails to distinguish between a correct math derivation and a confidently stated wrong number?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Agent Pool -> Embedder -> Contribution Estimator -> Graph Builder -> Aggregator
- **Critical path**: Round 0: Broadcast Query → Agents → Responses → Embeddings → Compute ψn → Build DAG → Route messages along DAG edges → Agents update responses → Check consensus → Exit: Compute centroid → Select nearest response
- **Design tradeoffs**: Increasing agents or rounds improves accuracy in weak-backend regime but linearly increases token consumption; using small embedder is efficient but adds noise vs larger embedders that sharpen ranking but add latency
- **Failure signatures**: Graph Fragmentation if threshold too high; Echo Chambers if threshold too low and misconception exists; Rank Inversion if weak agent ranks highest due to embedding failure
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run SelfOrg vs Single Agent on weak backbone (Qwen-1.5B) on GSM8K to verify weak regime amplification; 2) Disable dynamic reforming to measure impact of dynamic re-organization on accuracy; 3) Implement early-stopping criterion and plot accuracy vs token reduction compared to fixed 3-round baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does SELFORG's advantage erode or become negative when applied to frontier-scale models where single-agent accuracy is already saturated? The paper notes on AQUA-RAT with 72B model, accuracy slightly decreased from 81.10% to 80.71%, suggesting diminishing returns. This remains unresolved as the paper doesn't determine if coordination overhead causes active harm in high-accuracy regimes.

### Open Question 2
Does the "correctness cluster" assumption hold for subjective or open-ended generation tasks where valid responses are semantically diverse? The framework relies on correct answers clustering while wrong ones scatter, supported only by math data. Generative tasks may produce multiple valid but semantically distinct responses that fail to cluster, potentially lowering contribution scores for valid outputs.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the capacity of the lightweight embedding model limit SELFORG's ability to detect subtle semantic errors? The paper shows larger embedding models provide sharper separation between strong and weak agents. It's unclear if noise from weaker embeddings causes the system to reject semantically similar but lexically distinct correct answers.

## Limitations
- Semantic cluster assumption unproven across diverse domains; framework could catastrophically fail if misconception clusters form tighter than correct answer clusters
- Embedding model dependency creates fundamental tradeoff between efficient but potentially unreliable embeddings versus accurate but expensive ones
- Sycophancy risk where agents rapidly converge on plausible but incorrect answers through groupthink, especially with common misconceptions

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical framework for contribution estimation via cosine similarity and DAG-based information flow are mathematically sound given assumptions; empirical results showing performance gains in weak-agent regime are well-documented
- **Medium**: Claims about scaling with model size and handling heterogeneous agent pools are supported but require more stress testing; efficiency gains from early stopping are promising but only validated on specific benchmarks
- **Low**: Fundamental assumption about answer clustering behavior across diverse domains lacks rigorous validation; relies heavily on observed behavior in reasoning tasks without proving extension to other domains

## Next Checks
1. **Cluster Validation Study**: Systematically test clustering assumption across 10+ diverse domains (math, code, creative writing, factual recall) using multiple embedding models. Measure whether correct answers consistently cluster tighter than incorrect ones, and identify domains where this assumption fails.

2. **Sycophancy Stress Test**: Design adversarial scenarios where initial responses contain common misconceptions. Run SELFORG with varying agent counts and thresholds to measure false consensus rates. Compare against baselines to quantify risk of groupthink amplification.

3. **Embedding Robustness Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments varying embedder quality (MiniLM vs. MPNet vs. larger models) while keeping all else constant. Measure correlation between embedding noise and contribution estimation errors, and establish guidelines for embedder selection based on task characteristics.
