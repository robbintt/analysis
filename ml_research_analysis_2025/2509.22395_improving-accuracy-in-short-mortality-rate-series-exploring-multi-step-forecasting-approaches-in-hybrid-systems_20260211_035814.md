# Improving accuracy in short mortality rate series: Exploring Multi-step Forecasting Approaches in Hybrid Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.22395
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22395
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: ARIMA-LSTM hybrid with Recursive forecasting achieved best accuracy (mean MAPE 1.905%) across 12 datasets from 4 countries

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of improving mortality rate forecasting accuracy using short time series, critical for insurance, pension funds, and demographic planning. The authors propose hybrid systems combining statistical (ARIMA) and machine learning models (LSTM, MLP, N-BEATS) to capture both linear and nonlinear patterns in mortality data. They evaluate three multi-step forecasting approaches—Recursive, Direct, and MIMO—across 12 datasets covering Australia, France, Japan, and Portugal.

The Recursive approach demonstrated superior accuracy for residual series modeling, outperforming Direct and MIMO approaches in 58.33% to 66.67% of cases across different hybrid models. Among the machine learning models, LSTM showed the best performance in forecasting residuals, achieving the lowest error in 41.67% of datasets. The ARIMA-LSTM hybrid system with Recursive multi-step forecasting achieved the best overall accuracy, outperforming single statistical, machine learning, and multivariate models.

## Method Summary
The authors develop hybrid forecasting systems by combining ARIMA models for capturing linear patterns with machine learning models (LSTM, MLP, N-BEATS) for modeling nonlinear residuals. They test three multi-step forecasting approaches: Recursive (single model iteratively forecasts future steps), Direct (separate model for each horizon), and MIMO (single model forecasts all future steps simultaneously). The methodology is evaluated on mortality rate data from four countries across 12 datasets, comparing performance against single statistical models, pure machine learning approaches, and multivariate models.

## Key Results
- Recursive approach outperformed Direct and MIMO in 58.33%-66.67% of cases for residual modeling
- LSTM achieved best performance among machine learning models (lowest error in 41.67% of datasets)
- ARIMA-LSTM hybrid with Recursive forecasting achieved mean MAPE of 1.905% across all datasets
- Hybrid system reduced forecasting error by 4.44% to 71.46% compared to alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach succeeds by combining ARIMA's strength in capturing linear trends and seasonal patterns with machine learning models' ability to model nonlinear residuals and complex patterns. The Recursive multi-step approach benefits from learning from its own forecasts, which is particularly effective when modeling residuals that tend to be smaller and more stable than raw series. This decomposition strategy allows each component to focus on its comparative advantage, leading to improved overall accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **ARIMA models**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models capture linear time series patterns through differencing, autoregression, and moving averages. Why needed: Provides baseline statistical modeling for linear mortality trends. Quick check: Verify stationarity through differencing and examine ACF/PACF plots.
- **LSTM networks**: Long Short-Term Memory networks handle sequential data with memory cells that maintain information across time steps. Why needed: Captures nonlinear temporal dependencies in mortality data residuals. Quick check: Monitor training/validation loss curves for overfitting.
- **Multi-step forecasting approaches**: Three strategies (Recursive, Direct, MIMO) for predicting multiple future time steps. Why needed: Different approaches suit different data characteristics and computational constraints. Quick check: Compare error accumulation across forecasting horizons.
- **Hybrid modeling**: Combining statistical and machine learning approaches to leverage complementary strengths. Why needed: Addresses limitations of pure statistical or pure ML approaches in mortality forecasting. Quick check: Evaluate residual patterns after each modeling stage.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ARIMA -> Residual extraction -> ML model (LSTM/MLP/N-BEATS) -> Forecast combination

Critical path: Data preprocessing -> ARIMA modeling -> Residual calculation -> ML model training -> Recursive forecasting -> Error evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Statistical models offer interpretability and handle linear patterns well but miss nonlinear dynamics. ML models capture complex patterns but require more data and lack interpretability. Hybrid systems balance these tradeoffs but increase complexity.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may indicate: (1) inadequate ARIMA model specification for linear components, (2) insufficient ML model capacity for residual patterns, (3) inappropriate multi-step approach for the data characteristics, or (4) improper error metric selection.

First experiments:
1. Test ARIMA model adequacy by examining residual autocorrelation and normality
2. Compare ML model performance on raw vs. residual data
3. Evaluate each multi-step approach on a single dataset before full-scale testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow geographic scope covering only four countries (Australia, France, Japan, Portugal)
- Focus on short time series may not translate well to longer historical datasets
- Performance under structural breaks or regime changes in mortality patterns unexplored

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| ARIMA-LSTM hybrid with Recursive forecasting achieves best accuracy | High |
| Generalizability to other populations and longer time series | Medium |
| Specific error reductions reported (4.44%-71.46%) | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test hybrid models on mortality data from additional countries and regions to assess generalizability across diverse demographic patterns
2. Evaluate model performance during periods of significant mortality shocks or structural breaks to assess robustness under extreme conditions
3. Compare the hybrid approach against alternative error metrics and forecasting horizons to ensure comprehensive assessment of forecast quality
