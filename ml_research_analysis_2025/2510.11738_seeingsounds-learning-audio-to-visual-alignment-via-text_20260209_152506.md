# SeeingSounds: Learning Audio-to-Visual Alignment via Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11738
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11738
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: New state-of-the-art in controllable audio-to-image generation without paired audio-visual training data

## Executive Summary
SeeingSounds introduces a lightweight, modular framework for audio-to-image generation that leverages text-mediated alignment rather than paired audio-visual training. The method projects audio features into semantic language space via a frozen text encoder and grounds them into visual domain using a vision-language model, enabling generation without training visual models. Operating on frozen diffusion backbones with only lightweight adapters trained, it supports fine-grained control through procedural text prompt generation where audio transformations map to descriptive prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

## Method Summary
The framework uses frozen encoders (AST for audio, T5 for text, CLIP for vision-language, FLUX for diffusion) with only lightweight MLP adapters and attention pooling layers trained. Audio features are projected to match text and CLIP embedding spaces via MSE loss, then used to condition a frozen diffusion model for image generation. Class-level captions are generated via GPT-4o, and controllability is achieved through procedural mapping of audio transformations (volume, pitch) to descriptive text prompts. Training uses two AdamW optimizers (lr=1e-5 for T5 branch, lr=1e-7 for CLIP branch) on a single H100 GPU.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art AIC scores across standard benchmarks (VEGAS, RAVDESS, Landscape+Into the Wild)
- Demonstrates effective controllability where volume changes produce visually consistent object size modifications
- Outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings without requiring paired audio-visual data
- Ablation studies confirm importance of both T5 and CLIP alignment paths, with T5-only showing significantly better performance than CLIP-only

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Text-mediated alignment enables audio-to-visual generation without paired audio-visual data. Audio features are projected through learnable MLP adapters and attention pooling to match frozen text encoder outputs (T5) and vision-language encoder outputs (CLIP) using MSE loss. At inference, aligned audio embeddings condition a frozen diffusion model. Assumes frozen text encoders capture sufficient semantic structure to ground audio representations.

### Mechanism 2
Attention pooling enables flexible token-length matching across modalities. Learnable query tokens perform cross-attention over audio-derived token sequences, mapping from m audio tokens to l text tokens or 1 CLIP vector. Preserves token relationships better than averaging. Assumes attention pooling captures inter-token dependencies necessary for semantic preservation.

### Mechanism 3
Procedural prompt generation enables controllable generation without model retraining. Audio transformations (volume, pitch) map to text descriptions via predefined rules and LLM-assisted caption editing. Mixed audio yields compositional prompts. Assumes audio signal modifications have consistent, learnable mappings to semantic descriptors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Frozen backbone training / adapter-based fine-tuning**: Why needed - entire approach depends on training lightweight modules while keeping encoders frozen. Quick check - explain why gradients don't flow through frozen parameters and how this affects memory/compute.
- **Cross-modal alignment via representation matching**: Why needed - core training objective aligns audio embeddings to text/CLIP spaces via MSE. Quick check - what assumptions does MSE-based alignment make about the structure of the target embedding space?
- **Attention pooling / learnable queries**: Why needed - critical for matching variable-length audio token sequences to text/vision token sequences. Quick check - how does attention pooling differ from mean pooling, and when would each fail?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio → AST → A_T/A_V → attention pooling → MSE vs. T5/CLIP outputs (training) OR → FLUX conditioning (inference)
- **Critical path**: Audio features flow through AST encoder, adapt through MLP layers, match dimensions via attention pooling, align to text/CLIP spaces via MSE loss during training, or directly condition FLUX during inference
- **Design tradeoffs**: No paired audio-visual data vs. potential semantic gaps; frozen diffusion backbone vs. inability to specialize for audio; class-level captions only vs. loss of fine-grained correspondence
- **Failure signatures**: High training loss but poor visual quality (check attention pooling convergence); semantically wrong but technically correct images (text encoder may not capture audio semantics); controllability fails (transformation-caption mapping may be inconsistent)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train on single class, verify adapter outputs correlate with text embeddings (cosine similarity > 0.7)
  2. Replace attention pooling with mean pooling on VEGAS-5, expect AIC drop similar to paper's ~40 points
  3. Apply volume scaling to 10 samples, verify generated object size changes correspond to prompt modifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework be adapted to ensure temporal coherence and motion dynamics in audio-to-video generation? The paper mentions video generation as a preliminary extension but doesn't address maintaining consistency across frames while synchronizing visual motion with temporal audio dynamics.

### Open Question 2
Can the procedural mapping between audio transformations and text prompt modifiers be automated to eliminate manual descriptions? The current approach requires manually providing transformation descriptions, creating a bottleneck for scalability.

### Open Question 3
How does strict reliance on class-level captions constrain the model's ability to process unlabeled or ambiguous "in-the-wild" audio? The framework depends on discrete class labels to generate textual bridge prompts, making it unclear how it would handle sounds that don't fit predefined classes.

### Open Question 4
Why does T5-only alignment significantly outperform CLIP-only alignment, and does this imply language structure is more critical than direct visual grounding? The large performance gap suggests text encoder provides primary semantic signal, casting doubt on CLIP's relative contribution when used in isolation.

## Limitations
- Missing critical implementation details for MLP adapters and attention pooling configurations
- Unknown training hyperparameters including batch size, epochs, and scheduling strategy
- Heavy dependency on GPT-4o for caption generation without access to system prompts
- Limited evaluation on diverse real-world audio without class labels

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core conceptual framework of dual alignment is theoretically sound with clear performance advantages
- **Medium Confidence**: Procedural controllability claims show promising examples but mapping mechanism lacks detailed validation
- **Low Confidence**: Exact reproducibility is impossible due to missing architectural parameters and training configurations

## Next Checks

1. **Attention Pooling Ablation Verification**: Replicate ablation replacing attention pooling with mean pooling on VEGAS-5 dataset, expect approximately 40-point AIC drop (from ~94 to ~54)
2. **Cross-Modal Alignment Validation**: Compute cosine similarity between adapted audio embeddings and frozen text embeddings for 100 random audio-text pairs from 50-class VGGSound subset, expect mean similarity > 0.7
3. **Controllability Robustness Test**: Apply systematic volume scaling (0.5×, 1.0×, 2.0×) to 50 diverse audio samples, quantify correlation between input volume ratios and generated object size changes, expect strong positive correlation (r > 0.7)
