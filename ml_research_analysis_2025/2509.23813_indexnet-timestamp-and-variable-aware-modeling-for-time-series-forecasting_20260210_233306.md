# IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: IndexNet achieves competitive performance vs strong baselines on 12 datasets by explicitly modeling timestamp and variable index information in MLP backbone.

## Executive Summary
IndexNet introduces an MLP-based architecture for multivariate time series forecasting that explicitly incorporates timestamp and variable index information. The model uses two learnable embedding modules—Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE)—that inject periodic temporal patterns and variable-specific identity vectors into the input sequence. Zero-initialized embeddings are concatenated with projected inputs, allowing the model to capture both temporal periodicity and variable-specific dynamics while maintaining interpretability. Evaluated across 12 diverse datasets, IndexNet demonstrates competitive performance against strong baselines, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the index-aware design.

## Method Summary
IndexNet is a multivariate time series forecasting method that incorporates index-related information—timestamps and variable indices—into an MLP-based architecture. It features two embedding modules: Timestamp Embedding (TE), which injects periodic temporal patterns into sequences, and Channel Embedding (CE), which assigns each variable a unique trainable identity vector. This design allows the model to explicitly capture temporal periodicity and variable-specific dynamics, improving reliability and interpretability. Evaluated on 12 diverse datasets, IndexNet achieves competitive performance compared to strong baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality. Ablation studies and visualizations further highlight the interpretability and advantages of the index-aware design.

## Key Results
- IndexNet achieves competitive performance on 12 datasets compared to strong baselines
- Zero-initialized embeddings outperform random initialization in ablation studies
- Concatenation of embeddings is critical—alternative strategies degrade performance
- Model demonstrates interpretability through visualization of learned temporal patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly encoding timestamp and variable index information through learnable embeddings that are concatenated with the input sequence. Timestamp Embedding captures periodic temporal patterns (hour/day/week/month) while Channel Embedding provides each variable with a unique identity vector. The zero-initialization strategy ensures embeddings learn task-relevant patterns rather than relying on random initialization. By concatenating these embeddings with projected inputs, the model maintains the original temporal and variable structure while allowing the MLP backbone to learn complex interactions between these index-aware features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multivariate time series forecasting**: Predicting future values of multiple variables given historical data
  - Why needed: Core task that requires modeling complex temporal and inter-variable dependencies
  - Quick check: Verify input/output shapes match N×L historical and N×T prediction dimensions

- **Timestamp embedding for periodicity**: Learning periodic temporal patterns through embeddings at multiple granularities
  - Why needed: Time series often exhibit daily, weekly, and monthly patterns that must be captured
  - Quick check: Confirm TE retrieves and aggregates embeddings for hour, day, week, month

- **Variable identity encoding**: Assigning unique identity vectors to each variable/channel
  - Why needed: Variables may have distinct behaviors and relationships that require explicit modeling
  - Quick check: Verify CE produces N×C_dim identity matrix with zero initialization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input → TE(ZeroInit) + CE(ZeroInit) + Concat → Residual MLP → Output

**Critical path**: Historical sequence → Timestamp preprocessing → TE/CE embedding retrieval → Concatenation → Residual MLP encoding → Linear projection to horizon T

**Design tradeoffs**: Zero initialization vs random initialization for embeddings; concatenation vs addition/projection strategies; MLP vs more complex backbones

**Failure signatures**: 
- Random initialization degrades performance (vs zero init)
- Improper timestamp injection (addition/projection) causes MSE increase
- Missing timestamp preprocessing leads to incorrect embedding retrieval

**First experiments**:
1. Implement TE with zero-initialized embeddings and verify concatenation with projected input
2. Add CE with zero-initialized identity matrix and measure impact on Electricity dataset
3. Train complete model on Traffic dataset with L=96, T=96 using Adam optimizer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can index-related priors be effectively integrated into sophisticated deep learning architectures without causing overfitting or disrupting their intrinsic structural mechanisms?
- Can universal, architecture-agnostic embedding schemes be developed to flexibly adapt to diverse forecasting scenarios beyond the specific backbone used here?
- Why does the Channel Embedding (CE) module introduce redundancy and degrade performance when applied to iTransformer on the Traffic dataset?

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, weight decay, learning rate schedule) are unspecified
- Performance claims rely on comparison to unspecified "strong baselines"
- Method faces challenges when extending to more complex, intricate model architectures
- Results depend on dataset-specific configurations not fully detailed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core architectural design and intended purpose are clearly described and supported by ablation results
- **Medium confidence**: Reported performance improvements are plausible but depend on unspecified training configurations
- **Low confidence**: Generality across 12 datasets cannot be independently verified without exact train/val/test splits

## Next Checks
1. Verify TE/CE embeddings are initialized to zero and concatenated (not added or projected) as described, then measure MSE on Electricity and ETT datasets to confirm Table 10 results
2. Test the model with and without zero-initialization on TE/CE to quantify the performance impact claimed in the ablation study
3. Implement the exact timestamp preprocessing (HourOfDay, DayOfWeek, sequential indices for missing timestamps) and confirm that the temporal signal is correctly encoded into the embeddings
