# Failure Prediction in Conversational Recommendation Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17976
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17976

- One-line primary result: Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction method detects failures in CRS with up to 93% accuracy for system failures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for predicting failures in conversational recommendation systems by analyzing multi-turn semantic information from retrieved image embeddings. The method, termed Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, uses autoencoder-based predictors and coherence-based predictors adapted from query performance prediction to classify conversations as successful or failed. Two types of failures are considered: system failures (target exists but not retrieved) and catalogue failures (target missing from catalogue). Experiments on Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets demonstrate that multi-turn prediction consistently outperforms single-turn approaches, with autoencoder-based predictors achieving up to 93% accuracy for system failures.

## Method Summary
The approach extracts top-100 retrieved image embeddings at each conversation turn from a conversational recommendation system, then computes either autoencoder reconstruction loss or coherence-based query performance prediction metrics as features. These features are concatenated across turns 1 to k-1 to predict whether the target item will be found at turn k. The autoencoder learns compressed representations of retrieved items, while coherence metrics capture pairwise semantic relations among retrieved items. L1 regularization is used to identify important turns, and classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or L1-regularized) make the final binary prediction. The method is evaluated on Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets with a 70/30 train/test split.

## Key Results
- Autoencoder-based predictor achieves up to 93% accuracy for system failures (target exists but not retrieved)
- Multi-turn prediction consistently outperforms single-turn approaches across all scenarios
- Performance drops significantly for catalogue failures, with accuracies around 51-72%
- L1-regularized coherence predictors perform best for missing target scenarios on Shoes dataset (up to 78%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Autoencoder-Based Semantic Compression for Failure Detection
The autoencoder learns a low-dimensional manifold of top-100 retrieved items across conversation turns. Reconstruction error captures deviation from the learned "core" semantic space, while cross-entropy loss trains a classifier on the compressed representation. The total loss L_total = L_rec + L_cls jointly optimizes for reconstruction fidelity and classification accuracy. The compressed representation captures essential semantic dimensions that distinguish successful vs. failed trajectories.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Turn Feature Aggregation with Importance Weighting
Features from turns 1 through k-1 are concatenated and aggregated. An L1 regularization term (shrinkage factor λ) zeroes out unimportant turn dimensions, so only turns that meaningfully guide toward the target contribute to the final prediction. This approach captures the cumulative evidence of retrieval trajectory while filtering out noisy early turns.

### Mechanism 3: Coherence-Based QPP Adaptation for Dense Image Retrieval
Query Performance Prediction metrics (autocorrelation, WAND, Reciprocal Volume, A-pairRatio) are adapted from text IR to measure pairwise semantic coherence among retrieved image embeddings. These metrics capture whether items cluster tightly (coherent, likely successful) or scatter (incoherent, likely failed). The approach leverages the spatial relations of dense image embeddings to signal CRS failure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Query Performance Prediction (QPP)
  - **Why needed here**: The paper directly imports QPP methodology from IR, adapting it to CRS. Understanding QPP's goal—predicting retrieval effectiveness without relevance judgments—is essential to grasp why coherence metrics are used.
  - **Quick check question**: Given ranked lists [0.92, 0.91, 0.90, 0.89, 0.88] vs. [0.92, 0.45, 0.43, 0.40, 0.38], which would QPP predict as more successful, and why?

- **Concept**: Autoencoders for Representation Learning
  - **Why needed here**: The AE-based predictor is the core contribution. Understanding that AEs learn by minimizing reconstruction error and that the bottleneck layer captures "essential" features is necessary to interpret why this works for failure detection.
  - **Quick check question**: If an autoencoder trained on successful conversations has high reconstruction error on a new conversation's retrieved items, what might that indicate about the conversation's likely outcome?

- **Concept**: Dense Retrieval with Single-Vector Embeddings
  - **Why needed here**: The paper contrasts image retrieval (single vector per item) with text retrieval (token-level representations). Understanding this distinction explains why BERT-based predictors can't be directly applied and why embedding-level methods are necessary.
  - **Quick check question**: Why can't a token-level predictor like BERT-QPP be directly applied to image items, and how does the AE approach circumvent this limitation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Simulator -> EGE CRS Model -> Top-100 Retrieved Items w/ Embeddings -> Feature Extraction Layer -> (AE: Compressed Repro + MSE) or (Coherence Metrics: AC, WAND, RV, A-pairRatio) -> Multi-Turn Aggregator: Concatenate turns 1 to k-1 -> Classifier: RF / LogReg / L1-Regularized -> Binary Output: Found / Not Found at Turn k

**Critical Path:**
1. Train EGE model on Shoes/FashionIQ using Show-Attend-and-Tell user simulator to generate feedback
2.
