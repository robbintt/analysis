# Layer-wise Minimal Pair Probing Reveals Contextual Grammatical-Conceptual Hierarchy in Speech Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.15655
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15655
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** S3Ms encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones, matching ASR performance despite lacking text supervision

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates contextual syntactic and semantic encoding in transformer-based speech language models using minimal pair probing across 71 tasks and four model classes (S3M, ASR, AudioLLM, codec). Results show that all speech models encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones, with S3Ms matching or surpassing ASR encoders despite lacking text supervision. Layer-wise analysis reveals S3Ms peak mid-network then crash in final layers, while ASR and AudioLLM encoders maintain or improve, reflecting pretraining objective differences. Temporal probing shows S3Ms encode grammatical cues 500ms before word onset versus AudioLLMs' more even distribution. Across all models, mean pooling outperforms single-token approaches, and first tokens consistently carry more linguistic information than final tokens despite bidirectional architecture.

## Method Summary
The study employs minimal pair probing across 71 linguistic tasks to systematically evaluate contextual syntactic and semantic encoding in four classes of speech transformer models. Layer-wise analysis tracks information flow through network depth, while temporal probing examines when grammatical and conceptual features are encoded relative to word onset. The methodology compares S3Ms (self-supervised speech models), ASR systems, AudioLLMs, and codec-based models using consistent evaluation protocols across all architectures.

## Key Results
- All speech models encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones
- S3Ms match or surpass ASR encoders despite lacking text supervision
- S3Ms peak mid-network then crash in final layers, while ASR and AudioLLM encoders maintain or improve
- S3Ms encode grammatical cues 500ms before word onset versus AudioLLMs' more even distribution
- Mean pooling outperforms single-token approaches across all models
- First tokens consistently carry more linguistic information than final tokens in bidirectional architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The differential encoding of grammatical versus conceptual features across speech models reflects the distinct pretraining objectives and architectural constraints of each model class. S3Ms, trained without text supervision, develop robust grammatical representations through acoustic-phonetic patterns and prosodic cues that reliably signal syntactic structure. The mid-network peak followed by final-layer degradation in S3Ms suggests that self-supervised objectives prioritize intermediate representations for acoustic discrimination rather than preserving high-level linguistic abstractions. ASR models maintain grammatical encoding through their supervised training, which explicitly maps acoustic input to structured linguistic output. The temporal advantage of S3Ms in encoding grammatical cues before word onset indicates that acoustic-prosodic information provides reliable syntactic signals that precede lexical access, while AudioLLMs' more distributed temporal encoding reflects their focus on broader semantic representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Minimal pair probing**: Binary discrimination tasks that test whether models can distinguish between minimal linguistic differences, essential for isolating specific linguistic features from confounding factors
- **Layer-wise analysis**: Tracking information encoding across network depth to understand how representations evolve and where linguistic information is most robustly captured
- **Temporal probing**: Examining when linguistic features are encoded relative to speech events to understand the temporal dynamics of speech processing
- **Self-supervised speech learning**: Training speech models without text supervision to develop representations based solely on acoustic patterns
- **Cross-modal alignment**: Mapping acoustic representations to linguistic structures, critical for understanding how speech models bridge the acoustic-linguistic gap
- **Pooling strategies**: Methods for aggregating token-level representations into utterance-level features, fundamental for evaluating how models compress information

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Raw audio -> Feature extractor -> Transformer layers -> Pooling layer -> Minimal pair classifier
**Critical path:** Input speech frames → Convolutional or transformer-based feature extraction → Multi-head self-attention across layers → Layer-specific representation → Pooling aggregation → Binary classification
**Design tradeoffs:** Self-supervised pretraining trades explicit linguistic supervision for broader acoustic coverage, while supervised ASR models gain precise linguistic alignment at the cost of domain specificity. Layer-wise degradation in S3Ms reflects the tension between acoustic discrimination and linguistic abstraction.
**Failure signatures:** Final-layer crashes in S3Ms indicate loss of high-level linguistic information, while temporal probing reveals whether models capture predictive acoustic cues or rely on post-hoc lexical information.
**First experiments:** 1) Compare minimal pair accuracy across layer depths to identify encoding peaks, 2) Measure temporal offsets between grammatical and conceptual encoding relative to word boundaries, 3) Evaluate pooling strategy impact on linguistic feature preservation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Minimal pair probing may oversimplify complex linguistic phenomena by focusing on binary discrimination tasks
- Layer-wise analysis findings are based on specific architectures tested and may not generalize across all transformer variants
- Temporal probing results may be sensitive to alignment methods and temporal resolution choices

## Confidence
- S3Ms encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones: **High confidence**
- S3Ms peak mid-network then crash in final layers: **Medium confidence**
- S3Ms encode grammatical cues 500ms before word onset: **Medium confidence**
- Mean pooling outperforms single-token approaches: **High confidence**
- First tokens carry more linguistic information than final tokens: **High confidence**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying pretraining dataset composition and fine-tuning procedures to isolate the impact of training objectives on grammatical versus conceptual encoding patterns
2. Implement alternative temporal probing methods with finer temporal resolution to verify the 500ms pre-onset grammatical encoding finding and explore its robustness across different speech corpora
3. Design minimal pair tasks that test nested linguistic phenomena to determine whether the observed grammatical-conceptual hierarchy persists for more complex linguistic distinctions beyond current binary discrimination tasks
