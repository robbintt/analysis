# Explicit vs. Implicit Biographies: Evaluating and Adapting LLM Information Extraction on Wikidata-Derived Texts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14943
- Reference count: 7
- LLMs achieve 93.3-93.0% accuracy on implicit reasoning after fine-tuning, compared to 71.6-58.1% for models trained only on explicit data

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how textual implicitness affects large language models' (LLMs) performance in information extraction (IE) tasks. The researchers created synthetic datasets containing 10,000 implicit and explicit biographical descriptions derived from Wikidata. They found that LLMs struggle significantly more with extracting information from implicit texts compared to explicit ones, with a 14.6% failure rate (NaN outputs) for implicit versus 1.3% for explicit descriptions. To address this, they applied LoRA fine-tuning to three models (LLaMA 3.2-1B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Phi-1.5), demonstrating that models trained on both explicit and implicit data achieved accuracy rates of 93.3-93.0% on implicit reasoning tasks, compared to 71.6-58.1% for models trained only on explicit data. The results show that exposure to implicit patterns during fine-tuning significantly improves LLMs' ability to handle implicit information extraction, suggesting that current difficulties are primarily due to insufficient training data rather than architectural limitations.

## Method Summary
The researchers created synthetic datasets of 10,000 explicit and implicit biographical descriptions derived from Wikidata triples. They used a carefully designed prompt to generate implicit versions of biographies where explicit facts were converted into inferential statements. Three models (LLaMA 3.2-1B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Phi-1.5) were fine-tuned using LoRA with different training strategies: one group trained only on explicit data, another on implicit data, and a third on a balanced mix of both. Performance was evaluated using standard accuracy metrics and failure rate analysis (NaN outputs).

## Key Results
- LLMs show 14.6% failure rate (NaN outputs) on implicit information extraction versus 1.3% for explicit descriptions
- Models fine-tuned on combined explicit and implicit data achieved 93.3-93.0% accuracy on implicit reasoning tasks
- Models trained only on explicit data achieved 71.6-58.1% accuracy on the same implicit reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improvement in implicit reasoning performance occurs because fine-tuning on combined explicit and implicit data exposes models to the inferential patterns necessary for understanding implicit information. When models are trained only on explicit statements, they lack the contextual reasoning skills needed to extract information from texts that require inference. The LoRA fine-tuning approach allows models to adapt their weights efficiently to handle these implicit patterns without requiring full fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Implicit vs Explicit Information** - Why needed: Understanding the distinction between directly stated facts and information requiring inference. Quick check: Can identify whether a statement explicitly states or implies a fact.
2. **Information Extraction from Text** - Why needed: Core task of identifying and extracting specific facts from biographical descriptions. Quick check: Can extract named entities and relationships from structured text.
3. **LoRA Fine-tuning** - Why needed: Efficient method for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks without full fine-tuning. Quick check: Can implement LoRA adapters and understand how they modify model behavior.
4. **Synthetic Dataset Generation** - Why needed: Creating controlled experimental conditions with balanced explicit and implicit data. Quick check: Can design prompts that transform explicit statements into implicit ones.
5. **Performance Metrics for IE** - Why needed: Measuring accuracy and failure rates in information extraction tasks. Quick check: Can calculate precision, recall, and accuracy for extraction tasks.
6. **Biographical Knowledge Graphs** - Why needed: Understanding the source data structure (Wikidata) and how to convert triples into natural language. Quick check: Can map Wikidata triples to natural language descriptions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Wikidata triples -> Prompt generation -> Synthetic text creation -> LoRA fine-tuning -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:** Data generation → Model fine-tuning → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Synthetic data provides controlled conditions but may lack real-world complexity; LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning but may limit adaptation compared to full fine-tuning

**Failure Signatures:** High NaN output rates (14.6% vs 1.3%) indicate models struggle with implicit reasoning; significant accuracy gaps between explicit-only and mixed training approaches

**First Experiments:**
1. Test synthetic data generation pipeline with different prompt variations to optimize implicit text creation
2. Implement baseline evaluation comparing zero-shot performance across all three models
3. Conduct ablation study varying the ratio of explicit to implicit data in fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results rely on synthetic datasets rather than naturally occurring implicit texts
- Performance metrics lack confidence intervals and stability analysis across different data splits
- Study focuses exclusively on biographical texts, limiting generalizability to other domains

## Confidence

**High confidence:** LLMs exhibit significantly higher failure rates on implicit versus explicit information extraction tasks (14.6% vs 1.3% NaN outputs)

**Medium confidence:** LoRA fine-tuning on combined explicit and implicit data substantially improves performance on implicit reasoning tasks

**Medium confidence:** The primary barrier to implicit reasoning is training data insufficiency rather than architectural limitations

## Next Checks

1. Test the fine-tuned models on naturally occurring implicit texts from diverse domains beyond biographies to assess external validity
2. Conduct ablation studies with varying proportions of implicit data in fine-tuning to identify the optimal training mixture
3. Evaluate model performance across different inference strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting) to determine if architectural modifications could further improve implicit reasoning without additional fine-tuning
