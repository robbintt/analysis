# Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12980
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12980
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of vector similarity search methods in realistic application contexts.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between synthetic performance metrics and real-world task success in vector similarity search by introducing the Iceberg benchmark. The study reveals that traditional VSS evaluation methods focusing on recall and latency often fail to predict actual task performance due to three key sources of degradation: embedding loss, metric misuse, and data distribution sensitivity. Through comprehensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art methods across eight diverse datasets, the research demonstrates substantial deviations from conventional rankings and provides practitioners with an interpretable decision tree for method selection based on task-specific characteristics.

## Method Summary
The Iceberg benchmark suite provides end-to-end evaluation of vector similarity search methods by incorporating realistic application contexts. It evaluates methods across eight diverse datasets spanning image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems with vector counts ranging from 1M to 100M. The benchmark assesses 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and introduces the Information Loss Funnel framework to identify three sources of performance degradation: embedding loss during feature extraction, metric misuse where distances poorly reflect task relevance, and data distribution sensitivity affecting index robustness. Results are analyzed using interpretable task-centric meta-features to provide actionable guidance for practitioners.

## Key Results
- Iceberg reveals substantial deviations from traditional VSS rankings based solely on recall-latency metrics
- High synthetic recall does not guarantee strong task-level performance in real-world applications
- The Information Loss Funnel framework identifies three critical sources of end-to-end performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically identifying and quantifying information loss at multiple stages of the VSS pipeline. First, embedding loss captures the quality degradation during feature extraction from raw data. Second, metric misuse addresses the fundamental mismatch between distance metrics and task-specific relevance. Third, data distribution sensitivity reveals how index robustness varies across different data characteristics. By evaluating methods end-to-end rather than in isolation, Iceberg exposes hidden pitfalls that traditional benchmarks miss, providing more realistic performance assessments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Loss Funnel**: Framework identifying three degradation sources in VSS pipelines; needed to understand why high synthetic metrics don't translate to real task performance; quick check: trace information loss from raw data to final retrieval results
- **Task-Centric Meta-Features**: Dataset characteristics that influence VSS method performance; needed to move beyond one-size-fits-all benchmarking; quick check: identify which meta-features are most predictive for a given application
- **End-to-End Evaluation**: Assessment approach that includes embedding generation and task-specific relevance; needed to capture real-world performance; quick check: compare isolated vs. integrated method performance

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Raw Data -> Embedding Generation -> Vector Indexing -> Similarity Search -> Task Relevance Assessment
**Critical path**: The embedding generation and task relevance assessment stages are most critical for identifying information loss and ensuring real-world applicability
**Design tradeoffs**: Balancing computational efficiency against end-to-end task performance, with traditional benchmarks favoring speed over practical utility
**Failure signatures**: High recall with poor task performance indicates metric misuse or embedding loss; stable synthetic metrics but variable task results suggest data distribution sensitivity
**3 first experiments**: 1) Compare traditional vs. end-to-end evaluation for a single method on one dataset, 2) Identify which Information Loss Funnel stage dominates degradation for specific applications, 3) Test decision tree recommendations against actual task performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Focus on static datasets and fixed embedding models may not capture dynamic real-world VSS deployments
- Assumes pre-computed embeddings, potentially overlooking on-the-fly embedding generation costs
- Coverage limited to eight datasets, which may not represent all VSS application domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in the Information Loss Funnel framework and its three identified degradation sources
- Medium confidence in relative method rankings and selection guidelines due to dataset dependency
- Medium confidence in practical utility of decision tree pending validation across additional domains

## Next Checks
1. Validate Information Loss Funnel framework on streaming data with evolving distributions and dynamic embedding models
2. Extend evaluation to include real-time embedding generation costs and their impact on end-to-end task performance
3. Test decision tree recommendations on specialized domains such as scientific literature retrieval and multimodal data scenarios
