# Group Equivariance Meets Mechanistic Interpretability: Equivariant Sparse Autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09432
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09432
- Authors: Ege Erdogan; Ana Lucic
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: A single matrix can explain over 98% of activation variance under 90° rotations, and equivariant SAEs outperform regular SAEs in invariant probing tasks.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of incorporating group symmetries into sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for mechanistic interpretability. The key insight is that optimal sparse solutions for equivariant features require an impractical O(|G|) latents per feature for large groups. To solve this, the authors propose an adaptive approach that first learns an invariant autoencoder, then optimizes a transformation matrix M to map canonical reconstructions back to their original forms. This allows the SAE to adapt to the base model's specific level of equivariance without enforcing exact symmetries upfront.

## Method Summary
The method involves two key steps: (1) train an invariant SAE that maps all rotated versions of an input to the same canonical latent representation, and (2) optimize a transformation matrix M to predict the actual activations of rotated inputs from the canonical reconstruction. The invariant encoder is implemented as a 2-layer MLP (256->512->latent) while the decoder is linear. M is initialized as the identity matrix to allow adaptation to the base model's equivariance level. The approach avoids the O(|G|) latents requirement by capturing group transformations in a single matrix rather than creating separate features for each transformation.

## Key Results
- M explains over 98% of activation variance between ground truth and predicted activations under 90° rotations
- Equivariant SAEs outperform regular SAEs in binary probing tasks for invariant features (S tasks) while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality
- The adaptive approach successfully handles the unknown degree of equivariance in base model activations without requiring exact symmetry enforcement upfront

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The base model's activation space transforms approximately linearly under group actions, allowing a single matrix M to capture this transformation. The authors optimize M to minimize error between transformed canonical activation and actual activation of transformed input (M^p ψ(x) ≈ ψ(g^p x)). This works because neural network activations often exhibit approximate linear structure under symmetries, even though the network itself is non-linear.

### Mechanism 2
Forcing the SAE encoder to be group-invariant improves semantic quality of latents by isolating "what" exists from "how" it is oriented. By mapping all transformed versions of an input to a single canonical latent point, the SAE avoids wasting capacity on mere orientations and concentrates on shape identity. This prevents polysemantic latents that mix shape and orientation information.

### Mechanism 3
Initializing M as identity allows the SAE to adapt to the specific level of equivariance learned by the base model. This adaptive approach prevents forcing a symmetry the model hasn't actually learned - if the base model is truly invariant, M stays near identity; if equivariant, M diverges to represent the transformation. This is crucial since the degree of equivariance is often unknown a priori.

## Foundational Learning

- **Group Theory (Orbits & Stabilizers)**: Needed to understand that the invariant encoder collapses an entire orbit (set of all rotated versions) into one point. Quick check: If an image x is rotated by 90° (gx) and 180° (g²x), does the invariant SAE output different latents for these two inputs?

- **Linear Algebra (Change of Basis)**: Required to understand M as a linear map acting on activation space, where M^p represents applying the transformation p times. Quick check: If M represents a 90° rotation in activation space, what does M⁴ theoretically equal?

- **Mechanistic Interpretability (Superposition)**: Important for understanding how SAEs unpack superposed features and avoid "polysemantic" latents that mix shape and orientation. Quick check: Why would a standard SAE struggle with a rotated image, potentially creating one feature for "circle" and another for "rotated circle"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base Model (ψ) → Invariant Encoder (E) → Decoder (D) → Transformation Matrix (M)
- **Critical path**: Collect activations → Train invariant SAE → Train matrix M (can run in parallel)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Encoder depth (linear vs 2-layer MLP), reconstruction vs utility trade-off, latent efficiency (avoids O(|G|) scaling but introduces d² parameters)
- **Failure signatures**: High L_inv (encoder cannot map transformed inputs), low R² for M (base model not equivariant or linearity assumption false), probing drop (invariant latents fail on orientation tasks)
- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Verify linearity by training M on fixed base model, (2) Ablate encoder depth comparing linear vs 2-layer MLP, (3) Probing benchmark comparing Equivariant SAE vs "Wide" SAE on S, SP, SO task sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can M be learned as effectively in larger models such as frontier foundation models? This remains unresolved as experiments were restricted to small autoencoders with 256-dimensional activations on synthetic datasets.

- **Open Question 2**: Does enforcing group structure constraints (e.g., M^|G| = I) improve the optimization of M? The current method optimizes M as a general matrix without strictly enforcing group axioms or cyclic constraints.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the reconstruction performance of equivariant SAEs be improved to match that of regular SAEs? Results currently show equivariant SAEs "lag behind in the reconstruction/sparsity frontier" compared to regular baselines.

## Limitations
- The assumption of approximate linear transformation under group actions may not generalize to non-cyclic groups or highly non-linear equivariance patterns
- The approach requires collecting activations for all group-transformed versions, becoming computationally expensive for larger groups or continuous symmetries
- A single transformation matrix M may be insufficient for base models with heterogeneous equivariance across different feature subspaces or layers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of learning invariant SAE followed by transformation matrix M is well-supported by experimental results showing >98% R² and superior probing performance
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about generalization beyond 90° rotations and simple synthetic datasets require further validation
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability to larger groups and performance on real-world scientific ML models rather than synthetic data remains to be established

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to a different group structure (e.g., reflections or 45° rotations) and verify if M maintains high R² and probing performance
2. Test the approach on a scientific ML model (e.g., protein structure prediction or climate modeling) to assess practical utility beyond synthetic datasets
3. Systematically vary the initialization of M and encoder depth to quantify their impact on final performance and identify failure modes
