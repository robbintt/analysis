core_contribution: This paper introduces an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm
  for infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages
  partial information orders over policies. The key insight is that for certain MDPs,

# Reinforcement Learning in MDPs with Information-Ordered Policies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03904
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03904
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves regret bound of Õ(√(w log|Θ|T)) for infinite-horizon average-cost MDPs with information-ordered policies, independent of state/action space sizes.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages partial information orders over policies to enable counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction. The key insight is that for certain MDPs, data collected under one policy can be used to estimate the performance of others, allowing the algorithm to achieve regret bounds that scale with the width of the partial order rather than the size of the policy space. The framework is applied to three operations research problems, demonstrating new algorithms and regret guarantees that interpolate between bandit and full-feedback regimes.

## Method Summary
The algorithm operates in epochs, discretizing the continuous policy space and computing a set of maximal policies that form a minimum covering set under the partial order. In each epoch, these maximal policies are executed to generate trajectories, from which counterfactual estimates for all subordinate policies are computed using domain-specific inference mechanisms. The algorithm then prunes the policy space based on confidence intervals and repeats. The key innovation is the use of partial orders (either sample-path or distributional) to enable efficient exploration without requiring full environment interaction for every policy.

## Key Results
- Achieves Õ(√(w log|Θ|T)) regret bound where w is width of partial order
- First Õ(√T) regret result for lost-sales dual sourcing with dual index policies
- Demonstrates scalability independent of state and action space sizes
- Numerical simulations show consistent performance matching or exceeding specialized baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Higher base-stock policies in inventory control reveal more demand information, allowing lower policies to be simulated.
- **Mechanism:** Policy π^θ' ⪯ π^θ if trajectory under π^θ contains sufficient information to compute empirical average cost of π^θ'. In inventory control, higher base-stock levels always have at least as much inventory, revealing more sales data.
- **Core assumption:** Exogenous variables (demand) are independent of agent's actions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "data collected under π^θ can be used to estimate performance of π^θ'..." [section 4.1] "observed sales N(q) = min{q, D} deterministically imply N(q') for any q' ≤ q."
- **Break condition:** If system dynamics lack monotonicity, partial order fails, width w = |Θ|.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Regret bounds scale with width w of partial order rather than policy space size |Θ|.
- **Mechanism:** Algorithm explores only w maximal policies, gathering data sufficient to infer performance of entire policy space.
- **Core assumption:** Width w is small relative to |Θ|.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...regret bound of Õ(√(w log(|Θ|)T))..." [section 2.1.3] "Note that w=1 implies existence of policy capable of counterfactual estimation for every policy in Θ."
- **Break condition:** If order has high width, algorithm must play almost every policy, reverting to standard RL complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Distributional Policy Order enables approximate counterfactual estimation when exact inference is impossible.
- **Mechanism:** Uses collected trajectory to estimate distribution of costs for another policy, relying on system revisiting high-information states frequently.
- **Core assumption:** MDP is ergodic enough to ensure critical states are hit frequently.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.1.2] "π^θ' ⪯ π^θ if distribution lies within small total variation distance of empirical average cost under π^θ'." [section 4.2] Lemma 2 establishes this order using hitting times.
- **Break condition:** If system mixes slowly or avoids critical states, horizon threshold T_h(δ) becomes impractically large.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Partially Ordered Sets (Posets) and Width
  - **Why needed here:** Theoretical guarantee depends on "width" of policy order. Understanding Dilworth's theorem helps in designing low-width parameterizations.
  - **Quick check question:** Given policies ordered by parameter θ, can you identify chain where θ₁ ≤ θ₂ implies complete information inheritance?

- **Concept:** Average-Cost MDPs (Gain and Bias)
  - **Why needed here:** Concentration bounds rely on boundedness of bias span H. Understanding gain as steady-state average and bias as transient deviations is crucial.
  - **Quick check question:** Does your problem have uniform gain function g^θ(s) independent of starting state s?

- **Concept:** Exogenous vs. Endogenous MDPs
  - **Why needed here:** Counterfactual inference relies on "exogenous" variables being independent of agent's actions. Recognizing this structure is critical for defining information order.
  - **Quick check question:** Is random variable you need to estimate (e.g., demand) affected by policy you choose, or fixed by environment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Discretizer -> Order Resolver -> Sampler -> Counterfactual Engine -> Eliminator
- **Critical path:** Order Resolver and Counterfactual Engine. Without defining π^θ' ⪯ π^θ, algorithm defaults to inefficient bandit approach.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Sample-Path vs Distributional Order: Sample-Path simpler but restrictive; Distributional flexible but introduces α-factor and T_h(δ) threshold
  - Discretization r: Finer grid increases |Θ₁| raising logarithmic term but improves policy optimality
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Exploding Regret: If regret scales with |Θ| or |S|, partial order is trivial or bias span H is unbounded
  - Stagnation: If confidence set Θ_k never shrinks, counterfactual estimates too noisy or confidence radius miscalibrated
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement single-retailer inventory control (Section 4.1) - simplest width-1 case
  2. Test dual-sourcing with censoring to validate Distributional Policy Order
  3. Scale queuing model action space to verify IOPEA regret remains constant while standard algorithms degrade

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Partial orders must be constructed specifically for each problem domain
- Performance heavily depends on accurate width parameter w estimation
- Requires restartable policies and computational overhead for finding maximal policy sets
- Applicability may be limited to operations research settings with natural information structures

## Confidence
- **Regret bounds:** High - rigorous theoretical framework with supporting proofs
- **Practical applicability:** Medium - constructing appropriate partial orders for arbitrary MDPs remains challenging
- **Scalability claims:** High - theoretical guarantees are independent of state/action space sizes

## Next Checks
1. Apply IOPEA to a non-operations research domain (e.g., gridworld navigation) to verify information orders exist outside presented settings.

2. Systematically vary width parameter w in synthetic MDPs to empirically validate √w scaling and identify practical thresholds.

3. Implement both ordering mechanisms on dual-sourcing problem to quantify trade-off between approximation quality and computational efficiency.
