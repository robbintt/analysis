# The PROPER Approach to Proactivity: Benchmarking and Advancing Knowledge Gap Navigation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.09926
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09926
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: Outperforms strong baselines in proactive assistance with up to 84% win rate in single-turn evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PROPER, a framework for proactive assistance that treats knowledge gaps as a calibration problem over explicit user needs and latent task-relevant dimensions. The method uses a two-agent architecture where a Dimension Generating Agent identifies missing but important aspects from fine-tuned supervision, and a Response Generating Agent selectively updates baseline responses while preserving intent. A post-hoc reranker filters and prioritizes dimensions based on quality, alignment with unmet needs, and diversity. Across medical, recommendation, and coding domains, PROPER demonstrates consistent improvements over strong base models and Chain-of-Thought baselines.

## Method Summary
PROPER frames proactive assistance as a calibration problem where the system identifies and addresses knowledge gaps beyond explicit user queries. The framework consists of two agents: a Dimension Generating Agent that infers missing but important aspects from fine-tuned supervision, and a Response Generating Agent that selectively updates baseline responses while preserving user intent and controlling proactivity levels. A post-hoc reranker filters and prioritizes generated dimensions based on quality, alignment with unmet needs, and diversity. The approach explicitly models latent task-relevant dimensions before generating proactive updates, enabling more timely and appropriate interventions in domains where hidden risks and constraints matter.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 84% win rate over strong base models in single-turn evaluation
- Demonstrates consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions across three domains
- Ablation shows dimension generation drives most improvement, not just response capacity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly surfacing and ranking missing dimensions before generating proactive updates, treating knowledge gaps as first-class representations. This dimension-first approach enables the system to identify and address latent aspects that users may not explicitly mention but are critical for task completion. By calibrating the balance between preserving user intent and introducing proactive elements, the framework achieves more appropriate interventions than methods that either ignore latent dimensions or overwhelm users with unsolicited information.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Gap Navigation** - Understanding how to identify and traverse gaps between explicit user needs and latent task requirements. Why needed: Forms the conceptual basis for proactive assistance. Quick check: Can the system distinguish between missing information and irrelevant noise?

**Fine-tuned Supervision for Dimension Generation** - Using annotated data to train models that can infer important missing aspects. Why needed: Enables systematic identification of latent dimensions. Quick check: Does supervision generalize across domains or overfit to specific contexts?

**Selective Response Updating** - The ability to modify baseline responses while preserving original intent and controlling proactivity levels. Why needed: Prevents overwhelming users while adding value. Quick check: Can the system maintain response coherence when adding proactive elements?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Dimension Generating Agent -> Dimension Reranker -> Response Generating Agent -> Final Response

**Critical Path**: The core execution flow moves from user input through dimension identification, reranking for quality and diversity, to selective response modification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Dimension generation versus response capacity (ablation shows former is more important), preserving intent versus introducing new information, diversity versus coverage in reranking.

**Failure Signatures**: Over-generation of irrelevant dimensions, loss of user intent during response modification, reranking that prioritizes diversity at the expense of coverage.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test dimension generation quality on held-out medical queries, 2) Evaluate response preservation fidelity when adding proactive elements, 3) Measure reranker effectiveness at balancing diversity and relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is narrow, limited to synthetic or curated test sets in three domains
- No external validity testing in open-ended, noisy real-world contexts
- No human-in-the-loop assessment or user study data provided

## Confidence
- **Core method confidence**: Medium - ablation results are consistent within reported domains but external validity is limited
- **Performance gains confidence**: Low-Medium - strong win-rate metrics but lack significance testing and baseline fairness checks
- **Deployment confidence**: Low - no real-time or user-study data provided

## Next Checks
1. **External domain transfer test**: Evaluate on at least two domains outside the original three (e.g., legal advice, technical support) using held-out data and report win rates
2. **Human-in-the-loop assessment**: Conduct a randomized user study comparing PROPER-generated responses against baseline responses on task completion, perceived helpfulness, and proactivity appropriateness
3. **Robustness under annotation noise**: Retrain the dimension generator on synthetic noisy supervision (e.g., with 20-40% label corruption) and measure performance drop in both dimension quality and downstream response quality
