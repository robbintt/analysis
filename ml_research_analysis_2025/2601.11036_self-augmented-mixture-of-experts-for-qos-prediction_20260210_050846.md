# Self-Augmented Mixture-of-Experts for QoS Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11036
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SA-MoE achieves up to 29.18% improvement in MAE and 38.62% in RMSE for response time prediction compared to MF-MoE on WS-DREAM dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SA-MoE, a self-augmented hybrid framework for QoS prediction under sparse user-service interactions. The core innovation lies in combining matrix factorization with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, enhanced by iterative self-augmentation. The approach uses model predictions to refill unobserved QoS entries and incorporates pseudo-labeled data for additional supervision. Experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset show that SA-MoE consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to 29.18% improvement in MAE and 38.62% in RMSE for response time prediction compared to MF-MoE, and strong gains in throughput prediction. Ablation studies confirm the value of both the refill mechanism and expert collaboration.

## Method Summary
SA-MoE combines matrix factorization with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, enhanced by iterative self-augmentation. The approach uses model predictions to refill unobserved QoS entries and incorporates pseudo-labeled data for additional supervision. Experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset show that SA-MoE consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to 29.18% improvement in MAE and 38.62% in RMSE for response time prediction compared to MF-MoE, and strong gains in throughput prediction.

## Key Results
- SA-MoE achieves up to 29.18% improvement in MAE and 38.62% in RMSE for response time prediction compared to MF-MoE
- Strong performance gains observed in throughput prediction
- Ablation studies confirm the value of both the refill mechanism and expert collaboration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The self-augmentation strategy enables iterative improvement by leveraging the model's own predictions to fill unobserved QoS entries, creating a feedback loop that refines both the matrix factorization and MoE components. This pseudo-labeling approach effectively expands the training set and allows the model to learn from its own high-confidence predictions, addressing the cold-start problem inherent in sparse interaction data. The MoE architecture enables dynamic routing of samples to specialized experts, improving adaptability to diverse QoS patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Matrix Factorization (MF)**: Decomposes user-service interaction matrices into latent factors; needed to capture global patterns in sparse data. Quick check: Verify convergence and latent factor quality on validation set.
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Routes inputs to specialized expert networks; needed for handling diverse QoS patterns. Quick check: Monitor expert utilization rates and routing stability.
- **Self-Augmentation**: Uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to expand training data; needed to address data sparsity. Quick check: Validate pseudo-label quality and monitor error propagation.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Repeated cycles of prediction and retraining; needed to progressively improve model accuracy. Quick check: Track performance improvement per iteration and detect overfitting.
- **Sparse Interaction Handling**: Techniques for learning from incomplete user-service data; needed for realistic QoS prediction. Quick check: Evaluate performance under varying sparsity levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
User-Service Interactions -> Matrix Factorization -> MoE Router -> Expert Networks -> Aggregator -> Predictions
                         -> Self-Augmentation Module (pseudo-labels) -> Refill Mechanism

**Critical Path**
Input QoS data → Matrix factorization → MoE routing → Expert processing → Aggregation → Prediction → Self-augmentation (pseudo-labels) → Refill unobserved entries → Retrain

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Balancing between global (MF) and local (MoE experts) modeling approaches
- Risk of error propagation in self-augmentation vs. benefits of expanded training data
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple expert networks vs. performance gains
- Frequency of self-augmentation iterations vs. model stability

**Failure Signatures**
- Degrading performance over iterations (error propagation)
- Imbalanced expert utilization (routing issues)
- High variance in predictions (overfitting to pseudo-labels)
- Slow convergence or plateauing accuracy

**First Experiments**
1. Validate pseudo-label quality by comparing to ground truth in observed entries
2. Test expert specialization by analyzing routing patterns across different QoS types
3. Benchmark performance under controlled sparsity levels to establish robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope: tested only on WS-DREAM dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Reliance on pseudo-labels: assumes model predictions are reliable enough for supervision
- Limited discussion on computational efficiency and scalability
- Insufficient analysis of expert specialization and collaboration dynamics

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core performance improvements (MAE/RMSE) | High |
| Innovation of self-augmentation strategy | Medium |
| Ablation study results and insights | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SA-MoE on additional QoS datasets (e.g., from other service-oriented or recommendation domains) to assess generalizability and robustness.
2. Conduct a detailed error analysis of pseudo-label quality across different sparsity levels and in early vs. late training iterations to quantify the risk of error propagation.
3. Perform computational scalability and efficiency benchmarks to determine practical deployment limits for large-scale service ecosystems.
