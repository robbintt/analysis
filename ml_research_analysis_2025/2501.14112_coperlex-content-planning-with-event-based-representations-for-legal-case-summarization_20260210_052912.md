# CoPERLex: Content Planning with Event-based Representations for Legal Case Summarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.14112
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14112
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: Event-based content planning improves factual accuracy and coherence in legal case summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoPERLex, a three-stage framework for legal case summarization that explicitly models content selection, planning, and summary generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, CoPERLex first extracts salient content using MemSum, then generates structured event-based plans represented as Subject-Verb-Object tuples, and finally synthesizes coherent summaries. Experiments on four legal datasets show that integrating content selection and event-centric planning improves both factual accuracy and coherence compared to existing methods. Event-based plans outperform entity-centric alternatives by better capturing the narrative structure of legal documents.

## Method Summary
CoPERLex operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) content selection using MemSum to identify salient information from legal documents, (2) event-based planning where structured Subject-Verb-Object tuples are generated to represent key events and relationships, and (3) summary generation using the extracted content and event plan as guidance. The framework explicitly separates content planning from summary generation, allowing for better control over summary content and improved faithfulness to source material. The approach contrasts with end-to-end models by maintaining interpretable intermediate representations that guide the summarization process.

## Key Results
- CoPERLex improves factual accuracy and coherence compared to end-to-end summarization approaches on four legal datasets
- Event-based planning outperforms entity-centric alternatives by better capturing legal document narrative structure
- Each component (content selection, planning, hybrid training) contributes significantly to performance based on ablation studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly modeling the content planning stage, which is often implicit in end-to-end summarization models. By first extracting salient content and then generating structured event representations, the system creates a roadmap for summary generation that maintains fidelity to source material. The event-based representations capture the causal and temporal relationships inherent in legal narratives, which entity-centric approaches may miss. This explicit planning stage allows the model to focus on generating coherent narratives rather than simultaneously handling content selection and generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Event Extraction**: Why needed - Legal cases involve complex sequences of events that must be accurately represented. Quick check - Can extract SVO tuples with reasonable accuracy from legal text.

**Content Selection**: Why needed - Legal documents contain vast amounts of information, requiring intelligent filtering of salient content. Quick check - MemSum effectively identifies key information without losing critical details.

**Plan-based Generation**: Why needed - Structured plans provide guidance for coherent summary synthesis. Quick check - Generated summaries follow logical narrative flow based on event plans.

**Legal Document Structure**: Why needed - Understanding legal document conventions improves content extraction. Quick check - Model handles different legal document types appropriately.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Content Selection (MemSum) -> Event-based Planning (SVO extraction) -> Summary Generation

**Critical Path**: The content selection stage is critical as it determines what information enters the planning phase. Poor content selection propagates errors through planning and generation stages.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Explicit content planning vs. end-to-end approaches trades off simplicity for better control and interpretability. The three-stage pipeline increases complexity but provides more reliable results.

**Failure Signatures**: Content selection failures lead to missing key information; planning failures result in incoherent event sequences; generation failures produce summaries that don't match the plan.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test content selection accuracy on a held-out validation set
2. Evaluate event extraction quality by comparing generated SVO tuples to gold standard events
3. Assess summary coherence by measuring plan adherence in generated summaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Event representation schema is relatively simple (SVO tuples) without capturing complex temporal or causal relationships
- Relies on MemSum for content selection, which may not optimally identify salient information for all legal document types
- Requires pre-defined event schemas and extraction rules, limiting adaptability to different legal systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core contribution of explicit content planning with event-based representations is well-supported by experimental results across four legal datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Superiority of event-based planning over entity-centric alternatives is demonstrated but relies on automated metrics that may not fully capture practical value.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about "better control over summary content" lack systematic evaluation; assertion about enhanced faithfulness to source material needs human expert validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct expert evaluation with legal professionals to assess practical utility, legal accuracy, and coherence of CoPERLex summaries compared to human-written summaries.

2. Expand evaluation to include legal document types beyond the four datasets used, particularly focusing on different legal traditions and document structures.

3. Implement and evaluate more sophisticated event representation schemas that capture temporal sequences, causal relationships, and hierarchical event structures.
