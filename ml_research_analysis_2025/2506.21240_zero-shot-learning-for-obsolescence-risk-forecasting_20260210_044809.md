# Zero-Shot Learning for Obsolescence Risk Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21240
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21240
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** LLMs can predict component obsolescence from tabular data without training on labeled examples

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses component obsolescence forecasting, a challenge that leads to increased costs and disruptions in industries reliant on electronic components. Traditional forecasting methods require extensive labeled data, which is often unavailable or unreliable. To address this, the authors propose a zero-shot learning (ZSL) approach using large language models (LLMs) to predict obsolescence risk from tabular data without requiring prior training on labeled instances. The method serializes tabular features into natural language prompts and uses four recent LLMs (T0, Llama 3.2, Gemma 2, Phi 3.5) to classify components as available or obsolete. Evaluated on two real-world datasets—one for systems and one for electronic components—the approach shows strong performance. Gemma 2 achieved 96.67% accuracy and 0.964 AUC on the electronic component dataset, while T0 achieved 69.14% accuracy and 0.765 F1 score on the systems dataset. The results demonstrate that ZSL with LLMs is a promising solution for data-scarce obsolescence forecasting.

## Method Summary
The authors propose converting tabular component data into natural language prompts that LLMs can process in zero-shot mode. Each row is serialized as "The [column name] is [value]." and wrapped in a prompt asking "Is this component available? Yes or no?" Four LLMs (T0 3B, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-It, Phi-3.5-Mini-Instruct) are evaluated on two datasets: Arrow (11,080 Zener diodes, 68.41% obsolete) and GSM Arena (8,628 smartphones, 55.32% obsolete). The models generate binary predictions without any training on the specific datasets.

## Key Results
- Gemma 2 achieved 96.67% accuracy and 0.964 AUC on the Arrow electronic component dataset
- T0 achieved 69.14% accuracy and 0.765 F1 score on the GSM Arena systems dataset
- Phi 3.5 failed to follow instructions and generated no valid predictions for 100% of GSM Arena instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Converting structured tabular data into natural language strings allows LLMs to process domain-specific features for classification tasks they were not explicitly trained on.
- **Mechanism:** The "Text Template" serialization transforms feature-value pairs into narrative format, bridging the gap between structured data and LLM's natural language pre-training.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic relationships between technical attributes learned during pre-training transfer effectively to component lifecycle status classification.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] describes the serialization method; [abstract] notes addressing data limitations; [corpus] neighbor paper supports structured data alignment.
- **Break condition:** Mechanism fails if serialization destroys critical structural relationships that LLMs cannot reconstruct.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Zero-shot classification relies on the model's ability to map technical attributes to "available" or "obsolete" concepts using internalized knowledge about technology lifecycles.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM acts as a knowledge base, inferring obsolescence probability based on temporal and technical patterns from pre-training data.
- **Core assumption:** LLM's pre-training contains sufficient information about technology lifecycles to distinguish current from outdated parts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] states zero-shot prediction without training; [section 3.2] mentions instruction-following capability; [corpus] supports zero-shot transfer mechanism.
- **Break condition:** Mechanism degrades if specific technical domain is underrepresented in pre-training data.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Successful forecasting depends heavily on the model's capacity for instruction-following to constrain outputs to valid binary classification.
- **Mechanism:** Prompt engineering forces the model to generate specific class labels ("Yes" or "No") rather than open-ended responses.
- **Core assumption:** Models can consistently adhere to output format requested in prompt without fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4] notes Phi 3.5 failed to follow instructions while T0, Llama 3.2, and Gemma 2 succeeded; [section 3.1] details prompt structure.
- **Break condition:** Mechanism fails if model prioritizes completion style over instruction compliance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core capability allowing prediction for components with no historical failure data, distinguishing from traditional supervised learning.
  - **Quick check question:** Can the model classify a component type it has never seen in a training dataset?

- **Concept: Tabular Data Serialization**
  - **Why needed here:** LLMs process text, not database rows. Understanding how to flatten tables into strings without losing semantic meaning is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** How do you convert a row `[Part: Diode, Year: 1999]` into a format a text model understands?

- **Concept: Instruction Tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** Explains performance gap between Gemma 2 (Instruction Tuned) and Phi 3.5 regarding adherence to prompts.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a smaller model (Gemma 2B) outperform or function better than a larger, non-instruction-tuned model in a classification task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw CSV/Tabular data -> Preprocessor (serialization) -> Prompt constructor -> LLMs (inference) -> Evaluator (metrics)
- **Critical path:** Serialization format -> Prompt specificity -> Model selection
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Gemma 2 vs. T0: One model does not fit all domains (96.67% accuracy on Arrow vs. 69.14% on GSM Arena)
  - Phi 3.5 Rejection: Tradeoff between model intelligence and model compliance
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Missing Predictions: Phi 3.5 failed to generate predictions for 276/11,080 rows and 100% of GSM Arena rows
  - Format mismatch: Generating descriptions instead of "Yes/No" breaks automated evaluation
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Take 5 Arrow dataset rows, serialize manually, prompt Gemma 2 to verify "Yes/No" constraint understanding
  2. Prompt Sensitivity: Test if changing "Is this diode available?" to "Determine if this component is obsolete." changes T0 performance on GSM Arena
  3. Domain Contrast: Run same serialized Arrow component through both Gemma 2 and Llama 3.2 to verify Gemma 2's superiority (96.67% accuracy)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can fine-tuning these models within a few-shot learning framework significantly improve predictive accuracy over the current zero-shot baseline?
  - **Basis:** Authors state future research should "investigate the potential of fine-tuning these models... within a few-shot learning framework"
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study showing performance metrics of fine-tuned models against zero-shot results

- **Open Question 2:** Do hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs with traditional machine learning methods enhance robustness compared to LLMs alone?
  - **Basis:** Conclusion suggests "exploring hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs with traditional obsolescence prediction methods could further enhance... robustness"
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results from ensemble model combining LLM embeddings with traditional features

- **Open Question 3:** Why does the Phi 3.5 model fail to follow instructions on the GSM Arena dataset despite being instruction-tuned?
  - **Basis:** Results note Phi 3.5 "consistently failed to follow the instructions... failed entirely for the GSM Arena dataset"
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation study analyzing Phi 3.5's attention mechanisms or output logits with specific serialization format

## Limitations
- Lack of training data for both datasets limits generalizability to new domains
- Simple serialization method may lose complex relational information between features
- Only tested four specific LLMs, leaving questions about performance of larger or differently-architected models

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Gemma 2 results on Arrow dataset (96.67% accuracy, 0.964 AUC) - consistent and clearly specified
- **Medium confidence:** T0 results on GSM Arena dataset - reported but lower accuracy (69.14%) suggests less reliability
- **Low confidence:** Claims about Phi 3.5's general capability - consistently failed to follow instructions, making theoretical potential difficult to assess

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Test Gemma 2 (best-performing model) on GSM Arena dataset to verify whether superior performance on electronic components generalizes to systems data
2. Serialization sensitivity test: Compare "Text Template" method against alternative formats (JSON-style, narrative descriptions) to determine if simple serialization is optimal
3. Model size vs. instruction compliance study: Evaluate Phi 3.5 with different temperature settings and explicit instruction-tuning prompts to determine if compliance issues can be resolved through parameter tuning
