# Adaptive Bounded Exploration and Intermediate Actions for Data Debiasing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.08151
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08151
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Algorithm provably debiases training data under unimodal distributions with censored feedback via bounded exploration and intermediate actions.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to debias training data for fair and accurate classification with censored feedback. The key idea is bounded exploration: the algorithm explores beyond its current decision threshold but limits both the depth (via a lower bound) and frequency (via a probability) of exploration to control costs. Theoretical analysis shows that this approach can recover unbiased parameter estimates under unimodal distributions, and empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets (Adult, FICO, Retiring Adult) demonstrate improved accuracy and fairness. The work also introduces intermediate exploration actions, modeled as a two-stage MDP, showing a tradeoff between faster debiasing and higher cumulative costs. Overall, the method effectively mitigates data bias while balancing exploration costs and fairness goals.

## Method Summary
The algorithm maintains parameter estimates for feature distributions per group/label and uses these to compute decision thresholds that minimize a loss function subject to fairness constraints. At each step, it explores below the threshold within a bounded range defined by a lower bound and an exploration probability. The lower bound ensures exploration is limited to a specific depth, while the probability controls how often exploration occurs. Updates are based on sample percentiles of accepted agents within the exploration range. The method also considers intermediate actions that provide noisy label information at a lower cost, modeled as a two-stage MDP to balance immediate exploration costs against future classification accuracy.

## Key Results
- Bounded exploration with lower bound and probability recovers unbiased parameter estimates under unimodal distributions despite censored feedback.
- Intermediate actions provide a tradeoff between faster debiasing and higher cumulative costs compared to uniform exploration.
- Static exploitation-only policies systematically overestimate distribution parameters due to truncated observations.
- Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show improved accuracy and fairness compared to baselines.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Limiting exploration to a specific bounded range ([LB_t, θ_t]) allows the recovery of unbiased parameter estimates for unimodal distributions despite censored feedback.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm introduces a lower bound (LB_t) defined such that the current parameter estimate (ω̂_0) is the median of the probability mass between LB_t and the decision threshold (θ_t). As new samples arrive in this interval, the algorithm updates ω̂_0 to the observed sample median. If ω̂_0 is underestimated, the true distribution implies more mass exists above ω̂_0, pushing the sample median up, and vice versa, creating a self-correcting feedback loop.
- **Core assumption:** The feature distributions f_y are unimodal (e.g., Gaussian, Beta) and the single unknown parameter assumption holds.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Theoretical analysis shows that this approach can recover unbiased parameter estimates under unimodal distributions."
  - [Section 5, Theorem 2]: Proves convergence by showing estimation errors form supermartingales that converge to zero-mean random variables.
  - [corpus]: Corpus neighbors focus on general optimization or vision debiasing (DetoxAI), lacking specific validation for this bounded exploration logic in censored feedback loops.
- **Break condition:** Fails if the distribution is multi-modal or if the exploration probability ε_t decays too fast relative to the arrival rate of informative samples.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Intermediate actions (e.g., micro-loans) reduce the cumulative cost of exploration at the expense of slower debiasing speed compared to uniform exploration.
- **Mechanism:** By offering a "middle" action, the decision maker receives a noisy label signal at a lower cost (L_l < L_h). However, because the label is noisy (an unqualified agent might succeed at the intermediate task with probability γ), the variance of the estimate update increases, requiring more samples to achieve the same reduction in bias as a clean "uniform" exploration decision.
- **Core assumption:** The intermediate action provides a correlated but noisy signal of the true label y, and specific cost inequalities hold (e.g., (1 - N_2/N_1)(L^h_2 α_0 - L^h_1 α_1) ≥ L^l_2 (1 - γ) α_0).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Leverage intermediate actions which provide noisy label information at a lower cost."
  - [Section 6, Theorem 4]: Shows E[|θ* - θ̂^U_2|] ≤ E[|θ* - θ̂^I_2|], proving the threshold converges slower with intermediate actions.
  - [corpus]: Standard RL exploration (e.g., "Optimistic ε-Greedy") focuses on state coverage rather than this specific cost-accuracy trade-off in label acquisition.
- **Break condition:** Fails if the noise γ is too high (approaching random guessing), making the intermediate data uninformative.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Static exploitation-only policies systematically overestimate distribution parameters (shift thresholds too high) due to truncated observations.
- **Mechanism:** Without exploration, the system only observes samples where x ≥ θ_t. In positive-only sampling, the mean of observed samples is higher than the true mean. The algorithm updates estimates based on this truncated data, causing the threshold θ_t to drift upward, further restricting the observable space and exacerbating the bias.
- **Core assumption:** Feedback is censored (labels are only revealed for positive decisions).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 5, Theorem 1]: "The exploitation-only algorithm overestimates ω_y... [but] pure exploration algorithm recovers unbiased estimates."
  - [Section 1]: "Biases in these datasets can raise economic and ethical concerns due to the resulting algorithms' disparate treatment."
  - [corpus]: Related work on censored feedback (cited in text) aligns with this, though specific corpus neighbors provided do not address the truncation bias directly.
- **Break condition:** If the initial training data is perfectly representative and the population distribution does not shift, exploitation-only remains optimal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Censored Feedback (Selective Labeling)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the fundamental constraint. One cannot simply "train on available data" because the available data is filtered by the very policy being trained. Understanding this selection bias is prerequisite to grasping why exploration is mechanically necessary.
  - **Quick check question:** If a bank only sees repayment data for people it approves, why is it dangerous to assume rejected applicants would have defaulted?

- **Concept: Quantile-based Parameter Estimation**
  - **Why needed here:** The algorithm updates estimates by matching quantiles (specifically the median) of the observed truncated data to the theoretical quantiles of the assumed distribution.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is matching the median of a truncated interval more robust to outliers than matching the mean?

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The intermediate action trade-off is modeled as a two-stage MDP to balance immediate exploration costs against future classification accuracy.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of the paper, what represents the "state" and "reward" in the intermediate action MDP?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Estimator (maintains parameters) -> Policy Selector (finds threshold) -> Exploration Controller (calculates LB_t and ε_t) -> Data Buffer (stores samples) -> Decision Maker
- **Critical path:** Arrival of agent x -> Score against θ_t -> (If x < θ_t) Trigger exploration logic (x ≥ LB_t & random roll < ε_t) -> Decision -> Observe Label -> Update ω̂
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Depth (τ):** Lower τ (deeper exploration) increases debiasing speed but incurs higher risk/cost (more False Positives).
  - **Intermediate vs. Uniform:** Use Intermediate (I) if the cost of full admission (L^h_2) vastly outweighs the cost of slow convergence; use Uniform (U) if rapid debiasing is critical.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Threshold Drift:** θ_t consistently increasing suggests "Exploitation-only" behavior (exploration not triggering).
  - **Estimate Oscillation:** High variance in ω̂ suggests exploration probability ε_t is too high or intermediate action noise γ is unhandled.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run Algorithm 1 on synthetic Gaussian data with known shift. Verify that ω̂_t → ω_true and compare regret against "Exploitation-only."
  2. **Sensitivity to Depth (LB):** Vary the percentile τ used to define LB_t. Plot "Speed of Debiasing" vs. "Cumulative False Positive Cost."
  3. **Intermediate Action Utility:** Implement the two-stage MDP comparison. Identify the specific cost ratios (L_h/L_l) where switching from Uniform (U) to Intermediate (I) actions minimizes total cumulative loss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the convergence guarantees of the active debiasing algorithm be extended to non-unimodal feature distributions?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion, "We conjecture that Theorem 2 on the performance of active debiasing can be extended to distributions beyond unimodal distributions."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical proof of convergence (Theorem 2) relies on properties specific to unimodal distributions to establish that estimation errors are supermartingales.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal proof showing that the sequence of parameter estimates {ω̂_t} converges to the true parameter ω for specific classes of multimodal distributions, or a demonstration of a specific multimodal case where the bounded exploration fails to converge.

- **Open Question 2:** How can fairness constraints be explicitly incorporated into the exploration decisions to ensure equitable risk distribution across demographic groups?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 8 notes, "Our debiasing algorithm... does not consider fairness constraints in its exploration decisions... Imposing fairness rules on exploration decisions... remain as interesting directions of future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** Currently, the algorithm focuses on minimizing bias and cost during exploration (admitting agents below the threshold). It does not account for whether the costs of this exploration (e.g., risky loans) fall disproportionately on specific protected groups.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the proposed algorithm that modifies the exploration probability ε_t or lower bound LB_t based on group-specific fairness metrics, accompanied by an analysis of the trade-off between debiasing speed and exploration fairness.

- **Open Question 3:** What are the theoretical bounds on the weighted regret for the active debiasing algorithm compared to baseline methods?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify "the analytical study of weighted regret of our algorithm... remain as main directions of future work" after observing the trade-off numerically in Section 7.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper provides bounds on the standard (unweighted) error/regret in Theorem 3, the weighted regret—which penalizes errors exponentially based on the distance from the decision threshold—is only analyzed through numerical experiments.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical derivation providing an upper bound on the cumulative weighted regret for the active debiasing algorithm, explaining why it outperforms pure exploration in weighted cost scenarios.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely heavily on unimodal distribution assumptions (e.g., Gaussian, Beta); performance in multi-modal settings is untested.
- Algorithm requires access to inverse CDF of estimated distribution, which can be unstable when parameter estimates drift or become extreme.
- Adaptive exploration rule ε_t is not fully specified in main text, relying on fixed schedules for most experiments.
- Intermediate action extension is analyzed separately from main algorithm with sparse implementation guidance.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Bounded exploration mechanism works under stated unimodal assumptions (supported by Theorem 2 and empirical results on synthetic data).
- **Medium confidence:** Intermediate action framework provides valid cost-accuracy tradeoff (supported by Theorem 4), though practical implementation details are sparse.
- **Medium confidence:** Real-world results on Adult, FICO, and Retiring Adult datasets show improved accuracy and fairness, but paper lacks statistical significance testing and detailed error bars.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce synthetic experiment:** Implement Algorithm 1 on Gaussian data with known shift, verifying convergence of ω̂_t and comparing regret against exploitation-only baseline.
2. **Test multi-modal robustness:** Apply algorithm to synthetic multi-modal distributions to identify breaking conditions for bounded exploration mechanism.
3. **Validate intermediate action integration:** Implement two-stage MDP for intermediate actions and compare cumulative costs against uniform exploration across different cost ratios.
