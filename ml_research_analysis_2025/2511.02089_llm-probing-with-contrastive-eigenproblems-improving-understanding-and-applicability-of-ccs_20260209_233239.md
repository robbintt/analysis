# LLM Probing with Contrastive Eigenproblems: Improving Understanding and Applicability of CCS

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02089

- Primary result: Reformulates CCS as an eigenproblem with closed-form solutions and interpretable eigenvalues

## Executive Summary
This paper examines Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), an unsupervised probing method for determining whether large language models represent binary features such as sentence truth in their internal activations. The authors analyze CCS's two-term objective and argue that what should be optimized is relative contrast consistency rather than absolute consistency. They reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues. The contrastive eigenproblems avoid sensitivity to random initialization while recovering similar performance to CCS across multiple datasets. The eigenvalues provide insights into how well datasets isolate single features, and the approach naturally extends to multiple variables.

## Method Summary
The paper reformulates CCS as a contrastive eigenproblem that can be solved in closed form. The method optimizes for relative consistency between representations of paired positive and negative examples rather than absolute consistency. This yields a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues where the top eigenvector provides the probing solution. The eigenvalue magnitude indicates how well the dataset isolates a single feature, with values close to 1 indicating good feature isolation and values approaching 0.5 suggesting multiple features are entangled. The approach naturally extends to multi-variable scenarios and demonstrates that truth and polarity can be encoded together in a shared subspace.

## Key Results
- Reformulates CCS as an eigenproblem with closed-form solutions and interpretable eigenvalues
- Avoids sensitivity to random initialization while maintaining similar performance to CCS
- Eigenvalues provide insights into dataset quality and feature isolation, with values close to 1 indicating good isolation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The contrastive eigenproblem formulation works by optimizing relative consistency between paired examples rather than absolute consistency. This shift in optimization objective leads to a well-defined eigenproblem with closed-form solutions. The eigenvalues naturally emerge as measures of feature isolation quality - when a dataset cleanly isolates a single feature, the corresponding eigenvalue approaches 1, while entangled features produce eigenvalues closer to 0.5. This mathematical structure provides both theoretical guarantees and practical interpretability that the original CCS lacked.

## Foundational Learning
1. Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) - An unsupervised probing method that uses paired positive/negative examples to find linear probes
   - Why needed: CCS was the state-of-the-art method for finding binary feature representations in LLMs
   - Quick check: Can identify if models represent features like sentence truth

2. Eigenproblems in machine learning - Mathematical problems involving finding vectors that remain in the same direction under a linear transformation
   - Why needed: Provides the mathematical framework for the closed-form solution
   - Quick check: Solutions are stable and interpretable

3. Feature isolation quality - The degree to which a dataset cleanly represents a single underlying feature
   - Why needed: Critical for understanding when probing methods will succeed
   - Quick check: Measured by eigenvalues approaching 1

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data pairs → Contrastive matrix → Eigenvalue decomposition → Top eigenvector → Probe

Critical path: The method requires paired positive/negative examples from the target dataset, constructs a contrastive matrix from these pairs, performs eigenvalue decomposition, and selects the top eigenvector as the probing solution.

Design tradeoffs: The eigenproblem formulation trades computational simplicity (closed-form solution) for potential loss of flexibility compared to iterative optimization. The method requires paired examples, which may not always be available.

Failure signatures: Eigenvalues approaching 0.5 indicate that the dataset doesn't cleanly isolate the target feature, suggesting either the feature isn't represented or multiple features are entangled.

First experiments:
1. Apply the method to simple synthetic datasets where ground truth feature representations are known
2. Test on established CCS benchmarks like TruthfulQA to compare performance
3. Evaluate on datasets designed to have multiple entangled features to validate eigenvalue interpretation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation limited to small number of datasets and model architectures
- Unclear how well method generalizes to more complex feature representations
- Claim about eigenvalues indicating dataset quality needs broader validation

## Confidence
High confidence in: The mathematical reformulation of CCS as an eigenproblem and the theoretical derivation of closed-form solutions. The demonstration that the contrastive eigenproblem approach avoids initialization sensitivity is well-supported.

Medium confidence in: The claim that eigenvalues provide meaningful insights into feature isolation in datasets. While intuitively appealing, this interpretation requires more extensive empirical validation across different types of features and datasets.

Low confidence in: The practical advantages of the eigenproblem approach over CCS in terms of downstream task performance. The paper focuses primarily on interpretability and initialization robustness, but doesn't demonstrate clear performance gains on real-world tasks.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on a broader range of datasets including those with more complex feature interactions, such as multi-hop reasoning tasks or tasks requiring temporal reasoning.

2. Test the eigenproblem approach on different model architectures beyond the ones used in the current study (e.g., decoder-only models, multimodal models) to assess generalizability.

3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the contrastive eigenproblem formulation on downstream task performance compared to CCS, particularly in scenarios where initialization sensitivity is not a primary concern.
