# Activation Manifold Projection: Liberating Task-Specific Behaviors from LLM Architectures

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.17902
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17902
- **Authors:** Al Kari
- **Reference count:** 1
- **Primary result:** CAST transfers LoRA adapters between different LLM architectures, achieving 85-95% of fully retrained performance without task-specific data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the architectural lock-in problem where fine-tuned LoRA adapters are tied to specific model architectures and cannot be transferred. The author introduces Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST), which maps activation manifolds between models rather than aligning static weights. CAST learns lightweight bidirectional projection heads to translate activations between architectures, applies the frozen source LoRA in its native space, and projects the behavioral delta back. Experiments show CAST achieves 85-95% of fully retrained LoRA performance across heterogeneous model families, establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

## Method Summary
CAST transfers LoRA adapters by mapping activation manifolds between source and target architectures. The method adds two trainable projection matrices (P_T→S and P_S→T) per LoRA-adapted layer. During forward pass, target activations are projected into source space, the frozen LoRA delta is computed, then projected back to target space. The projections are trained on a general corpus (C4) for approximately 1000 steps using a composite loss combining KL divergence for output matching and MSE for internal state alignment. Only the projections are trained; the source LoRA weights remain frozen throughout, enabling zero-shot transfer without task-specific data.

## Key Results
- CAST-translated adapters achieve 85-95% of performance compared to fully retrained LoRAs
- Dual-objective loss (KL + MSE) is essential; using only KL causes superficial mimicry, while only MSE produces incoherent text
- Outperforms existing weight-space transfer methods, establishing new state-of-the-art in model interoperability
- Successfully transfers across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Llama-2-7B to Mistral-7B)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Direct Activation-Space Mapping Bypasses Weight-Space Brittleness
Mapping activation manifolds directly is more robust than aligning static weight matrices because it operates in the space where behaviors are actually expressed. CAST learns projection matrices that translate activations between architectures rather than attempting to align weight subspaces via SVD. The frozen LoRA operates in its native source space on projected activations, then the output delta is projected back. This works because activation manifolds, despite architectural differences, share learnable isomorphic structure when trained on similar data distributions.

### Mechanism 2: Frozen Behavioral Kernel Preserves Learned Skill
Treating the source LoRA as immutable during transfer preserves the integrity of the learned task-specific behavior. Only the projection heads are trained; LoRA weights remain frozen throughout. This decouples the skill from the source architecture while maintaining the exact transformation the LoRA learned. The behavioral delta is geometry-specific but semantically portable if the input activation is properly translated.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Objective Loss Enforces Both Functional and Geometric Alignment
Combining KL divergence (output distribution matching) with MSE (hidden state alignment) produces more robust mappings than either alone. KL ensures the student model's logits match the teacher's softened output distribution; MSE aligns internal representations via a trainable projection head when dimensions differ. Functional equivalence and geometric similarity are complementary objectives that regularize each other; neither alone is sufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: CAST is designed to transfer LoRA adapters specifically; understanding that LoRA adds a learnable delta ∆y = BA(x) to layer outputs is essential to grasp what CAST is translating
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a LoRA adapter trained on Llama-2-7B cannot be directly applied to Mistral-7B?

- **Concept: Activation Space vs. Weight Space**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core claim is that activation-space transfer is superior to weight-space methods; understanding this distinction is critical for evaluating the approach
  - Quick check question: Why might aligning weight matrix principal components fail to preserve functional behavior across architectures?

- **Concept: Manifold Learning / Geometric Alignment**
  - Why needed here: CAST maps between "activation manifolds"—the geometric structures formed by internal activations; intuition for high-dimensional geometry aids understanding
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for two models to have "geometrically similar" internal representations, and how would you measure it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Target Model (M_T) → Target Activation (x_T) → P_T→S (trainable projection) → x'_S (in source space) → Frozen LoRA (A_S, B_S) → ∆y'_S (behavioral delta) → P_S→T (trainable projection) → ∆y_T (back in target space) → Target Model output: y_T = M_T(x_T) + ∆y_T

- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify corresponding LoRA-adapted layers between source and target models
  2. Initialize P_T→S and P_S→T (random or identity-based is a reasonable starting point)
  3. Train projections on general corpus (C4) for ~1000 steps using L_CAST
  4. Freeze projections; LoRA adapter remains frozen throughout

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Projection dimensionality: Paper uses "lightweight" projections but does not specify rank/size
  - Training corpus choice: General corpus (C4) enables zero-shot transfer without task data, but domain mismatch could degrade mapping quality
  - One-time cost per model pair: 1000 steps is claimed as minimal, but this must be repeated for each new source-target pair

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance well below 85% of retrained baseline → likely projection initialization or training instability
  - Coherent but off-task outputs → L_MSE dominating; geometric alignment without functional fidelity
  - Incoherent text → L_KL dominating; output matching without internal consistency
  - Architecture mismatch errors → ensure layer correspondence is correctly identified

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity check with same-architecture transfer: Train CAST from Llama-2-7B to itself (identity mapping)
  2. Small cross-architecture test: Transfer a simple classification LoRA from GPT-2 to GPT-2-Medium
  3. Ablation of loss components: Train with L_KL only, L_MSE only, and full L_CAST

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but leaves several critical empirical gaps unaddressed, including the method's performance on extreme size mismatches and non-Transformer architectures.

## Limitations
- Core assumption of isomorphic activation manifolds across architectures is asserted but not theoretically proven
- No ablation studies on projection architecture complexity or initialization strategies
- Cross-architecture transfer is tested primarily on similar-sized models (7B → 7B)
- Domain generalization from C4 corpus training is assumed but not validated across diverse task domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Architectural description and training procedure are clearly specified; dual-objective loss formulation is well-defined and empirically validated
- **Medium confidence:** 85-95% performance retention claim is supported by experimental results but relies on specific conditions that may not generalize
- **Low confidence:** Theoretical justification for why activation-space mapping succeeds where weight-space alignment fails is not rigorously established

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-size transfer validation:** Test CAST on extreme size mismatches (e.g., 1.3B → 70B, or 7B → 70B) to establish the method's limits and whether the activation manifold assumption holds across scale differences

2. **Projection architecture ablation:** Systematically vary the rank and complexity of projection matrices P_T→S and P_S→T to identify the minimal effective projection size and determine if current projections are over-parameterized

3. **Domain shift robustness:** Train CAST on C4 but evaluate on specialized domains (biomedical, legal, code) to quantify how domain mismatch between projection training and target task affects transfer quality
