# A Multi-To-One Interview Paradigm for Efficient MLLM Evaluation
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14886
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14886
- Reference count: 0
- This paper proposes a multi-to-one interview paradigm to address inefficiency and redundancy in conventional full-coverage MLLM evaluation, achieving up to 17.6% PLCC and 16.7% SRCC improvements over random sampling while reducing required questions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the inefficiency and redundancy of conventional full-coverage question-answering evaluations for Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm inspired by human hiring processes, which includes a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases, dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and an adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level selection. Experiments on MMT-Bench, ScienceQA, and SEED-Bench demonstrate that this paradigm achieves significantly higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the number of required questions.

## Method Summary
The proposed paradigm introduces a two-stage interview process that mimics human hiring practices. The pre-interview stage uses a smaller question set to filter and screen candidates, while the formal interview stage employs a more comprehensive evaluation with dynamically adjusted interviewer weights to ensure fairness across different model capabilities. The adaptive question selection mechanism selects questions based on difficulty levels and model performance history, optimizing the evaluation process by focusing on questions that provide maximum information gain. The dynamic weight adjustment ensures that different aspects of MLLM performance are weighted appropriately based on their relevance to the evaluation goals.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 17.6% improvement in PLCC and 16.7% improvement in SRCC over random sampling baselines
- Demonstrated significant correlation with full-coverage evaluation results while using fewer questions
- Validated effectiveness across three established benchmarks: MMT-Bench, ScienceQA, and SEED-Bench

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-to-one interview paradigm works by emulating human hiring processes, where initial screening (pre-interview) identifies promising candidates before more thorough evaluation (formal interview). The dynamic weight adjustment mechanism ensures fairness by adapting to model strengths and weaknesses, while the adaptive difficulty selection optimizes information extraction by focusing on questions that provide maximum discrimination between models. This staged approach reduces redundancy by eliminating questions that don't contribute meaningful differentiation, while maintaining high correlation with comprehensive evaluation results.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** - Why needed: Understanding the target models being evaluated and their capabilities; Quick check: Can you explain how MLLMs differ from standard LLMs in terms of input processing?
2. **Full-coverage evaluation methodology** - Why needed: Establishing the baseline against which the proposed paradigm is compared; Quick check: What are the computational costs and limitations of full-coverage evaluation?
3. **Correlation metrics (PLCC, SRCC)** - Why needed: Quantifying the relationship between the proposed method and full-coverage results; Quick check: Can you interpret what a 17.6% PLCC improvement means in practical terms?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Question pool -> Pre-interview filter -> Adaptive difficulty selector -> Dynamic weight adjuster -> Formal interview evaluator -> Correlation analyzer

Critical path: The evaluation pipeline follows a staged approach where the pre-interview stage filters candidates, then the adaptive difficulty selector chooses questions, and the dynamic weight adjuster ensures fair evaluation across different model capabilities.

Design tradeoffs: The paradigm balances evaluation efficiency against comprehensiveness, trading some coverage for significant time and resource savings. The adaptive mechanisms add computational overhead but provide better discrimination between models.

Failure signatures: Poor correlation with full-coverage results may indicate inadequate question pool diversity or miscalibrated difficulty levels. Excessive weight adjustment instability could suggest poorly designed interviewer weighting schemes.

First experiments:
1. Compare correlation with full-coverage evaluation across different question pool sizes
2. Test adaptive difficulty selection against fixed-difficulty baselines
3. Evaluate weight adjustment stability across multiple evaluation runs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparisons only against simple random sampling baselines without head-to-head testing against other sophisticated evaluation paradigms
- Reported correlation improvements lack explicit statistical significance testing across multiple runs
- Dynamic weight adjustment mechanism may introduce systematic bias toward certain question types or model architectures

## Confidence
High: The core methodology of using interview-style evaluation with pre-interview and formal interview stages is clearly described and experimentally validated on three established benchmarks.

Medium: The claimed efficiency gains and correlation improvements with full-coverage evaluations are supported by experiments, though limited comparison scope and absence of statistical significance testing warrant cautious interpretation.

Low: The generalizability of the dynamic weight adjustment mechanism across diverse MLLM architectures and the long-term stability of the adaptive question selection process under repeated evaluations.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons between the multi-to-one interview paradigm and established active learning evaluation frameworks (such as uncertainty sampling or query-by-committee approaches) to establish relative performance advantages.

2. Perform cross-architecture validation by applying the interview paradigm to a broader range of MLLM models beyond those tested, including both open-source and proprietary systems, to assess the robustness of the dynamic weight adjustment mechanism.

3. Execute statistical power analysis across multiple experimental runs to quantify the significance of reported correlation improvements and establish confidence intervals for the efficiency gains, particularly for the 17.6% PLCC and 16.7% SRCC improvements.
