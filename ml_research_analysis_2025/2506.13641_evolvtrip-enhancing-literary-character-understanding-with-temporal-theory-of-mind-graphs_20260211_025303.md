- Improves LLM ToM reasoning accuracy on literary narratives by encoding character mental states as structured temporal knowledge graphs

## Executive Summary
EvolvTrip addresses the challenge of Theory-of-Mind reasoning in literary narratives by converting implicit character psychology into explicit, perspective-aware temporal knowledge graphs. The framework extracts character mental states as subject-predicate-object triples (beliefs, emotions, intentions, desires) while respecting what each character can actually know based on their perspective. Tested on LitCharToM, a benchmark of 2,539 multiple-choice questions across four ToM dimensions from 20 classic novels, EvolvTrip consistently improves LLM accuracy, with the largest gains in emotion recognition and particularly strong performance for smaller models and in extended-context scenarios.

## Method Summary
EvolvTrip constructs a temporal knowledge graph by extracting mental-state triples from literary narratives using GPT-4o with perspective-aware filtering. Each triple captures a character's belief, emotion, intention, or desire as (Character, Predicate, Object) with temporal tags linking states across plot segments. During inference, relevant triples are added to the prompt alongside the original text. The framework also includes out-of-distribution fine-tuning where models learn to output triples before answers. The approach decomposes complex ToM reasoning into manageable steps by providing explicit cognitive structure rather than requiring simultaneous narrative comprehension and mental state inference.

## Key Results
- Consistently improves LLM accuracy across model scales (Llama-3.1-8B to GPT-4o) on LitCharToM benchmark
- Largest gains in emotion recognition dimension (up to 6% improvement)
- Particularly effective for smaller models and extended-context scenarios (>4,500 tokens)
- OOD fine-tuning shows robustness with structured triple-based training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Representation as Reasoning Decomposition
Converting implicit character psychology into explicit relation triples reduces ToM reasoning complexity by decomposing inference into manageable steps. Rather than requiring LLMs to simultaneously parse narrative text, identify relevant characters, infer mental states, and answer questions, EvolvTrip pre-encodes mental states as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples with ToM-specific predicates. This scaffolding provides explicit cognitive structure that reduces the compound cognitive load of narrative comprehension plus ToM inference.

### Mechanism 2: Perspective-Aware Information Filtering
Constraining mental state attribution to character-accessible information improves accuracy by preventing omniscience errors. The extraction process identifies events observable by each character and excludes unobservable ones, reducing false positive attributions where models assign mental states based on reader-accessible but character-inaccessible information. This correctly models information asymmetries between characters and readers.

### Mechanism 3: Temporal Continuity via Knowledge Graph Linking
Maintaining psychological continuity across narrative segments improves long-context ToM by enabling explicit state tracking and contradiction detection. Triples are tagged with plot segment identifiers and linked across time, allowing the system to combine similar states, refine partial information, or explicitly mark contradictions as character development rather than errors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graph Construction (Subject-Predicate-Object Triples)**
  - Why needed here: EvolvTrip's core representation; understanding how triples encode relationships and how temporal tagging enables state tracking
  - Quick check question: Given the sentence "Elizabeth realizes Darcy's letter changed her opinion of him," what triples would you extract?

- **Theory of Mind Dimensions (Belief, Emotion, Intention, Desire)**
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly categorizes mental states into these four dimensions with distinct predicates; conflating them creates extraction errors
  - Quick check question: Is "wanting to leave the room" a desire or an intention? What's the operational difference?

- **Prompt Engineering for Structured Output**
  - Why needed here: Triple extraction uses GPT-4o with specific formatting constraints; understanding prompt design prevents output parsing failures
  - Quick check question: If GPT-4o outputs "(Character, feels, happy)" instead of "(Character, FeelsTowards, happy)," where does the pipeline break?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Text (CoSER) → Triple Extraction (GPT-4o) → Temporal KG Construction → LLM Inference

- **Critical path:** Triple extraction quality → everything downstream depends on accurate, perspective-aware triple generation. The two-stage verification (GPT-4o + human on 40% sample) gates pipeline reliability.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - GPT-4o extraction vs. manual annotation (speed vs. accuracy)
  - Four ToM dimensions vs. finer granularity (interpretability vs. coverage)
  - Plot-level vs. sentence-level temporal granularity (computational cost vs. resolution)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Perspective contamination: Character attributed knowledge they couldn't have
  - Predicate confusion: "BelievesAbout" used where "DesiresFor" is correct
  - Temporal ordering errors: Earlier states incorrectly override later ones
  - Triple hallucination: Mental states not grounded in source text

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline comparison:** Run your target LLM on LitCharToM questions with standard prompting vs. EvolvTrip-augmented prompting. Measure accuracy delta per ToM dimension.
  2. **Ablation on perspective filtering:** Compare triples extracted with vs. without perspective constraints on a held-out chapter. Check for omniscience errors in the unfiltered version.
  3. **Context length stress test:** Evaluate performance degradation as prompt length increases from 2,000 to 10,000+ tokens, with and without triple augmentation. Identify the crossover point where structured representations provide maximal benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the EvolvTrip schema be extended to successfully handle higher-order recursive beliefs (e.g., beliefs about others' beliefs) and counterfactual reasoning? The current framework focuses on four dimensions and does not capture recursive beliefs, counterfactual reasoning, or epistemic states like uncertainty.

### Open Question 2
Does EvolvTrip transfer effectively to generative tasks involving open-ended character analysis? The multiple-choice evaluation restricts measurement to recognition rather than testing deeper generative understanding of character psychology.

### Open Question 3
How can the framework represent complex, ambiguous psychological states like conflicted emotions or unconscious motivations? The structured triple format necessarily simplifies complex literary character psychology, such as conflicted emotions or unconscious motivations, which may not fit neatly into simple triples.

## Limitations
- Reliance on GPT-4o for triple extraction introduces domain-specific dependency risks
- Evaluation limited to classic Western literature, unclear if framework generalizes to other narrative forms
- Temporal linking mechanism assumes linear narrative progression, may not handle experimental storytelling
- Two-stage verification validates only 40% of extracted triples, leaving 60% unverified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Structured triple representation decomposition mechanism well-supported by ablation studies showing consistent improvements
- **Medium Confidence:** Temporal continuity claims supported by extended-context performance gains, but untested on unreliable narrators
- **Low Confidence:** OOD fine-tuning results suggest robustness but limited to 5 books from same literary tradition

## Next Checks
1. Test EvolvTrip on non-literary narrative forms (screenplays, news articles, social media narratives) to assess domain transfer
2. Conduct systematic error analysis by ToM dimension to identify predicate-specific extraction errors
3. Measure full pipeline latency (extraction + KG construction + inference) and compare against baseline LLM performance for practical trade-off assessment
