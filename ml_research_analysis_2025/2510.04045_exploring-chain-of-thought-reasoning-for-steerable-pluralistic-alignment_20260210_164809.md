## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can improve steerable pluralistic alignment in LLMs, enabling them to adopt specific perspectives. We evaluate four CoT-based approaches—CoT prompting, supervised fine-tuning on human-authored or synthetic CoTs, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)—using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA datasets. RLVR consistently outperforms all other methods across both datasets and model architectures, achieving up to 81.3% accuracy on Value Kaleidoscope and 72.3% on OpinionQA. Notably, RLVR demonstrates strong sample efficiency, matching baseline performance with only 10-30% of training data. Analysis of generated CoTs reveals that RLVR promotes pluralistic reasoning by encouraging consideration of multiple perspectives, though this can reduce perceived faithfulness. Offensive content remains low across all methods, with RLVR showing only a slight increase compared to zero-shot baselines.

## Method Summary
The study compares five approaches for steerable pluralistic alignment: zero-shot CoT prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on human-written CoTs, SFT on synthetic CoTs, and RLVR with GRPO. RLVR uses outcome-only rewards (1 for correct final answer, 0 otherwise) and generates multiple reasoning attempts per sample, serving as data augmentation. The method is evaluated on two datasets—Value Kaleidoscope (218K pairs, 3-way classification) and OpinionQA (91K pairs, demographic-conditional multiple-choice)—using Llama 3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B models. Key hyperparameters include GRPO group size of 16, rollout temperature of 0.7, and top-p of 0.95.

## Key Results
- RLVR with GRPO consistently outperforms other methods, achieving 81.3% accuracy on Value Kaleidoscope and 72.3% on OpinionQA.
- RLVR demonstrates strong sample efficiency, matching baseline performance with only 10-30% of training data.
- RLVR promotes pluralistic reasoning in CoTs by encouraging consideration of multiple perspectives, though this reduces perceived faithfulness.
- Offensive content remains low across all methods, with RLVR showing only a slight increase compared to zero-shot baselines.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: RLVR with outcome-only rewards produces more effective CoTs for perspective-taking than supervised CoT training.
- **Mechanism**: GRPO generates multiple reasoning attempts per sample; correct answers receive reward, implicitly reinforcing whatever reasoning patterns led there. This avoids the credit assignment problem of token-level supervision.
- **Core assumption**: Correct answers correlate with higher-quality reasoning traces; the reward signal propagates backward through the CoT tokens via policy gradients.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "reward function is defined solely based on the correctness of the final answer; no partial credit is awarded for proper formatting or the quality of the CoT"; [Page 3] "GRPO algorithm generates multiple attempts for a given training sample, which doubles as an effective data augmentation technique"; [corpus] "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs" suggests RLVR can incentivize reasoning, though the mechanism is described as implicit.
- **Break condition**: If CoT tokens don't contribute gradient signal toward the correct answer (e.g., degenerate CoTs that are ignored), performance would collapse to SFT baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Synthetic CoT underperforms SFT because sequence-length normalization dilutes answer token influence.
- **Mechanism**: Cross-entropy loss averages over 100-200 tokens; final answer (few tokens) contributes marginally. Human CoTs (20-40 tokens) concentrate loss on the answer.
- **Core assumption**: Model capacity is allocated proportionally to token-level loss contributions.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Page 11] "our CoT fine-tuning methods minimize the average cross-entropy loss over an entire sequence... the influence of the final answer is diluted"; [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus papers don't address this specific finding.
- **Break condition**: If using token-weighted loss or answer-only loss during fine-tuning, synthetic CoT should match or exceed SFT.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: RLVR-induced pluralistic reasoning in CoTs reduces perceived faithfulness while improving accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: RLVR encourages models to consider multiple viewpoints before committing (phrases like "on the other hand"). Evaluators see balanced reasoning but can't infer the target perspective, lowering faithfulness scores.
- **Core assumption**: Faithfulness evaluation (predicting answer from CoT alone without perspective info) captures interpretability; pluralistic CoTs are a feature, not a bug.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Page 5] "among the CoT traces judged unfaithful... 58.6% of the corresponding predictions were 'neither', in contrast to just 15.9% in the ground truth"; [Page 5] "in every case, the traces contained reasoning that reflected pluralistic perspectives"; [corpus] "Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment" addresses pluralism but not faithfulness tradeoffs.
- **Break condition**: If pluralistic reasoning is unwanted, constrain CoT to single-perspective arguments via prompting or reward shaping.

## Foundational Learning

- **Steerable Pluralistic Alignment**
  - Why needed here: This is the core task—conditioning model outputs on a specified perspective/demographic rather than a uniform default.
  - Quick check question: Given a scenario + demographic, can you distinguish between "model's opinion" and "model adopting the specified demographic's opinion"?

- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
  - Why needed here: The RLVR algorithm used; generates multiple completions per prompt, scores them, and updates policy relative to group performance.
  - Quick check question: How does GRPO differ from PPO in terms of advantage estimation and reward normalization?

- **CoT Faithfulness vs. Performance Tradeoff**
  - Why needed here: RLVR achieves higher accuracy but lower faithfulness scores; understanding this tension is critical for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: If a CoT considers opposing arguments before concluding, is that "unfaithful" or "thorough"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base models (Llama 3 8B, Qwen2.5 7B) -> Datasets (Value Kaleidoscope, OpinionQA) -> Training (SFT variants, RLVR with GRPO) -> Evaluation (Accuracy, balanced accuracy, Macro F1; faithfulness; offensiveness)

- **Critical path**: 1. Start with SFT baseline (predict answer directly, no CoT) 2. Add CoT via human-written or synthetic traces (SFT on full sequence) 3. Apply RLVR: generate K=16 completions per sample, reward=1 if correct else 0, update via GRPO

- **Design tradeoffs**: RLVR requires 8×A100 GPUs and ~1,500-2,000 GPU-hours vs. SFT's lower compute; Human CoT requires gold rationales (VK has them, OpinionQA doesn't); synthetic CoT is scalable but underperforms; Pluralistic CoTs improve accuracy but reduce interpretability

- **Failure signatures**: Synthetic CoT accuracy < SFT baseline (likely loss dilution from long sequences); High offensiveness in CoTs (check demographic/perspective prompts for adversarial triggers); RLVR reward plateaus at 0 (rollout temperature too low, or task too hard for current model)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce SFT vs. RLVR gap on a 10% data subset to validate setup before full training 2. Ablate GRPO group size (K=4 vs. 16) to test sample-efficiency mechanism 3. Evaluate faithfulness with perspective information provided to evaluator (compare vs. blind evaluation)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can RLVR and CoT-based methods be effectively extended to "Overton" (spectrum summarization) and "distributional" (population-correlated) pluralistic alignment models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states the authors plan to extend these approaches to the other two types of pluralistic models defined in prior work.
- Why unresolved: The current study only validated the "steerable" setting (adopting a specific perspective), leaving the other pluralism types untested with CoT.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and evaluation of RLVR on benchmarks requiring diverse spectrum summaries or demographic response distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the reliance on in-domain labeled training data be reduced for RLVR-based pluralistic alignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes that while the approach improves with labeled data, it fails to outperform Modular Pluralism on new datasets without it.
- Why unresolved: The method currently requires 10-30% of training data to match baselines, but has not been tested in zero-shot transfer scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating strong steerable alignment on out-of-distribution datasets without requiring the specific labeled data used in the current study.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the trade-off between pluralistic reasoning and CoT faithfulness be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The analysis notes that RLVR promotes pluralistic views in CoTs, but this inclusion of multiple perspectives makes the reasoning appear "less faithful" to the final answer.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if this reduced faithfulness is an inherent side effect of pluralism or if prompting/training can isolate the target perspective better.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training objective or prompting strategy that maintains high pluralism in reasoning while improving the correlation between the CoT and the final decision.

## Limitations

- The evaluation methodology for faithfulness may penalize pluralistic reasoning approaches, making it unclear whether reduced faithfulness scores reflect genuine interpretability issues or methodology limitations.
- Synthetic CoT generation remains underspecified beyond basic templates, making it difficult to reproduce the exact performance gap between synthetic and human-written CoTs.
- The method requires 10-30% of training data to match baselines, failing to outperform Modular Pluralism on new datasets without in-domain labeled data.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: RLVR consistently outperforms other methods across both datasets and model architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results (81.3% accuracy on VK, 72.3% on OpinionQA). The sample efficiency claim is well-supported by ablation studies showing RLVR matching baseline performance with only 10-30% of training data.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why RLVR outperforms supervised CoT training is plausible but not definitively proven. While the paper provides reasonable explanations about reward propagation and data augmentation, the exact reasons for synthetic CoT underperformance remain somewhat speculative.

**Low Confidence**: The faithfulness evaluation methodology and its implications are uncertain. The paper acknowledges that pluralistic reasoning in RLVR-generated CoTs reduces faithfulness scores, but the practical significance of this tradeoff and whether the evaluation captures the right aspects of interpretability remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Faithfulness Evaluation**: Run the faithfulness evaluation with the perspective information provided to the evaluator and compare results with the blind evaluation. This would clarify whether pluralistic reasoning genuinely reduces interpretability or if the current evaluation methodology is flawed.

2. **Synthetic CoT Generation Control**: Systematically vary the synthetic CoT generation process (temperature, prompt specificity, maximum length) to identify which factors most strongly influence the performance gap with human-written CoTs. This would help validate or refute the sequence-length dilution hypothesis.

3. **Reward Shaping Experiment**: Modify the RLVR reward function to provide partial credit for correct reasoning steps or perspective alignment, then measure the impact on the accuracy-faithfulness tradeoff. This would test whether the current reward structure is optimal or if alternative designs could achieve both high accuracy and high faithfulness.
