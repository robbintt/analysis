## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Domain-adapted MentalBERT achieves accuracy 0.92 and Macro F1 0.76 on 10-class mental health/cyberbullying detection from social media

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified multiclass framework for detecting ten mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. The authors implement a "split-then-balance" pipeline, training on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. Through extensive comparison of traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and fine-tuned transformers, the work demonstrates that end-to-end fine-tuning with domain adaptation is critical, with MentalBERT achieving the best performance. A hybrid SHAP-LLM explainability framework and prototype dashboard are presented to support human-in-the-loop moderation, addressing the need for both high performance and interpretability in sensitive mental health detection tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors aggregate data from Reddit and Twitter, preprocess by lowercasing and removing URLs/mentions, then apply a "split-then-balance" pipeline: first splitting into 80/20 train/test pools with original imbalance, then balancing only the training pool via downsampling and EDA oversampling (synonym replacement, random insertion/swap/deletion). They compare lexical models, hybrid approaches, and fine-tuned transformers, with MentalBERT (pre-trained on Reddit mental health forums) achieving the best results. Fine-tuning uses AdamW optimizer with learning rate 2e-5, batch size 16, max sequence length 128, and 90/10 train/validation split. Evaluation uses Macro F1 on the held-out imbalanced test set.

## Key Results
- MentalBERT achieves accuracy 0.92 and Macro F1 0.76, outperforming generic BERT (0.69) and other baselines
- End-to-end fine-tuning is critical: static BERT embeddings with classical classifiers achieve only 0.53-0.58 Macro F1
- EDA-based oversampling improves minority class performance, with Bipolar F1 increasing from 0.49 to 0.70
- SHAP token attributions combined with LLM explanations provide actionable insights for human moderators
- The split-then-balance pipeline prevents data leakage while enabling effective learning on minority classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Domain-adapted pre-training provides task-relevant lexical and semantic representations that improve detection of mental health language patterns. MentalBERT, pre-trained on Reddit mental health forums, encodes domain-specific vocabulary and contextual patterns (e.g., how "tired of" signals distress) before fine-tuning. This prior knowledge reduces the data burden during task-specific training, enabling better generalization on rare classes like Bipolar Disorder (F1: 0.70 vs. 0.62 for generic BERT).

### Mechanism 2
The "split-then-balance" pipeline prevents data leakage while enabling effective learning on minority classes. By first splitting data into train/test pools with original imbalanced distribution, then applying balancing only to the training pool, the model learns from augmented/sampled balanced data while evaluation reflects real-world class frequencies. EDA-based oversampling creates synthetic examples for low-resource classes without duplicating test-set adjacent samples.

### Mechanism 3
End-to-end fine-tuning enables contextual embeddings to adapt task-specific attention patterns that static embeddings cannot capture. During fine-tuning, the transformer's self-attention weights are updated to emphasize discriminative token relationships for the 10-class task. Static BERT embeddings frozen at extraction time cannot adjust attention to distinguish semantically proximate classes (e.g., Anxiety vs. Stress), explaining why BERT_LogReg achieved only 0.55 Macro F1 vs. 0.76 for fine-tuned MentalBERT.

## Foundational Learning

- **Macro F1 vs. Weighted F1 under class imbalance**: Why needed: The test set is deliberately imbalanced (e.g., Personality Disorder: 20 samples, Suicide: 2,557). Weighted F1 inflates perceived performance by weighting by class size; Macro F1 reveals performance on rare but critical classes. Quick check: If your model achieves 0.93 Weighted F1 but 0.76 Macro F1, which classes should you investigate?

- **Transformer fine-tuning mechanics (AdamW, learning rate sensitivity)**: Why needed: The paper uses AdamW with lr=2e-5 for all transformer experiments. Understanding why this matters prevents common failures (exploding gradients, catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge). Quick check: Why might a learning rate of 2e-3 destroy pre-trained representations during fine-tuning?

- **SHAP values for token-level explainability**: Why needed: The hybrid SHAP-LLM framework relies on SHAP to quantify each token's contribution to predictions. Understanding additive feature attribution enables debugging of misclassifications and trust-building with human moderators. Quick check: If SHAP highlights "myself" as driving a Suicide prediction, but the post is actually about self-care, what might this indicate about training data biases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Social Media Text → Preprocessing → Split-then-Balance Pipeline → Tokenizer → Transformer Encoder → Classification Head → Softmax → Post-hoc explainability

- Critical path:
  1. Data deduplication before split (prevents leakage)
  2. Stratified split preserving original imbalance
  3. EDA oversampling for low-resource classes in training only
  4. Fine-tuning MentalBERT with AdamW (lr=2e-5, batch=16)
  5. Evaluation on held-out imbalanced test set using Macro F1

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MentalBERT vs. generic BERT: +0.06 Macro F1 improvement, but requires downloading domain-specific checkpoint; if deployment constraints prohibit additional dependencies, generic BERT with longer fine-tuning may be acceptable
  - 10-class unified model vs. separate binary classifiers: Unified model enables efficient inference but suffers from class confusion (Anxiety-Stress F1 gap); separate classifiers may improve per-class precision but increase deployment complexity
  - SHAP vs. attention-weights explainability: SHAP provides model-agnostic, theoretically grounded attributions but is computationally expensive; attention visualization is faster but less faithful for Transformers

- Failure signatures:
  - High Weighted F1, low Macro F1: Model overfitting to majority classes; re-examine balancing strategy
  - Cross-domain confusion (mental health ↔ cyberbullying): Check if model learned platform artifacts (Reddit vs. Twitter) rather than semantic content; verify with confusion matrix
  - Overconfident predictions on OOD data: Run calibration analysis; if predictions are poorly calibrated, use temperature scaling or switch to better-calibrated model

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Train TF-IDF + LogReg and fine-tuned MentalBERT on the paper's data splits; verify you reproduce 0.67 vs. 0.76 Macro F1 gap
  2. Ablation of balancing strategy: Compare Macro F1 before/after EDA oversampling on low-resource classes (Stress, Personality Disorder); check if Bipolar F1 improvement (0.49→0.70) replicates
  3. Calibration sanity check: Generate calibration plots for Suicide class on your validation set; confirm MentalBERT is better calibrated than ModernBERT before deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How does a multi-label classification framework improve the detection of co-occurring mental health conditions compared to the current single-label approach? The authors identify the "Curation of a Multi-Label Benchmark" as the "most critical next step" in Section 6.6.2, noting that the current single-label setup fails to capture clinical comorbidities (e.g., suicidal ideation co-occurring with bipolar disorder).

2. Does the hybrid SHAP-LLM explainability framework quantitatively improve decision-making accuracy, efficiency, and trust for human moderators? Section 6.6.2 states that future work must include formal Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies to "quantitatively validate the real-world impact of our hybrid explainability system" on workflow and trust.

3. How robust is the fine-tuned MentalBERT model against temporal shifts and demographic variations in social media data? Section 6.6.1 acknowledges that the use of aggregated Kaggle datasets limits generalizability, leaving the model's performance on "different platforms, time periods, or demographic groups" untested.

## Limitations

- Reliance on Reddit-derived mental health language for domain adaptation may not generalize to clinical or platform-specific contexts
- Data sources limited to Reddit and Twitter, potentially missing critical demographic segments
- 10-class unified model shows notable confusion between semantically proximate categories (Anxiety-Stress)
- Synthetic augmentation pipeline has not been validated for semantic preservation, raising concerns about meaning drift

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Domain-adapted MentalBERT outperforms generic BERT (Macro F1 0.76 vs. 0.69) on the specified social media dataset
- End-to-end fine-tuning is critical for transformer performance (static embeddings achieve only 0.53-0.58 Macro F1)
- The split-then-balance pipeline prevents data leakage while enabling effective minority-class learning
- Macro F1 is the appropriate metric for evaluating imbalanced mental health classification tasks

**Medium Confidence:**
- MentalBERT's Reddit pre-training provides general mental health language understanding transferable to Twitter
- The hybrid SHAP-LLM explainability framework provides actionable insights for human moderators
- EDA-based oversampling preserves semantic meaning while increasing class balance

**Low Confidence:**
- MentalBERT would maintain its performance advantage on clinical healthcare data
- The model's predictions are clinically actionable without human review
- The 10-class unified framework is optimal for real-world deployment

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate MentalBERT on clinical mental health screening data (e.g., therapy session transcripts, clinical intake forms) to quantify performance degradation outside social media. Measure both Macro F1 and clinical calibration metrics (e.g., Brier score, reliability diagrams).

2. **Ablation of Augmentation Semantics:** Implement semantic similarity checks (e.g., cosine similarity with SBERT embeddings) between original and augmented posts to quantify meaning preservation. Track per-class F1 changes when synthetic augmentation is disabled to isolate its contribution to minority-class performance.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** Deploy the prototype dashboard with domain experts (clinicians, social workers) to assess the accuracy and utility of SHAP-LLM explanations in real-world moderation scenarios. Measure time-to-decision, agreement rates, and user trust ratings compared to baseline moderation processes.
