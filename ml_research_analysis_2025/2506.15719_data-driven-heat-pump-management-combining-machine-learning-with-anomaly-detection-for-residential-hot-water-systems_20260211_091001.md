# Data-Driven Heat Pump Management: Combining Machine Learning with Anomaly Detection for Residential Hot Water Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15719
- Reference count: 24
- Combines LightGBM for temperature prediction with isolation forest for anomaly detection in residential heat pump systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing residential heat pump operations by integrating machine learning with anomaly detection techniques. The proposed system combines LightGBM for hot water temperature forecasting with isolation forest for detecting shower events, enabling adaptive hot water production tailored to household consumption patterns. By moving beyond conventional threshold-based control methods, this data-driven framework adapts to actual usage patterns, resulting in enhanced energy efficiency and user comfort. The methodology addresses key challenges in residential heat pump management through systematic feature selection, multi-step time-series analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology integrates two machine learning components: LightGBM for temperature prediction and isolation forest for anomaly detection. LightGBM uses historical temperature data and consumption patterns to forecast hot water demand, while isolation forest identifies anomalous shower events that deviate from typical usage patterns. The system employs a sliding window approach for multi-step time-series prediction and includes a feature selection process to optimize input variables. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted systematically to maximize model performance. The approach was tested on six real-world household datasets, providing a practical framework for residential heat pump optimization.

## Key Results
- LightGBM achieved RMSE improvements of up to 9.37% compared to LSTM variants
- Model performance showed strong correlation with R² values between 0.748-0.983
- Isolation forest demonstrated strong anomaly detection capability with F1-score of 0.87
- False alarm rate remained low at 5.2% for shower event detection
- Systematic feature selection and hyperparameter tuning contributed to robust performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining complementary machine learning techniques that address different aspects of heat pump management. LightGBM excels at handling complex, non-linear relationships in time-series data, making it ideal for temperature forecasting. The isolation forest algorithm efficiently detects anomalies by isolating data points that deviate from normal patterns, which is particularly useful for identifying irregular shower events. Together, these methods create a responsive system that adapts hot water production to actual consumption patterns rather than relying on fixed schedules or thresholds.

## Foundational Learning
- Time-series forecasting fundamentals: Essential for understanding how historical data predicts future hot water demand; quick check involves validating prediction accuracy across different time horizons
- Isolation forest algorithm: Critical for anomaly detection in irregular usage patterns; quick check includes measuring false positive and false negative rates
- Feature engineering for residential consumption: Necessary for identifying relevant variables that influence hot water usage; quick check involves correlation analysis between features and target variables
- Sliding window prediction: Important for multi-step forecasting in dynamic systems; quick check includes evaluating prediction performance as window size varies
- Hyperparameter optimization: Key for maximizing model performance; quick check involves comparing performance across different parameter configurations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Temperature sensors → Data preprocessing → Feature selection → LightGBM model → Temperature forecast → Isolation forest → Anomaly detection → Control system → Heat pump

**Critical Path:** Data collection → Feature extraction → LightGBM prediction → Isolation forest detection → Control decision → Heat pump adjustment

**Design Tradeoffs:** LightGBM vs LSTM (computational efficiency vs sequence modeling), isolation forest vs supervised classification (unsupervised flexibility vs labeled accuracy), sliding window vs single-step prediction (temporal context vs computational load)

**Failure Signatures:** High false alarm rates in isolation forest, degraded LightGBM performance with insufficient historical data, sensor drift affecting feature quality, overfitting during hyperparameter tuning

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate LightGBM temperature predictions against baseline LSTM models on a single household dataset
2. Test isolation forest anomaly detection on labeled shower event data
3. Evaluate end-to-end system performance by comparing energy consumption with conventional threshold-based controls

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance metrics based on only six households, limiting generalizability across different demographics and housing types
- Uncertainty about system robustness across diverse usage scenarios and climate zones

## Next Checks
1. Test methodology across a larger and more diverse set of households spanning different geographic regions and climate zones
2. Conduct cost-benefit analysis comparing implementation costs with energy savings and maintenance requirements
3. Perform long-term field trials to monitor performance under varying seasonal conditions and assess system durability over time
