# Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.11651
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Key outcome:** Algorithmic lookism—systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance—operates as infrastructure across text-to-image generation and classification systems, embedding structural harm through stronger effects for women, particularly Black and Asian women.

## Executive Summary
This study reveals that algorithmic lookism functions as a coherent normative framework rather than isolated technical failure, operating across text-to-image generation and classification systems. Using 26,400 synthetic faces from Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, the authors demonstrate that generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes while correlating negative attributes with unattractiveness. The bias propagates to downstream tasks: women's faces generated with negative attributes suffer significantly higher misclassification rates in gender classification systems, creating algorithmic invisibility. Qualitative analysis reveals intensified aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, default beautification of women, and geographic reductionism in "Asian" representation.

## Method Summary
The study generates 26,400 synthetic faces (13,200 per model) using Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium with prompts following the format "<Front photo of a [attribute] [race] [gender]>" across 11 attribute conditions, 3 races (Asian, Black, White), and 2 genders (woman, man), yielding 200 images per condition. Faces are cropped to facial regions and embeddings extracted using both CLIP and ArcFace. Distributional distance (L(a)_g) and cross-attribute correlation (C(g)) metrics quantify lookism strength. Gender classification accuracy is evaluated using InsightFace, DeepFace, and FairFace classifiers. Statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's, t-test/Welch's/Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d) assess significance.

## Key Results
- Both SD 2.1 and 3.5 exhibit systematic algorithmic lookism, with faces generated with positive attributes clustering near 'attractive' references while negative attributes align with 'unattractive' (RQ1.1)
- Women's faces generated with negative attributes suffer significantly higher misclassification rates in gender classification systems, with InsightFace accuracy dropping to 12.3% on 'unhappy' female faces in SD 3.5 (RQ2)
- SD 3.5 produces more convincing images but demonstrates pronounced shift toward idealized representations through age homogenization, default beautification of women, and geographic reductionism (RQ3)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Text-to-image models systematically encode associations between facial attractiveness and positive social attributes, with stronger effects for women, particularly Black and Asian women. The model's learned representation space maps "attractive" prompts closer to embeddings of positive traits (happiness, intelligence, sociability, trustworthiness) than to negative counterparts, as measured by distributional distances (L(a)_g) and cross-attribute correlations (C(g)).

### Mechanism 2
Bias from generation propagates to downstream gender classification, causing higher misclassification for women's faces generated with negative attributes, creating "algorithmic invisibility." Faces generated with negative attributes deviate from the aesthetic norms embedded in both the generative model and the classifiers' training data; classifiers then fail to correctly identify gender on these non-normative faces.

### Mechanism 3
Newer models (SD 3.5) intensify aesthetic constraints through age homogenization, default beautification of women, and geographic reductionism, despite potential improvements in some quantitative metrics. Enhanced data curation and model architecture changes narrow the aesthetic distribution of outputs, reducing phenotypic diversity and aligning more tightly with Eurocentric, youthful, and gendered beauty standards.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Attractiveness Halo Effect (from social psychology)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper operationalizes algorithmic lookism as an extension of this human cognitive bias, where physical attractiveness influences trait perception. Understanding the human phenomenon clarifies what the authors are testing for in AI systems.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the authors chose happiness, intelligence, sociability, and trustworthiness as the test attributes?

- **Concept:** Embedding Spaces (CLIP, ArcFace)
  - **Why needed here:** The quantitative analysis relies on measuring distances and correlations in these spaces. Without understanding that embeddings compress images into vectors where semantic similarity is (approximately) geometric proximity, the methodology is opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** Why do the authors use two different embedding spaces, and what would it mean if results diverged between them?

- **Concept:** Intersectional Bias
  - **Why needed here:** The paper emphasizes that effects are not uniform but stronger for women, particularly Black and Asian women. Intersectionality explains how gender, race, and other attributes compound disadvantage.
  - **Quick check question:** How might an intervention that reduces lookism for white men fail to help (or even harm) Black women?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Prompt design module -> Generative model (SD 2.1, SD 3.5) -> Preprocessing pipeline -> Embedding extractors (CLIP, ArcFace) -> Bias quantification (L(a)_g, C(g)) -> Downstream classifiers (InsightFace, DeepFace, FairFace) -> Qualitative analysis
- **Critical path:** Prompt generation → Image synthesis → Preprocessing → Embedding extraction → Metric calculation → Statistical testing → Classification evaluation → Qualitative analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** Synthetic vs. real faces allow controlled variation but may not reflect real-world distribution; binary attribute framing simplifies analysis but excludes nuance; CLIP captures broad semantics but may encode societal biases; FairFace is designed for fairness while InsightFace/DeepFace are general-purpose
- **Failure signatures:** Metric inconsistency between CLIP and ArcFace suggests embedding-specific bias; classifier variance indicates architecture-specific sensitivities; neutral face anomaly reveals deeply embedded defaults; intersectional collapse indicates severe algorithmic invisibility
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate cross-attribute correlation analysis on alternative generative models (DALL-E 3, Midjourney) 2) Introduce adversarial prompt intervention with neutralizing phrases to measure classification accuracy improvement 3) Audit a deployed system (profile photo moderation tool) using synthetic and real faces to compare lab vs. field behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do human perceptions of attractiveness align with the binary "attractive/unattractive" labels used to generate synthetic faces in this study? The study measures correlations between model-generated attributes and embeddings but does not verify if human observers agree with the model's operationalization of these aesthetic categories.
- **Open Question 2:** Does algorithmic lookism and the associated "algorithmic invisibility" manifest differently for non-binary individuals or mixed-race identities? The current dataset was constrained to binary gender and three specific racial categories, leaving the mechanics of lookism on fluid or intersectional identities unexplored.
- **Open Question 3:** Can data curation strategies be designed to reduce lookism without simultaneously intensifying aesthetic homogenization (the "quality-diversity" paradox)? The paper notes a paradoxical result where SD 3.5, despite "improved data curation," exhibited "intensified aesthetic constraints," implying current curation methods filter out aesthetic non-conformity under the guise of quality control.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic faces and embedding-based metrics introduces ecological validity concerns; real-world deployment may differ due to image quality, lighting, and contextual factors
- Binary framing of gender and limited racial categories exclude non-binary and mixed-race identities, potentially underestimating intersectional harms
- Qualitative findings depend on subjective visual analysis without large-scale human validation

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Systematic association between attractiveness and positive attributes (RQ1.1) supported by robust distance and correlation metrics across both embedding spaces and model versions
- **Medium confidence:** Downstream propagation to gender classification (RQ2) as accuracy drops are dramatic but depend on synthetic face realism and classifier-specific sensitivities
- **Medium confidence:** Qualitative claims about intensified aesthetic constraints in SD 3.5 (RQ3) given subjective nature of visual analysis and lack of large-scale automated comparison

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study on real-world face datasets (CelebA, FairFace) to test whether synthetic face findings generalize to deployed systems
2. Conduct large-scale human evaluation studies to validate embedding-based bias metrics against perceptual judgments of attractiveness and trait associations
3. Test adversarial prompt interventions (e.g., "average appearance" modifiers) to assess whether bias mitigation at generation stage improves downstream classification fairness
