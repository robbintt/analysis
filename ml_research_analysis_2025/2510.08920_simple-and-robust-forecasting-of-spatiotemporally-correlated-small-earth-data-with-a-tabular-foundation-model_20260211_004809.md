# Simple and Robust Forecasting of Spatiotemporally Correlated Small Earth Data with A Tabular Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08920
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Simple and robust forecasting approach achieves superior accuracy across diverse geoscience scenarios by combining spatiotemporal feature extraction with tabular foundation models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data using a novel approach that combines comprehensive feature extraction with tabular foundation models. The method extracts both temporal and spatial features from limited geoscience datasets, transforming them into structured tabular representations that preserve spatiotemporal correlations. By employing TabPFN-TS as the core predictive engine, the approach achieves superior accuracy compared to graph deep learning models and standard tabular foundation models across three diverse geoscience scenarios: monthly precipitation, daily landslide displacement, and hourly surface soil moisture forecasting.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves a three-stage process: (1) constructing a spatiotemporally coupled feature framework that combines universal temporal features with spatial features derived from neighboring stations, (2) applying intelligent feature selection via correlation analysis to mitigate overfitting, and (3) employing a dual adaptive mechanism to merge custom features with TabPFN-TS's built-in capabilities. The approach extracts 5 categories of temporal features (basic statistics, advanced temporal patterns, regime changes) and 2 categories of spatial features (distance-weighted, cross-station dynamics), transforming raw time-series into structured tabular representations. TabPFN-TS, a pre-trained tabular foundation model, then performs zero-shot forecasting without task-specific training, leveraging the engineered features to overcome its inherent bias toward global mean predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieved superior accuracy compared to T-GCN and standard TabPFN across monthly precipitation, daily landslide displacement, and hourly soil moisture forecasting
- Outperformed traditional methods particularly at stations where conventional approaches struggle
- Maintained strong generalization across all monitoring locations without task-specific retraining
- Demonstrated effectiveness across diverse spatiotemporal scales and geoscience phenomena

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit spatiotemporal feature extraction enables tabular foundation models to overcome their bias toward global mean predictions.
- Mechanism: The approach extracts 5 categories of temporal features and 2 categories of spatial features, transforming raw time-series into structured tabular representations. These explicit numerical encodings provide domain-specific priors that guide the pre-trained model away from generic forecasting behaviors.
- Core assumption: Small Earth data exhibit systematic spatiotemporal correlations that can be captured through handcrafted features rather than learned end-to-end.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and Section 2.2.2 describe the feature extraction approach and its role in enabling spatiotemporal correlation capture under limited data conditions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical progressive embedding fuses custom spatiotemporal features with TabPFN-TS's internal representations, reducing redundancy while preserving predictive signal.
- Mechanism: A three-stage process: (1) construct spatiotemporally coupled feature framework, (2) apply intelligent feature selection via correlation analysis, and (3) employ dual adaptive mechanism to merge custom features with TabPFN-TS's built-in capabilities.
- Core assumption: TabPFN-TS's internal feature engineering is insufficient for geoscience-specific patterns but can be complemented without interference.
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.2.2 and 4.2 describe the dual feature embedding methodology and its benefits for capturing complex temporal patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot tabular foundation models with spatiotemporal features generalize across monitoring stations without task-specific retraining.
- Mechanism: TabPFN-TS is pre-trained on synthetic time-series data to learn universal patterns. By inputting structured spatiotemporal features rather than raw observations, the model leverages learned priors while adapting to station-specific characteristics through context-learning mechanisms.
- Core assumption: The pre-training distribution of TabPFN-TS sufficiently covers the statistical properties of engineered geoscience features.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and Section 2.3.2 discuss TabPFN-TS's zero-shot forecasting capability and its advantages over task-specific training approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Tabular Foundation Models (TabPFN)**
  - Why needed here: TabPFN provides zero-shot forecasting without gradient-based training, enabling rapid deployment across heterogeneous monitoring scenarios. Understanding its Bayesian prior-data fitting mechanism is essential for diagnosing prediction bias.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why TabPFN's predictions might tend toward the global mean when input features lack domain-specific structure?

- Concept: **Spatiotemporal Correlation Structures**
  - Why needed here: The approach assumes spatial dependencies can be encoded via distance-weighted averages and nearest-station features. Understanding spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Tobler's first law) validates when these simplifications hold.
  - Quick check question: For a station with weak correlation to neighbors (correlation coefficient <0.3), would distance-weighted spatial features still provide predictive value?

- Concept: **Feature Engineering for Time-Series**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on lag features, rolling statistics, seasonal cycles, and regime change indicators. Understanding how these capture autocorrelation, non-stationarity, and structural breaks is critical for diagnosing failure cases.
  - Quick check question: If your time-series exhibits sudden regime shifts not captured by variance ratio features, what additional feature categories might help?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw multi-station time-series → Feature extraction (temporal + spatial) → Feature selection → TabPFN-TS inference → Station-wise forecasts
- Critical path: Feature extraction quality directly determines forecasting accuracy through the transformation of raw observations into structured tabular representations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature engineering overhead vs. model simplicity: Extensive features improve accuracy but require domain expertise to construct
  - Spatial feature granularity: Distance-weighted averages assume isotropic spatial correlation; anisotropic patterns may require direction-aware features
  - Temporal window sizes: Short windows capture dynamics but increase noise; long windows smooth trends but miss abrupt changes
- Failure signatures:
  - Predictions converge toward global mean → Input features lack discriminative power; verify feature distributions differ across stations
  - Temporal lag in forecasts → Periodic features misaligned with actual seasonality; check cyclic group statistics windows
  - Poor performance at spatially isolated stations → Distance-weighted features provide weak signal; consider removing spatial features or increasing σ parameter
  - Negative KGE values (as observed for raw TabPFN baseline) → Raw exogenous variables interfere rather than assist; ensure features are normalized and structured
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Replicate the T-GCN vs. TabPFN vs. proposed method comparison on one dataset (e.g., precipitation) to verify implementation correctness; expect proposed method to achieve lowest RMSE/MAE across majority of stations.
  2. **Feature ablation**: Remove spatial features (distance-weighted, nearest-station, spatial gradients) and measure accuracy degradation; quantify contribution of spatial vs. temporal features per scenario.
  3. **Cross-domain transfer**: Apply the trained feature pipeline to a held-out monitoring station not used in feature selection; assess generalization gap to validate zero-shot claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of domain-specific exogenous variables (e.g., rainfall, topography) alter the forecasting accuracy compared to the current framework which relies solely on temporal data characteristics?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.4 states that "Future research will incorporate more comprehensive exogenous information sources," noting the current framework focuses exclusively on temporal data characteristics without enriched environmental data.
- Why unresolved: The current feature engineering pipeline ignores physical environmental drivers that likely influence the spatiotemporal patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing performance metric changes (RMSE, MAE) when auxiliary environmental data layers are added to the tabular representation for the landslide and soil moisture case studies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the implementation of spatial clustering features combined with local modeling approaches resolve performance issues in data with pronounced spatial aggregation patterns?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.4 suggests that "predictive methodologies can be further optimized by introducing spatial clustering features," specifically to enhance adaptability to complex local structures.
- Why unresolved: The current approach uses a generalized feature extraction strategy which may not fully capture distinct local dynamics or "spatially isolated" station behaviors effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the model utilizing spatial clustering pre-processing compared against the baseline to see if it improves accuracy at clustered or isolated monitoring stations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the inherent limitation of the TabPFN model in predicting linear trends be mitigated to improve performance on cumulative geoscience phenomena like landslide displacement?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.3 admits the "TabPFN model used in our proposed approach has inherent limitations in predicting linear trends," which weakens effectiveness for cumulative displacement forecasting.
- Why unresolved: The foundation model appears biased against capturing sustained directional trends, leading to inferior results at certain landslide stations compared to T-GCN.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and testing of a hybrid architecture (e.g., integrating a trend-specific module) that closes the performance gap with T-GCN on datasets exhibiting strong linear trends.

## Limitations

- Core claims about TabPFN-TS's zero-shot forecasting capability rest on several unverified assumptions that require empirical validation
- Datasets used are relatively small (5-9 stations) and geographically limited, raising questions about scalability to continental-scale monitoring networks
- The mechanism by which explicit spatiotemporal feature engineering overcomes TabPFN's inherent global-mean bias is asserted but not empirically isolated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology for extracting spatiotemporal features from small Earth data (temporal statistics, distance-weighted spatial aggregation) is well-grounded in established time-series analysis practices
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements over T-GCN and standard TabPFN are plausible given the explicit feature engineering, but the magnitude may be dataset-dependent and requires replication
- **Low confidence**: The claims about zero-shot generalization across monitoring stations without task-specific retraining are theoretical assertions not yet validated across independent geographic regions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a feature ablation study that systematically removes temporal, spatial, and cross-station feature categories to quantify their individual contributions to forecasting accuracy
2. Apply the trained feature pipeline to an entirely new monitoring station outside the original geographic region to test true zero-shot generalization claims
3. Compare performance against graph-based models using learned spatial representations rather than handcrafted features to determine whether the improvement comes from feature engineering quality or the TabPFN architecture itself
