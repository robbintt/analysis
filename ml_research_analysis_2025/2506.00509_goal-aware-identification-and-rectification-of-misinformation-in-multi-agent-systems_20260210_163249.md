# Goal-Aware Identification and Rectification of Misinformation in Multi-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00509
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces ARGUS framework reducing misinformation toxicity by ~28.17% and improving task success rates by ~10.33% in LLM-based multi-agent systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of large language model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) to misinformation injection attacks, which can mislead agents and cause task failures. The authors introduce MisinfoTask, a dataset featuring realistic, complex tasks designed to evaluate MAS robustness against misinformation. They propose ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework that combines adaptive localization to identify critical misinformation propagation channels with goal-aware reasoning to rectify misinformation. Experiments show ARGUS significantly reduces misinformation toxicity and improves task success rates under attack, demonstrating its effectiveness in defending MAS against diverse misinformation threats.

## Method Summary
ARGUS is a two-stage, training-free defense framework for LLM-based multi-agent systems. The first stage uses adaptive localization to identify critical misinformation propagation channels through a composite edge scoring mechanism combining topological importance (Edge Betweenness Centrality), message frequency, and semantic relevance to inferred misinformation goals. The second stage employs goal-aware reasoning with multi-turn chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to detect and rectify misinformation through fact identification, internal knowledge verification, and persuasive reconstruction. A corrective agent monitors the top-k communication edges, analyzes intercepted messages, infers misinformation intent, and generates corrections that are routed back to affected agents.

## Key Results
- Reduces misinformation toxicity by approximately 28.17% across diverse attack methods
- Improves task success rates under attack by about 10.33% compared to baseline
- Goal inference accuracy ranges from 0.50 to 0.75 across different attack types and LLMs
- Ablation studies show dynamic localization and CoT revision are critical components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Topological Edge Scoring for Critical Channel Identification
- Claim: Edge Betweenness Centrality combined with semantic relevance scoring prioritizes monitoring of high-impact communication channels
- Mechanism: The framework computes a composite score for each edge: Score^r(e) = α·Score_topo(e) + β·Score_freq(e) + γ·Score_rel(e), where topological importance (Eq. 2), message frequency, and semantic similarity to inferred misinformation goals are weighted (α=0.2, β=0.2, γ=0.6). Top-k edges are selected for deploying corrective agents
- Core assumption: Assumes misinformation propagates through structurally central and semantically relevant channels; assumes prior-round goal inference is sufficiently accurate to guide re-localization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combines adaptive localization to identify critical misinformation propagation channels"
  - [section 4.1.1-4.1.2] Detailed scoring formulas (Eq. 2-9) and weight configurations (α=0.2, β=0.2, γ=0.6, θ_sim=0.4)
  - [corpus] G-Safeguard (arXiv:2502.11127) similarly uses topology-guided security, suggesting topology-aware monitoring is a reasonable design pattern

### Mechanism 2: Goal-Aware Intent Inference for Adaptive Re-Localization
- Claim: Inferring the misinformation's intent-driven goal enables semantically targeted channel monitoring in subsequent rounds
- Mechanism: The corrective agent a_cor analyzes intercepted messages and outputs a textual description g'_mis of the inferred intent. These descriptions are embedded, deduplicated by cosine similarity, and used to compute relevance scores (Eq. 5-7) for adaptive edge selection
- Core assumption: Assumes misinformation exhibits coherent, goal-directed patterns that can be inferred from content; assumes embedding similarity captures semantic alignment with inferred goals
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "goal-aware reasoning to rectify misinformation"
  - [section 4.2] "Goal-aware Intent Inference" subprocess described; Figure 4 shows 0.50-0.75 accuracy across attack methods and LLMs
  - [corpus] No direct corpus papers validate intent inference in MAS

### Mechanism 3: Chain-of-Thought Persuasive Rectification via Internal Knowledge Activation
- Claim: Multi-stage CoT prompting activates the LLM's parameterized knowledge to detect and generate persuasive corrections for misinformation
- Mechanism: Three-stage process: (1) Multi-faceted Identification deconstructs messages sentence-by-sentence; (2) Internal Knowledge Resonance compares claims against parameterized knowledge; (3) Heuristic Persuasive Reconstruction generates corrections using root-cause analysis, cognitive reframing, and contextual integration
- Core assumption: Assumes LLMs possess sufficient parametric knowledge to verify claims and generate corrections; assumes CoT prompting reliably activates this knowledge without introducing new hallucinations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "goal-aware reasoning for precise misinformation rectification"
  - [section 4.2] Detailed three-stage process; Appendix A.4 describes rectification principles
  - [corpus] Self-Check methods (Manakul et al., 2023) use similar self-reflection prompting

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **MAS as Directed Graph (G = (A, E))**
  - Why needed here: Understanding agents as nodes and communication channels as edges is prerequisite for Edge Betweenness Centrality computation and adaptive localization
  - Quick check question: Given a 5-agent MAS with edges {(a1→a2), (a2→a3), (a3→a4), (a4→a5), (a1→a5)}, which edge has highest betweenness centrality?

- Concept: **Information Flow Levels (Intra-agent vs. Inter-agent)**
  - Why needed here: ARGUS operates at inter-agent level (monitoring edges) but leverages intra-agent CoT reasoning; distinguishing these levels clarifies intervention points
  - Quick check question: Does modifying an agent's system prompt constitute an intra-agent or inter-agent intervention?

- Concept: **Misinformation vs. Malicious Content**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes misinformation (semantically benign, factually incorrect) from overtly malicious content; defense mechanisms target covertness
  - Quick check question: Would a prompt injection that outputs hate speech be classified as misinformation per this paper's definition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Planning Agent -> Worker Agents -> Conclusion Agent; Corrective Agent monitors edges between Worker Agents
- Critical path:
  1. Round 1: Initial localization via Edge Betweenness Centrality (Eq.4)
  2. Each round: a_cor intercepts messages on monitored edges → CoT detection → persuasive rectification → goal inference
  3. End of round: Re-compute edge scores with inferred goals (Eq.9) → re-localize a_cor for next round
  4. Final round: Conclusion agent synthesizes output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **k selection (monitored edges)**: Paper sets k = M-1 (near-full monitoring); smaller k reduces overhead but risks missing propagation channels
  - **Score weights (α, β, γ)**: High γ (0.6) prioritizes semantic relevance; if embeddings are noisy, this may mislocalize
  - **Training-free vs. trained defense**: Training-free enables deployment flexibility but may underperform specialized classifiers

- Failure signatures:
  - MT increases across rounds (Figure 5, attack-only): Indicates uncontrolled propagation
  - Corrective agent produces corrections that disagree with ground truth (Table 2, w/ Ground Truth shows lower MT)
  - Low goal inference accuracy (Figure 4 < 0.5): Leads to poor adaptive re-localization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline attack-only test**: Run MISINFO TASK with PI/RP/TI, measure MT/TSR without ARGUS to establish vulnerability baseline (replicate Figure 2)
  2. **Ablation by component**: Remove dynamic localization, CoT revision, and multi-turn correction separately (replicate Table 2) to identify critical modules
  3. **Topology sensitivity test**: Compare Chain, Full, and Self-Determination topologies under attack+ARGUS (replicate Figure 6) to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Scalability of Computational Overhead**: How can the computational overhead and latency introduced by the ARGUS corrective agent be minimized to ensure scalability in large-scale Multi-Agent Systems?
- **Dynamic Information Verification**: How can defense frameworks be adapted to identify and rectify misinformation regarding dynamic, time-sensitive external information that is not contained within the LLM's parametric knowledge?
- **Adaptive Adversarial Evasion**: Is the adaptive localization component robust against adversarial evasion strategies specifically designed to lower semantic relevance scores or manipulate edge frequency?

## Limitations
- The integration of an external defense module inherently introduces computational overhead that is challenging to entirely mitigate
- Current ARGUS framework is limited to safeguarding against misinformation about knowledge resident within the agents' core LLMs
- The embedding model Φ(·) for semantic similarity scoring in adaptive re-localization is unspecified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using Edge Betweenness Centrality for initial critical channel identification is well-specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The goal-aware intent inference component shows reasonable accuracy (0.50-0.75) but lacks external validation from corpus papers
- **Medium confidence**: The three-stage CoT-based rectification process is detailed, though its effectiveness depends on LLM's parametric knowledge coverage

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce ablation studies** from Table 2 by removing dynamic localization, CoT revision, and multi-turn correction separately to verify each component's contribution to MT reduction
2. **Test ARGUS across diverse topologies** beyond the Chain topology used in main experiments, particularly evaluating performance on Full and Self-Determination configurations from Figure 6
3. **Evaluate goal inference accuracy** under varying misinformation complexity by testing with incoherent, multi-objective, or obfuscated misinformation patterns to assess break conditions identified in the mechanism analysis
