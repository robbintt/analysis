# AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DeepSeek-V3 outperformed Llama 3.3 70B and Mistral Large on Arabic tabular reasoning, while Jais models lagged especially on reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AraTable, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Arabic tabular data across three tasks: direct QA, reasoning, and fact verification. Tables were sourced from Wikipedia, real-world datasets, and LLM-generated content, with QA pairs manually validated by native speakers. Experiments across 41 tables show DeepSeek-V3 consistently outperforming Llama 3.3 70B and Mistral Large, while Jais models lagged, especially on reasoning tasks. Direct QA yielded high accuracy (~90%+), but reasoning accuracy remained below 60%. A self-deliberation-based automatic evaluation method closely matched human judgments, confirming its reliability. AraTable addresses the gap in Arabic tabular benchmarks and highlights the need for improved LLM reasoning over structured data.

## Method Summary
AraTable evaluates LLMs on Arabic tabular data using 41 tables (max 40 rows each) with 615 human-validated QA pairs across three task types: direct QA (factual extraction), reasoning QA (temporal/mathematical/comparative/logical), and fact verification. Models perform zero-shot inference on CSV-formatted tables with free-text answers. Evaluation uses semantic equivalence with tolerance for numeric precision (±0.005) and Arabic morphological variations. An Assisted Self-Deliberation (ASD) protocol compares two LLM judges who re-evaluate only when disagreements occur, producing scores that closely match human judgments.

## Key Results
- DeepSeek-V3 achieved the highest overall accuracy across all task types, particularly excelling on reasoning tasks where Jais models lagged significantly
- Direct QA accuracy reached ~90%+ while reasoning accuracy remained below 60%, indicating a substantial performance gap between extraction and inference tasks
- The ASD evaluation method produced scores closely aligned with human judgments, with specific improvements observed for Qwen and limited improvement for GPT-4o

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: The Task-Complexity Divergence
LLM performance degrades non-linearly as tasks shift from direct extraction to multi-step symbolic inference over tabular data. Direct QA relies on pattern matching and location heuristics, which align with LLM pre-training objectives. Reasoning tasks require state maintenance across rows and precise logical operators, which LLMs often fail because they process text linearly without an internal "symbolic scratchpad," leading to compounding errors when a single logic step fails.

### Mechanism 2: Generalist Scale vs. Linguistic Specialization
Massive generalist models (DeepSeek-V3, Llama 3.3) outperform specialized Arabic-centric models (Jais) on complex reasoning, suggesting that reasoning is a transferable capability derived from scale and diverse pre-training data rather than linguistic specialization alone. Specialized models like Jais are fine-tuned for linguistic fluency and cultural context, but tabular reasoning requires broader logical priors often learned from massive, diverse English-dominant corpora.

### Mechanism 3: Assisted Self-Deliberation (ASD) for Evaluation
An "Assisted Self-Deliberation" protocol, where an LLM judge re-evaluates its decision solely based on a "disagreement flag" from a peer, aligns more closely with human judgment than single-pass evaluation. In the first pass, LLMs use fast, heuristic-based evaluation. When a disagreement signal is introduced, it forces the model to switch to a slower, rule-based scrutiny to justify its position, effectively checking against the provided rubric more rigorously.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tabular Data Linearization** - Why needed: LLMs cannot natively "see" a grid; they process a sequence of tokens. Understanding how CSV/Markdown linearization flattens relationships is critical to understanding why models fail on structural reasoning. Quick check: How does representing a table as a CSV string potentially hide the semantic relationship between a header and a cell compared to a visual grid?

- **Concept: The "Reasoning Gap"** - Why needed: This paper defines a specific failure mode where linguistic fluency does not correlate with logical inference. One must distinguish between "the model didn't understand the Arabic" vs. "the model couldn't execute the logic." Quick check: If a model answers "What is the capital?" correctly but fails "Which city has the highest population density?", is the failure likely linguistic or logical?

- **Concept: Arabic Morphological Complexity** - Why needed: Arabic's rich morphology increases tokenization complexity, impacting exact-match evaluation and semantic similarity, necessitating the "relaxed evaluation" rubric used in the paper. Quick check: Why might a standard BLEU score or exact match fail to detect a correct answer in Arabic if the model uses a valid synonym or different grammatical form?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** GPT-4o (Generation) -> Human Annotators (Filtering/Ground Truth) -> Target LLMs (Inference) -> LLM Judges (Qwen/4O) + ASD Protocol (Resolver)
- **Critical path:** The Manual Filtering & Verification process. The entire benchmark relies on the ground truth being unimpeachable. If human annotators approve a generated QA pair that is actually logically flawed, the evaluation of the models becomes invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Row Limitation (40 rows) truncated tables to fit the context window of weaker models (Jais), reducing complexity of reasoning tasks involving large aggregations. Free-text vs. Constrained Output allowed models to answer naturally but massively increased evaluation complexity requiring semantic checking rather than JSON parsing.
- **Failure signatures:** The "Verbose Hallucination" where Jais produces long, repetitive explanations instead of direct answers. The "Numeric Drift" where models struggle with precision (4.50 vs 4.51). The "Language Switch" where models revert to English for entity names.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check: Run DeepSeek-V3 on a sample of "Real-World" tables vs. "Wikipedia" tables to replicate the ~10-20% performance drop. 2) Evaluator Stress Test: Implement the ASD mechanism using two different judge models and measure the "delta" in alignment with human scores. 3) Prompt Sensitivity: Test Jais with a few-shot prompt to determine if the low reasoning score is a capability limit or a prompt-alignment issue.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- To what extent do few-shot prompting and fine-tuning improve LLM accuracy on complex reasoning tasks in AraTable compared to the zero-shot baseline? The authors state future work will explore few-shot and fine-tuned settings, particularly for complex reasoning scenarios.

- How does LLM performance scale when processing larger or hierarchical Arabic tables, and can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigate context limitations? The authors suggest extending the benchmark to include larger and more diverse tables, including RAG as a promising direction.

- How do proprietary, closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) perform on AraTable tasks relative to the open-source models evaluated? The authors note they tested only open-source models, leaving the performance of potential state-of-the-art baselines unknown.

- Can advanced reasoning prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Table, significantly reduce the performance gap between direct extraction and complex reasoning? The paper notes reasoning accuracy remains below 60% and discusses Chain-of-Table in related work but does not apply it.

## Limitations
- Dependence on human-annotated ground truth for 615 QA pairs introduces potential subjectivity despite native speaker validation
- Row limitation (40 rows) may underrepresent the complexity of real-world tabular reasoning tasks
- Self-deliberation evaluation method lacks established literature validation for tabular reasoning contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: DeepSeek-V3 outperforming other models on Arabic tabular tasks
- Medium confidence: The 60% accuracy ceiling for reasoning tasks reflects fundamental LLM limitations
- Medium confidence: The Assisted Self-Deliberation evaluation method reliably approximates human judgment

## Next Checks
1. Ground truth validation audit: Have a second independent native Arabic speaker review 10% of the ground truth QA pairs to quantify inter-annotator agreement and identify potential systematic biases.

2. Cross-lingual reasoning comparison: Run identical reasoning tasks on English versions of comparable tables using the same models to determine if the 60% accuracy ceiling is specific to Arabic or represents a general LLM reasoning limitation.

3. Extended context window experiment: Test model performance on truncated versions of the 40-row tables (20 rows, 30 rows) to quantify how much the row limitation affects reasoning accuracy and determine if the performance ceiling is due to context constraints rather than reasoning capability.
