core_contribution: Winsor-CAM introduces a human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that
  generates robust, multi-layer visual explanations by applying Winsorization to suppress
  extreme importance values across all convolutional layers. Unlike standard Grad-CAM,
  which relies on the final layer, Winsor-CAM aggregates layer-wise Grad-CAM maps
  and applies percentile-based clipping to reduce the influence of outliers, enabling
  semantic-level tuning through a user-adjustable threshold.

# Winsor-CAM: Human-Tunable Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Layer-Wise Winsorization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10846
- Authors: Casey Wall; Longwei Wang; Rodrigue Rizk; KC Santosh
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms Grad-CAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 localization metrics through Winsorization-based outlier suppression

## Executive Summary
Winsor-CAM introduces a human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust, multi-layer visual explanations by applying Winsorization to suppress extreme importance values across all convolutional layers. Unlike standard Grad-CAM, which relies on the final layer, Winsor-CAM aggregates layer-wise Grad-CAM maps and applies percentile-based clipping to reduce the influence of outliers, enabling semantic-level tuning through a user-adjustable threshold. Evaluated on ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and InceptionV3 using the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, Winsor-CAM outperforms both final-layer Grad-CAM and naïve layer averaging in terms of localization accuracy, achieving higher Intersection over Union (IoU) and better center-of-mass alignment with ground truth masks.

## Method Summary
Winsor-CAM extends Grad-CAM by aggregating layer-wise importance maps across all convolutional layers rather than relying solely on the final layer. The method applies Winsorization—a statistical technique that caps extreme values at specified percentiles—to each layer's Grad-CAM map before aggregation. This reduces the influence of outliers that can distort visual explanations. The approach includes a human-tunable threshold parameter that allows experts to control the semantic level of the explanations, enabling exploration of model behavior across different hierarchical levels of abstraction.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher Intersection over Union (IoU) scores compared to standard Grad-CAM and naïve layer averaging
- Demonstrates better center-of-mass alignment with ground truth segmentation masks
- Shows improved spatial coherence and interpretability across multiple architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3)
- Maintains robust performance across different semantic levels through human-tunable thresholding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Winsor-CAM's effectiveness stems from its statistical approach to handling extreme importance values in deep network activations. By applying Winsorization to each layer's Grad-CAM map, the method prevents outlier activations from dominating the final explanation. This is particularly important in deep networks where later layers can contain noisy or overly specific activations that don't generalize well. The layer-wise aggregation captures semantic information at multiple levels of abstraction, while the percentile-based clipping ensures that no single layer or activation can disproportionately influence the final explanation. The human-tunable threshold provides semantic control, allowing experts to explore different levels of abstraction in the model's decision-making process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Grad-CAM fundamentals**: Needed to understand the baseline method being extended; quick check: can explain how gradients flow back to generate class-specific activation maps
- **Winsorization statistics**: Essential for understanding the outlier suppression mechanism; quick check: can define percentile-based clipping and its effect on distributions
- **Multi-layer feature aggregation**: Critical for grasping how semantic information is combined across network depths; quick check: can explain why different layers capture different levels of abstraction
- **IoU and localization metrics**: Important for interpreting performance evaluation; quick check: can calculate and explain what IoU measures in segmentation tasks
- **Center-of-mass alignment**: Relevant for understanding spatial accuracy metrics; quick check: can explain how this metric differs from IoU in evaluating explanation quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input image → Multiple convolutional layers → Layer-wise Grad-CAM maps → Winsorization (percentile clipping) → Weighted aggregation → Tunable threshold → Final explanation map

**Critical path:**
Input → Forward pass through all conv layers → Backward gradient computation for target class → Grad-CAM computation per layer → Winsorization → Aggregation → Thresholding

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Layer-wise vs. final-layer only: More comprehensive but computationally heavier
- Fixed vs. adaptive percentiles: Simpler implementation vs. potentially better adaptation to different architectures
- Tunable vs. fixed threshold: Greater flexibility vs. potential user confusion

**Failure signatures:**
- Oversmoothing of explanations if Winsorization percentiles are too conservative
- Loss of important detail if thresholds are too aggressive
- Computational inefficiency if layer count is excessive without sufficient benefit

**First experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing Winsor-CAM variants with different percentile thresholds (5-95, 10-90, 20-80)
2. Cross-dataset evaluation on medical imaging or satellite imagery to test generalizability
3. User study with domain experts to validate semantic interpretability claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, but several implicit questions emerge from the work: How do different Winsorization percentile choices affect explanation quality across various architectures? Can the human-tunable parameter be made more intuitive or adaptive? How does Winsor-CAM perform on out-of-domain datasets beyond natural images? What is the relationship between Winsorization thresholds and semantic abstraction levels?

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely entirely on PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark without validation on other datasets
- Fixed Winsorization percentiles (5th and 95th) lack justification for optimal threshold selection
- Human-tunable parameter's semantic interpretability is claimed but not empirically validated through user studies
- Computational overhead from processing multiple layers may limit real-time applications

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Mathematical formulation of layer-wise Winsorization is sound and reproducible
- Implementation details are clearly specified and verifiable

**Medium confidence:**
- Comparative performance metrics against Grad-CAM and layer averaging are internally consistent
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific dataset and architectures tested

**Low confidence:**
- Claims about enhanced interpretability lack empirical validation beyond quantitative localization metrics
- Semantic interpretability of tunable parameter not supported by user studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the Winsorization percentile thresholds across multiple datasets to determine robustness to parameter choice
2. Perform a human factors study with domain experts to validate whether the tunable parameter produces semantically meaningful control over explanations
3. Test the method on out-of-domain datasets (medical imaging, satellite imagery) to assess generalizability beyond natural images
