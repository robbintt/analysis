# Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27651
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel greedy layer-wise training method based on deterministic information bottleneck principle outperforms existing layer-wise baselines on CIFAR-10/100 and achieves strong performance on traffic sign recognition task

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a greedy layer-wise training approach for deep neural networks that explicitly exploits the sequential layer-wise convergence pattern observed in standard end-to-end backpropagation. By analyzing training dynamics through an information-theoretic lens, the authors demonstrate that networks converge from shallow to deep layers in a Markov information bottleneck pattern. Based on these insights, they propose training each layer jointly with an auxiliary classifier while minimizing a local objective that combines cross-entropy loss with weighted entropy regularization to enforce information compression. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern CNNs like ResNet and VGG, showing superior performance compared to existing layer-wise baselines and comparable results to SGD-trained networks.

## Method Summary
The method trains neural networks layer-by-layer without end-to-end backpropagation by exploiting the sequential convergence pattern observed in standard SGD training. Each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that provides local supervision, minimizing a deterministic information bottleneck objective combining cross-entropy loss with entropy regularization. The entropy term uses matrix-based Rényi's α-order entropy with RBF kernel estimation, forcing representations to compress task-irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant content. After training, auxiliary classifiers are discarded and only the main network parameters are retained. The approach is extended to traffic sign recognition by adding bounding box regression alongside classification.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing layer-wise baselines (Greedy LE, Greedy LS) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using VGG-11, VGG-16, and ResNet-18
- Achieves performance comparable to end-to-end backpropagation on standard image classification tasks
- Demonstrates strong performance on traffic sign recognition combining classification and bounding box regression
- Shows improved robustness to catastrophic forgetting compared to end-to-end training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sequential Layer-wise Convergence
Deep networks trained with end-to-end backpropagation implicitly converge layer-by-layer from shallow to deep, which greedy layer-wise training can explicitly exploit. Cross-MI matrices show diagonal elements in shallow layers rapidly converge while deeper layers increase more gradually, suggesting each layer reaches stable representations before deeper layers. Core assumption: convergence ordering reflects inherent deep architecture properties. Evidence: Cross-MI matrices for VGG16 and ResNet18 show progressive diagonal convergence from top-left to bottom-right across epochs. Break condition: If networks showed simultaneous convergence or deep-before-shallow patterns, the premise would collapse.

### Mechanism 2: Deterministic Information Bottleneck Compression
Adding entropy regularization to local objectives forces representations to discard task-irrelevant information, improving generalization. The DIB objective combines cross-entropy with entropy term, where I(Z;X) = H(Z) for deterministic networks. Minimizing H(Z) compresses representations while CE preserves task-relevant information. Core assumption: deterministic IB approximation captures essential compression dynamics. Evidence: Modified information plane shows H(z_l) increases then decreases during training, confirming compression phases exist in standard SGD. Break condition: If entropy minimization collapsed representations or showed no generalization benefit, the mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 3: Auxiliary Classifier-based Local Supervision
Attaching auxiliary classifiers to each layer enables local gradient computation without backward locking, reducing memory while maintaining performance. Each layer output feeds into an auxiliary classifier producing intermediate predictions. The local objective trains layer and auxiliary parameters jointly using only forward information. Core assumption: auxiliary classifier can extract sufficient task-relevant information from each layer's representation. Evidence: Greedy LS/LE substantially outperform NIK and HSIC-bottleneck on CIFAR-10/100. Break condition: If intermediate layer representations lacked sufficient task information, auxiliary classifiers would fail to provide useful supervision.

## Foundational Learning

- **Information Bottleneck Principle**: The entire method minimizes I(Z;X) while maximizing I(Z;Y) to learn minimal sufficient representations. Quick check: Given representation Z, what does high I(Z;Y) but low I(Z;X) indicate about information content?

- **Rényi's α-order Entropy**: Used as differentiable mutual information estimator for high-dimensional representations via kernel Gram matrices. Quick check: Why might Rényi entropy be preferred over Shannon entropy for gradient-based optimization?

- **Greedy vs. Multi-round Layer-wise Training**: Distinguishes single-pass greedy approach from HSIC bottleneck's multi-round method affecting computational cost. Quick check: What is the memory advantage of greedy single-pass over multi-round layer-wise training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Layer blocks f_θ_l -> Auxiliary classifiers g_φ_l -> DIB loss module -> Two-head extension (traffic sign)
- **Critical path**: Forward pass computes z_l = f_θ_l(z_{l-1}) → Auxiliary classifier produces ŷ_l = g_φ_l(z_l) → DIB loss: β·H(z_l) + CE(ŷ_l; y) [+ α·Bbox for traffic sign] → Update (θ_l, φ_l) via SGD; freeze other parameters → Proceed to layer l+1; discard auxiliary classifier at test time
- **Design tradeoffs**: β tuning (0.001-0.01 range); auxiliary classifier capacity vs. overhead; layer block granularity vs. flexibility
- **Failure signatures**: Representation collapse (β too high); no improvement over CE-only (β too low); early layer stagnation (auxiliary capacity issues)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation: Train 5-layer CNN on CIFAR-10 with β sweep to confirm optimal range; 2) Ablation on auxiliary classifier depth: Compare 1 FC vs. 2 Conv + 1 FC on VGG-11/CIFAR-10; 3) Compression visualization: Plot H(z_l) vs. I(z_l; y) trajectories to confirm fitting-then-compression pattern

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Information-theoretic analysis relies on mutual information approximations using matrix-based Rényi entropy, which may not capture full complexity of high-dimensional representations
- Sequential convergence pattern represents correlation rather than proven causation for layer-wise training effectiveness
- Method performance on very deep networks beyond ResNet-18 remains untested, and computational overhead of training auxiliary classifiers could become prohibitive

## Confidence
- Sequential Layer-wise Convergence: High (strong empirical evidence from cross-MI matrix analysis)
- Deterministic Information Bottleneck Compression: Medium (solid theoretical foundation but limited empirical validation)
- Auxiliary Classifier Supervision: Medium (demonstrated effectiveness but auxiliary capacity sensitivity not fully explored)

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Pattern Validation**: Test whether deeper-before-shallow convergence patterns can be induced through architectural modifications to challenge sequential convergence assumption
2. **Information Plane Generalization**: Apply modified information plane analysis to other architectures (DenseNet, MobileNet) to verify fitting-then-compression pattern holds beyond VGG/ResNet
3. **Ablation on Entropy Estimation**: Compare matrix-based Rényi entropy against alternative MI estimators (MINE, InfoNCE) to assess sensitivity to specific information-theoretic approximation used
