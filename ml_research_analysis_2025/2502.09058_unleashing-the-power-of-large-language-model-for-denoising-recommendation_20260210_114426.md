# Unleashing the Power of Large Language Model for Denoising Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09058
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09058
- Authors: Shuyao Wang; Zhi Zheng; Yongduo Sui; Hui Xiong
- Reference count: 40
- LLaRD outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by 6.92%–11.79% in Recall@10 and NDCG@10

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLaRD, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance denoising in recommendation systems. By generating preference and relation knowledge through Chain-of-Thought prompting over interaction graphs, LLaRD applies information bottleneck techniques to filter noisy interactions. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over existing denoising methods, particularly in handling noisy user-item interactions and cold-start scenarios.

## Method Summary
LLaRD addresses denoising in recommendation systems by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate preference and relation knowledge, then applying information bottleneck to filter noise. It uses CoT prompting over interaction graphs to infer collaborative and interest-based edges, and combines semantic and graph-based signals for robust denoising. Experiments on three datasets with GMF and LightGCN backbones show LLaRD outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by 6.92%–11.79% in Recall@10 and NDCG@10, with stronger robustness to added noise and improved cold-start performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of LLM-mined knowledge and the denoising framework.

## Key Results
- LLaRD outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by 6.92%–11.79% in Recall@10 and NDCG@10
- Demonstrated stronger robustness to added noise compared to existing methods
- Showed improved cold-start performance for new users

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLaRD leverages LLMs to generate high-quality preference and relation knowledge from interaction graphs, which provides richer semantic understanding than traditional denoising approaches. The Chain-of-Thought prompting enables the LLM to systematically reason about user preferences and item relationships, generating both collaborative and interest-based edges. By combining this knowledge with information bottleneck techniques, the framework effectively filters out noise while preserving meaningful signals, resulting in more accurate recommendations.

## Foundational Learning

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Enables LLMs to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps, improving the quality of generated knowledge. Why needed: Essential for systematic reasoning about user preferences and item relationships. Quick check: Verify that CoT prompts produce consistent intermediate reasoning steps across different user-item pairs.

**Information Bottleneck Theory**: A principle that optimizes the tradeoff between compressing input data and preserving relevant information for prediction. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for noise filtering while maintaining prediction accuracy. Quick check: Validate that the mutual information between inputs and outputs decreases while prediction performance improves.

**Graph Neural Networks**: Specialized neural networks that operate on graph-structured data, capturing relationships between nodes. Why needed: Enables modeling of user-item interaction networks and the newly generated collaborative/interest edges. Quick check: Confirm that graph convolution operations properly aggregate information from neighboring nodes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User-Item Graph -> LLM CoT Reasoning -> Preference/Relation Knowledge Generation -> Information Bottleneck Denoising -> Recommendation Model (GMF/LightGCN)

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is the LLM CoT reasoning step that generates preference and relation knowledge, as this directly impacts the quality of denoising. The information bottleneck layer is also crucial for filtering noise based on the LLM-generated knowledge.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead (due to LLM inference) for improved recommendation quality and robustness. The choice between GMF and LightGCN as backbone models offers flexibility but may affect performance depending on dataset characteristics.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest when LLM-generated knowledge is inconsistent or when the information bottleneck over-prunes meaningful interactions. The framework may also struggle with datasets where noise patterns significantly differ from the training distribution.

**3 First Experiments**: 1) Validate LLM-generated knowledge quality on a small sample of user-item pairs, 2) Test information bottleneck parameter sensitivity on a validation set, 3) Compare denoising performance with and without LLM knowledge on a held-out test set.
