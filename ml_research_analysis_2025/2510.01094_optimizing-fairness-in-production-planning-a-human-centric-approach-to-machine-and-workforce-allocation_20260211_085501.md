core_contribution: This paper introduces a two-layer, human-centric production planning
  framework integrating Constraint Programming (CP) for Order-Line allocation and
  Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for Worker-Line allocation. The CP layer optimizes
  machine utilization and due date adherence, while the MDP layer incorporates worker
  preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints into assignments.

# Optimizing Fairness in Production Planning: A Human-Centric Approach to Machine and Workforce Allocation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01094
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Human-centric production planning framework achieves high expert satisfaction (8.03 for Order-Line, 8.47 for Worker-Line) while balancing operational efficiency and workforce fairness

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a two-layer optimization framework for production planning that integrates Constraint Programming (CP) for Order-Line allocation with Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for Worker-Line allocation. The system prioritizes both operational efficiency and worker well-being by incorporating preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints into the scheduling process. Evaluated through 16 expert sessions in the automotive industry, the approach demonstrates high satisfaction scores and low variance, indicating robustness across different scenarios. The framework effectively addresses the challenge of balancing machine utilization and due date adherence with human-centric considerations, offering practical insights for fair and efficient manufacturing scheduling.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-layer approach: CP optimizes machine utilization and due date adherence at the Order-Line level, while MDP incorporates worker preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints at the Worker-Line level. The system was evaluated through 16 expert sessions using SUS-based questionnaires and quantitative KPIs, measuring satisfaction, fairness, and operational efficiency. The evaluation focused on the automotive industry context, gathering feedback on preference alignment, fairness in assignments, and operational performance metrics.

## Key Results
- High satisfaction scores achieved: 8.03 for Order-Line allocation and 8.47 for Worker-Line allocation
- Low variance in satisfaction scores demonstrates system robustness across different scenarios
- Experts positively evaluated fairness and preference alignment, though noted issues with earliness and worker reassignment modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by decoupling machine-level optimization from worker-level considerations, allowing each layer to focus on its specific constraints while maintaining overall system coherence. CP handles hard operational constraints and efficiency targets, while MDP captures the nuanced human factors that affect worker satisfaction and productivity. This separation enables more precise optimization at each level while preserving the ability to balance competing objectives through the integrated architecture.

## Foundational Learning
- Constraint Programming fundamentals: Needed to understand CP layer's ability to handle complex operational constraints; Quick check: Can model precedence, capacity, and temporal constraints effectively
- Markov Decision Process basics: Required to grasp how worker preferences and constraints are incorporated into the optimization; Quick check: Can represent state transitions and reward structures for worker assignments
- Multi-objective optimization tradeoffs: Essential for understanding how the framework balances efficiency and fairness; Quick check: Can quantify and optimize for competing objectives simultaneously
- Human factors in manufacturing: Critical for appreciating the importance of worker preferences and constraints; Quick check: Can identify and model relevant human-centric factors
- Automotive production planning context: Provides necessary background for evaluating the framework's applicability; Quick check: Understands typical automotive manufacturing constraints and workflows

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: CP layer (Order-Line allocation) -> MDP layer (Worker-Line allocation) -> Expert evaluation system
- Critical path: Order reception -> CP optimization -> Worker preference incorporation -> Assignment generation -> Expert validation
- Design tradeoffs: Separated optimization layers enable specialized handling but require careful integration; real-time computation vs. solution quality balance
- Failure signatures: Constraint violations indicate CP layer issues; worker dissatisfaction suggests MDP parameter tuning needed; low satisfaction scores across experts signal fundamental architectural problems
- 3 first experiments: 1) Test CP layer with simplified worker constraints to isolate machine optimization performance, 2) Validate MDP layer with pre-defined CP solutions to assess worker satisfaction impact, 3) Run integrated system with synthetic data to verify end-to-end functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size of 16 expert sessions limits statistical power and generalizability across different manufacturing contexts
- Automotive industry focus constrains applicability to other sectors with different operational constraints
- Brief evaluation period may not reveal long-term impacts on worker satisfaction or system sustainability

## Confidence
- System Architecture and Methodology: High
- Expert Evaluation Results: High
- Real-world Applicability: Medium
- Long-term Impact Assessment: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal studies across multiple manufacturing sectors to assess system performance and worker satisfaction over extended periods
2. Expand expert evaluation to include diverse manufacturing contexts and larger sample sizes to improve statistical robustness
3. Implement real-world pilot testing with dynamic constraint handling to validate system adaptability to changing production conditions
