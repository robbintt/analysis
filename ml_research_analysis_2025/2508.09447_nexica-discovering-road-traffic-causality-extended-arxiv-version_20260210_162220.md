# NEXICA: Discovering Road Traffic Causality (Extended arXiv Version)

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.09447
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09447
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** NEXICA achieves near-perfect accuracy (AUC of 0.9995) on road traffic causality detection compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents NEXICA, a novel algorithm for discovering causal relationships in road traffic data. The method detects traffic slowdown events from time series data, computes the probability of one event sequence causing another using maximum likelihood estimation, and trains a random forest classifier on these probabilities. Tested on six months of data from 195 highway sensors in Los Angeles, NEXICA demonstrates superior accuracy and computation speed compared to existing approaches. The core innovation lies in focusing on binary slowdown events rather than raw speed values, using a maximum likelihood method to compute causation probabilities, and leveraging ground truth causal and non-causal pairs for training.

## Method Summary
NEXICA processes Caltrans PeMS 5-minute speed aggregates from 195 highway sensors in Los Angeles. The algorithm first computes a "median week" baseline for each sensor, then identifies slowdown events when speed drops below a threshold (α) of this baseline. Crucially, it retains only the leading edge of each slowdown, converting continuous speed time-series into binary events. For each pair of sensors, NEXICA calculates correspondence counts (A_{00}, A_{01}, A_{10}, A_{11}) at various lags, then computes a causation probability (p_c) using maximum likelihood estimation. A random forest classifier is trained on these counts and probabilities, using ground truth pairs selected based on geographic proximity and drive time constraints.

## Key Results
- Best classifier using correspondence counts achieved near-perfect accuracy (AUC of 0.9995) on balanced ground truth data
- NEXICA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed
- The method demonstrates robustness to unbalanced training sets
- Superior performance achieved using Random Forest on correspondence counts compared to using MLE probability alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Leading-Edge Event Abstraction
Converting continuous speed time-series into binary "leading edge" events isolates causal signals by removing periodic noise and magnitude variance. The system computes a "median week" baseline and identifies slowdowns when speed drops below α of this baseline, retaining only the first timestamp of the slowdown. This focuses on the initiation of slowdowns as the independent variable carrying causal weight, while duration is treated as noise.

### Mechanism 2: Maximum Likelihood Causality (p_c)
A closed-form Maximum Likelihood Estimation solution enables efficient computation of causal probability between binary event streams without iterative optimization. The algorithm maps event streams to a 2x2 contingency table representing co-occurrence at specific lags, then analytically solves for p_c (probability of causation) and p_s (probability of spontaneous events) by maximizing log-likelihood.

### Mechanism 3: Supervised Topology Classification
Training a Random Forest classifier on "obvious" causal pairs derived from geographic constraints yields higher accuracy than unsupervised statistical thresholds. The system constructs training data where positive pairs are sensors on the same road/direction within drive-time limits, and negative pairs are sensors with long drive times, learning complex decision boundaries from correspondence counts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Granger Causality**: NEXICA addresses limitations of Granger causality in traffic data. Granger relies on linear regression on raw values, while NEXICA uses binary events and MLE for non-linear traffic patterns. *Quick check:* Why would linear regression on raw speed values fail to detect a causal relationship between a sudden lane closure and a downstream slowdown 20 minutes later?

- **Time-Lagged Correlation vs. Causality**: NEXICA shifts time series (lagging) to compute A_{ij} counts, distinguishing between "A happens before B" and "A causes B". The median week baseline prevents daily rush hour co-occurrence from being classified as causal. *Quick check:* If two sensors both show slowdowns at 8:00 AM daily due to rush hour, how does the "median week" baseline prevent this from being classified as a causal link from A to B?

- **Spatiotemporal Contiguity**: Ground truth generation relies on physics of traffic: effects must happen after causes (temporal) and upstream (spatial). Sensors on opposite directions are labeled negative despite proximity. *Quick check:* Why does the algorithm label a sensor pair as "Negative" if they are on the same highway but in opposite directions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Source (PeMS) -> Pre-processor (Median Week baseline) -> Event Encoder (binary slowdown events) -> Lag Engine (time shifting) -> Set Arithmetic (A_{ij} counts) -> Inference Core (MLE p_c and Random Forest) -> Ground Truth Builder (Bing Maps API)

- **Critical path**: Event Encoder -> Set Arithmetic -> Random Forest. The efficiency of set intersection operation dictates system scalability.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Median Week chosen for speed and simplicity over LSTM predictors, trading granular prediction accuracy for computational tractability across 195 sensors. MLE provides interpretable probability but is outperformed by Random Forest using raw counts.

- **Failure signatures**: High station dropout rate or suspiciously low event counts indicate imputation artifacts. Unstable MLE occurs when A_{10} or A_{01} are zero. Topological violations occur if "Negative" pairs contain complex indirect causal paths.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Vary anomaly threshold α (0.05 to 0.25) and lag tolerance τ to verify leading edge detection. 2) Reproduce "Balanced Scalar Threshold" test comparing NEXICA's p_c against Granger Causality F-scores. 3) Retrain Random Forest removing one correspondence count at a time to verify A_{01} and A_{10} are most powerful features.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalizing to causal graphs**: Can the pairwise probabilistic model be extended to infer a comprehensive causal graph with multiple concurrent edges and signal nodes? The current algorithm computes causality probabilities for independent pairs, ignoring complex network effects where slowdowns might propagate through multiple intermediate nodes simultaneously.

- **External ground truth integration**: Does incorporating external ground truth like police accident reports improve the model's ability to distinguish spontaneous slowdowns from propagated ones? The current method identifies spontaneous events solely through statistical deviation, which may misclassify unmodeled latent variables as spontaneous noise.

- **Urban road robustness**: Is NEXICA robust to data sparsity and signal noise typical of arterial roads or regions with fewer sensors? The current study is limited to mainline highway sensors with high data completeness, and it's unclear if the median-week prediction model works without 90%+ data completeness.

## Limitations

- The binary "leading edge" event abstraction may fail to capture true causal signals if downstream slowdowns are initiated by gradual build-up rather than sudden leading edges.
- The MLE derivation assumes statistical independence and bounded lags that may not hold for complex traffic dynamics.
- Ground truth selection by drive time embeds the assumption that proximity equals causality, which may break down with traffic rerouting or "rubbernecking" across medians.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core algorithm implementation (MLE computation, set arithmetic, Random Forest training) is mathematically sound and reproducible given PeMS data.
- **Medium Confidence**: Superiority claims over baselines (AUC 0.9995) are robust for tested dataset, but generalizability to other cities or traffic patterns is uncertain.
- **Low Confidence**: Selection of "obvious" ground truth pairs is inherently heuristic and may not generalize beyond LA highway network.

## Next Checks

1. **Edge Case Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the anomaly threshold α (0.1 to 0.4) and lag tolerance τ to find breaking points where classifier performance degrades, testing robustness of "leading edge" abstraction.

2. **Alternative Ground Truth**: Recreate training set using different method for selecting negative pairs (e.g., ensure they're on different highways entirely) to check if high accuracy is robust to heuristic selection.

3. **Cross-City Validation**: Apply exact NEXICA pipeline to different city's PeMS data (e.g., San Francisco or Seattle) to assess whether performance is specific to Los Angeles highway network or represents general solution.
