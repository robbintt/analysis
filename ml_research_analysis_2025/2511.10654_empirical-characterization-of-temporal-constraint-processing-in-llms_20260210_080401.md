# Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654
- Authors: Javier Marín
- Reference count: 33
- Models achieving perfect accuracy under conversational prompts show extreme brittleness, dropping 25-62 percentage points under reformulated prompts with identical semantic content.

## Executive Summary
This paper empirically characterizes temporal constraint processing in large language models, revealing systematic deployment risks. Testing eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) on deadline detection tasks, the author finds a bimodal performance distribution: models achieve either >95% or <50% accuracy with no correlation to parameter count. Models achieving perfect accuracy under conversational prompts show extreme brittleness, dropping 25-62 percentage points under reformulated prompts with identical semantic content. Failing models exhibit 100% false positive rates, always recommending action regardless of temporal validity. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. The results demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, requiring explicit architectural mechanisms for continuous temporal state representation and constraint checking.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates eight 2.8-8B parameter models on deadline detection tasks using conversational and structured prompt formats. Models are tested on 8 scenarios (4 open window, 4 closed window) spanning emergency response, medical, financial, and project management domains. Binary accuracy, closed window accuracy, and false positive rates are computed. For models showing 25-65% baseline capability, LoRA fine-tuning (rank=16, alpha=32) is applied on 200 synthetic examples across 5 domains. Response generation uses temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_new_tokens=200, with 8-bit quantization for efficiency.

## Key Results
- Models show bimodal performance distribution (>95% or <50% accuracy) with no correlation to parameter count in 2.8-8B range
- Models achieving 100% accuracy under conversational prompts drop 25-62 percentage points under reformulated prompts with identical semantic content
- Failing models exhibit 100% false positive rates, always recommending action regardless of temporal validity
- Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Training Distribution Dominates Scale for Temporal Processing
- Claim: Temporal constraint processing capability in 2.8-8B models depends primarily on pretraining corpus composition, not parameter count.
- Mechanism: Models exposed to sufficient "temporal window closure" examples (where correct response is "too late") learn pattern matching for specific linguistic formulations. Models lacking this exposure learn unconditional action heuristics.
- Core assumption: The bimodal distribution with zero scale correlation implies data distribution effects dominate architectural capacity in this range.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range—a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely." [Section 5.2] "Performance is bimodal, violates monotonicity (larger models sometimes perform worse), and shows no correlation with parameter count in 3-8B range."

### Mechanism 2: Surface Pattern Matching Without Compositional Generalization
- Claim: High accuracy under specific prompt formats reflects linguistic pattern matching, not robust temporal constraint checking.
- Mechanism: Models learn statistical associations between temporal expressions and responses in training data. When prompt structure changes while preserving semantic content, these associations break—indicating models didn't learn the underlying relational computation.
- Core assumption: Robust temporal reasoning should be invariant to formatting variations preserving semantic meaning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point accuracy drops from formatting changes alone)." [Section 4.2, Table 2] "Models achieving 100% accuracy under conversational prompts drop 25-62 percentage points under reformulated prompts with identical semantic content."

### Mechanism 3: Fine-Tuning Remediation via Cross-Domain Integration Signal
- Claim: Models with partial baseline capability (25-65%) can improve 12-37 percentage points with 200 diverse temporal examples.
- Mechanism: These models learned some temporal patterns during pretraining but lacked sufficient diversity for reliable generalization. Targeted fine-tuning provides integration signal connecting temporal reasoning across domains, improving generalization under structured conditions.
- Core assumption: Improvement reflects better generalization rather than memorization of test distribution.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Targeted fine-tuning on 200 diverse examples...improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points." [Section 4.4, Table 3] Four models improved; Llama-3.1 showed +37.5pp gain from 25% baseline.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Allen's Interval Algebra**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames deadline detection as testing specific temporal relations (before, during, overlaps). Understanding these primitives clarifies what "temporal reasoning" means operationally.
  - Quick check question: Can you name three of the thirteen primitive temporal interval relations?

- Concept: **Compositional Generalization**
  - Why needed here: The paper connects prompt brittleness to failures in systematic recombination—applying learned primitives to novel configurations.
  - Quick check question: Why would a model that correctly answers "deadline passed?" fail on "has the window closed?" with identical semantics?

- Concept: **Autoregressive Token Prediction Limitations**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues discrete tokens cannot naturally represent continuous temporal state, and next-token prediction doesn't encourage constraint satisfaction.
  - Quick check question: What type of computation would be needed to maintain "elapsed time" as a continuous variable?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Test scenarios: 8 deadline detection tasks (4 open window, 4 closed window) with explicit temporal information
  - Evaluation pipeline: Response generation → answer extraction → accuracy/FPR calculation
  - Fine-tuning module: LoRA (rank=16, alpha=32) on attention projections with 200 synthetic examples across 5 domains
  - Failure mode detector: Check for 100% false positive rates indicating action bias

- Critical path:
  1. Establish baseline accuracy on conversational prompts
  2. Re-test with structured prompts to surface brittleness
  3. Calculate false positive rate on closed-window scenarios
  4. If baseline 25-65%: apply targeted fine-tuning and re-evaluate

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Conversational vs. structured prompts: Conversational may show higher accuracy but masks brittleness; structured reveals robustness gaps
  - LoRA aggressiveness: Higher rank/alpha may cause catastrophic forgetting in smaller models (Phi-3 degraded -25pp)
  - Training data balance: 50/50 open/closed windows prevents response bias but requires synthetic generation

- Failure signatures:
  - 100% false positive rate = systematic action bias (always recommends action)
  - >30pp accuracy drop between prompt formats = brittle pattern matching
  - Degradation after fine-tuning = catastrophic forgetting (reduce LoRA rank)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run all 8 scenarios under conversational prompts; flag any model with <50% accuracy as failing
  2. Re-run passing models with structured prompts; flag any with >25pp accuracy drop as brittle
  3. For models with 25-65% baseline, apply 200-example fine-tuning and measure delta; expect +12-37pp if mechanism holds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Which of the 13 Allen temporal relations are learnable through next-token prediction, and which require explicit architectural support?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1 states: "future work should systematically evaluate all 13 Allen relations to characterize which temporal reasoning components are learnable via token prediction versus requiring architectural support."
- Why unresolved: This study only tested implicit `before` and `during`/`overlaps` relations through deadline detection tasks. Complex relations like `starts`, `finishes`, and their compositions remain uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across all 13 Allen interval relations with controlled test scenarios for each relation type.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do findings generalize to models beyond the 2.8-8B parameter range?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6 explicitly acknowledges: "Limited parameter range. We tested 2.8-8B models only. Much larger models (70B+) might show different patterns."
- Why unresolved: The bimodal distribution and lack of scale correlation were only tested in a narrow parameter range used for practical deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the same evaluation protocol on 70B+ parameter models to determine if bimodal patterns persist or if emergent temporal processing appears.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What internal representations do models develop for temporal constraints—do they encode continuous temporal state or just surface linguistic patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6 acknowledges: "No mechanistic analysis. We document behavioral patterns without explaining internal representations or computational mechanisms."
- Why unresolved: Behavioral evaluation cannot distinguish between models that learn genuine temporal state representation versus sophisticated pattern matching over temporal language.
- What evidence would resolve it: Probing studies or mechanistic interpretability analysis examining whether models maintain continuous temporal representations when processing deadline scenarios.

## Limitations

- Limited parameter range tested (2.8-8B) with no evaluation of whether findings generalize to larger models
- Only two prompt format variations tested, leaving unclear whether brittleness is fundamental or format-specific
- No mechanistic analysis of internal representations or computational mechanisms used by models

## Confidence

- High confidence: The bimodal performance distribution finding (models achieve either >95% or <50% accuracy with no correlation to parameter count) is well-supported by the experimental results across eight models spanning 2.8-8B parameters.
- Medium confidence: The conclusion that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction alone is plausible but extrapolates from a limited range of model sizes and task types.
- Low confidence: The specific claim that "explicit architectural mechanisms for continuous temporal state representation and constraint checking" are required remains speculative without empirical validation of alternative architectures.

## Next Checks

1. Test the same models across 5-10 semantically-equivalent prompt variations to establish whether brittleness is specific to tested formats or represents a general pattern-matching limitation.
2. Evaluate 70B+ parameter models to determine if scale eventually overcomes the data-distribution dominance observed in 2.8-8B range.
3. Implement a hybrid architecture combining LLM with symbolic temporal reasoning module and test whether this hybrid outperforms fine-tuning alone on novel temporal scenarios not seen during training.
