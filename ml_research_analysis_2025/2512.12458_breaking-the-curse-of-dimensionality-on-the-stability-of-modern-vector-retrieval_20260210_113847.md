# Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: On the Stability of Modern Vector Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12458
- Reference count: 40
- Establishes stability theory for modern vector retrieval tasks circumventing the curse of dimensionality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of stability in modern vector retrieval systems that aim to overcome the curse of dimensionality. The authors formalize three practical settings—multi-vector search, filtered vector search, and sparse vector search—and prove conditions under which these approaches maintain stability. The work provides theoretical foundations and experimental validation for understanding when and why these modern retrieval techniques work reliably, offering actionable guidance for system designers and model developers.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a formal framework for analyzing stability in vector retrieval tasks, focusing on three modern approaches that circumvent traditional dimensionality limitations. For multi-vector search, the authors prove that Chamfer distance-based methods are stable when the underlying single-vector search is strongly stable and document sets are non-degenerate. Filtered vector search stability is established by showing that sufficiently large penalty values for filter mismatches guarantee stability even when base vector search is unstable. For sparse vector search, the paper introduces concentration and overlap of importance properties, proving these together imply stability. The theoretical results are validated through synthetic experiments and real-world dataset evaluations.

## Key Results
- Multi-vector search with Chamfer distance is stable if induced single-vector search is strongly stable and document sets are non-degenerate
- Filtered search achieves stability with sufficiently large penalty values for filter mismatches, regardless of base search stability
- Sparse vector search is stable when concentration and overlap of importance properties hold together

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stability mechanisms work by establishing mathematical conditions that prevent small perturbations in input vectors from causing large changes in retrieval results. For multi-vector search, stability is maintained by ensuring the Chamfer distance between query and document representations changes predictably under perturbations. In filtered search, stability emerges from penalty values that dominate the distance metric when filter conditions are violated, creating a stable decision boundary. Sparse vector search stability relies on the concentration of importance across vector dimensions and the overlap of important dimensions between similar documents, creating redundancy that dampens the effect of individual dimension perturbations.

## Foundational Learning

**Chamfer Distance**
- Why needed: Provides a way to measure similarity between sets of vectors in multi-vector search
- Quick check: Verify that distance between sets is the average minimum distance from each query vector to document vectors

**Stability Theory**
- Why needed: Establishes theoretical guarantees that small input changes won't cause large output changes
- Quick check: Test if retrieval results remain consistent under small perturbations of input vectors

**Importance Concentration**
- Why needed: Ensures retrieval decisions depend on a consistent subset of vector dimensions
- Quick check: Verify that a small subset of dimensions accounts for most of the similarity score

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Query -> Multi-vector Representation -> Chamfer Distance Calculation -> Similarity Score
Query + Filter -> Vector + Filter Distance -> Weighted Sum -> Final Score
Query Sparse Vector -> Importance Weights -> Dimension Selection -> Similarity Calculation

**Critical Path**
The most critical path is in multi-vector search: document set construction → vector decomposition → Chamfer distance computation → ranking. This path determines overall system stability and must be optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Multi-vector search: More vectors per document increases representation power but computational cost
- Filtered search: Higher penalty values increase stability but may reduce precision for borderline cases
- Sparse search: Higher sparsity improves efficiency but requires careful dimension selection

**Failure Signatures**
- Multi-vector: Instability when document sets have highly similar vector distributions
- Filtered: Poor performance when penalty values are too low or too high relative to filter distribution
- Sparse: Failure when importance concentration is too weak or overlap too limited

**First Experiments**
1. Measure stability under controlled perturbations for each retrieval method
2. Compare retrieval accuracy across different penalty value settings in filtered search
3. Analyze importance concentration and overlap metrics in sparse vector representations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions may not hold in practice, particularly regarding non-degenerate document sets
- Penalty value thresholds for filtered search may be overly conservative, leading to unnecessary computational overhead
- Practical verification of concentration and overlap properties in real-world deployments remains challenging

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties and Limitations**
- Theoretical framework assumes ideal conditions that may not hold in practice
- Penalty value thresholds may be overly conservative
- Verification of sparse vector properties is difficult in real deployments

**Confidence Assessment**
- Multi-vector search stability: High confidence
- Filtered search stability: Medium confidence
- Sparse vector search properties: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies measuring actual penalty values required for stability in filtered search across diverse real-world datasets to validate theoretical thresholds.

2. Develop and test automated methods for verifying concentration and overlap of importance in sparse vector models during training.

3. Perform end-to-end latency and computational efficiency benchmarks comparing stable versus unstable configurations in production-like environments.
