# LLM-Assisted Emergency Triage Benchmark: Bridging Hospital-Rich and MCI-Like Field Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26351
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-assisted triage benchmark harmonizes MIMIC-IV-ED data into hospital-rich and MCI-like regimes, with random forest achieving AUROC=0.73 (hospital) and AUROC=0.79 (MCI-like).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an open benchmark for emergency triage prediction that bridges hospital-rich and MCI-like field simulation regimes using LLM-assisted feature harmonization. The authors processed MIMIC-IV-ED with LLM guidance to harmonize noisy clinical features and align schemas across tables. The benchmark defines two distinct feature regimes to support both traditional hospital settings and mass casualty incident scenarios. Baseline models were evaluated, with random forest showing the strongest performance across both settings, and SHAP analyses revealing triage acuity and respiratory measures as top predictors.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an LLM-assisted pipeline to process MIMIC-IV-ED data, harmonizing noisy clinical features such as AVPU scores and respiratory support indicators while prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs. The benchmark defines two feature regimes: hospital-rich (including vitals, labs, observations, and notes) and MCI-like (vitals, observations, and notes only). Baseline models including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained and evaluated on both regimes, with random forest achieving the best performance metrics.

## Key Results
- Random forest achieved AUROC=0.73 and F1=0.35 in the hospital-rich feature regime
- Random forest achieved AUROC=0.79 and F1=0.56 in the MCI-like feature regime
- SHAP analyses identified triage acuity and respiratory measures as the most important predictors
- The pipeline successfully lowers technical barriers for triage prediction research and supports reproducible benchmarking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-assisted approach works by leveraging large language models to automate the harmonization of heterogeneous clinical data features, reducing manual effort and potential inconsistencies in schema alignment. By creating two distinct feature regimes, the benchmark enables evaluation of triage prediction models in both resource-rich hospital environments and resource-constrained MCI scenarios, providing flexibility for different deployment contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feature Harmonization**: Standardizing heterogeneous clinical data elements (why needed: to enable consistent model training; quick check: verify consistent mappings across similar features)
- **Schema Alignment**: Coordinating data structure across multiple tables (why needed: to enable unified feature access; quick check: confirm all referenced columns exist and match types)
- **Feature Selection Prioritization**: Identifying clinically relevant vitals and labs (why needed: to focus on actionable predictors; quick check: review selected features with clinical expert)
- **Regime Differentiation**: Separating hospital-rich and MCI-like feature sets (why needed: to match deployment constraints; quick check: count features in each regime)
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Using AUROC and F1 for triage prediction (why needed: to assess both discrimination and classification balance; quick check: confirm metric calculations match definitions)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MIMIC-IV-ED data -> LLM harmonization -> Feature regime split -> Model training -> SHAP analysis

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing with LLM -> Feature regime definition -> Model training and evaluation -> Interpretability analysis with SHAP

**Design Tradeoffs**: LLM-assisted harmonization trades manual accuracy for automation speed and consistency; two-feature regime approach trades completeness for deployment flexibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate incomplete feature harmonization, missing critical clinical variables, or inappropriate model selection for the feature regime complexity.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Replicate baseline model training on the hospital-rich regime with random forest
2. Train logistic regression on the MCI-like regime to establish lower performance bounds
3. Apply SHAP analysis to identify top predictors in both feature regimes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Feature harmonization reliability is uncertain without independent validation against clinician-verified gold standards
- Generalizability across different EDs and MCI environments is unclear due to single-dataset evaluation
- Missing outcome labels prevent assessment of clinical relevance for reported performance metrics

## Confidence
- Benchmark Construction and Feature Regimes: High
- Model Performance Metrics: Medium
- SHAP Analysis Interpretability: High

## Next Checks
1. Have a clinician or domain expert independently verify a sample of LLM-processed features against original clinical records to assess mapping accuracy and identify potential systematic errors.
2. Evaluate the benchmark models on at least one external ED dataset with similar feature sets to quantify performance degradation and assess generalizability.
3. Confirm the exact outcome being predicted and conduct a clinician review to ensure that the top SHAP-identified features are clinically meaningful for that outcome in both hospital and MCI contexts.
