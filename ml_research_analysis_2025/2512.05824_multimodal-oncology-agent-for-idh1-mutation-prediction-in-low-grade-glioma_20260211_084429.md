# Multimodal Oncology Agent for IDH1 Mutation Prediction in Low-Grade Glioma

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.05824
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05824
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** MOA with histology integration achieved F1-score of 0.912 for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) that combines a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model with reasoning over clinical, genomic, and biomedical literature sources for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma. The agent was evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort using a quantitative framework measuring mutation-related information in generated reports. MOA without histology achieved an F1-score of 0.826, outperforming clinical baselines (0.798-0.789). When combined with histology features, MOA reached an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology-only baseline (0.894) and fused histology-clinical baseline (0.897).

## Method Summary
The Multimodal Oncology Agent integrates a TITAN-based histology tool with a reasoning framework that queries external biomedical knowledge sources. The agent processes patient data through sequential tool selection, where it reasons about which information sources to query based on available clinical and genomic data. The system generates reports that are evaluated using a framework measuring mutation-related information content. The approach allows the agent to adapt tool selection when clinical data is missing, demonstrating flexibility for real-world clinical applications with incomplete patient records.

## Key Results
- MOA without histology integration achieved F1-score of 0.826, outperforming clinical baselines (0.798-0.789)
- MOA with histology integration achieved F1-score of 0.912, exceeding histology-only baseline (0.894) and fused baseline (0.897)
- The agent demonstrated capability to handle missing clinical data by adapting tool selection strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MOA framework works by integrating multimodal data sources through sequential reasoning rather than joint end-to-end learning. The TITAN foundation model processes histology images while the reasoning component queries clinical, genomic, and biomedical literature sources to enrich the information available for mutation prediction. This sequential approach allows the agent to adapt its tool selection based on data availability, potentially capturing complementary information that single-modality or simple fusion approaches might miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **TITAN foundation model for histology analysis**: Why needed - to extract meaningful features from whole-slide images; Quick check - verify transfer learning performance on LGG histology
- **Biomedical literature reasoning**: Why needed - to incorporate latest research findings; Quick check - validate information retrieval accuracy from sources
- **Sequential tool selection**: Why needed - to handle missing data gracefully; Quick check - test adaptation when clinical features are removed
- **Mutation-related information quantification**: Why needed - to evaluate reasoning quality objectively; Quick check - ensure metric correlates with prediction accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: TITAN histology tool -> Clinical data processor -> Genomic data processor -> Literature reasoning module -> Report generator

Critical Path: Patient data input → Tool selection reasoning → Individual tool processing → Information synthesis → Report generation → Mutation prediction

Design Tradeoffs: Sequential reasoning provides flexibility for missing data but may introduce computational overhead and error propagation compared to joint end-to-end learning approaches.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance when critical clinical features are missing, degradation when literature sources are outdated, potential compounding errors from sequential processing.

First Experiments:
1. Compare MOA against true multimodal baseline with joint histology-clinical feature learning
2. Perform ablation studies removing each biomedical knowledge source individually
3. Test MOA performance with 30-50% clinical data missing to validate adaptability claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sequential reasoning approach may introduce computational overhead and compounding errors compared to joint end-to-end learning
- Claims about external knowledge enrichment lack ablation studies demonstrating specific source contributions
- Missing data handling mechanism is not fully specified, making robustness assessment difficult

## Confidence

**MOA's standalone clinical performance (F1=0.826): High** - well-validated against clear baselines
**Performance improvement with histology integration (F1=0.912): Medium** - comparison to appropriate multimodal baselines needed
**Claims about external knowledge enrichment: Low** - lacks source attribution and ablation evidence
**Missing data handling capabilities: Medium** - mechanism not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Compare MOA against a true multimodal baseline that jointly processes histology and clinical features end-to-end, rather than through sequential reasoning
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of each external biomedical knowledge source to prediction performance
3. Test MOA on a dataset with realistic rates of missing clinical data (30-50%) to validate the claimed adaptability in challenging clinical scenarios
