# TURA: Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.04604
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04604
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** TURA improved session success rate by 8.9% and reduced critical failures by 16.7% versus a strong LLM+RAG baseline in production.

## Executive Summary
TURA introduces an agentic framework that bridges static RAG and dynamic data sources for AI search. It features intent-aware retrieval to decompose queries and select tools, DAG-based planning for parallel execution, and a distilled executor for low-latency performance. In large-scale production deployment, TURA improved session success rate by 8.9% and reduced critical failures by 16.7% versus a strong LLM+RAG baseline. Answer accuracy reached 87.5% (vs. 65.3%) and faithfulness 96.2% (vs. 72.4%). Agent distillation achieved 88.3% accuracy at 750ms latency, outperforming the 82.4% teacher model. TURA demonstrates a production-proven blueprint for robust, real-time AI search integrating heterogeneous information sources.

## Method Summary
TURA's architecture separates query understanding, tool retrieval, planning, and execution. The Intent-Aware Retrieval module decomposes complex queries into atomic sub-intents, which are matched against a semantically augmented index of tool descriptions (MCP Servers) using dense retrieval. A DAG-based Task Planner analyzes dependencies between sub-tasks to identify parallelizable operations, constructing an optimal execution plan. The distilled Executor, a smaller model trained via "train-with-thought, infer-without-thought," executes the specific tool calls defined in the DAG with minimal latency. The system was trained on expert trajectories generated by a large teacher model, with automated filtering for correctness and efficiency, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small student model.

## Key Results
- Improved session success rate by 8.9% and reduced critical failures by 16.7% in production
- Answer accuracy reached 87.5% (vs. 65.3%) and faithfulness 96.2% (vs. 72.4%)
- Distilled 4B model achieved 88.3% accuracy at 750ms latency, outperforming 82.4% teacher at 8700ms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intent Decomposition for Heterogeneous Tool Selection
TURA improves retrieval accuracy for complex queries by breaking them into atomic sub-intents before matching against tools. A large LLM decomposes a multi-faceted query (e.g., "plan a trip") into distinct sub-queries (e.g., "get weather," "book hotel"). These are matched against a semantically augmented index of tool descriptions (MCP Servers) using dense retrieval. This bridges the "lexical gap" between user vernacular and formal API definitions.

### Mechanism 2: DAG-based Planning for Latency Optimization
Modeling task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) reduces end-to-end latency by identifying and parallelizing independent operations. A Task Planner analyzes dependencies between sub-tasks. If Sub-task A (Get Weather) and Sub-task B (Get Hotel List) do not depend on each other's output, the system executes them in parallel. Only dependent tasks wait.

### Mechanism 3: "Train-with-Thought, Infer-without-Thought" Distillation
Distilling a large teacher model into a smaller student model using mixed-rationale data preserves reasoning capability while drastically cutting inference time. A small model (Qwen3-4B) is fine-tuned on trajectories that include "thought" processes alongside actions. During deployment, the model outputs only the action, skipping the explicit generation of the rationale text.

## Foundational Learning

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
  - **Why needed:** TURA treats external data sources (APIs, databases) as standardized "MCP Servers." Understanding MCP is essential to grasp how TURA standardizes dynamic tool access.
  - **Quick check:** How does wrapping a database query in an MCP Server differ from calling a standard REST API in terms of discoverability for an LLM?

- **Dense Retrieval vs. Lexical Search**
  - **Why needed:** TURA retrieves tools using vector embeddings, not keywords. Engineers need to understand that tools are matched by "semantic intent" rather than exact string matching.
  - **Quick check:** Why would a dense retrieval approach be necessary to connect the query "find a place to sleep" to a tool named `book_hostel_api`?

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Computation**
  - **Why needed:** The system optimizes for speed by structuring tasks as a DAG. Understanding topological sorting is required to debug why certain tasks run in parallel while others wait.
  - **Quick check:** In a DAG of [Get Weather] -> [Suggest Outfit], can [Suggest Outfit] execute before [Get Weather] finishes? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Query -> Intent-Aware Retrieval -> DAG-based Task Planner -> Distilled Executor -> MCP Servers -> Final Answer

- **Critical path:**
  1. User Query enters Intent-Aware Retrieval
  2. Query is decomposed into sub-queries
  3. Retriever matches sub-queries to MCP Servers
  4. Planner constructs a DAG based on dependencies
  5. Executor runs independent DAG nodes in parallel, calling tools via MCP
  6. Results are synthesized into the final answer

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Intelligence:** The architecture reserves the "smartest" (and slowest) model for planning only. The execution is offloaded to a smaller, distilled model to ensure the total response time stays under ~1s.
  - **Recall vs. Noise:** The system generates synthetic queries to augment tool descriptions (index augmentation). This improves recall (finding the right tool) but risks introducing noise if the synthetic queries drift from actual tool capabilities.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Runaway Latency:** Likely caused by the Planner failing to identify dependencies, forcing sequential execution of tasks that could have been parallel.
  - **Tool Hallucination:** The Distilled Executor attempting to call parameters that don't exist because it skipped the reasoning step on a novel/unseen query type.
  - **Retrieval Miss:** The Intent Decomposer splitting a query too finely, losing the context needed to select the correct tool.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Retrieval Ablation:** Run a set of complex queries with "Index Augmentation" turned off. Measure the drop in tool selection accuracy to validate the semantic indexing mechanism.
  2. **Latency Stress Test:** Submit a query requiring 5 independent tools. Compare the P50/P90 latency of the DAG Planner vs. a forced Sequential Planner to quantify the parallelism speedup.
  3. **Distillation Fidelity:** Compare the Executor's success rate on a held-out test set when "thought generation" is forced ON vs. forced OFF to check for reasoning degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does the Distilled Agent Executor maintain high performance on tools and APIs entirely unseen during the distillation training process?
  - **Basis:** Section 4.3.1 describes training on "representative sub-tasks" but does not evaluate zero-shot generalization capabilities.
  - **Why unresolved:** Fine-tuning on expert trajectories typically optimizes for the specific tool distribution in the training set, potentially creating a system that is brittle when facing novel APIs.
  - **Evidence:** Evaluation of the distilled 4B model on a hold-out set of newly introduced MCP Servers not present in the fine-tuning data.

- **Open Question 2:** What specific failure modes of the large-scale teacher model (Deepseek-V3) are eliminated by the distillation process, allowing the student to outperform it?
  - **Basis:** Table 7 shows the Qwen3-4B Distilled model (88.3%) outperforms the Deepseek-V3 teacher (82.4%).
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper attributes this to "crystallizing optimal reasoning paths" but does not analyze if the teacher failed due to over-reasoning, formatting issues, or latency constraints that the student avoided.
  - **Evidence:** A comparative error analysis of execution trajectories where the teacher failed but the student succeeded.

- **Open Question 3:** How does the Intent-Aware Retrieval module's latency and recall scale as the number of available MCP Servers grows by orders of magnitude?
  - **Basis:** Section 4.1 introduces the retrieval module for a "global pool," but the experimental evaluation (Section 5) is limited to the fixed MCP-Bench dataset.
  - **Why unresolved:** The "lexical gap" and retrieval noise may increase significantly with a larger tool universe, potentially requiring hierarchical retrieval strategies not discussed in the current architecture.
  - **Evidence:** Retrieval performance metrics (Recall@k, Latency) plotted against an increasing index size (e.g., 100 vs. 10,000 servers).

## Limitations

- Real-world generalizability is uncertain due to the proprietary nature of the MCP-Bench dataset and specific MCP Servers used
- The 8.9% improvement in session success rate lacks ablation studies isolating the contribution of each mechanism
- The trade-off between synthetic query augmentation and potential semantic drift is not quantified

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The distillation mechanism ("train-with-thought, infer-without-thought") is well-supported by the ablation showing 88.3% accuracy at 750ms latency versus the 82.4% teacher at 8700ms.
- **Medium confidence:** The intent-aware retrieval and DAG planning mechanisms are plausible and supported by literature, but their isolated impact is not rigorously proven.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about production deployment are difficult to verify without access to the MCP-Bench dataset or the specific judge models used for data curation.

## Next Checks

1. **Isolated ablation test:** Disable the synthetic query augmentation and measure the drop in tool retrieval accuracy to quantify the benefit and risk of the semantic indexing mechanism.
2. **Latency decomposition:** Submit a query requiring multiple independent tools and compare the P50/P90 latency of the DAG Planner versus a forced Sequential Planner to isolate the parallelism speedup.
3. **Distillation stress test:** Compare the Executor's success rate on a held-out test set when "thought generation" is forced ON versus forced OFF to detect any reasoning degradation in the distilled model.
