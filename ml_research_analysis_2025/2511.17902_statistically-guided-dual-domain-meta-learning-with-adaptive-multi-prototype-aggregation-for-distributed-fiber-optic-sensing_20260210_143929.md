## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing activities in Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) under cross-deployment conditions, where significant domain shifts, scarce labels at new sites, and limited within-class coverage hinder reliable recognition. To tackle these issues, the authors propose DUPLE, a prototype-based meta-learning framework that leverages complementary time- and frequency-domain features and adapts class representations to sample-specific statistics. DUPLE introduces a dual-domain learner that constructs multi-prototype class representations to capture intra-class heterogeneity, a lightweight statistical guidance network (SGN) that estimates the reliability of each domain from raw signal statistics, and a query-adaptive aggregation strategy that selects and combines the most relevant prototypes for each query. Extensive experiments on two real-world cross-deployment benchmarks demonstrate that DUPLE consistently outperforms strong deep learning and meta-learning baselines, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores under label-scarce target deployments. Notably, DUPLE mitigates class-wise worst-case degradation under deployment shifts, leading to more balanced and accurate recognition across all activity categories.

## Method Summary
DUPLE is a prototype-based meta-learning framework for few-shot activity recognition in DFOS under cross-deployment domain shifts. The method processes raw 1D vibration signals and their STFT spectrograms through parallel 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN encoders to extract 128-dimensional embeddings in time and frequency domains. A lightweight SGN network estimates domain-specific reliability weights from 26 statistical features (16 time + 10 frequency domain). Support set embeddings are clustered via K-means to form multi-prototypes per class with adaptive K selection. Query-adaptive attention selects relevant prototypes using a query-specific key vector, and collaborative decision fusion combines cross-domain relations with SGN weights. The model is trained using episodic N-way K-shot training with Leave-One-Deployment-Out (LODO) evaluation protocol.

## Key Results
- DUPLE consistently outperforms strong deep learning and meta-learning baselines in cross-deployment activity recognition
- Achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores under label-scarce target deployments
- Mitigates class-wise worst-case degradation under deployment shifts, leading to more balanced recognition across all activity categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Prototype Representation for Intra-Class Heterogeneity
Using multiple prototypes per class captures diverse patterns within the same activity category across different deployment conditions. Support set embeddings for each class are clustered via K-means with an adaptive K selection criterion that penalizes over-fragmentation. Each cluster centroid becomes a prototype. Classification uses a soft-OR (log-sum-exp) rule over prototype similarities. This works because activity patterns exhibit multi-modal distributions due to deployment-specific factors (coupling, noise, installation method). Break condition: If activity patterns are unimodal within each deployment, additional prototypes add noise and overfit to support set idiosyncrasies.

### Mechanism 2: Statistical Guidance for Domain-Specific Reliability
Raw statistical features can predict which domain (time vs. frequency) is more reliable for each sample. A 26-dimensional statistical vector (16 time-domain: mean, std, kurtosis, etc.; 10 frequency-domain: spectral centroid, rolloff, etc.) is fed to SGN, an MLP that outputs domain importance weights (α_t, α_f) via softmax and prototype sensitivity β via sigmoid. This works because statistical properties like SNR, spectral flatness, and peak density correlate with domain reliability. Break condition: If reliability depends on factors not captured in the 26 features (e.g., fine-grained temporal dynamics), SGN provides misleading priors.

### Mechanism 3: Query-Adaptive Prototype Aggregation
Attending to query-relevant prototypes improves generalization by matching the query's specific characteristics rather than using fixed class representations. A query-specific key vector q_c is formed from SGN guidance and initial logits. Attention weights over prototypes are computed via scaled cosine similarity with temperature τ. Prototypes are aggregated via weighted sum before final classification. This works because different queries benefit from different prototype combinations; not all prototypes within a class are equally relevant. Break condition: If prototype relevance is uniform across queries, attention weights collapse to near-uniform, providing no benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Meta-learning / Few-shot Episodic Training**: Why needed - DUPLE uses episodic N-way K-shot training where each episode simulates a deployment shift. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between support set and query set within a single episode?
- **Prototype-based Metric Learning**: Why needed - Classification relies on distances/similarities between queries and class prototypes. Quick check: How does ProtoNet classify a query sample? (Answer: nearest prototype in embedding space)
- **Domain Shift in DFOS**: Why needed - The problem DUPLE addresses is specifically cross-deployment generalization failure. Quick check: What physical factors cause domain shift in DFOS? (Answer: fiber installation method, coupling conditions, ambient noise, mounting structure)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Raw 1D signal + STFT spectrogram → Parallel encoders → 1D-CNN (time domain), 2D-CNN (frequency domain) → Embeddings → [Support: cluster to prototypes] / [Query: compute similarity + attend] → SGN weights → Fusion → Final logit
- **Critical path:** Signal → Dual encoders → Embeddings → [Support: cluster to prototypes] / [Query: compute similarity + attend] → SGN weights → Fusion → Final logit
- **Design tradeoffs:** Multi-prototype vs. single (better coverage of intra-class diversity but requires sufficient support samples); SGN statistical guidance vs. learned fusion (interpretable but may miss nonlinear patterns); Separate domain encoders vs. shared (preserves domain-specific inductive biases but doubles parameter count)
- **Failure signatures:** SGN outputs near-uniform weights (α_t ≈ 0.5, α_f ≈ 0.5) → guidance not learning; All classes select K=1 → multi-prototype mechanism not activating; Attention weights near-uniform → query-adaptive aggregation providing no discrimination; Per-class accuracy shows mode collapse (e.g., 1DCNN gets 0% on Background/Climb in Table 12)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablation study (replicate Table 10): Remove FPM, SGN, CDM one at a time to isolate each contribution. 2) Per-deployment breakdown (replicate Table 7): Identify which deployment conditions are hardest; check if DUPLE's advantage is consistent or deployment-specific. 3) SGN weight inspection: Visualize α_t, α_f distributions across samples from different deployments to verify SGN is learning deployment-specific priors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Multi-event recognition extension:** The current framework focuses only on single-event scenarios. Extending DUPLE to handle simultaneous or overlapping activities in the signal stream is identified as a logical next step.
- **Multi-channel fusion adaptation:** The current SGN and feature extractors process single-channel data. Generalizing the dual-domain meta-learning strategy to leverage spatial information across multiple fiber sensing channels is proposed for future work.
- **Computational efficiency optimization:** While current latency is sufficient for real-time use, DUPLE has roughly 4x the inference latency and 2x the FLOPs of ProtoNet baselines. Optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy is suggested for deployment on edge computing hardware.

## Limitations
- Encoder architectures are underspecified (layer configurations, hyperparameters)
- SGN MLP dimensions and internal architecture details missing
- Training hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, episode count) not stated
- Performance variance (±15-20%) is high, suggesting instability under deployment shifts
- Multi-prototype mechanism may overfit to support set idiosyncrasies if K is not carefully chosen

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Dual-domain meta-learning framework structure, episodic training protocol, statistical guidance mechanism concept
- **Medium confidence:** Prototype clustering with adaptive K, query-adaptive attention mechanism
- **Low confidence:** Specific hyperparameter choices, SGN implementation details, exact CNN architectures

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study replication:** Remove FPM, SGN, and CDM components individually to quantify each contribution to DUPLE's performance gains
2. **SGN weight distribution analysis:** Visualize domain weights (α_t, α_f) across deployment conditions to verify statistical guidance is learning deployment-specific priors
3. **Per-class prototype diversity check:** Verify multi-prototype K≥2 for classes with known multi-modal distributions; examine if single-prototype collapse occurs for minority classes
