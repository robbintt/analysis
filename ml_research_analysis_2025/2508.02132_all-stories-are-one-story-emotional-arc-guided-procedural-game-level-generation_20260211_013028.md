- Primary result: Integration of emotional arcs into procedural game level generation using LLMs improves narrative coherence and player enjoyment in ARPGs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework that integrates emotional arcs into procedural game level generation by using large language models to create branching story graphs guided by canonical narrative structures (Rise, Fall). Each story node is populated with characters, items, and gameplay attributes, with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional trajectory. Implemented in a prototype ARPG, the system generates levels from high-level user input and aligns narrative pacing with gameplay challenge. Evaluation through user ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc integration significantly enhances enjoyment and narrative coherence, with 81.25% of participants correctly identifying arc-based conditions. The results demonstrate that emotionally structured procedural generation can improve interactive storytelling and player engagement in games.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of three main components: a story graph generator using LLMs to create branching narratives guided by specified emotional arcs (Rise, Fall), a node population system that assigns characters, items, and gameplay attributes to each story node, and a level generation module that translates the story graph into playable game levels. The system takes high-level user input about desired story elements and emotional trajectory, then generates a coherent narrative structure where difficulty and gameplay events align with the emotional arc. The prototype was implemented as an ARPG with fixed combat mechanics, allowing evaluation of how narrative structure affects player experience through user ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis of generated content.

## Key Results
- Emotional arc integration significantly improved player enjoyment ratings compared to control conditions
- 81.25% of participants correctly identified the emotional arc type in their gameplay experience
- Sentiment analysis showed alignment between intended emotional trajectories and actual player experience
- The framework successfully generated coherent story graphs with aligned gameplay difficulty curves

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling narrative as a graph structure where each node represents a story event with associated emotional valence. By constraining the LLM to generate stories following specific emotional trajectories (Rise, Fall), the system creates a scaffold that guides both narrative content and gameplay design. The emotional arc acts as a control signal that influences not just what happens in the story, but how challenging and engaging the gameplay should be at each point. This creates a tight coupling between narrative and gameplay mechanics, where story progression naturally leads to appropriate difficulty scaling. The branching structure allows for player agency while maintaining narrative coherence through the emotional arc constraint.

## Foundational Learning
- **Emotional arc theory**: The concept that stories follow predictable emotional trajectories (why needed: provides the theoretical foundation for constraining narrative generation; quick check: Vonnegut's shape of stories visualization)
- **Story graph representation**: Modeling narratives as directed graphs where nodes are story events and edges are transitions (why needed: enables procedural generation while maintaining narrative coherence; quick check: check if generated graphs have cycles or dead ends)
- **LLM-controlled generation**: Using prompt engineering to guide large language models toward specific narrative structures (why needed: allows generation of coherent stories following emotional arcs; quick check: verify generated stories match intended valence patterns)
- **Gameplay-narrative alignment**: Coupling story progression with gameplay mechanics and difficulty (why needed: creates integrated player experience rather than disconnected narrative; quick check: track difficulty progression against emotional trajectory)
- **Sentiment analysis for validation**: Using NLP tools to measure emotional content in generated text (why needed: provides objective measure of whether emotional arcs are successfully implemented; quick check: run sentiment analysis on sample stories to verify valence patterns)
- **Procedural content generation pipelines**: The architectural approach to combining multiple AI systems for game content creation (why needed: enables complex, integrated generation beyond simple level design; quick check: trace data flow from user input to final game level)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Input -> LLM Story Generator -> Node Population -> Level Generator -> Game Engine

**Critical Path:**
User provides story elements and desired emotional arc → LLM generates branching story graph constrained by arc → Each node populated with characters, items, gameplay attributes → Level generator translates story graph to playable levels with difficulty aligned to emotional trajectory → Game engine renders levels with integrated narrative

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Fixed combat mechanics vs. dynamic gameplay adaptation: Simplified combat allowed focus on narrative generation but limited evaluation of full gameplay integration
- Text-heavy narrative vs. integrated cues: Verbose text effectively conveyed emotion but interrupted gameplay flow, suggesting need for multimodal approaches
- LLM-based generation vs. rule-based systems: LLMs provide more natural narrative but introduce variability and potential inconsistencies

**Failure Signatures:**
- Generated stories that don't follow specified emotional arcs (indicates LLM prompt engineering issues)
- Disconnected story nodes or incoherent narrative transitions (suggests graph generation problems)
- Difficulty curves that don't align with emotional trajectory (indicates node population or level generation errors)
- Players unable to perceive emotional arcs (suggests text-based approach insufficient for emotional communication)

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate stories with different emotional arcs and verify sentiment analysis matches intended patterns
2. Create story graphs with varying branching complexity and test for narrative coherence
3. Map emotional trajectory to difficulty scaling and validate alignment through playtesting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the emotional arc-guided generation framework be effectively generalized to game genres with different structural constraints, such as visual novels or roguelikes?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in Future Work that the framework was evaluated solely within an ARPG template and extending it to visual novels, simulation games, or roguelikes could reveal new constraints.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to the Action RPG genre, which offers a specific balance of story and gameplay that may not translate directly to other formats.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and user evaluation of the framework in genres outside of ARPGs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrating non-verbal emotional signals (audio, visuals, pacing) improve player perceptibility of emotional arcs compared to text-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: The Discussion suggests that future integration should embed cues in gameplay events and audiovisual dynamics to reduce "narrative friction" caused by verbose text.
- Why unresolved: The current system relies heavily on textual narrative to convey emotion, which some users found interruptive to gameplay rhythm.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative user study measuring arc perceptibility and immersion between text-only and multimodal generation conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the generation pipeline be modified to enforce strict monotonic emotional trajectories (steady Rise or Fall) despite the LLM's tendency toward positive affect?
- Basis in paper: The Results section notes that monotonic arc types failed to show directional trends, largely due to a systemic bias in the story generation or classifier toward positive valence.
- Why unresolved: The current model lacks explicit valence supervision, causing "steady Fall" trajectories to fluctuate or remain flat rather than consistently decreasing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generation of strictly monotonic valence curves validated by sentiment analysis, potentially requiring reinforcement learning or constrained decoding.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=16) and narrow demographic (university students, limited gender diversity) limits generalizability
- Prototype limited to ARPG genre, restricting claims about broader applicability to other game types
- Heavy reliance on subjective measures without incorporating objective gameplay metrics like completion times or death counts
- Framework depends on large language models, introducing variability and potential inconsistencies across model versions

## Confidence

High confidence in:
- Technical feasibility of integrating emotional arcs into procedural generation pipelines
- Effectiveness of LLMs for story graph generation
- Ability to align narrative pacing with gameplay difficulty

Medium confidence in:
- Impact of emotional arc guidance on player enjoyment and narrative coherence (given small sample size and subjective evaluation methods)

Low confidence in:
- Framework's applicability to diverse game genres
- Effectiveness across different player demographics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale study with 100+ participants across diverse age groups, gaming experience levels, and cultural backgrounds to test generalizability
2. Implement objective gameplay metrics (completion rates, death counts, time spent per level) alongside subjective measures to validate claimed improvements in engagement and difficulty alignment
3. Test the framework across multiple game genres (platformers, puzzle games, strategy games) to assess its adaptability beyond the ARPG prototype
