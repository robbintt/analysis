# SeqBattNet: A Discrete-State Physics-Informed Neural Network with Aging Adaptation for Battery Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17621
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Discrete-state PINN with aging adaptation achieves superior battery voltage prediction with minimal parameters and single-cell training

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SeqBattNet, a novel battery modeling approach that combines physics-informed neural networks with aging adaptation through a discrete-state framework. The model addresses key limitations of existing battery modeling approaches by requiring only three basic battery parameters while maintaining robust performance across varying discharge profiles and aging states. SeqBattNet employs a two-component architecture with an HRM-GRU encoder for generating cycle-specific aging parameters and a physics-based decoder for terminal voltage prediction. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving lower RMSE values while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
SeqBattNet is a discrete-state Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) designed for lithium-ion battery terminal voltage prediction during discharge. The model employs a two-component architecture: an HRM-GRU encoder that generates cycle-specific aging adaptation parameters and a decoder based on an equivalent circuit model combined with deep learning. The encoder processes sequences of current and voltage to predict parameters including internal resistance, time constant, initial state of charge, state of health, and weighting factors. The decoder uses these parameters with physics-based equations to predict terminal voltage throughout the discharge cycle. The model requires only three basic battery parameters and can be trained on data from a single cell while maintaining robust performance across different operating conditions and aging states.

## Key Results
- Achieves lower RMSE values than classical sequence models and PINN baselines across three benchmark datasets (TRI, RT-Batt, NASA)
- Effectively captures both overall discharge trends and local voltage fluctuations across varying operating conditions
- Requires only three basic battery parameters and can be trained on data from a single cell while maintaining robust performance
- Demonstrates computational efficiency with minimal parameter requirements compared to traditional model-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SeqBattNet works by integrating physics-informed modeling with adaptive neural networks to capture both the underlying electrochemical processes and the evolving battery characteristics due to aging. The discrete-state framework allows the model to handle the sequential nature of battery discharge while maintaining physical consistency through the equivalent circuit model. The HRM-GRU encoder adapts to aging by generating cycle-specific parameters that reflect the current state of the battery, enabling the model to adjust its predictions based on degradation patterns. This combination of physics-based constraints and data-driven adaptation allows the model to generalize effectively across different discharge profiles and aging states while requiring minimal prior knowledge about the specific battery chemistry.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: HRM-GRU Encoder -> Parameter Prediction -> Physics Decoder -> Voltage Prediction

**Critical Path**: Input sequence (I, V) → HRM-GRU encoder → [R₀, τ, SOC₀, SOH, w] parameters → Physics decoder with ECM → Terminal voltage output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades parameter count for physical interpretability and aging adaptation. While traditional PINNs may require extensive parameter tuning and domain knowledge, SeqBattNet minimizes this through its adaptive encoding mechanism. The discrete-state approach balances computational efficiency with modeling accuracy, though it introduces complexity in the encoder's micro-update logic. The weighted loss function prioritizes final timestep accuracy but may create training instability if not properly tuned.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor SOC₀ prediction leading to systematic voltage drift throughout discharge
- Inadequate aging parameter adaptation causing performance degradation on aged cells
- Micro-update logic errors in HRM-GRU resulting in loss of temporal information
- Imbalanced loss weights causing overfitting to early or late discharge phases

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate the HRM-GRU encoder's micro-update logic by testing different interpretations of Q and T parameters
2. Test the physics decoder's response to parameter perturbations to verify physical consistency
3. Evaluate the weighted Huber loss implementation with varying weight schedules to assess training stability
