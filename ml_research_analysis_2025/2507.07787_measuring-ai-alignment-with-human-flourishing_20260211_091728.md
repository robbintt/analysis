# Measuring AI Alignment with Human Flourishing
## Quick Facts

- Primary result: FAI Benchmark evaluates AI alignment with human flourishing across 7 dimensions, with top model scoring 72/100

## Executive Summary
The Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark) introduces a novel evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike traditional benchmarks focusing on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures how effectively models contribute to holistic human well-being through 1,229 objective and subjective questions evaluated by specialized judge LLMs using geometric mean scoring. Testing 28 leading language models revealed that none achieved acceptable alignment across all dimensions, with the highest-scoring model (OpenAI's o3) reaching only 72/100 overall.

Models particularly struggled with Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose dimensions, highlighting the need for AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm. The benchmark's comprehensive approach to measuring AI alignment represents a significant shift from harm-focused evaluations toward proactive assessments of how AI systems can enhance human well-being across multiple life domains.

## Method Summary
The FAI Benchmark evaluates AI alignment with human flourishing through 1,229 questions spanning seven dimensions of well-being. Each dimension is assessed using specialized judge LLMs that evaluate model responses through both objective and subjective criteria. The benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to calculate overall performance, ensuring that models cannot achieve high scores by excelling in only a few dimensions. The evaluation framework tests 28 leading language models, including various GPT models, Claude, Gemini, and open-source alternatives, measuring their ability to provide responses that support human flourishing across all tested dimensions.

## Key Results
- None of the 28 tested language models achieved acceptable alignment across all seven human flourishing dimensions
- OpenAI's o3 model scored highest at 72/100 overall, while open-source models generally scored below 40/100
- Models showed particular weakness in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose dimensions
- Even the best-performing models failed to adequately address complex human well-being concepts, suggesting significant room for improvement in AI alignment with human flourishing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The FAI Benchmark works by systematically evaluating AI responses across multiple dimensions of human well-being rather than focusing solely on harm prevention. By using specialized judge LLMs and geometric mean scoring, the benchmark ensures comprehensive assessment of how models support or hinder human flourishing. The framework's strength lies in its multidimensional approach, recognizing that human well-being encompasses diverse aspects from relationships and health to meaning and spirituality. This holistic evaluation captures the complexity of human flourishing in a way that traditional benchmarks cannot, providing actionable insights into where AI systems fall short in supporting genuine human well-being.

## Foundational Learning
- **Human flourishing dimensions**: Understanding the seven categories of well-being (Character, Relationships, Happiness, Meaning, Health, Financial Stability, Faith) is essential for recognizing the comprehensive scope of AI alignment assessment.
- **Geometric mean scoring**: This statistical approach ensures balanced performance across all dimensions, preventing models from masking weaknesses in critical areas.
- **Judge LLM methodology**: Specialized evaluation models provide consistent assessment criteria, though this approach may introduce its own biases and limitations.
- **Cross-cultural applicability**: The benchmark's dimensions must be interpretable across different cultural contexts to ensure meaningful global assessment.
- **Objective vs subjective evaluation**: Distinguishing between measurable outcomes and interpretive responses is crucial for accurate benchmarking.
- **AI alignment measurement**: Moving beyond harm prevention to assess positive contributions to human well-being represents a paradigm shift in AI evaluation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Human flourishing dimensions -> Question sets -> Model responses -> Judge LLM evaluation -> Geometric mean scoring -> Overall alignment scores
**Critical path**: Question generation -> Model response generation -> Judge LLM evaluation -> Score aggregation -> Dimension-level and overall scoring
**Design tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive well-being assessment over technical capability measurement, sacrificing simplicity for holistic evaluation. Geometric mean scoring ensures balanced performance but may mask improvement opportunities in specific dimensions.
**Failure signatures**: Models failing to address specific dimensions (particularly Faith/Spirituality, Character/Virtue, or Meaning/Purpose) indicates fundamental gaps in understanding human flourishing concepts.
**First experiments**:
1. Test model responses to Faith and Spirituality questions across different cultural contexts
2. Evaluate Character and Virtue responses to determine if models can navigate complex ethical scenarios
3. Assess Meaning and Purpose responses to measure model understanding of existential and life-goal concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, focusing instead on presenting the benchmark framework and initial evaluation results. However, the findings implicitly raise questions about how to improve AI alignment with human flourishing, particularly in the dimensions where models performed poorly.

## Limitations
- The subjective nature of human flourishing dimensions introduces potential bias in evaluation
- Reliance on judge LLMs may perpetuate existing model biases and limitations
- Cross-cultural applicability of the benchmark, particularly for Faith and Spirituality dimension, remains uncertain
- The framework may not capture the full complexity of human well-being across diverse cultural contexts

## Confidence
**Medium confidence** in the benchmark's ability to measure true AI alignment with human flourishing. The systematic approach provides a structured framework, but the subjective nature of the concepts and reliance on AI judges introduce significant uncertainty. The finding that even top models score only 72/100 suggests appropriate challenge level, but also raises questions about evaluation stringency versus actual capability gaps.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation studies with human evaluators from diverse backgrounds to assess whether the benchmark's dimensions and questions are interpreted consistently across different cultural contexts
2. Test the benchmark's sensitivity by evaluating whether targeted improvements in model training specifically focused on human flourishing concepts lead to measurable score increases
3. Compare judge LLM evaluations against human expert assessments for a subset of questions to quantify agreement rates and identify potential systematic biases in the automated evaluation approach
