# Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25420
- Authors: Nasrin Rahimi; A. Murat Tekalp
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The paper proposes two inference-time strategies to improve temporal consistency and fidelity in zero-shot video restoration using pretrained image diffusion models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of temporal inconsistency in zero-shot video restoration using pretrained image diffusion models. The authors propose two inference-time strategies: Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG), which incorporates a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to encourage smoother temporal evolution based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, and Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which reduces stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity scores. Their methods demonstrate substantial improvements in temporal consistency for zero-shot diffusion-based video restoration without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two complementary inference-time techniques to address temporal inconsistency in zero-shot video restoration. Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) introduces a curvature penalty that encourages smoother temporal evolution of diffusion trajectories in a perceptual space, inspired by the neuroscience concept of perceptual straightening. Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES) reduces stochastic variation by generating multiple diffusion trajectories from the same noise vector and combining them through uniform averaging. These methods are designed to work with any pretrained image diffusion model and can be applied during inference without architectural changes.

## Key Results
- PSG significantly improves temporal perceptual scores like FVD and perceptual straightness by encouraging smoother temporal evolution of diffusion trajectories
- MPES consistently improves fidelity metrics like PSNR and SSIM across all tasks without sacrificing sharpness
- The combined approach demonstrates substantial improvements in temporal consistency for zero-shot diffusion-based video restoration without requiring retraining or architectural modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by addressing two fundamental challenges in zero-shot video restoration. PSG reduces temporal inconsistency by penalizing curvature in the diffusion trajectory through a perceptual space, encouraging smoother temporal evolution that aligns with the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis. MPES improves fidelity by reducing the stochastic variation inherent in diffusion sampling through ensembling multiple trajectories, effectively averaging out random fluctuations that can degrade image quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion models: Generate samples through iterative denoising processes; why needed to understand the basic framework being modified; quick check: can explain the forward and reverse diffusion processes
- Temporal consistency: Measures how smoothly video frames evolve over time; why needed to understand the core problem being addressed; quick check: can define FVD and explain why it matters for video quality
- Perceptual straightening hypothesis: From neuroscience suggesting natural movements appear smoother in perceptual space; why needed to understand the theoretical motivation for PSG; quick check: can explain how this relates to video restoration
- Ensemble methods: Combine multiple predictions to reduce variance; why needed to understand MPES mechanism; quick check: can describe how averaging multiple trajectories reduces stochastic noise
- Image manifold: The low-dimensional space where natural images reside; why needed to understand PSG's optimization framework; quick check: can explain what it means for samples to approach the image manifold
- Cross-attention: Mechanism in diffusion models for conditioning on text prompts or other information; why needed to understand VISION-XL architecture; quick check: can identify where cross-attention blocks appear in the architecture

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Vision Transformer backbone -> Cross-attention blocks -> UNet-style denoising blocks -> Output

Critical path: Input noise vector -> Vision Transformer feature extraction -> Cross-attention conditioning -> Iterative denoising through UNet blocks -> Final image output

Design tradeoffs: The methods work at inference time without retraining, trading computational overhead for improved temporal consistency and fidelity. MPES requires multiple forward passes, increasing computational cost but providing significant quality improvements.

Failure signatures: Over-smoothing when PSG is applied too early in the denoising process, potentially reducing motion sharpness. Uniform averaging in MPES may not account for varying trajectory quality across different degradation types.

First experiments: 1) Apply PSG only in mid/late denoising steps to avoid over-smoothing, 2) Compare uniform averaging vs quality-aware weighting in MPES, 3) Test methods on simple video denoising task before moving to more complex degradations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: At what denoising timesteps should Perceptual Straightening Guidance be applied to maximize temporal coherence without over-smoothing motion?
- Basis in paper: Authors state: "Perceptual-straightening guidance can be applied only in the mid/late denoising steps or on shorter frame sequences to avoid over-smoothing."
- Why unresolved: Early PSG causes temporal low-pass filtering instead of motion-consistent changes; optimal scheduling remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation across different timestep ranges, measuring both temporal coherence (FVD) and motion preservation (optical flow consistency).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adaptive fusion mechanisms outperform uniform averaging in Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling?
- Basis in paper: Future work proposes "developing adaptive fusion mechanisms, such as attention-based or quality-aware weighting mechanisms, that dynamically combine results based on reconstruction confidence."
- Why unresolved: Current uniform averaging treats all trajectories equally; quality-aware weighting may reduce artifact propagation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of uniform vs attention-weighted vs confidence-weighted fusion across degradation types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do PSG and MPES generalize effectively to diffusion architectures beyond SDXL?
- Basis in paper: Authors list "Testing multi-path ensemble sampling using different diffusion architectures (e.g., Stable Diffusion 1.5, pix-art, Consistency Models)" as future work.
- Why unresolved: All experiments use VISION-XL with SDXL backbone; architectural invariance is unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-architecture benchmark with identical degradation tasks and metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Would margin-based curvature penalties with adaptive thresholds outperform the current ReLU-based formulation?
- Basis in paper: Authors propose exploring "margin-based (hinge/Huber) curvature penalties with adaptive thresholds and a scheduler that increases the PS update weight as samples approach the image manifold."
- Why unresolved: Current ReLU formulation treats all curvature equally; adaptive thresholds may improve robustness near the image manifold.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of penalty formulations with scheduled weighting on temporal blur tasks.

## Limitations
- Lack of quantitative user study data validating perceptual improvements
- Restricted scope of tasks (video enhancement, denoising, deblurring only)
- Absence of evaluation on longer video sequences where temporal consistency becomes more critical

## Confidence
- Temporal consistency improvements: High (supported by objective metrics like FVD and perceptual straightness scores showing consistent gains)
- Fidelity improvements: High (demonstrated through systematic PSNR and SSIM improvements across all tasks)
- Perceptual quality claims: Medium (limited by lack of user study validation despite perceptual metric improvements)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive user studies comparing the perceptual quality of restored videos with and without the proposed methods across multiple tasks
2. Evaluate the methods on longer video sequences (beyond 6 frames) to assess temporal consistency in extended temporal contexts
3. Measure and report the computational overhead and runtime impact of MPES ensemble sampling compared to standard inference
