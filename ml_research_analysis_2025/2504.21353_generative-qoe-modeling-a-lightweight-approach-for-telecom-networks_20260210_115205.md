# Generative QoE Modeling: A Lightweight Approach for Telecom Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21353
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21353
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: VQ-HMM achieves 0.77 QoE prediction accuracy with 0.0015s inference latency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework for Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction in telecom networks, combining Vector Quantization (VQ) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The approach addresses the challenge of real-time QoE estimation in resource-constrained environments by transforming continuous network features into discrete categorical symbols using VQ, enabling efficient temporal sequence modeling with HMMs. The VQ-HMM pipeline effectively captures dynamic QoE patterns while supporting probabilistic inference on unseen data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a QoE prediction accuracy of 0.77 with minimal inference latency of 0.0015 seconds, outperforming complex deep learning models like LSTMs in terms of both accuracy and speed. The framework offers a scalable, interpretable alternative to traditional methods, particularly suited for edge computing and latency-sensitive applications in telecom networks.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework uses a two-stage pipeline for QoE prediction. First, Vector Quantization via K-means clustering discretizes continuous multivariate network features (throughput, latency, packet loss, MSSSIM, PSNR) into discrete tokens. Second, a first-order discrete Hidden Markov Model is trained on these token sequences to model QoE state transitions. The model uses the Viterbi algorithm for inference to find the most probable sequence of QoE states. The approach is validated on publicly available streaming video QoE datasets with subjective user scores on a 1-100 scale.

## Key Results
- VQ-HMM achieves 0.77 QoE prediction accuracy versus 0.29 for HMM with scalar binning
- Inference latency of 0.0015 seconds makes it suitable for real-time edge deployment
- Outperforms LSTMs (0.78 accuracy) while being ~15x faster (0.0015s vs 0.023s)
- Effectively smooths transient noise while maintaining temporal dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: VQ Preserves Temporal Feature Relationships
- **Claim:** Vector Quantization preserves temporal feature relationships better than scalar discretization, enabling effective sequence modeling.
- **Mechanism:** VQ maps continuous multivariate network features to discrete categorical tokens using K-means clustering, preserving the joint distribution of features within each cluster centroid. This creates a meaningful "vocabulary" of network states that the HMM can process.
- **Core assumption:** The continuous feature space contains distinct clusters that correspond to interpretable network states; the Markov assumption holds for the discretized symbols.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.1] shows HMM-VQ achieves 0.77 accuracy vs. 0.29 for HMM with binned data; [Section 3.3] describes transformation of continuous features into discrete tokens via K-means.

### Mechanism 2: HMM Captures Latent QoE Dynamics
- **Claim:** First-order HMMs capture latent QoE dynamics by modeling state transitions probabilistically, filtering transient noise.
- **Mechanism:** The HMM learns transition and emission matrices, using the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable path through hidden states given observed VQ tokens, smoothing out momentary observation noise.
- **Core assumption:** QoE evolution is a Markov process where the next state depends primarily on the current state; temporal dependencies longer than one step are negligible.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.2] argues HMMs are effective when "observed data is generated by underlying latent processes"; [Section 4.3] shows "Likely" state sequence closely matches ground truth except for "transient deviations."

### Mechanism 3: Generative Modeling Enables NR Deployment
- **Claim:** Generative modeling enables deployment in data-scarce or "No Reference" (NR) environments via probabilistic inference.
- **Mechanism:** By learning the joint probability P(X, Y) rather than just the discriminative boundary, the model supports semi-supervised learning and synthetic data generation in NR scenarios.
- **Core assumption:** The training data distribution sufficiently represents the deployment environment; unlabeled test sequences adhere to the learned emission/transition statistics.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.1] contrasts generative vs. discriminative modeling; [Section 1] highlights potential applicability in "No Reference (NR) and Near Reference (NRR) scenarios."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Quantization (VQ) & Codebook Generation**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the critical interface between raw network telemetry and the HMM. Understanding VQ determines whether you preserve feature structure or collapse it into noise.
  - **Quick check question:** If you double the number of clusters (k) in your K-means VQ step, how would you expect the HMM's emission matrix size and data sparsity to change?

- **Concept: The Markov Assumption & Temporal Memory**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses a *first-order* HMM. You must understand the constraints this places on the "memory" of the network state to diagnose prediction errors.
  - **Quick check question:** Can a first-order HMM distinguish between a user experiencing their first glitch vs. their tenth glitch in a minute? Why or why not?

- **Concept: Viterbi Algorithm vs. Forward-Backward**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper specifies the Viterbi algorithm for inference (finding the single best path). This differs from computing the probability of being in a state at time t (smoothing/filtering).
  - **Quick check question:** If you need a confidence score for a QoE prediction at time t rather than just the most likely class label, does Viterbi provide this, or do you need a different calculation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (multivariate time-series) -> VQ Encoder (K-Means clustering) -> Sequence Model (Discrete HMM) -> Inference Engine (Viterbi decoder)

- **Critical path:** The **VQ Codebook Quality**. If the K-means clustering does not separate high-QoE and low-QoE network conditions effectively, the HMM cannot recover this information. The HMM is downstream and purely trusts the token ID.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Granularity vs. Sparsity:** Increasing VQ clusters (k) preserves resolution but creates a massive, sparse emission matrix B that requires more training data to estimate reliably.
  - **Accuracy vs. Latency:** The paper shows LSTMs (0.78 accuracy) slightly beat HMM-VQ (0.77), but HMM-VQ is ~15x faster (0.0015s vs 0.023s). Choose HMM for edge/real-time; LSTM for offline batch analysis.
  - **Interpretability vs. Representational Power:** HMMs allow you to inspect matrix A to see "Probability of going from Good QoE to Bad QoE," which deep models (LSTM/GANs) obscure.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Flat-lining" Predictions:** The model predicts the majority class regardless of input. *Likely cause:* VQ clusters are imbalanced, or HMM transition priors are too strong/under-trained.
  - **Oscillating State Predictions:** The predicted QoE jumps erratically between states every timestep. *Likely cause:* VQ resolution is too fine, mapping minor noise to different tokens, or HMM diagonal transition probabilities are too low.
  - **Latency Spike:** Unlikely given the lightweight nature, but if k (states) or N (HMM states) grow exponentially, Viterbi complexity O(N^2 T) may degrade.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **VQ Fidelity Test:** Train the VQ layer and reconstruct inputs from cluster centroids. Plot reconstruction error vs. k to find the "elbow" point before training the HMM.
  2. **Ablation on Discretization:** Compare HMM-VQ vs. HMM-Uniform-Binning vs. Gaussian-HMM (continuous) on the same validation set to quantify the specific contribution of the VQ preprocessing step.
  3. **Latency Budgeting:** Measure inference time strictly on target edge hardware (Raspberry Pi/Jetson equivalent) with varying sequence lengths T to confirm the O(T) scaling holds in practice against the paper's 0.0015s benchmark.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does the integration of real-time perceptual dimensions (human and context factors) alter the accuracy and latency balance of the VQ-HMM pipeline compared to using system-level metrics alone?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states future work will "incorporate perceptual dimensions to better align predictions with user-centric QoE factors."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study focuses primarily on system-level modeling due to the limited availability of datasets containing Perceptual Dimensions (PDs).
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results from datasets that include real-time subjective PD annotations, demonstrating performance changes relative to the current 0.77 accuracy baseline.

- **Question:** Can hybrid generative-discriminative architectures be successfully integrated into this framework to enhance representational capacity without sacrificing the low latency essential for edge computing?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors propose to "explore hybrid generative-discriminative models to enhance representational capacity" in future work.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation utilizes a purely generative approach (HMM), and the trade-offs involved in merging this with discriminative components within the lightweight VQ pipeline remain unexplored.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of a hybrid model's accuracy versus its inference latency on resource-constrained hardware.

- **Question:** Does utilizing a second-order or continuous HMM significantly improve the capture of temporal dependencies compared to the first-order discrete model currently employed?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 4.3 mentions the use of a "first order HMM" and notes "transient deviations during state transitions," suggesting the current model order may struggle with complex temporal smoothness.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper does not ablate the effect of the Markov order on the "transient deviations" observed in the time-domain results.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies comparing first-order and higher-order HMMs focusing on the reduction of transient deviations during QoE state transitions.

## Limitations
- Critical parameters underspecified (number of VQ clusters, HMM states, discretization scheme, sequence length, data splits)
- No statistical significance testing or calibration analysis for accuracy claims
- Limited generalizability testing across different network conditions or video content types
- "No Reference" scenario applicability remains speculative without demonstration

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core architectural concept (VQ + HMM) is sound and well-described; the mechanism by which VQ preserves temporal feature relationships and HMM smooths noise is theoretically valid.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported accuracy of 0.77 is believable given the dataset and task, but the exact recipe to achieve it is incomplete.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to other network conditions or video content types is not tested.

## Next Checks
1. **VQ Codebook Sensitivity**: Perform a grid search over the number of K-means clusters (e.g., k=16, 32, 64, 128) and plot reconstruction error vs. HMM prediction accuracy. Identify the "elbow" point where additional clusters no longer improve accuracy but increase emission matrix sparsity.

2. **HMM State Discretization Impact**: Systematically vary the number of discrete QoE states (e.g., 3, 5, 7 classes) and measure the resulting accuracy and transition matrix diagonal dominance. This will reveal whether the 0.77 accuracy is tied to a specific granularity assumption.

3. **Deployment Latency Verification**: Implement the full VQ-HMM pipeline on a target edge device (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and measure inference latency across varying sequence lengths (T=10, 50, 100). Confirm the O(T) scaling and that the 0.0015s benchmark is achievable in a real-world deployment scenario.
