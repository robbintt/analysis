# Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.16002
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002
- **Authors**: Sumit Singh; Rohit Mishra; Uma Shanker Tiwary
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: RA improves low-context Hindi NER across models: MuRIL 0.69→0.70, XLM-R 0.495→0.71, GPT3.5-turbo 0.17→0.31, Llama-2-7B fine-tuned 37.0 F1

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of named entity recognition (NER) in low-context Hindi sentences by combining transformer-based models with retrieval augmentation (RA) from Wikipedia. The research evaluates both encoder models (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT3.5-turbo) with and without RA integration. RA is implemented by retrieving relevant Wikipedia sentences and titles, then augmenting input examples with this contextual information. Results demonstrate that RA consistently improves performance on low-context examples, with particularly dramatic gains for XLM-R and generative models. The study also shows that Llama-2-7B fine-tuned with RA achieves state-of-the-art results for Hindi NER on the MultiCoNER dataset.

## Method Summary
The research combines transformer-based models with retrieval augmentation from a Hindi Wikipedia knowledge base. For encoder models (MuRIL, XLM-R), RA is integrated during fine-tuning by retrieving top-10 relevant sentences/titles from Wikipedia and concatenating them to inputs. Generative models (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT3.5-turbo) use RA in few-shot prompting scenarios. The study uses ElasticSearch to index a Hindi Wikipedia dump with fields for sentence, title, and paragraph. Iterative retrieval is applied at inference, where predicted entities are used to retrieve additional context for a second prediction pass. Model training uses specific hyperparameters: LR=5e-6, Batch=64, Epochs=20 for encoders; LR=5e-5, Batch=8, Epochs=2 for Llama-2-7B with QLoRA 4-bit.

## Key Results
- RA improves MuRIL macro F1 from 0.69 to 0.70 on low-context examples
- XLM-R shows dramatic improvement from 0.495 to 0.71 with RA integration
- GPT3.5-turbo performance increases from 0.17 to 0.31 when using RA in few-shot prompting
- Llama-2-7B fine-tuned with RA achieves 37.0 macro F1, outperforming base Llama-2-7B and other generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Retrieval augmentation addresses the core challenge of low-context named entity recognition by providing additional contextual information from external knowledge sources. In Hindi NER, where sentences often lack sufficient local context to disambiguate entity types, RA supplements the input with relevant Wikipedia content that helps resolve ambiguities. The mechanism works by retrieving semantically related sentences and titles based on the input, then incorporating this retrieved information directly into the model's processing pipeline. This approach effectively expands the context window beyond the original sentence, providing the semantic richness needed to accurately identify and classify named entities, particularly for cases where the original sentence provides minimal clues about entity boundaries or types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The task of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories like person names, organizations, locations, etc. *Why needed*: This is the core problem being addressed, focusing specifically on Hindi language and low-context scenarios. *Quick check*: Can identify entity boundaries and types in standard Hindi text with sufficient context.
- **Retrieval Augmentation (RA)**: The technique of retrieving relevant external information to augment input data for improved model performance. *Why needed*: Addresses the limitation of insufficient local context in low-context sentences by providing additional semantic information. *Quick check*: Can retrieve relevant Wikipedia content based on input queries and successfully integrate it into the processing pipeline.
- **MultiCoNER Dataset**: A multilingual named entity recognition dataset designed to evaluate models on low-context and ambiguous examples across multiple languages including Hindi. *Why needed*: Provides the evaluation benchmark and test data for measuring performance improvements in low-context scenarios. *Quick check*: Can parse and process the Hindi track data with correct label alignment and tag set (GRP, CORP, CW, etc.).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Sentence -> ElasticSearch KB Query -> Retrieved Sentences/Titles -> Model Input -> Prediction (Iterative: Prediction -> Entity Query -> Additional Retrieval -> Prediction)

**Critical Path**: The core workflow involves taking low-context Hindi sentences, querying the Wikipedia knowledge base for relevant context, augmenting the input with retrieved information, and processing through the appropriate model architecture (encoder or generative). The iterative inference path adds an additional prediction-retrieval-prediction loop to further enhance performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades increased computational complexity and potential information overload from retrieved content against improved accuracy on low-context examples. Using top-10 retrieved sentences provides comprehensive context but risks exceeding token limits and introducing noise. The choice between encoder fine-tuning versus generative model prompting represents different architectural approaches to integrating retrieved information.

**Failure Signatures**: Sequence length overflow when concatenating retrieved paragraphs to inputs, low baseline performance indicating potential preprocessing issues, and retrieval quality degradation when predicted entities are used as queries in iterative inference. The unusually low XLM-R baseline (0.49 vs MuRIL 0.69) suggests potential implementation differences or data processing issues.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify the XLM-R baseline discrepancy by implementing the exact preprocessing pipeline and label alignment to reproduce the 0.49 baseline performance.
2. Test the sensitivity of Llama-2-7B performance to different prompt engineering approaches to establish robustness of the 37.0 macro F1 result.
3. Measure the performance difference between single-step and iterative retrieval approaches to quantify the contribution of iterative inference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- The exact prompt templates for Llama-2-7B fine-tuning and few-shot experiments are not included, which could substantially affect performance outcomes
- Specific ElasticSearch query configuration details are missing, leaving ambiguity about optimal retrieval parameters
- Limited ablation studies make it unclear whether the full iterative retrieval process provides significant benefits over simpler approaches
- The surprisingly low baseline for XLM-R without RA compared to MuRIL suggests potential methodological differences that weren't explicitly addressed

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The overall finding that retrieval augmentation improves performance on low-context examples is well-supported by consistent improvements across multiple models (MuRIL: +0.01, XLM-R: +0.215, GPT3.5-turbo: +0.14). The methodology for RA integration with transformer encoders is clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium confidence**: The specific performance gains for Llama-2-7B (37.0 macro F1) and the relative ranking of models depend heavily on implementation details that are not fully specified, particularly prompt engineering and retrieval quality.

**Low confidence**: The exact contribution of iterative retrieval versus single-step retrieval is unclear due to limited ablation studies, and the reason for XLM-R's unusually low baseline remains unexplained.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the baseline XLM-R performance discrepancy by implementing the exact preprocessing pipeline and label alignment to verify whether the 0.49 baseline is reproducible or indicates a methodological issue.
2. Implement and test the iterative retrieval process by creating a precise specification for how predicted entities are formatted and used in subsequent retrieval queries, then measure the performance difference between single-step and iterative approaches.
3. Experiment with alternative prompt templates for Llama-2-7B to test the sensitivity of performance to different prompt engineering approaches and establish whether the reported 37.0 macro F1 is robust to prompt variations.
