# Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.12476
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12476
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Achieves F1 scores up to 89 in ternary relationship detection and 79 overall on EERD evaluation, demonstrating superior error detection and actionable feedback compared to baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of training reliable reasoning models in data-scarce domains by introducing a novel framework called Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA). R2tA uses LLMs to generate and iteratively refine reasoning traces through a two-stage process: technical auditing for factual accuracy and stylistic polishing for readability. The refined traces serve as high-fidelity supervision signals, enabling task-specific models to be fine-tuned via supervised learning and preference optimization. Applied to EERD evaluation in database education, R2tA achieved significant performance improvements—F1 scores up to 89 in ternary relationship detection and 79 overall—demonstrating superior error detection and actionable feedback compared to baselines. This approach provides a practical, label-efficient solution for structured reasoning tasks in education and beyond.

## Method Summary
R2tA employs a two-stage refinement process using a guide LLM to audit and polish initial reasoning traces. First, factual auditing detects hallucinations and omitted errors against domain-specific rubrics, iterating until coverage stabilizes (F1 convergence). Then, stylistic polishing improves readability with explicit factuality checkpoints to prevent accuracy degradation. The refined traces are used to fine-tune a base model through supervised learning and preference optimization. Applied to EERD evaluation, R2tA significantly improved performance metrics compared to baselines, particularly in detecting complex relationship errors.

## Key Results
- R2tA achieved F1 scores up to 89 in ternary relationship detection and 79 overall on EERD evaluation
- Reasoning enhancement consistently outperformed feedback-only baselines, especially in concept-heavy categories
- Style polishing with factuality checkpoints preserved accuracy while improving readability of refined traces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Factual Auditing with Convergence Detection
A guide LLM systematically refines noisy chain-of-thought traces by detecting hallucinations and omitted errors against domain-specific rubrics, iterating until coverage stabilizes. The guide LLM evaluates initial reasoning against schema-specific rubrics, excising erroneous phrases and inserting concise explanations for missed mistakes. An F1 score quantifies error coverage at each iteration; refinement halts when |F1_curr − F1_prev| < ε for two consecutive iterations, preventing over-refinement. Core assumption: LLMs exhibit stronger verification capability than initial generation capability, enabling reliable error detection when provided structured rubrics.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Decoupled Alignment (SFT → DPO) for Reasoning and Output
Decoupling reasoning calibration from output alignment preserves chain-of-thought faithfulness that direct output-only fine-tuning degrades. Stage 1: SFT on refined traces produces reasoning-calibrated model π_r. Stage 2: DPO uses refined traces as "chosen" and post-SFT outputs as "rejected," aligning with conceptual preferences without reward modeling. This sequence repeats for feedback alignment, conditioning outputs on faithful reasoning. Core assumption: SFT alone introduces spurious features and weakens causal reasoning-output links; DPO can recalibrate preferences if grounded in pre-validated traces.

### Mechanism 3: Factuality-Checkpointed Stylistic Polishing
Separating technical auditing from stylistic refinement—with explicit factuality checkpoints—preserves accuracy while improving readability. After factual auditing yields optimal F1 (F1_optimal), style polishing iteratively improves coherence/readability rewards. Critically, if F1 drops below F1_optimal or reward decreases, refinement halts immediately, preventing accuracy degradation during polish. Core assumption: Style improvements can be made orthogonally to factual content if monitored; without checkpoints, polish can inadvertently corrupt verified claims.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Faithfulness**
  - **Why needed here:** R2tA's core premise is that fine-tuning often erodes CoT faithfulness—intermediate reasoning steps must causally influence outputs rather than serve as post-hoc rationalizations.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why SFT alone might cause a model to generate plausible-looking reasoning that doesn't actually determine its final answer?

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** R2tA uses DPO (not RLHF with reward models) to align preferences using chosen/rejected pairs constructed from refined vs. suboptimal traces.
  - **Quick check question:** How does DPO differ from PPO-based RLHF, and why does it avoid training a separate reward model?

- **Concept: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Semantics**
  - **Why needed here:** The case study task (EERD evaluation) requires understanding strong/weak entities, identifying relationships, cardinalities, total participation, and specialization/union—errors in these cascade through evaluations.
  - **Quick check question:** Why must a weak entity have total participation in its identifying relationship with a strong entity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Base LLM π₀ -> Guide LLM G -> Refinement pipeline -> Two-stage aligner -> LoRA adapters

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate initial traces from π₀ for all training inputs
  2. Iteratively audit reasoning with G until F1 stabilizes
  3. Polish style with factuality checkpointing
  4. SFT π₀ on refined traces R → π_r
  5. DPO π_r using preference pairs P_r
  6. Generate aligned reasoning r* from π_r
  7. Audit feedback y₀ → refined feedback f̂
  8. SFT π_r on (x, r*, f̂) → π_f
  9. DPO π_f using preference pairs P_f

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Guide LLM choice: GPT-4o provides strong verification but adds API dependency and cost; a smaller open model could reduce cost but may miss subtle errors
  - Max iterations M=5, ε=0.05: Balances refinement thoroughness vs. compute; aggressive settings may over-polish or under-converge
  - 4-bit quantization: Reduces memory but may marginally affect output quality on edge cases
  - Separate LoRAs for reasoning vs. feedback: Increases modularity but doubles inference complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High variance across concept-heavy categories (e.g., Relationship Types F1=15 for feedback-only baseline): Indicates missing reasoning grounding
  - Hallucination cascades in multi-error scenarios: GPT-4o progressively fails as mistakes compound; R2tA resists this better but not immune
  - Precision drop after DPO without reasoning enhancement: Suggests preference pairs lack causal reasoning structure

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Table 1 ablation on a single schema (e.g., Hospital test set): Compare B+Fb-SFT, B+Fb-SFT+DPO, and full R2tA to verify reasoning enhancement contribution
  2. Ablate factual checkpointing in style polish: Remove F1 monitoring and observe precision degradation to quantify its protective effect
  3. Substitute guide LLM: Replace GPT-4o with a smaller open model (e.g., Qwen-14B) and measure F1 gap to assess guide model sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does R2tA generalize effectively to other graph-structured domains beyond EERD evaluation, such as UML class diagrams or knowledge graph validation?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "extend structural auditing beyond ERDs to other graph-structured domains (i.e., UML, knowledge graphs)"
  - **Why unresolved:** The framework was only validated on EERD evaluation; structural constraints and error taxonomies differ across graph-structured tasks.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark R2tA on at least two additional graph-structured domains (e.g., UML diagram evaluation, knowledge graph consistency checking) using comparable mistake induction protocols, reporting F1 scores per category.

- **Open Question 2:** Can LLM-based evaluation be reliably supplemented or replaced with programmatic verification for structured reasoning tasks?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note: "enhance evaluation fidelity: supplement or replace LLM-based graders with programmatic checkers"
  - **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation uses GPT-4o as an automated judge, which may introduce systematic biases or miss edge cases that programmatic checks would catch.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparison study where the same model outputs are evaluated by both LLM-based graders and schema-aware programmatic validators, measuring agreement rates and discrepancy analysis.

- **Open Question 3:** Does adding explicit causal modeling between reasoning steps and schema constraints improve interpretability and error detection?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors propose to "investigate explicit causal modeling for deeper interpretability" and "add explicit causal checks linking each reasoning step to schema constraints"
  - **Why unresolved:** Current refinement relies on F1-score optimization without formal causal structure; it remains unclear whether explicit causal chains would improve faithfulness.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Implement a causal intervention study where specific reasoning steps are ablated or perturbed, measuring downstream impact on final feedback accuracy and human interpretability ratings.

- **Open Question 4:** How robust is R2tA's performance when using alternative guide LLMs with varying capabilities for the refinement stage?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The method depends on GPT-4o as the sole guide LLM; sensitivity to guide model choice is untested despite varied verification capabilities across models.
  - **Why unresolved:** If the guide LLM introduces errors during refinement, these could propagate into the training data, affecting final model performance.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Run R2tA with multiple guide LLMs (e.g., Claude, open-source alternatives) and compare resulting fine-tuned model performance on the same held-out test set.

## Limitations

- The approach depends critically on guide LLM performance and rubric quality; incomplete or ambiguous rubrics could undermine convergence detection
- The method assumes reasoning faithfulness degrades monotonically under output-only fine-tuning, which may vary by model architecture
- Guide LLM choice (GPT-4o) adds API dependency and cost, limiting accessibility for some applications

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The two-stage decoupled alignment (SFT→DPO) improves performance over SFT-only baselines (supported by Table 1 and Table 3 results)
- **Medium confidence:** The factual checkpointing during style polishing prevents accuracy degradation (novel claim with limited direct corpus support)
- **Medium confidence:** Iterative refinement with F1 convergence effectively extracts domain-specific reasoning patterns (performance gains in Table 2 and Table 3 suggest validity)

## Next Checks

1. **Rubric ablation study:** Systematically remove or weaken rubric constraints and measure F1 degradation to quantify dependency on guide LLM's rubric-following ability
2. **External domain transfer:** Apply R2tA to a non-ERD task (e.g., mathematical proof verification) with minimal rubric modification to test generality
3. **Long-form reasoning stress test:** Evaluate on extended multi-step problems to verify R2tA maintains coherence and error detection beyond the 11-category EERD scope
