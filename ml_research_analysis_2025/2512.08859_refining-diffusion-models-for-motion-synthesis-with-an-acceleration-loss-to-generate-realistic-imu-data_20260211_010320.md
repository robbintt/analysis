# Refining Diffusion Models for Motion Synthesis with an Acceleration Loss to Generate Realistic IMU Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.08859
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08859
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Acceleration loss refinement improved HAR classification by 8.7% compared to original model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the domain gap between motion synthesis models optimized for visual quality and the acceleration profiles required for realistic IMU data generation. The authors propose refining a pretrained diffusion model by incorporating an acceleration-based second-order loss (L_acc) that enforces consistency in discrete second-order temporal differences of generated motion. This approach aligns motion priors with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. When integrated into a text-to-IMU framework and evaluated through HAR classification, the refined model showed 12.7% relative reduction in acceleration loss, with larger improvements for high-dynamic activities compared to low-dynamic ones.

## Method Summary
The authors refine a pretrained diffusion model (MDM) by incorporating an acceleration-based second-order loss term (L_acc) into the training objective. This loss enforces consistency in discrete second-order temporal differences of generated motion trajectories, specifically targeting the acceleration patterns needed for realistic IMU data generation. The refined model is integrated into a text-to-IMU synthesis pipeline and evaluated through HAR classification on real-world data. The approach focuses on local motion-level objectives that compare generated motion with ground-truth trajectories, optimizing the motion prior for realistic acceleration profiles rather than directly optimizing for downstream HAR performance.

## Key Results
- Acceleration loss decreased by 12.7% relative to original model
- Larger improvements observed for high-dynamic activities (running, jumping) vs low-dynamic ones (sitting, standing)
- HAR classification improved by 8.7% when trained exclusively on refined synthetic data compared to original model
- t-SNE embeddings showed synthetic IMU data shifted closer to real IMU recordings, particularly for high-dynamic activities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The acceleration-based second-order loss (L_acc) directly enforces temporal consistency in the discrete second-order differences of generated motion trajectories. This aligns the motion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns that are critical for realistic sensor data generation. By optimizing at the motion synthesis level rather than the IMU generation level, the approach ensures that the underlying motion dynamics naturally produce realistic acceleration profiles. The refinement approach bridges the domain gap between visually-optimized motion models and sensor-specific requirements without requiring end-to-end optimization of the full synthesis pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models for Motion Synthesis**: Generate sequential motion data by iteratively denoising from Gaussian noise, conditioned on text prompts or other inputs
  - *Why needed*: Provide the foundation for controllable motion generation that can be refined for IMU-specific requirements
  - *Quick check*: Can generate diverse, high-quality motion sequences from text descriptions

- **Second-Order Temporal Differences**: Mathematical formulation capturing acceleration by computing discrete differences of velocity (first differences of position)
  - *Why needed*: IMU sensors directly measure acceleration, making this the critical feature for realistic sensor data
  - *Quick check*: Consistent with physical sensor measurements and captures dynamic motion characteristics

- **Text-to-IMU Synthesis Pipeline**: Multi-stage process converting text descriptions → motion synthesis → SMPL body model → IMU sensor simulation
  - *Why needed*: Enables controllable generation of synthetic IMU data for activities described by text
  - *Quick check*: Each stage must be differentiable or have well-defined interfaces for end-to-end evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text → Motion Synthesis (MDM) → SMPL Body Model → IMU Simulation → HAR Classification

**Critical Path:** Motion Synthesis → SMPL Body Model → IMU Simulation (for data generation and evaluation)

**Design Tradeoffs:** Local motion-level optimization vs end-to-end HAR performance optimization; simple single-loss refinement vs complex multi-loss combinations; pretrained model adaptation vs training from scratch

**Failure Signatures:** Limited improvement for low-dynamic activities; potential overfitting to specific sensor configurations; sensitivity to loss weight selection

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing L_acc refinement against no refinement on acceleration profile similarity metrics
2. Evaluation of acceleration loss reduction across different activity types (high vs low dynamic)
3. HAR classification performance comparison when training on refined vs original synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Would incorporating a HAR performance term into the fine-tuning loss for end-to-end optimization yield further improvements over the current local motion-level objectives?
- Can systematic hyperparameter optimization and alternative weighting strategies for combined loss terms achieve further gains beyond the conservative single-term approach?
- Does the acceleration-based refinement approach transfer effectively to other diffusion-based motion synthesis architectures beyond MDM?
- Can quality-control mechanisms that filter unreliable generated motions before HAR training systematically improve classification performance?

## Limitations
- Evaluation constrained to HAR classification and t-SNE visualizations, lacking direct quantitative validation of acceleration profile similarity beyond training loss
- Comparison framework evaluates against diffusion baseline but excludes more recent generative approaches for IMU data synthesis
- Study focuses on specific wrist-thigh sensor setup, limiting generalizability to other sensor configurations

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Methodology for incorporating acceleration loss is clearly defined | High |
| Performance improvements are statistically significant within evaluation framework | Medium |
| t-SNE visualizations suggest improved alignment with real IMU data | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate acceleration profile similarity using quantitative distribution matching metrics (e.g., Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Wasserstein distance) between synthetic and real IMU data across different activity types
2. Test the refined model's performance on IMU data from alternative sensor placements (e.g., ankle, chest) to assess generalizability beyond the wrist-thigh configuration
3. Compare the acceleration loss refinement approach against recent generative models for IMU data synthesis, including transformer-based architectures and conditional GANs, to establish relative performance gains
