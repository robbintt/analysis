# T-pro 2.0: An Efficient Russian Hybrid-Reasoning Model and Playground

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10430
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10430
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Open-weight Russian LLM with hybrid reasoning, Cyrillic-dense tokenizer, and adapted EAGLE speculative-decoding for efficient inference

## Executive Summary
T-pro 2.0 is an open-weight Russian LLM designed for hybrid reasoning and efficient inference. It features a custom Cyrillic-dense tokenizer that reduces sequence length for Russian inputs, a four-stage training pipeline (midtraining, SFT, DPO, EAGLE), and strong performance on Russian benchmarks (ruAIME 0.704, T-Math 0.541, ruMMLU-Pro 0.697). The model is released with training data, benchmarks, and a web demo to enable reproducible research and practical deployment.

## Method Summary
T-pro 2.0 adapts Qwen3-32B by replacing 34k low-frequency non-Cyrillic tokens with Cyrillic ones, followed by 40B-token midtraining to stabilize embeddings. It then undergoes SFT on T-Wix 500k, DPO on 100k preference pairs, and EAGLE draft head training for speculative decoding. The pipeline achieves 1.85× speedup and supports both direct answering and reasoning-trace generation.

## Key Results
- ruAIME: 0.704 (Russian mathematical reasoning)
- T-Math: 0.541 (proprietary Russian STEM benchmark)
- ruMMLU-Pro: 0.697 (Russian multi-task understanding)
- EAGLE speedup: 1.85× across tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cyrillic-Dense Tokenizer
- **Claim:** Replacing low-frequency non-Cyrillic tokens with Cyrillic ones reduces sequence length for Russian inputs, improving efficiency.
- **Mechanism:** 34k tokens in Qwen3 vocabulary are swapped with 35.7k Cyrillic candidates from donor tokenizers; four refinement passes ensure merge rules exist for two-piece decompositions.
- **Core assumption:** Token count reduction translates to faster inference; new merge paths can be learned without destabilizing embeddings.
- **Evidence:** [abstract] cites "Cyrillic-dense tokenizer" for latency reduction; [section 3.2] details token replacement and Table 7 shows tokens/word drop (38%→60% ≤2-token words).
- **Break condition:** Model fails to adapt to new boundaries, causing incoherent output or English performance drop.

### Mechanism 2: Adapted EAGLE Speculative Decoding
- **Claim:** EAGLE pipeline enables faster generation by predicting tokens in parallel with a lightweight draft head.
- **Mechanism:** Small draft model (1 decoder layer + FR-Spec) proposes candidates; 32B target verifies them in batch; accepted tokens are added in one forward pass.
- **Core assumption:** Draft approximates target well enough for high acceptance length, especially in structured domains.
- **Evidence:** [abstract] cites "adapted EAGLE speculative-decoding pipeline"; [section 3.2] details architecture and Table 2 shows ~1.85× speedup.
- **Break condition:** Low acceptance length (e.g., high temperature, stochastic tasks) negates speedup.

### Mechanism 3: Instructional Midtraining
- **Claim:** Midtraining stabilizes model after tokenizer swap, bridging pre-training and fine-tuning.
- **Mechanism:** 40B tokens of instruction-style data (Reasoning, QA, Math) force model to learn new Cyrillic subwords in task-solving context.
- **Core assumption:** Model remaps embeddings without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Evidence:** [section 3.2] lists goals; ablation shows "instruct-only" outperforms "pre-train + instruct" for reasoning.
- **Break condition:** Noisy or too-small midtraining data causes overfitting or convergence failure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) & Merge Graphs
  - **Why needed:** To understand tokenizer modification; new tokens require existing merge rules for encoding.
  - **Quick check:** If you add a new Cyrillic token but do not update merge rules, what happens during tokenization?

- **Concept:** Speculative Decoding (Draft-Verify)
  - **Why needed:** To grasp 2× speedup; relies on smaller model guessing larger model's output.
  - **Quick check:** Why does speculative decoding guarantee identical output distribution to standard autoregressive decoding (mathematically)?

- **Concept:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
  - **Why needed:** To understand final alignment stage; uses preference pairs to refine behavior.
  - **Quick check:** How does DPO differ from RLHF regarding the need for a separate reward model during optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Qwen3-32B → Tokenizer (Cyrillic-dense BPE) → Midtraining (40B tokens) → SFT (T-Wix 500k) → DPO (100k pairs) → EAGLE Draft Head (1 layer + FR-Spec)

- **Critical path:** Tokenizer Swap → Midtraining is most fragile; insufficient midtraining data leads to under-trained embeddings and garbage output.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Tokenizer:** Heavy Cyrillic optimization risks English degradation (mitigated by ~10% English data).
  - **Inference:** EAGLE requires storing draft and target models in VRAM, trading memory for compute latency.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low Acceptance Rate:** EAGLE speedup drops to ~1.0×; check temperature (high temp lowers acceptance) or domain (Humanities < STEM).
  - **Tokenizer Artifacts:** Strange subword chunks indicate failed midtraining or merge graph refinement.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Tokenizer Efficiency Test:** Run T-pro and base Qwen3 on identical Russian text; compare tokens/word and latency (no EAGLE).
  2. **EAGLE Ablation:** Benchmark throughput (tokens/sec) with/without EAGLE at T=0 vs. 0.8 to measure temperature impact on acceptance length.
  3. **Midtraining Necessity:** (If resources allow) Fine-tune base model with new tokenizer *without* midtraining; evaluate on T-Math for performance drop.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does T-pro 2.0 maintain coherence and retrieval accuracy at the theoretical 128k context window?
- **Basis:** [explicit] "Limitations" states 128k support "has not been empirically validated" due to 32k training cap.
- **Why unresolved:** RoPE scaling enables longer contexts, but models often suffer from attention degradation without long-context fine-tuning.
- **Evidence to resolve:** Evaluation on Needle In A Haystack at 128k token limit.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Would online reinforcement learning (PPO/GRPO) improve robustness vs. offline DPO?
- **Basis:** [explicit] "Limitations" notes "absence of interactive feedback may limit robustness" and lead to OOD task degradation.
- **Why unresolved:** Current model uses only offline DPO; gains from on-policy exploration remain unquantified.
- **Evidence to resolve:** Comparative study of GRPO vs. DPO baseline on OOD reasoning benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does draft model quantization impact acceptance rates and speedup in the Russian-adapted EAGLE pipeline?
- **Basis:** [explicit] Appendix G identifies "draft model quantization and integrating EAGLE 3" as future work.
- **Why unresolved:** Quantization reduces memory pressure but introduces approximation errors that could lower acceptance rate.
- **Evidence to resolve:** Benchmarks comparing BF16 vs. INT8/INT4 draft models on T-Math (latency and acceptance length).

## Limitations

- **Corpus Composition:** Exact datasets and filtering criteria for midtraining and SFT are not fully specified, limiting bias assessment.
- **EAGLE Generalization:** Speedup varies by domain and temperature; practical benefits in mixed-input applications are uncertain.
- **Tokenizer Adaptation:** Midtraining's necessity and sensitivity to data composition are not fully explored.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Training pipeline (tokenizer, midtraining, SFT, DPO, EAGLE) is clearly described and follows established practices; reported metrics are reasonable.
- **Medium Confidence:** Tokenizer adaptation implementation details are provided, but impact on final performance is not fully explored; EAGLE speedup results are convincing but generalizability is uncertain.
- **Low Confidence:** Exact training corpus composition and quality are not fully specified, making bias and limitation assessment difficult; detailed performance analysis on diverse tasks is lacking.

## Next Checks

1. **Independent Corpus Analysis:** Obtain full dataset lists for midtraining and SFT; analyze language distribution, domain coverage, and biases to assess representativeness.
2. **EAGLE Speedup Benchmarking:** Run T-pro 2.0 with/without EAGLE on diverse tasks (STEM, Humanities, Creative Writing) at different temperatures; measure speedup and acceptance rates.
3. **Tokenizer Ablation Study:** Train baseline model with original Qwen3 tokenizer and same midtraining data; compare performance on Russian tasks (T-Math, ruMMLU-Pro) to quantify tokenizer impact.
