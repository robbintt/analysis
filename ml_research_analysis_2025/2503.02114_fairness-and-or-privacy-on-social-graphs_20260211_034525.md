# Fairness and/or Privacy on Social Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02114
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02114
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: Fairness interventions reduce bias but often at cost of accuracy or privacy; Kipf GCN and GraphSAGE are more robust to fairness modifications

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates fairness and privacy interventions in graph neural networks across multiple architectures and datasets. The authors test adversarial debiasing, edge weighting, filtering, and combined approaches, measuring their impact on fairness metrics (equality of opportunity, statistical parity), privacy leakage, and accuracy. Key findings include: fairness interventions effectively reduce bias but often at the cost of accuracy or privacy; certain GNN architectures (Kipf GCN, GraphSAGE) are more robust to fairness modifications; combined approaches like adversarial edge weighting show promise in balancing multiple objectives. The results demonstrate that fairness and privacy preservation in GNNs involves inherent trade-offs, with no single intervention excelling across all metrics. Model architecture selection and careful parameter tuning are crucial for achieving desired fairness and privacy outcomes.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four GNN architectures (Kipf GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN) on three social network datasets (NBA, Pokec_n, Pokec_z) with node classification tasks. Five fairness interventions are tested: adversarial debiasing with tunable α/β parameters, edge weighting based on inverse group proportions, filtering, embedding projection, and fair learning variants. Combined approaches include adversarial edge weighting (EwAd) and fair edge weighting (EwFlpar). Performance is measured across three categories: accuracy, fairness metrics (statistical parity, equality of opportunity), and privacy metrics (privacy/fairness attribute leakage, membership inference attack accuracy). Hyperparameter tuning occurs on validation sets, with results reported on test sets.

## Key Results
- Fairness interventions effectively reduce bias but often at the cost of accuracy or privacy
- Kipf GCN and GraphSAGE models exhibit the greatest robustness to fairness interventions
- Combined approaches like adversarial edge weighting show promise in balancing multiple objectives
- Edge weighting emerges as the most effective technique for mitigating bias while maintaining reasonable accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial debiasing reduces bias in GNNs by learning representations independent of sensitive attributes without significantly affecting privacy leakage.
- Mechanism: A fairness regularizer encourages the GNN to produce node embeddings that minimize correlation with inferred proxy sensitive attributes. The adversarial component learns to predict the sensitive attribute while the main model learns to defeat this prediction.
- Core assumption: Sensitive attribute information can be approximated from graph structure and available node features even when partially unavailable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fairness interventions effectively reduce bias but often at the cost of accuracy or privacy"
  - [section 4.1] "adversarial debiasing does not appear to have a significant overall impact on privacy... variations in privacy leakage appear to be primarily attributed to the inherent characteristics of the different models"
  - [corpus] Related work on fairness-aware GNNs (arXiv:2510.18473) confirms adversarial approaches are actively studied but notes limited evaluation in knowledge graph contexts.
- Break condition: If sensitive attributes cannot be reasonably approximated from available features, the proxy representation will be unreliable and debiasing ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Edge weighting based on inverse group proportions improves fairness by increasing representation of under-represented nodes during message passing.
- Mechanism: Weights are attached to edges inversely proportional to sensitive group sizes. During GCN convolution, these weights modify the aggregation step, making visits to under-represented nodes more likely during representation learning.
- Core assumption: Node neighborhood composition correlates with biased outcomes; rebalancing exposure during aggregation reduces disparity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "FairWalk... attach weights to edges based on the inverse of proportions of sensitive groups, to make it more likely to visit under-represented nodes"
  - [section 4.2] "edge weighting emerge as the most effective techniques for mitigating bias while maintaining reasonable accuracy"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for edge weighting specifically in GNNs; evidence is paper-internal.
- Break condition: If biased outcomes stem from feature distributions rather than structural imbalance, edge weighting alone will not achieve fairness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combined fairness countermeasures (adversarial edge weighting, fair edge weighting) outperform single interventions by addressing both structural and representational bias sources simultaneously.
- Mechanism: Edge weighting modifies the aggregation topology while adversarial/fair learning constrains the embedding space. The dual intervention targets different stages of the GNN pipeline.
- Core assumption: Bias enters through multiple pathways (structure and features), so multi-point intervention yields additive or synergistic benefits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "adversarial edge weighting emerges as the most effective technique for the Kipf GCN, achieving optimal fairness outcomes while also minimizing privacy leakage"
  - [section 4.3] "fair edge weighting achieves superior performance, simultaneously maximizing accuracy and minimizing both statistical parity and equality of opportunity"
  - [corpus] GRAPHGINI (arXiv:2402.12937) explores individual and group fairness but does not validate combined structural + adversarial approaches.
- Break condition: If interventions interact negatively (e.g., edge weighting disrupts gradients needed for adversarial training), combined approaches may underperform.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Message passing in GNNs
  - Why needed here: All fairness interventions operate by modifying how information aggregates across neighbors. Understanding baseline convolution is prerequisite to understanding where interventions attach.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a node's representation is computed from its neighbors in a 2-layer GCN?

- Concept: Statistical Parity vs. Equality of Opportunity
  - Why needed here: The paper optimizes for different fairness definitions; Fl_eoo and Fl_par denote different debiasing objectives with different trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves statistical parity but not equality of opportunity, what does that indicate about its error patterns across groups?

- Concept: Membership inference attacks
  - Why needed here: Privacy leakage is measured via attribute inference and membership inference; interpreting results requires understanding what these attacks exploit.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with higher accuracy be more vulnerable to membership inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base GNNs: Kipf GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN
  - Fairness interventions: Adversarial debiasing (α, β parameters), Edge weighting, Filtering, Embedding projection, Fair learning (Fleoo, Flpar)
  - Combined methods: Adversarial Edge Weighting (EwAd), Fair Edge Weighting (EwFlpar)
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Statistical Parity, Equality of Opportunity, Privacy/Fairness Attribute Leakage, Membership Inference Attack accuracy

- Critical path:
  1. Select GNN architecture (Kipf GCN or GraphSAGE recommended for robustness)
  2. Choose fairness intervention based on priority (fairness vs. privacy vs. accuracy)
  3. If multi-objective, test combined methods (EwAd, EwFlpar)
  4. Tune parameters on validation set; evaluate all metrics on test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Kipf GCN/GraphSAGE: More robust to fairness modifications, lower accuracy drop
  - GAT/GIN: More sensitive to interventions, higher accuracy loss
  - Filtering/Embedding projection: Effective privacy reduction but significant accuracy cost
  - Adversarial debiasing: Good fairness with minimal privacy impact; requires tuning α, β

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops >10% with filtering or embedding projection → switch to adversarial or edge weighting
  - Privacy leakage increases with fairness intervention → check if using GAT/GIN (less robust); consider GCN
  - Statistical parity improves but equality of opportunity stagnates → combine edge weighting with fair learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train Kipf GCN on target dataset; record accuracy, fairness metrics (SP, EOO), privacy leakage, and MIA accuracy.
  2. Single intervention: Apply adversarial debiasing with α=0.5, β=0.5; compare all metrics to baseline to observe trade-offs.
  3. Combined method: Apply Adversarial Edge Weighting (EwAd) on same architecture; compare against both baseline and single intervention to assess additive benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can fairness interventions and privacy-preserving techniques be jointly optimized to achieve synergistic benefits, and does the optimal combination vary across fairness definitions, model architectures, or datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Future Work: "A promising direction is to investigate the effectiveness of combining fairness and privacy-preserving measures... exploring how different fairness interventions interact with privacy-enhancing techniques and whether certain combinations yield synergistic benefits."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates fairness interventions independently and only briefly explores combining fairness countermeasures (EwAd, EwFlpar), but does not integrate dedicated privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy into the optimization framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study measuring fairness, privacy, and accuracy metrics when jointly applying fairness interventions (adversarial debiasing, edge weighting) with privacy techniques (differential privacy, noise injection) across multiple GNN architectures and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can fairness interventions be designed to adapt to evolving data distributions and dynamic graph structures in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify in Future Work: "Investigating fairness interventions that can adapt to evolving data distributions and dynamic graph structures is essential... methods that can continuously monitor and adjust fairness constraints."
- Why unresolved: All experiments in this study use static graphs with fixed train/validation/test splits; no temporal or dynamic evaluation was conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on temporal graph datasets measuring whether fairness metrics degrade over time as graph structure changes, and evaluation of adaptive methods that recalibrate fairness constraints dynamically.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the observed trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and accuracy generalize beyond social network graphs to other domains such as biological, financial, or citation networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study exclusively uses social network datasets (NBA players, Pokec social network), with the authors noting that "effectiveness of different fairness interventions varied across datasets, suggesting that the choice of debiasing techniques should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the data."
- Why unresolved: Social graphs have particular structural properties (homophily, community structure) that may influence how fairness interventions propagate through the network; different graph types may exhibit different trade-off patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the experimental methodology on diverse graph types (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, financial transaction graphs, citation networks) comparing the effectiveness of the same fairness countermeasures.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What mechanisms explain why Kipf GCN and GraphSAGE exhibit greater robustness to fairness interventions compared to GAT and GIN architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that "Kipf GCN and GraphSAGE models exhibit the greatest robustness to fairness interventions, experiencing the lowest drop in accuracy when modified with various fairness methods," but does not investigate the architectural properties causing this difference.
- Why unresolved: The study reports empirical differences but does not analyze whether attention mechanisms (GAT), aggregation functions (GIN sum vs. GCN mean), or other architectural choices mediate the impact of fairness modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies isolating specific architectural components (aggregation type, attention, depth) combined with theoretical analysis of how fairness gradients propagate differently through each architecture.

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses on binary and small multi-class classification tasks, limiting generalizability to complex prediction scenarios
- Hyperparameter tuning details are sparse, particularly for fairness intervention parameters (α, β) and attack model architectures
- Results show high sensitivity to GNN architecture choice, with GAT and GIN showing significant degradation under fairness interventions

## Confidence

- High confidence: Fairness interventions reduce bias (statistical parity, equality of opportunity) as measured; combined approaches (adversarial edge weighting) outperform single interventions.
- Medium confidence: Trade-off patterns between fairness, privacy, and accuracy are consistent; Kipf GCN and GraphSAGE show better robustness to fairness modifications.
- Low confidence: Specific hyperparameter settings and their impact on results; generalizability to larger, more complex graph datasets and tasks beyond node classification.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments on additional GNN architectures (e.g., GATv2, GCNII) to test architecture sensitivity claims.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying α and β parameters systematically to map their effect on fairness-privacy-accuracy trade-offs.
3. Test combined approaches on larger, more complex graph datasets (e.g., Reddit, Amazon) to assess scalability and generalization.
