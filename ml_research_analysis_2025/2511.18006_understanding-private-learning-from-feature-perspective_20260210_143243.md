- This paper provides the first theoretical framework for analyzing private learning through a feature learning perspective, showing private learning requires higher SNR than non-private learning and noise memorization persists under practical privacy budgets.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a theoretical framework for understanding private learning through a feature learning lens. The authors introduce a multi-patch data structure that separates label-dependent feature signals from label-independent noise, enabling analysis of how differential privacy affects feature learning versus noise memorization. Using a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, they characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent, revealing that effective private signal learning requires higher signal-to-noise ratios compared to non-private training.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation σ(z) = max{0,z}^q (q > 2) trained via noisy gradient descent with Gaussian noise injection for differential privacy. The data follows a multi-patch structure x = [y·v, ξ] where v is the feature signal and ξ is label-independent noise. Training tracks coefficient dynamics Γ^(t) for signal learning and Φ^(t) for noise memorization, with early stopping before cumulative privacy noise accumulation. The framework analyzes conditions under which feature signals are learned versus when noise is memorized, establishing SNR thresholds for both private and non-private settings.

## Key Results
- Private learning requires SNR·nε ≥ e^Ω(1) for effective feature signal capture, stricter than non-private SNR^q·n ≥ e^Ω(1)
- When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it also occurs in private learning as long as ε ≥ SNR^{1-q}·n^{-1}
- The model weights decompose uniquely into signal learning coefficients (Γ), noise memorization coefficients (Φ), and cumulative privacy noise components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: SNR Threshold Elevation in Private Learning
Private learning requires higher signal-to-noise ratio than non-private training for effective feature learning. Privacy noise injection creates an additional constraint on feature learning, requiring the condition min{SNR·nε, SNR^q·n} ≥ e^Ω(1) to hold. When n^{-1/2} ≤ ε ≤ SNR^{q-1}, a lower privacy budget requires a higher SNR compared to standard non-private training (which only requires SNR^q·n ≥ e^Ω(1)). The mechanism breaks when SNR·nε ≤ e^Ω(1) ≤ SNR^q·n.

### Mechanism 2: Noise Memorization Persistence
Data noise memorization that occurs in non-private learning will also occur in private learning under practical privacy budgets. When min{SNR^{-1}·ε, SNR^{-q}·n^{-1}} ≥ e^Ω(1), the model prioritizes memorizing label-independent noise over feature signals. Under typical privacy budgets (ε ≥ SNR^{1-q}·n^{-1}), noise memorization from non-private training persists. The privacy constraint ε ≤ n^{-q} required to suppress it is impractically stringent.

### Mechanism 3: Signal-Noise Weight Decomposition
Model weights uniquely decompose into signal learning coefficients (Γ), noise memorization coefficients (Φ), and cumulative privacy noise. Through noisy gradient descent, weights evolve as w^(t)_{j,r} = w^(0)_{j,r} + j·Γ^(t)_{j,r}·v/||v||²₂ + Σ_i Φ^(t)_{j,r,i}·ξ_i/||ξ_i||²₂ - ηΣ_s z_s. The coefficients satisfy bounded monotonic dynamics: Γ^(t) and Φ^(t) increase monotonically while the privacy noise component decreases, all remaining bounded within [-4 log(T*_p), 4 log(T*_p)].

## Foundational Learning

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR = ||v||₂/||ξ||₂)**: Central determinant of whether private learning captures features vs. memorizes noise; defines the threshold conditions in all main theorems. Quick check: Given feature vector v with ||v||₂ = 3 and noise ξ with E[||ξ||₂] = 5, what is the approximate SNR?

- **Differential Privacy (ε,δ)-DP with Gaussian Mechanism**: Defines privacy guarantee and calibrates noise scale σ_z ≥ Δ₂(f)/(√{2ln(1.25/δ)}·ε) injected during training. Quick check: For gradient sensitivity Δ₂ = 0.1, ε = 1, δ = 10^{-5}, what is the required Gaussian noise scale?

- **Over-parameterization Regime**: Ensures sufficient model capacity for both feature learning and noise memorization; required for theoretical guarantees (d = e^Ω(m²n⁴), n,m = Ω(poly log d)). Quick check: With n=1000 samples, m=10 filters, d=1000 dimensions, verify if the over-parameterization condition is satisfied

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data x = [y·v, ξ] ∈ (ℝ^d)² with label y∈{+1,−1} → Two-layer CNN f(W,x) = F_{+1}(W_{+1},x) - F_{-1}(W_{-1},x) → NoisyGD with w^{(t+1)}_{j,r} = w^{(t)}_{j,r} - η(∇L_D + z_t)

- **Critical path**: 1. Initialize weights with σ_0 in theoretical bounds 2. Set learning rate η ≤ e^{O(min{||v||_2^{-2}, ||ξ||_2^{-2}})} 3. Train with coefficient monitoring of Γ^(t) and Φ^(t) 4. Early stop before T*_p = η^{-1}min{poly(κ^{-1},||v||_2^{-1},...), mnεσ_0/(Cμ(||v||₂+||ξ||₂))}

- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher SNR → better feature learning but requires cleaner data/preprocessing; Larger ε → improved accuracy but weaker privacy guarantee; Larger σ_0 → faster initial learning but potential noise amplification; More iterations → better convergence but privacy noise accumulation

- **Failure signatures**: Small training loss + constant test loss ≈ 0.1 indicates noise memorization dominant; Feature learning stalls when insufficient SNR for given ε; Gradient explosion after moderate iterations indicates exceeded T*_p threshold

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Synthetic validation with d=1000, m=10, q=3, σ_0=0.001, η=0.01; sweep SNR ∈ {0.2, 0.6, 3} and ε ∈ {0.2, 1, 5}; plot max|Γ^(t)| vs max|Φ^(t)| dynamics 2. Real-world noise injection on CIFAR-10 with controlled Gaussian noise at varying SNR; compare test accuracy across ε ∈ {2, 4, 8}; generate GradCAM visualizations 3. Initialization scale ablation testing σ_0 across theoretical bounds [e^{-2}, e^{-1}, e^{0}] × reference; measure T_1 convergence time and final generalization gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does gradient clipping, a standard component of DP-SGD, interact with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dynamics during feature learning?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes in Footnote 2 and Section 3 that "we assume there is no clipping on gradients" to simplify the theoretical analysis of NoisyGD.
- Why unresolved: The analysis isolates the effect of Gaussian noise injection, but clipping introduces non-linearity that may alter how feature signals are scaled relative to data noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical derivation of the signal and noise coefficient bounds (Γ and Φ) under a clipping operator, or empirical ablation studies showing signal learning trends with varying clipping bounds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the theoretical guarantees for feature signal learning be extended to deep architectures beyond two-layer CNNs?
- Basis in paper: The methodology is restricted to a "two-layer convolutional neural network" (Section 3) with polynomial ReLU, whereas modern private learning often involves ResNets or Transformers.
- Why unresolved: The proofs rely heavily on the specific signal-noise decomposition possible in a single convolutional layer with fixed second-layer weights, which may not hold in deep hierarchical networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the framework to multi-layer networks or validating if the SNR thresholds derived (SNR · nε ≥ e^{Ω(1)}) empirically hold for deeper models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the correlation between feature signals and data noise affect the generalization bounds of private learning?
- Basis in paper: Definition 3.1 assumes data noise ξ is orthogonal to the feature signal v (using projection matrix H).
- Why unresolved: In real-world data, noise is often correlated with features. The current theory relies on orthogonality to separate signal learning from noise memorization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the model dynamics where ⟨v, ξ⟩ ≠ 0, determining if the threshold for noise memorization changes when signal and noise are coupled.

## Limitations

- Sensitivity calculation ambiguity: The paper assumes no gradient clipping but practical DP-SGD implementations require clipping thresholds to calibrate Gaussian noise, with the exact Δ₂(f) computation for the two-layer CNN architecture not explicitly specified.
- Sample size dependencies: While SNR is controlled, the absolute sample size n and noise scale σ_ξ for synthetic experiments are not specified, with theoretical bounds depending critically on these values through conditions like n^{-1/2} ≤ ε ≤ SNR^{q-1}.
- Initialization sensitivity: Results rely on specific initialization bounds σ_0 ∈ [e^{O((nε)^{-1/q}||v||_2^{-1})}, e^{O(min{ε^{-1/q}||ξ||_2^{-1}, (n)^{-1/2q}||v||_2^{-1}})}] that may be difficult to satisfy in practice without precise knowledge of problem parameters.

## Confidence

- SNR Threshold Elevation in Private Learning: **High** - The mechanism is well-defined with clear mathematical conditions and supported by Theorem 4.6
- Noise Memorization Persistence: **Medium** - The theoretical framework is sound but limited corpus evidence for real-world prevalence
- Signal-Noise Weight Decomposition: **Medium** - The decomposition is formally specified but practical verification requires extensive coefficient tracking

## Next Checks

1. **Sensitivity validation**: Compute exact gradient sensitivity Δ₂(f) for the polynomial ReLU CNN under different clipping strategies and verify the resulting privacy budget requirements

2. **SNR sweep reproducibility**: Implement the synthetic data generation pipeline with controlled SNR values and verify that the threshold conditions min{SNR·nε, SNR^q·n} ≥ e^Ω(1) accurately predict feature learning success/failure

3. **Initialization sensitivity study**: Test the initialization scale bounds empirically across multiple random seeds and verify that training consistently succeeds when σ_0 satisfies the theoretical conditions but fails otherwise
