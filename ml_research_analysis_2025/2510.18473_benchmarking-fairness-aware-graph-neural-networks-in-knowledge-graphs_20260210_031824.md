# Benchmarking Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks in Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18473
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18473
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fairness-aware GNNs show clearer accuracy-fairness trade-offs on knowledge graphs compared to existing datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmarking study of fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) specifically designed for knowledge graphs. The authors identify a critical gap in existing research: while fairness in GNNs has gained attention, there is a lack of large-scale, real-world datasets and systematic evaluations for group fairness in knowledge graph settings. To address this, they generate three new datasets from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, each containing nodes representing people with sensitive attributes (nationality or gender) and target labels (occupations).

The study benchmarks eight fairness-aware GNN methods across four GNN backbones and three early stopping conditions, creating 96 experimental patterns across nine real-world graphs. The findings reveal that knowledge graphs exhibit clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness compared to existing datasets, and that preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics while inprocessing methods tend to improve accuracy. The research provides a standardized framework and datasets that enable systematic evaluation of fairness-aware GNNs, addressing the reproducibility challenges in this emerging field.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a comprehensive benchmarking framework for fairness-aware GNNs in knowledge graphs. They generated three new datasets (YAGO, DBpedia, Wikidata) by extracting person entities with relationships, sensitive attributes (nationality or gender), and occupation labels from existing knowledge graphs. The study evaluated eight fairness-aware methods (four inprocessing: adversarial debiasing, meta-learning, graph fairness network, and fairness-aware graph convolution; three preprocessing: reweighing, disparate impact remover, learning fair representations; and one baseline) across four GNN backbones (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN) and three early stopping conditions (fixed epochs, validation loss, fairness-aware stopping), totaling 96 experimental patterns. Performance was measured using accuracy, equal opportunity difference, and demographic parity difference metrics.

## Key Results
- Knowledge graphs demonstrate clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness compared to existing datasets
- Preprocessing methods tend to improve fairness metrics while inprocessing methods improve accuracy
- Early stopping conditions significantly impact fairness outcomes, with fairness-aware stopping showing particular promise
- FairGNN and Vanilla methods show sensitivity to both model choice and early stopping variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmarking approach works because it systematically isolates the effects of different fairness-aware methods, GNN architectures, and training strategies on both accuracy and fairness metrics. By using real-world knowledge graphs with meaningful sensitive attributes and target labels, the study captures the complex relationships and biases present in actual data. The inclusion of multiple early stopping conditions reveals how training dynamics affect fairness outcomes, while the comprehensive coverage of method types (inprocessing vs preprocessing) provides insights into different approaches to achieving fairness.

## Foundational Learning
**Knowledge Graph Structure**: Understanding the triple-based representation (subject-predicate-object) and how relationships encode real-world knowledge - needed to appreciate how sensitive attributes and target labels are extracted and represented in the datasets.

**Group Fairness Metrics**: Familiarity with demographic parity and equal opportunity difference - needed to evaluate fairness outcomes and understand trade-offs with accuracy.

**Graph Neural Networks**: Knowledge of message passing and aggregation mechanisms in GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN architectures - needed to understand how different GNN backbones process graph-structured data and how fairness-aware modifications alter their behavior.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Knowledge Graph Datasets -> Data Preprocessing -> Fairness-aware GNN Methods -> GNN Backbones -> Training with Early Stopping -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical Path:
Dataset generation → Method selection → GNN backbone implementation → Training with early stopping → Fairness and accuracy evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Inprocessing vs preprocessing methods: Inprocessing modifies the learning process while preprocessing transforms the input data
- GNN backbone selection: Different architectures capture different aspects of graph structure
- Early stopping conditions: Fixed epochs vs validation-based vs fairness-aware stopping affect both convergence and fairness outcomes

Failure Signatures:
- Poor fairness metrics despite high accuracy may indicate unaddressed group biases
- Early stopping on validation loss may sacrifice fairness for accuracy
- Method sensitivity to backbone choice suggests limited generalizability

First Experiments:
1. Baseline GNN performance without fairness constraints to establish reference accuracy
2. Individual fairness-aware methods with different GNN backbones to identify method-backbone compatibility
3. Early stopping comparison across methods to quantify fairness-accuracy trade-offs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited to three knowledge graph datasets which may not represent all real-world scenarios
- Focus on node classification tasks may not generalize to other GNN applications
- Sensitive attributes (nationality and gender) may not capture all relevant fairness concerns in different contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodology and experimental design
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of findings across different knowledge graphs and sensitive attributes
- Low confidence in the absolute performance rankings of fairness-aware GNN methods across all possible scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study on additional knowledge graph datasets with diverse sensitive attributes and target labels to assess the robustness of findings.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the effects of individual components (e.g., GNN backbones, preprocessing steps) on fairness and accuracy trade-offs.
3. Investigate the performance of fairness-aware GNNs on downstream tasks beyond node classification to evaluate broader applicability of the methods.
