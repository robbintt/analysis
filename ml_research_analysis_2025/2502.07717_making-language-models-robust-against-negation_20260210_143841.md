# Making Language Models Robust Against Negation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.07717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07717
- Reference count: 28
- Key result: Self-supervised pre-training on negation-aware tasks improves BERT/RoBERTa performance on negation benchmarks by 1.8%-9.1% accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving language models' understanding of negation through targeted self-supervised pre-training. The authors introduce two novel tasks - Next Sentence Polarity Prediction (NSPP) and a modified Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) - that expose models to negation during training. By reversing sentence polarity to create negative examples rather than using random sentences, the NSP task significantly improves model performance on negation benchmarks like CondaQA. The approach demonstrates that focused pre-training on negation can enhance model robustness without degrading performance on non-negated inputs.

## Method Summary
The method involves two self-supervised pre-training tasks designed to improve negation understanding. The NSPP task predicts whether the next sentence contains negation cues, while the NSP task predicts if two sentences are consecutive, using polarity-reversed sentences as negatives. The authors extract approximately 6.4M sentence pairs from English Wikipedia, ensuring sentences contain negation cues like "not", "n't", or "never" modifying the main verb. Models are pre-trained on subsets of this data (500K to 1M pairs) using Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-6. After pre-training, models are fine-tuned on CondaQA and evaluated for accuracy and group consistency, with additional testing on LAMA/NLI/NLU benchmarks.

## Key Results
- NSP task improves CondaQA accuracy by 1.8%-9.1% and group consistency by 2.1%-17.6% across BERT and RoBERTa architectures
- NSP consistently outperforms NSPP task, with joint training showing no additional benefits
- Improvements are robust across model sizes (base and large) without degrading performance on non-negated inputs
- EWC regularization helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting on LAMA probes during pre-training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The NSP task works by exposing models to explicit polarity contrasts during pre-training, forcing them to distinguish between affirmative and negated sentence pairs. By using grammatical transformations to create negative examples (rather than random sentences), the model learns to associate specific linguistic patterns with negation. The polarity reversal process requires the model to understand how negation affects the meaning and grammatical structure of sentences, creating a stronger signal than simple negation detection. This targeted exposure to negation during the pre-training phase builds more robust representations that transfer to downstream negation understanding tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wikipedia sentence extraction**: Understanding how to filter and pair sentences with negation constraints is crucial for building the pre-training corpus. Quick check: Verify 50 random extracted pairs contain valid negation cues meeting the constraints.
- **Grammatical polarity reversal**: The rule-based system for creating negative examples must maintain grammaticality while inverting meaning. Quick check: Manually inspect 100 reversed sentences to ensure <10% are ungrammatical.
- **Cross-entropy loss optimization**: Proper implementation of binary classification loss is essential for both NSPP and NSP tasks. Quick check: Confirm training loss decreases steadily and validation loss stabilizes within 3 epochs.
- **Early stopping criteria**: The patience=3 parameter prevents overfitting during pre-training. Quick check: Monitor validation loss and ensure training stops within 10 epochs for stable runs.
- **Group consistency metrics**: Understanding how to measure consistent negation handling across related examples. Quick check: Calculate group consistency on a small CondaQA subset to verify implementation.
- **EWC regularization**: The regularization term (λ=1e-3) prevents forgetting of prior knowledge during pre-training. Quick check: Compare LAMA probe performance with and without EWC during pre-training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Wikipedia corpus extraction -> Sentence pair filtering -> Polarity reversal system -> Pre-training tasks (NSPP/NSP) -> Fine-tuning on CondaQA -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
The most critical path is the polarity reversal system, as it directly affects the quality of negative examples used in NSP task. Errors here propagate through pre-training and degrade downstream performance. The second critical component is the sentence filtering pipeline, which ensures only valid negation-containing sentences are used for training.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The authors chose rule-based polarity reversal over more sophisticated methods to maintain interpretability and control, accepting a 4% error rate for grammaticality. They limited negation cues to three common forms to create a focused but potentially narrow training signal. The decision to use Wikipedia as the sole corpus prioritizes data quality and consistency over domain diversity.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Unacceptable grammatical errors in polarity-reversed sentences (>10% of samples)
- Validation loss plateaus early or shows high variance across runs
- CondaQA accuracy improvements don't materialize after pre-training
- Performance degradation on non-negated inputs despite claims of robustness
- EWC regularization fails to prevent catastrophic forgetting on LAMA probes

**First Experiments:**
1. Extract 1,000 Wikipedia sentence pairs with negation and verify filtering constraints are correctly applied
2. Implement polarity reversal rules and test on 100 affirmative sentences, checking grammaticality and meaning inversion
3. Pre-train BERT-base on 10,000 NSP pairs for 2 epochs and evaluate on a small CondaQA subset to verify the training pipeline works

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does scaling pre-training to the full dataset (approx. 12.8M samples) yield significant performance gains over the 1M sample subset used in this study?
- Do the NSP and NSPP tasks generalize to other model architectures (e.g., decoder-only models) and pre-training corpora beyond Wikipedia?
- Does including more than two sentences of context during pre-training improve the model's ability to reason over negation?

## Limitations
- The study is limited to encoder-only architectures (BERT/RoBERTa) and Wikipedia corpus, restricting generalizability to other model types and domains
- The polarity reversal system has a 4% error rate that may affect pre-training signal quality, though the authors consider this acceptable
- No systematic investigation of downstream task transfer beyond negation-focused benchmarks, with minimal improvements on LAMA, NLI, and NLU tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: NSP task consistently improves CondaQA accuracy (1.8%-9.1%) and group consistency (2.1%-17.6%) across architectures and model sizes. This result is directly supported by multiple ablations and statistical tests.

**Medium confidence**: The relative underperformance of NSPP compared to NSP is convincing, but the paper does not explore why the negation-detection task fails to provide additional benefit when combined with polarity-based training.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about robustness without degradation on non-negated inputs are supported, but the secondary benchmarks (LAMA, NLI, NLU) show minimal or no improvement, suggesting the gains are negation-specific rather than representing broad language understanding improvements.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the proportion of negated vs. affirmative sentence pairs in pre-training data to determine if the 50/50 split is optimal for learning negation representations
2. Implement a more sophisticated polarity reversal system using a pre-trained grammatical error correction model to reduce the 4% error rate and measure impact on downstream performance
3. Evaluate the pre-trained models on a broader range of negation types (double negation, negative quantifiers, presupposition triggers) beyond the "not/n't/never" constraint to assess generalizability of the approach
