# Federated Distillation Assisted Vehicle Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight DDPM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09378
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09378
- Reference count: 25
- This paper addresses vehicle edge caching with privacy preservation and minimal communication overhead through federated distillation and lightweight DDPM

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme using lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic models (LDPM) to predict vehicle user content preferences while preserving privacy and minimizing communication overhead. The approach combines LDPM for personalized content prediction, federated distillation to reduce communication overhead, and incorporates vehicle mobility for adaptive caching. The method achieves up to 52.14% cache hit percentage with only 1.78 MB communication overhead, significantly outperforming baselines while being robust to vehicle speed variations.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses lightweight DDPM (770K parameters) for personalized content prediction, federated distillation to reduce communication overhead, and mobility-aware cache weighting. Vehicles generate synthetic data samples via reverse diffusion to improve sparse rating predictions, share knowledge through distillation rather than model parameters, and prioritize content based on residence time in RSU coverage. The system operates in three phases: knowledge collection and aggregation, local model training with distillation, and content prediction with mobility-weighted caching.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 52.14% cache hit percentage with only 1.78 MB communication overhead
- Reduces communication overhead by >98% compared to FedAvg (1.78 MB vs 1849.80 MB)
- Maintains stable cache hit performance across vehicle speeds (15-35 m/s)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Lightweight DDPM generates preference-aligned synthetic data to improve content prediction for sparse user ratings. The generative process performs reverse diffusion to create F sample data points per user, which are decoded and aggregated into content preference scores. The diffusion model fills unrated items with learned distribution information rather than zeros.

### Mechanism 2
Knowledge distillation replaces parameter transmission, reducing communication overhead by >98% while preserving collaborative learning. Vehicles share hash-code and vehicle-index pairs (HI) and model-output and vehicle-index pairs (KI) instead of full model weights. RSUs aggregate knowledge from similar users and redistribute via KL divergence loss terms.

### Mechanism 3
Mobility-aware cache weighting prioritizes content from vehicles with longer RSU residence time. Cache scores weight each vehicle's recommendations by position (distance from RSU entrance) divided by speed, giving higher weight to slower vehicles closer to RSU entry.

## Foundational Learning

- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**: Understanding how forward diffusion adds noise and reverse diffusion recovers data is essential to grasp why LDPM can generate preference-informed synthetic ratings. Quick check: Can you explain why the simplified loss function L_simple optimizes noise prediction rather than direct data reconstruction?

- **Knowledge Distillation in Federated Settings**: The core innovation replaces parameter sharing with knowledge (logits/soft labels) sharing; understanding distillation loss terms is required to modify the aggregation scheme. Quick check: How does KL divergence between output distributions enable knowledge transfer without raw data access?

- **Collaborative Filtering with Sparse Data**: The paper explicitly addresses the cold-start/sparse-rating problem; knowing why unrated items ≠ negative preferences prevents misinterpretation of zero entries. Quick check: Why does treating unrated items as zeros bias traditional similarity calculations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Vehicle side (pre-trained encoder/decoder, local LDPM, distillation module, hash encoder) -> RSU side (communication module, caching module, Knowledge Cache) -> MBS side (full content store, KC aggregation)

- **Critical path**: Vehicle enters RSU → uploads HI pair → RSU finds C similar users via cosine similarity on hash codes → RSU retrieves and averages their KI knowledge → sends to vehicle → vehicle trains local LDPM with distillation loss → vehicle generates F samples via reverse diffusion → decoder → preference scores → vehicle uploads KI pair + top-M content list → RSU updates cache with mobility-weighted scoring

- **Design tradeoffs**: Model size vs prediction quality (770K parameters balances vehicle compute constraints against generative capacity); Number of neighbors C (higher C increases knowledge diversity but dilutes similarity signal); Samples F (more samples improve preference estimation but increase inference latency)

- **Failure signatures**: Convergence stalls at high loss (check learning rate η=0.1 and temperature δ=2); Cache hit drops at high speeds (verify KC update frequency); Similarity matching returns few neighbors (threshold γ may be too restrictive)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline convergence test: Run LDPM training on MovieLens subset and plot loss vs episodes; 2) Communication overhead comparison: Measure total data transferred for FedAvg vs distillation scheme; 3) Speed robustness test: Vary vehicle speed from 15-35 m/s and plot cache hit percentage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- Lightweight LDPM architecture modifications (quarter channels, 3 feature map resolutions) lack detailed justification for their specific design choices
- Encoder/decoder dimensions for latent-space training remain unspecified, creating a critical gap for reproduction
- Similarity threshold γ and neighbor count C parameters significantly impact knowledge aggregation quality but are not reported in the results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Federated distillation mechanism showing >98% communication overhead reduction is well-supported by established knowledge distillation literature
- **Medium confidence**: LDPM's content prediction capability shows reasonable performance (52.14% cache hit), but lightweight architecture modifications lack ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: Mobility-aware caching weighting demonstrates stable performance across speeds, but the assumption that slower vehicles generate more reliable preference signals lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture ablation study**: Test LDPM variants with different channel reductions and feature map resolutions to quantify the impact of each lightweight modification on cache hit percentage and communication overhead

2. **Neighbor similarity sensitivity**: Systematically vary C (1-50 neighbors) and γ (0.5-0.9 similarity thresholds) to identify optimal knowledge aggregation parameters and assess robustness to heterogeneous user bases

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate the complete federated distillation scheme on Netflix Prize or Yahoo! Music datasets to verify performance transferability beyond MovieLens 1M, particularly for different rating scales and content types
