# Addressing Logical Fallacies In Scientific Reasoning From Large Language Models: Towards a Dual-Inference Training Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04228
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04228
- Reference count: 11
- The paper proposes a dual-reasoning training framework to address LLM vulnerability to logical fallacies in scientific reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical vulnerability in large language models (LLMs): their systematic misclassification of counterfactual and negated statements, particularly in scientific domains like medicine and environmental science. The authors demonstrate that even large models (up to 12B parameters) struggle with fallacies such as denying the antecedent and affirming the consequent, showing error rates of 50-60% on these patterns. To address this, they propose a dual-reasoning training framework that combines traditional affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial, formalizing a computational analogue of "denying the antecedent" to enhance robustness and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LLM reasoning vulnerability by testing classification of valid (P⇒Q) vs. fallacious logical variants across medical and environmental science domains. They construct 200 canonical premise-consequence pairs (100 per domain), each expanded to 8 logical variants via negation and rearrangement. The dual-reasoning framework proposes a composite loss function L_dual(θ) = L_pos(θ) + λ·L_neg(θ), where L_pos is standard next-token prediction and L_neg is a negation-aware penalty that forces the model to distinguish when conclusions should not follow from negated premises. The framework is theoretically grounded in contrastive learning principles and cognitive science research on category formation.

## Key Results
- LLMs systematically misclassify counterfactual and negated statements, with error rates of 50-60% on fallacies like denying the antecedent (¬P⇒¬Q) and affirming the consequent (Q⇒P)
- Parameter scaling alone (tested up to 12B parameters) is insufficient to overcome logical fallacy vulnerabilities
- The proposed dual-reasoning framework aims to enhance robustness by forcing separate representations for valid vs. invalid premise-conclusion pairs through gradient divergence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Loss Gradient Divergence
Adding an explicit negation-aware loss term forces the model to develop separate representations for valid versus invalid premise-conclusion pairs. The dual objective L_dual(θ) = L_pos(θ) + λ·L_neg(θ) introduces gradient terms that push p(Q|P) and p(Q|¬P) apart. Where affirmation-only models satisfy p(Q|P) ≈ p(Q|¬P) (cannot distinguish), dual-trained models satisfy p(Q|P) > p(Q|¬P) for pairs where ¬P ↛ Q. This works because there exist learnable features distinguishing when conclusions should versus should not follow.

### Mechanism 2: Counterfactual Boundary Shaping via Negative Sampling
Structured exposure to negated premises sharpens semantic category boundaries, reducing overgeneralization. Analogous to contrastive learning (SimCLR, word2vec negative sampling), the model learns not just what follows but what does NOT follow. This shapes latent space to encode meaningful dissimilarity. Negation carries informational content that can be leveraged computationally, consistent with cognitive science findings on category formation.

### Mechanism 3: Scale-Independent Reasoning Deficits
Logical fallacy vulnerability persists across model scales because the underlying training paradigm lacks disconfirmation mechanisms. Scaling increases exposure to linguistic patterns but does not introduce explicit signals for rejecting invalid inferences. Empirical results show larger models (Gemma 3, 12B) still misclassify fallacies like Q⇒P at ~60% rates, indicating structural (training paradigm) rather than capacity-related (model size) issues.

## Foundational Learning

- **Modus Ponens vs. Logical Fallacies**: Why needed here - The entire framework contrasts valid affirmation (P⇒Q given P) with fallacies like denying the antecedent (¬P ⇒ ¬Q) and affirming the consequent (Q ⇒ P). Quick check: Given "If it rains, the ground is wet," what can you NOT conclude if "the ground is wet"?

- **Contrastive Learning**: Why needed here - The dual-reasoning framework is theoretically grounded in how negative samples shape representations (SimCLR, word2vec negative sampling). Quick check: Why does contrastive loss include both positive pairs (similar) and negative pairs (dissimilar)?

- **Loss Function Composition**: Why needed here - The proposed L_dual = L_pos + λ·L_neg requires understanding how weighted loss terms interact during gradient descent. Quick check: What does the hyperparameter λ control in a composite loss function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Standard transformer LLM (f_θ: P → Q) with dual training objectives -> Data augmentation pipeline: Generate ¬P variants for each premise-consequence pair -> Loss compositor: L_pos (standard next-token) + λ·L_neg (negation-aware penalty) -> Evaluation harness: 8-way logical variant testing (P⇒Q, ¬P⇒Q, Q⇒P, etc.)

- **Critical path**: 1. Curate premise-consequence pairs (P, Q) from domain corpora 2. Generate negated premises ¬P (and optionally ¬Q) 3. Train with dual objective, tuning λ 4. Evaluate on all 8 logical variants to measure fallacy reduction

- **Design tradeoffs**: λ tuning: Too high → model becomes over-cautious, rejects valid inferences; too low → no benefit. Data quality: Negation generation must be semantically accurate; malformed negations add noise. Domain specificity: Medical vs. environmental vs. general reasoning may require different curricula

- **Failure signatures**: Model correctly handles P⇒Q but still fails on Q⇒P (affirming the consequent) → L_neg may not be generalizing to inverse patterns. Performance degrades on standard benchmarks → λ too high or negation data quality issues. No divergence between p(Q|P) and p(Q|¬P) → gradient signal from L_neg not propagating

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce the paper's evaluation on GPT-2 with the medical/environmental statements to establish baseline fallacy rates. 2. Implement L_neg on a small transformer (e.g., 125M params) and measure error reduction on the 8 logical variants. 3. Ablate λ values (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) to find the regularization sweet spot; track both fallacy reduction and standard benchmark performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does training an LLM with the proposed dual-inference objective (L_dual) yield significantly better performance on logical fallacy detection than standard training paradigms? The paper proposes this framework but does not present results from a model actually trained using the dual-loss function. Empirical benchmarks comparing a model trained on L_dual against a baseline model on tasks requiring the rejection of invalid premises would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What are the most effective methods for generating or curating datasets that explicitly incorporate the negation and counterfactual cases required for counterfactual denial? While the paper defines the logical taxonomy, it does not detail how to scalably construct the specific negative samples (¬P) needed to compute the negative loss term (L_neg). A study evaluating the quality and robustness of models trained on various synthetic or human-curated counterfactual datasets would provide answers.

### Open Question 3
Can the dual-reasoning framework be effectively integrated into evaluation pipelines to mitigate harmful bias and enhance ethical safeguards? The paper establishes the logical framework but leaves the specific application to "societal dimensions" and bias mitigation as an unexplored trajectory. Experiments showing that dual-reasoning models exhibit lower bias scores or higher safety alignment compared to standard affirmation-only models on established fairness benchmarks would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The dual-reasoning framework is proposed conceptually but the actual training pipeline implementation is not fully specified in the paper
- The paper focuses on binary TRUE/FALSE classification, which may not capture the full spectrum of LLM uncertainty or nuanced reasoning
- The evaluation is limited to medical and environmental science domains, potentially missing domain-specific reasoning patterns

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The empirical observation that LLMs systematically misclassify counterfactual and negated statements (Section 3 results)
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that parameter scaling alone is insufficient to overcome logical fallacy vulnerabilities
- **Medium Confidence**: The theoretical mechanism of dual-loss gradient divergence and its role in separating valid vs. invalid premise-conclusion pairs

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce baseline fallacy rates**: Run the evaluation protocol on GPT-2 (774M) and at least one other open model (e.g., LLaMA 3 8B) using the provided or reconstructed statement sets. Verify that error rates for denying the antecedent (¬P⇒¬Q) and affirming the consequent (Q⇒P) are in the 50-60% range as reported.

2. **Implement and test L_neg**: Code a minimal version of the negation-aware loss (e.g., using a simple cross-entropy penalty on ¬P variants) and train a small transformer (125M params) on a synthetic logical dataset. Measure the reduction in fallacy misclassification compared to standard next-token training.

3. **Ablate λ for optimal regularization**: Systematically vary λ in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0] during dual-training. For each value, report both fallacy reduction (e.g., in ¬P⇒¬Q accuracy) and degradation on standard benchmarks (e.g., P⇒Q accuracy). Identify the λ that maximizes the fallacy reduction without harming valid inference performance.
