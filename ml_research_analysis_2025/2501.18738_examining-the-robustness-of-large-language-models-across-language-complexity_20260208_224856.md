# Examining the Robustness of Large Language Models across Language Complexity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.18738
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18738
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: LLMs detect SRL constructs with AUCs 0.801-0.918; syntactic/semantic complexity affects performance differently across constructs

## Executive Summary
This study examines how large language models (LLMs) detect student self-regulated learning (SRL) constructs in math problem-solving across texts with varying linguistic complexity. Using a digital math platform dataset, the research finds that while lexical complexity shows no performance differences, syntactic and semantic complexity reveal nuanced variations: contextual representation detection improves with complex syntax, data transformation detection improves with simpler syntax, and numerical representation detection benefits from higher semantic cohesion.

## Method Summary
The study trains neural network classifiers to detect four SRL constructs (numerical representation, contextual representation, outcome orientation, data transformation) in student responses from 182 Thinklets across 79 middle school students. Text is vectorized using OpenAI's sentence-embedding-3-short (1536-dim), and models are evaluated with 10-fold student-level cross-validation. Performance is compared across high/low complexity groups using median splits on linguistic measures: Mass score (lexical), syntactic simplicity, and deep cohesion.

## Key Results
- Overall model performance: AUCs range from 0.801-0.918 across SRL constructs
- Lexical complexity shows no significant performance differences between high/low groups
- Syntactic complexity affects constructs differently: contextual representation improves with complex syntax, data transformation improves with simpler syntax
- Semantic cohesion benefits numerical representation detection but shows no effect on contextual representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Syntactic complexity affects SRL construct detection in opposite directions depending on whether the target construct is expressed through contextual narrative or mathematical formalism.
- Core assumption: The linguistic patterns students use to express different SRL behaviors systematically differ in syntactic structure, and these differences persist in the embedding space.
- Evidence: Abstract states "contextual representation detection was better with more complex syntax, data transformation detection improved with simpler syntax" and section 4 explains equation formulation uses simpler syntax.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic cohesion differentially impacts detection of constructs requiring cross-sentence integration versus localized detail extraction.
- Core assumption: The embedding model preserves semantic cohesion signals that interact constructively with NR detection but add noise for CR detection.
- Evidence: Abstract notes "numerical representation detection was better with higher semantic cohesion" and section 4 explains NR requires understanding how numerical values relate across text.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lexical complexity shows minimal impact on model performance due to constrained variance in middle school student writing samples.
- Core assumption: The null result reflects dataset constraints rather than true model invariance to lexical complexity.
- Evidence: Section 4 states "students' textual responses are more homogeneous in lexical complexity" and Table 2 shows narrow Mass score distribution (mean=0.03, SD=0.03).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Constructs and SMART Model
  - Why needed: The detectors target five cognitive operations; understanding what each construct measures is essential for interpreting why linguistic complexity affects them differently.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why "contextual representation" and "data transformation" might require different syntactic patterns in student writing?

- Concept: Coh-Metrix Linguistic Indices
  - Why needed: The study uses syntactic simplicity (inverse of complexity) and deep cohesion as complexity measures; misinterpreting these scales leads to incorrect conclusions.
  - Quick check: If a text scores 85 on syntactic simplicity, is it syntactically complex or simple? What about a deep cohesion score of 20?

- Concept: Embedding-Based Classification Pipeline
  - Why needed: The architecture freezes a pre-trained embedding model and trains only the classifier; this design choice limits what linguistic signals the system can learn to weight.
  - Quick check: If syntactic complexity affects detection, can the classifier layer directly learn to weight syntax, or is it constrained by what the embedding model represents?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text preprocessing -> Embedding extraction (sentence-embedding-3-short) -> Neural network classifier (single hidden layer) -> Construct prediction
- Critical path: Text preprocessing → embedding extraction → model inference → construct prediction. Complexity stratification happens during evaluation, not training.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing embeddings vs. fine-tuning: Frozen embeddings limit adaptation to domain-specific language patterns but reduce overfitting risk with small data (182 Thinklets)
  - Single hidden layer vs. deeper network: Simpler architecture chosen given limited samples; may underfit complex construct-signal relationships
  - Median-split complexity analysis vs. continuous modeling: Binary split enables clear comparison but loses nuance in complexity gradients
- Failure signatures:
  - Low AUC with high variance across folds: Likely class imbalance or insufficient signal
  - Large performance gap between high/low complexity groups: Model may be biased toward certain writing styles
  - Inconsistent results across complexity dimensions: Signals that construct-linguistic interactions are real
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace median-split with regression analysis to capture gradient effects and test if thresholds identified are stable
  2. Apply detectors to a different math platform or student population to test whether complexity effects generalize
  3. Compare sentence-embedding-3-short against other embeddings to determine if cohesion sensitivity is embedding-dependent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do these robustness findings generalize to datasets containing texts with a broader range of language complexity?
- Basis: The authors state they "plan to replicate this analysis with other datasets, potentially involving texts with a broader range of complexity"
- Why unresolved: The current study was limited by the specific linguistic characteristics of the sample where responses were relatively homogeneous
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the analysis on a corpus with high variance in Mass scores and syntactic structures

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the observed robustness to lexical complexity a genuine model feature or an artifact of low variance in the dataset?
- Basis: The discussion notes that "students' textual responses are more homogeneous in lexical complexity," which likely explains why models performed equally well on high and low lexical groups
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if models would remain robust if exposed to texts with extreme differences in vocabulary richness
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled evaluation of model performance on texts specifically manipulated to have significantly differing Mass scores

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does syntactic complexity have opposing effects on different SRL constructs?
- Basis: The authors found divergent results and hypothesized that equation formulation involves simpler syntax while contextual details are more complex
- Why unresolved: This explanation is a post-hoc hypothesis; the study did not empirically verify if linguistic structure drives the performance difference
- What evidence would resolve it: A feature importance analysis or controlled experiment where syntactic complexity is systematically varied while holding the SRL construct constant

## Limitations

- Small dataset (182 Thinklets from 79 students) limits generalizability of findings
- Manual coding of SRL constructs introduces potential subjectivity despite acceptable inter-rater reliability
- Median splits for complexity stratification may oversimplify continuous linguistic complexity and reduce statistical power

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Overall model performance (AUCs: 0.801-0.918) and observation that lexical complexity had minimal impact
- Medium Confidence: Differential effects of syntactic and semantic complexity on specific SRL constructs require replication with larger, more diverse datasets
- Low Confidence: Proposed mechanisms explaining why certain constructs are sensitive to specific complexity dimensions are speculative and not directly tested

## Next Checks

1. Replace median-split analysis with regression-based modeling to test whether complexity-construct interactions hold across the full range of linguistic measures
2. Apply trained detectors to student responses from a different math platform or educational context to assess whether complexity effects are robust across datasets
3. Compare performance using sentence-embedding-3-short against alternative embeddings (e.g., domain-adapted or smaller models) to determine if the observed cohesion sensitivity is embedding-specific or inherent to the task
