# EPEE: Towards Efficient and Effective Foundation Models in Biomedicine

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02053
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02053
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid early exiting strategy that reduces inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy across biomedical tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy for foundation models in biomedical applications that dynamically determines optimal inference depth. By combining entropy-based and patience-based criteria, EPEE enables models to exit early when predictions are sufficiently confident or consistent, addressing the "overthinking" problem common in deep transformer architectures. The method is evaluated across twelve datasets spanning three biomedical tasks using four foundation models, demonstrating significant inference time reductions while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Method Summary
EPEE is a hybrid early exiting strategy that dynamically determines optimal inference depth by combining entropy-based and patience-based criteria. The method monitors prediction confidence through entropy measures and prediction consistency through patience-based monitoring across layers. When either criterion is satisfied, the model exits early, reducing computational overhead. The approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any foundation model architecture, with particular benefits for deep transformer models that often produce redundant computations at later layers.

## Key Results
- EPEE significantly reduces inference time across all evaluated models and datasets
- Accuracy is maintained or improved compared to baseline models without early exiting
- The method demonstrates flexibility across different foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, ViT) and biomedical tasks (classification, relation extraction, event extraction)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EPEE addresses the inefficiency of deep foundation models that continue processing through all layers even when confident predictions can be made earlier. By monitoring both entropy (prediction uncertainty) and patience (consistency across layers), the method identifies optimal exit points that balance computational efficiency with prediction quality. This hybrid approach prevents both premature exits (which could compromise accuracy) and unnecessary computation (which wastes resources without improving predictions).

## Foundational Learning
- **Early exiting strategies**: Why needed - to reduce inference time in deep models; Quick check - verify exit points don't compromise prediction quality
- **Entropy-based confidence measurement**: Why needed - quantifies prediction uncertainty; Quick check - ensure entropy thresholds are appropriately calibrated
- **Patience-based consistency monitoring**: Why needed - tracks prediction stability across layers; Quick check - validate patience parameters prevent premature exits
- **Foundation model efficiency**: Why needed - biomedical applications require real-time inference; Quick check - measure practical runtime improvements
- **Transformer architecture characteristics**: Why needed - understanding layer redundancy patterns; Quick check - analyze activation similarity across layers
- **Biomedical task diversity**: Why needed - validate method across different problem types; Quick check - ensure consistent performance across task categories

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Foundation Model Layers -> Exit Point Decision (Entropy + Patience) -> Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the decision mechanism that determines when to exit, combining entropy calculations and patience monitoring. This must operate efficiently to not negate the computational savings from early exiting.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method balances between early exits (maximizing efficiency) and late exits (maximizing accuracy). The hybrid approach aims to optimize this tradeoff, but requires careful calibration of entropy thresholds and patience parameters for each specific model and task.

**Failure Signatures**: Premature exits may occur if entropy thresholds are too lenient or patience parameters too short, leading to reduced accuracy. Conversely, overly conservative settings may result in minimal efficiency gains as the model rarely exits early.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation without early exiting to establish reference accuracy and inference time
2. Ablation study comparing entropy-only versus patience-only early exiting approaches
3. Sensitivity analysis varying entropy thresholds and patience parameters to identify optimal configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on transformer-based architectures, limiting generalizability claims to other model families
- Datasets represent a relatively narrow slice of biomedical applications, potentially missing domain-specific challenges
- Performance metrics emphasize inference time and accuracy but lack comprehensive evaluation of downstream task quality and clinical impacts

## Confidence
- **Efficiency improvements**: High confidence - consistent empirical evidence across multiple models and datasets
- **Effectiveness preservation/improved**: Medium confidence - accuracy claims supported but could benefit from more statistical validation
- **Generalizability to any foundation model**: Low confidence - evaluation limited to four transformer-based models only

## Next Checks
1. Test EPEE on non-transformer architectures (e.g., ConvNets, RNNs) to verify general applicability claims
2. Conduct cross-domain validation by applying EPEE to biomedical tasks outside evaluated categories (e.g., medical image segmentation)
3. Perform ablation studies isolating contributions of entropy-based versus patience-based components to quantify individual impacts
