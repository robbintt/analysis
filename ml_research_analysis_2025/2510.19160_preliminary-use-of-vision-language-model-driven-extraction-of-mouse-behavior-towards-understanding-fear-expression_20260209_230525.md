- One-line primary result: Vision-language model pipeline achieves strong F1 scores for mouse behavior classification without fine-tuning.

## Executive Summary
This work develops a vision-language model (VLM) pipeline for annotating mouse behavior from video with minimal supervision. Using Qwen2.5-VL, the approach combines prompt engineering, in-context learning (ICL) with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing to classify behaviors like freezing, fleeing, and exploring/grooming at one-second resolution. Each component contributes meaningfully: ICL improves detection of rare behaviors, while frame-wise input enhances overall accuracy. The combined pipeline achieves strong F1 scores across all behavior classes without model fine-tuning. The method enables integration of behavioral features into broader neuroscience datasets, supporting more nuanced studies of fear and safety learning. Future work will explore richer environmental annotations and human-in-the-loop correction mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The pipeline uses Qwen2.5-VL without fine-tuning, applying frame-level preprocessing (splitting video into 1-second segments, decomposing each into individual frames), ICL with labeled examples, and both simple and complex prompts with behavior definitions. Each second of video is processed independently to produce a single behavior label, which is aggregated into a temporal behavior vector for downstream integration with neural datasets.

## Key Results
- The combined pipeline achieves strong F1 scores across all behavior classes (freezing, fleeing, exploring/grooming) without model fine-tuning
- ICL improves detection of rare behaviors, particularly fleeing (0.6% prevalence)
- Frame-level preprocessing enhances accuracy by compensating for VLMs' weak temporal reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frame-level preprocessing compensates for VLMs' weak temporal reasoning.
- Mechanism: By splitting video into one-second segments and decomposing each into individual frames, the pipeline forces the model to observe all visual content rather than relying on internal frame sampling. This reduces the burden of temporal reasoning and constrains output to single labels, limiting cascading errors.
- Core assumption: The model's visual recognition capabilities are stronger than its temporal sequencing abilities, and brief behaviors can be classified from static frame aggregates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "frame-level preprocessing... each of these methods contributes to improved classification"
  - [section 2.3] "VLMs are known to struggle with temporal reasoning, especially in tasks such as second-by-second and timelapse interpretation"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on hardware input devices or LLM compression, not VLM temporal limitations.
- Break condition: If behaviors require motion trajectory across multiple seconds (e.g., distinguishing "rearing" from "stretch-attend" based on ascent speed), frame-level input without explicit motion encoding may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning (ICL) with few-shot visual demonstrations rescues rare-class detection without fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: Labeled example frames are prepended to the target input, providing reference patterns the model can match. This is particularly effective for underrepresented behaviors (fleeing at 0.6%, freezing at 12.7%) where the model lacks sufficient priors from pre-training.
- Core assumption: The VLM can perform visual analogy from few examples in the same context window, and held-out examples are representative of test distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ICL improves detection of rare behaviors"
  - [section 2.4] "ICL can be particularly effective in helping VLMs reason about complex and domain specific behaviors... by providing a few labeled visual examples as context"
  - [section 3] "With ICL, the model begins to label fleeing behavior and achieves consistent improvements in freezing detection"
  - [corpus] Limited support; corpus neighbor "Videoicl: Confidence-based iterative in-context learning for out-of-distribution video understanding" (arXiv:2412.02186) suggests ICL for video is emerging but not yet standard.
- Break condition: If ICL examples are drawn from different lighting, camera angles, or mouse strains than test data, visual mismatch may degrade rather than help performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Complex prompts with explicit behavior definitions improve classification boundary decisions.
- Mechanism: Providing definitions (e.g., "Freezing = absolutely no visible movement across the whole second") reduces ambiguity in edge cases and guides the model toward domain-specific interpretations rather than colloquial understanding.
- Core assumption: The model can parse and apply detailed textual constraints to visual classification, and human-provided definitions align with ground-truth annotation criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.5] "complex prompt includes behavior definitions to provide additional guidance"
  - [section 3] "The complex prompt improves Grooming/Exploring and slightly boosts freezing recognition"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on prompt complexity for VLM behavior tasks.
- Break condition: If behavior definitions are internally inconsistent or conflict with actual annotator practice (e.g., if "fleeing" annotations in ground truth include borderline cases not captured by the definition), the model may learn the wrong boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **In-Context Learning (ICL)**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline relies entirely on ICL—no gradient updates occur. You must understand how to format examples, why example order and selection matter, and how ICL differs from fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: Given 3 labeled examples of mouse behavior, can you explain why presenting them in order of increasing behavioral complexity (exploring → freezing → fleeing) might differ from random order?

- Concept: **Class Imbalance and Per-Class F1**
  - Why needed here: The dataset is 86.7% grooming/exploring, 12.7% freezing, 0.6% fleeing. Accuracy would be misleading; the paper reports F1 scores. You must understand why and how to interpret them.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts "Exploring/Grooming" for every second, what would its accuracy be? What would its F1 for fleeing be?

- Concept: **Temporal Tokenization in VLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly works around VLMs' poor temporal reasoning by frame-splitting. Understanding *why* VLMs struggle (sparse frame sampling, no explicit motion encoding) informs whether this workaround generalizes.
  - Quick check question: Why might feeding 30 frames from one second as independent images produce different results than feeding a 1-second video clip, even if both contain the same pixels?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw video -> split into 1-second segments -> decompose each segment to individual frames -> prompt assembly (system prompt + behavior definitions + ICL examples + target frames) -> VLM Core (Qwen2.5-VL) -> single behavior label per second -> aggregated into temporal behavior vector

- Critical path:
  1. Video preprocessing (frame extraction) -> must preserve all frames, no subsampling
  2. ICL example selection -> must be from held-out set, representative of rare classes
  3. Prompt construction -> complex prompt with definitions for ambiguous behaviors
  4. Model inference -> one call per second of video
  5. Label aggregation -> concatenate into session-level behavior vector

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frame-wise vs. video input: Frame-wise is more accurate but increases inference cost linearly with frame rate (30x more tokens for 30 fps)
  - ICL example count: More examples may help rare classes but consume context window; paper does not report sensitivity analysis
  - Simple vs. complex prompts: Complex prompts help but require domain expertise to author definitions; simple prompts are more portable across behaviors

- Failure signatures:
  - Temporal hallucination: Model outputs wrong number of labels or misaligned timestamps (mitigated by single-label-per-call design)
  - Rare-class collapse: Fleeing F1 near zero -> indicates ICL examples insufficient or definitions unclear
  - Lighting/angle drift: Performance drops on new videos -> suggests ICL examples not representative of deployment conditions
  - Context overflow: Very long sessions may hit token limits if ICL examples are too numerous

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation validation: Replicate the paper's incremental experiments (no ICL → +ICL → +frame-splitting) on a held-out subset of your own data to confirm each component's contribution before full deployment.
  2. ICL example sensitivity: Test 0, 1, 3, and 5 ICL examples per behavior class to find the knee point where additional examples stop improving rare-class F1.
  3. Cross-context robustness: Train (assemble ICL examples) on videos from one experimental context (threatening environment) and test on another (safe environment) to measure generalization before assuming the pipeline transfers across conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited behavioral vocabulary: Only three coarse-grained classes are modeled, potentially missing nuanced fear-related behaviors like stretch-attend or risk assessment.
- Dataset constraints: The 3240-second corpus is imbalanced and likely from controlled experimental conditions. Performance on naturalistic or multi-animal videos remains untested.
- Hardware dependency: Frame-wise preprocessing assumes stable frame rates and resolution; compressed or variable-frame-rate inputs may require additional preprocessing.

## Confidence
- High confidence: ICL improves rare-class detection and frame-level preprocessing enhances accuracy over video-level input.
- Medium confidence: Complex prompts improve boundary decisions, though this effect is subtle and may depend heavily on prompt quality.
- Low confidence: Generalization to new environments and behaviors, as the paper does not test cross-experimental or cross-laboratory transferability.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a domain shift experiment: Train ICL examples on one experimental condition (e.g., threat context) and evaluate on another (e.g., safety context) to measure robustness to environmental variation.
2. Expand behavioral vocabulary: Add one or two nuanced fear-related classes (e.g., stretch-attend, risk assessment) and retrain ICL examples to test scalability of the prompt-driven approach.
3. Perform cross-laboratory validation: Apply the pipeline to video data from a different lab's setup (different camera angles, lighting, mouse strain) to assess reproducibility beyond the original dataset.
