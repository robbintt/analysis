# The Adaptive Vekua Cascade: A Differentiable Spectral-Analytic Solver for Physics-Informed Representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11776
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11776
- Authors: Vladimer Khasia
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel hybrid architecture achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameters by orders of magnitude

## Executive Summary
The Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC) addresses fundamental limitations in coordinate-based neural networks for representing physical fields, specifically spectral bias and the curse of dimensionality. These pathologies prevent learning high-frequency dynamics and cause parameter explosion in discrete feature grids. AVC introduces a hybrid architecture that combines deep learning with classical approximation theory, learning a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain to project complex dynamics onto a latent manifold where solutions are represented by generalized analytic functions.

The innovation centers on replacing the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver that optimally resolves spectral coefficients in closed form. This approach achieves dramatic improvements in efficiency and accuracy across five physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence, reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude while converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations.

## Method Summary
The Adaptive Vekua Cascade is a hybrid architecture that addresses spectral bias and dimensionality challenges in coordinate-based neural networks through a novel combination of diffeomorphic domain warping and differentiable spectral analysis. The method learns a smooth transformation of the input space that remaps complex physical dynamics onto a latent manifold where generalized analytic functions can represent the solution. Rather than using standard gradient descent for output layer optimization, AVC employs a differentiable linear solver to compute optimal spectral coefficients in closed form. This spectral-analytic approach enables accurate representation of high-frequency features while dramatically reducing the parameter count required for 3D problems. The architecture has been evaluated across five rigorous physics benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with parameter reductions from millions to hundreds and convergence speedups of 2-3x compared to implicit neural representations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across five physics benchmarks including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence
- Reduces parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids)
- Converges 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations while maintaining spectral accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AVC works by learning a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain that transforms complex, high-frequency dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution can be represented as generalized analytic functions. This geometric transformation effectively flattens the spectral content of the problem, making it amenable to efficient spectral representation. The key innovation is replacing the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver that computes optimal spectral coefficients in closed form, eliminating the slow convergence and poor high-frequency representation characteristic of standard neural network training. This hybrid approach leverages classical approximation theory while maintaining end-to-end differentiability, enabling the network to learn optimal domain transformations while efficiently representing the solution in the transformed space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spectral bias**: Neural networks learn low-frequency features first, struggling with high-frequency components - needed to understand why standard CBNNs fail for physical fields with sharp gradients or oscillations; quick check: examine frequency spectrum of learned solutions
- **Curse of dimensionality**: Parameter count grows exponentially with input dimension in discrete feature grids - needed to understand memory constraints in 3D problems; quick check: compare parameter scaling between AVC and standard CBNNs
- **Diffeomorphic warping**: Smooth, invertible transformations of the domain - needed to understand how AVC remaps complex dynamics to amenable manifolds; quick check: visualize learned domain transformations
- **Generalized analytic functions**: Extension of complex analytic functions to more general function spaces - needed to understand the mathematical foundation of the solution representation; quick check: verify satisfaction of Vekua-type conditions
- **Differentiable linear solvers**: End-to-end differentiable optimization of spectral coefficients - needed to understand the closed-form solution approach; quick check: compare convergence speed with gradient descent
- **Implicit neural representations**: Coordinate-based neural networks for continuous signal representation - needed as the baseline architecture being improved; quick check: compare AVC against standard SIREN or similar architectures

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input domain -> Diffeomorphic warping network -> Latent manifold -> Spectral coefficient solver -> Output field

**Critical path:** Physical coordinates → Learnable diffeomorphism → Transformed coordinates → Differentiable linear solver → Spectral coefficients → Physical field reconstruction

**Design tradeoffs:** The architecture trades computational complexity of the linear solver for reduced parameter count and improved spectral convergence. This shifts the optimization burden from iterative gradient descent to a single linear solve, at the cost of solving potentially large linear systems during training. The diffeomorphic warping adds complexity but enables the spectral representation to be effective where it would otherwise fail.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on non-smooth domains where diffeomorphic assumptions break down, slow convergence when the linear system becomes ill-conditioned, and spectral ringing artifacts near discontinuities. The method may also struggle when the optimal warping requires extreme deformations that are difficult to represent with the chosen network architecture.

**First experiments:**
1. Compare AVC against standard SIREN on a simple Helmholtz problem with increasing frequency content
2. Benchmark parameter efficiency on a 2D Navier-Stokes problem with known analytical solution
3. Test diffeomorphic warping robustness on a domain with sharp corners or discontinuities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical foundation assumes smoothness conditions that may not hold for all physical systems
- Computational cost of the differentiable linear solver versus standard gradient descent is not thoroughly analyzed
- Generalizability of the 2-3x convergence speedup across different problem classes needs verification

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark against alternative spectral methods beyond implicit neural representations to validate claimed performance improvements
2. Test on non-smooth physical domains to evaluate diffeomorphic warping robustness under broken smoothness assumptions
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each AVC component (warping, linear solver, spectral representation) to overall performance
