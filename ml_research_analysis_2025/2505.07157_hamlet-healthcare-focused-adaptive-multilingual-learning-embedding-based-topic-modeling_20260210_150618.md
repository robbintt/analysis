# HAMLET: Healthcare-focused Adaptive Multilingual Learning Embedding-based Topic Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07157
- Reference count: 0
- Introduces HAMLET architecture integrating GPT-4o, BERT, and Sentence-BERT for healthcare topic modeling with superior performance metrics

## Executive Summary
HAMLET addresses the critical challenge of topic modeling in healthcare text data through a novel graph-driven architecture that combines Large Language Models with Graph Neural Networks. The approach generates initial topics using GPT-4o, then refines them through a hybrid graph network incorporating BERT and Sentence-BERT embeddings alongside a Semantic-Geometric Similarity method. The system demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like LDA, LSA, and NMF, achieving composite scores between 0.724 and 0.759 while maintaining better topic diversity and coherence metrics across English and French healthcare datasets.

## Method Summary
HAMLET employs a two-stage process: first, GPT-4o generates an initial set of topics from healthcare documents, then a hybrid graph network refines these topics using embeddings from BERT and Sentence-BERT. The architecture integrates these components through a Semantic-Geometric Similarity method that captures both semantic relationships and geometric properties in the embedding space. The approach is designed to be adaptive and multilingual, requiring no human intervention for topic generation while maintaining consistent performance across different document lengths and languages. The graph-driven architecture enables the system to capture complex relationships between topics that traditional vector space models miss.

## Key Results
- Composite scores of 0.724-0.759 significantly outperform traditional methods (LDA, LSA, NMF, BERTopic)
- Topic diversity scores of 0.691-0.835 demonstrate improved topic separation and interpretability
- Consistent performance across English and French healthcare datasets validates multilingual capabilities
- Successfully generates interpretable short-phrase topics suitable for downstream classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture works by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple language models and embedding techniques. GPT-4o provides initial topic generation based on its broad understanding of language patterns, while BERT and Sentence-BERT embeddings capture deeper semantic relationships specific to healthcare contexts. The graph neural network structure allows the system to model complex topic relationships that traditional flat vector representations cannot capture. The Semantic-Geometric Similarity method integrates both semantic proximity and geometric properties of embeddings, enabling more nuanced topic refinement. This multi-modal approach addresses the limitations of single-model topic modeling by combining generative capabilities with discriminative semantic understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- Large Language Models (GPT-4o): Understand broad language patterns for initial topic generation; check by testing on diverse text corpora
- BERT Embeddings: Capture contextual semantic relationships in healthcare text; verify by comparing semantic similarity scores
- Sentence-BERT: Generate sentence-level embeddings for topic representation; validate through clustering quality metrics
- Graph Neural Networks: Model complex relationships between topics in embedding space; test with link prediction tasks
- Semantic-Geometric Similarity: Combine semantic and geometric properties for refined topic modeling; evaluate with ablation studies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Healthcare Documents -> GPT-4o -> Topic Generation -> BERT/Sentence-BERT Embeddings -> Graph Neural Network -> Semantic-Geometric Similarity -> Refined Topics

**Critical Path**: Document Input → GPT-4o Topic Generation → Embedding Layer (BERT/Sentence-BERT) → Graph Network Processing → Similarity Refinement → Final Topics

**Design Tradeoffs**: High accuracy through multiple model integration vs. increased computational complexity and resource requirements; fully automated generation vs. potential model bias without human oversight; multilingual support vs. limited language diversity in testing.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor topic quality when healthcare domain specificity exceeds model training data; degraded performance on languages outside English/French; computational bottlenecks during graph processing with large document sets.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test initial topic generation quality using GPT-4o on a small healthcare dataset
2. Evaluate embedding quality by clustering similar documents using BERT embeddings
3. Validate graph network effectiveness by measuring topic relationship capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on synthetic topic generation without ground truth validation on healthcare-specific datasets
- Requires substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings
- Limited language diversity testing may not generalize to languages with different linguistic structures

## Confidence

**High**: Technical architecture description and performance improvements over traditional methods (LDA, LSA, NMF) are well-documented and reproducible

**Medium**: Claims about multilingual consistency and absence of human intervention are supported but need testing on additional languages and healthcare domains

**Low**: Generalizability to real-world healthcare applications and robustness of Semantic-Geometric Similarity method across different contexts require further validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ground truth validation using expert-annotated healthcare datasets to verify accuracy and clinical relevance of automatically generated topics
2. Test approach on additional languages (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin) and healthcare subdomains (e.g., radiology reports, patient feedback) to assess true multilingual capabilities
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of GPT-4o, BERT, and Sentence-BERT components to overall performance gains
