- One-line primary result: Unified multimodal interleaved document representation with section-level reranking significantly improves retrieval performance over passage-level baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IDentIfy, a novel information retrieval framework that holistically represents and retrieves documents interleaved with multiple modalities—text, images, and tables—using vision-language models. Unlike existing approaches that segment documents into discrete passages or rely on fragmented visual representations, IDentIfy preserves the overall document context and multimodal interactions by encoding the full content into unified representations. Additionally, it introduces a section-level reranking mechanism to pinpoint the most relevant passages within retrieved documents.

The framework achieves significant improvements on four benchmark datasets, with up to 53.0% improvement in R@1 for document retrieval compared to relevant baselines. The approach demonstrates that comprehensive integration of multimodal information and document-level representation combined with section reranking outperforms traditional passage-level retrieval methods. This work addresses a critical gap in handling real-world documents that naturally interleave text, images, and tables without artificial segmentation.

## Method Summary
IDentIfy employs vision-language models to encode entire documents containing interleaved text, images, and tables into unified representations. The framework processes the full document context holistically rather than fragmenting it into discrete passages, preserving multimodal interactions and document structure. After retrieving documents based on these unified representations, IDentIfy applies a section-level reranking mechanism to identify the most relevant passages within each document. This two-stage approach combines the benefits of document-level retrieval with fine-grained passage relevance ranking, enabling effective handling of multimodal documents while maintaining retrieval accuracy and precision.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 53.0% improvement in R@1 for document retrieval compared to relevant baselines
- Demonstrated superior performance across four benchmark datasets for multimodal document retrieval
- Showed that document-level representation with section reranking outperforms passage-level retrieval methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach succeeds by preserving the natural multimodal structure of documents rather than artificially segmenting them. By encoding the full document context with interleaved text, images, and tables into unified representations, the system captures the rich semantic relationships and contextual dependencies that exist between different modalities. The section-level reranking mechanism then leverages these comprehensive representations to accurately pinpoint relevant content within retrieved documents, effectively combining the recall benefits of document-level retrieval with the precision of passage-level ranking.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Why needed - To jointly process and represent multimodal content (text, images, tables) within documents. Quick check - Verify the VLM can handle the specific document layouts and multimodal combinations present in your dataset.
- **Unified Document Representations**: Why needed - To preserve multimodal interactions and document context that would be lost through passage segmentation. Quick check - Test whether unified representations capture relationships between text and visual elements that segmented approaches miss.
- **Section-Level Reranking**: Why needed - To refine document-level retrieval results by identifying the most relevant passages within each document. Quick check - Compare section-level reranking performance against direct passage-level retrieval on the same dataset.
- **Multimodal Integration**: Why needed - Real-world documents contain interleaved text, images, and tables that must be processed cohesively. Quick check - Evaluate retrieval performance when different modalities are present versus absent in test documents.
- **Document Structure Preservation**: Why needed - Maintaining the original document layout and organization helps capture contextual meaning. Quick check - Assess whether structural information contributes to retrieval accuracy by comparing with layout-agnostic approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Document -> VLM Encoder -> Unified Representation -> Document Retrieval -> Section Reranker -> Ranked Passages

Critical Path: Document ingestion flows through the VLM encoder to create unified representations, which are then used for document retrieval. Retrieved documents undergo section-level reranking to produce final ranked passages.

Design Tradeoffs: The unified representation approach trades computational efficiency (processing entire documents) for better multimodal context preservation, while the section reranking adds complexity but improves precision. The framework prioritizes comprehensive context understanding over real-time performance.

Failure Signatures: Retrieval performance may degrade on documents with highly specialized visual content or non-standard layouts that the VLM cannot adequately process. The section reranking may struggle with very long documents or those with weak structural organization.

First Experiments:
1. Test IDentIfy on documents with significantly different layouts and multimodal compositions (e.g., invoices, resumes, or technical manuals) to assess generalizability beyond current benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of each modality (text, images, tables) to verify claimed improvements are not primarily driven by one particular modality
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and memory requirements of section-level reranking mechanism compared to standard passage-level retrieval at scale, including latency measurements for end-to-end query processing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on vision-language model performance and capabilities, which may not generalize equally well to all document types or domains
- Computational complexity added by section-level reranking mechanism may impact real-world deployment efficiency
- Limited discussion of potential biases in VLM training data and their effects on retrieval outcomes across diverse document sources

## Confidence
High confidence: Claims regarding performance improvements (up to 53.0% R@1 gain) are directly supported by quantitative results on established benchmarks.
High confidence: Claim that document-level representation combined with section reranking is more effective than passage-level retrieval is supported by comparative experiments.
Medium confidence: Claims about general applicability to "any" multimodal document format, as experiments primarily focus on structured business documents and scientific papers.

## Next Checks
1. Test IDentIfy on documents with significantly different layouts and multimodal compositions (e.g., invoices, resumes, or technical manuals) to assess generalizability beyond the current benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of each modality (text, images, tables) to verify that the claimed improvements are not primarily driven by one particular modality
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and memory requirements of the section-level reranking mechanism compared to standard passage-level retrieval at scale, including latency measurements for end-to-end query processing
