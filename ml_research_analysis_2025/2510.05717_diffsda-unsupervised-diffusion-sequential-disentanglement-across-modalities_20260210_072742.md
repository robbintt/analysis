# DiffSDA: Unsupervised Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Across Modalities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.05717
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05717
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel diffusion-based framework achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised sequential disentanglement across video, audio, and time series modalities.

## Executive Summary
DiffSDA introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for unsupervised sequential disentanglement across multiple data modalities. The core method models static and dynamic factors as interdependent within a probabilistic framework, enabling the separation of time-invariant and time-dependent variations in sequences without relying on labels. Unlike prior approaches that depend on complex loss formulations or are modality-specific, DiffSDA uses a single diffusion loss term and is adaptable to video, audio, and time series data with minimal architectural changes.

Experiments on high-resolution video datasets (VoxCeleb, CelebV-HQ, TaiChi-HD, MUG), audio benchmarks (TIMIT, LibriSpeech), and time series data (PhysioNet, ETTh1, Air Quality) show that DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods. It achieves lower reconstruction errors, better preservation of identity and motion under conditional swapping (e.g., AED/AKD metrics), and superior speaker identification disentanglement (42.29% gap in TIMIT). Additionally, it supports zero-shot disentanglement and reveals interpretable multifactor variations through latent space exploration.

## Method Summary
DiffSDA replaces traditional VAE/GAN frameworks with a diffusion model that jointly samples static and dynamic factors interdependently. The method uses a Sequential Semantic Encoder (U-Net/MLP + LSTM) to extract a shared static vector $s_0$ and a sequence of low-dimensional dynamic vectors $d^{1:V}_0$ from input sequences. These latents condition a diffusion decoder through Adaptive Group Normalization layers. The framework operates on latent space rather than pixels, using pre-trained VQ-VAE autoencoders for high-resolution video. Training uses a single EDM-style score matching loss without explicit regularization terms, achieving modality-agnostic performance across video, audio, and time series data.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on video datasets with lower AED/AKD metrics and better conditional swapping preservation
- Demonstrates superior speaker identification disentanglement with 42.29% EER gap in TIMIT audio benchmark
- Shows consistent performance across diverse modalities (video, audio, time series) with minimal architectural changes
- Supports zero-shot disentanglement and reveals interpretable multifactor variations through latent space exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Interdependent Prior Modeling
The paper posits that modeling static and dynamic factors as interdependent increases expressivity of marginal distributions and improves generation quality. DiffSDA defines a joint diffusion process where latent variables are sampled simultaneously, contrasting with prior VAE-based methods that assume independence. By allowing factors to interact during the diffusion process, the model captures complex correlations (e.g., specific identity favoring certain motion trajectories) that independent priors would miss.

### Mechanism 2: Implicit Disentanglement via Architectural Constraints
The framework enforces disentanglement through structural constraints rather than loss penalties. The static factor $s_0$ is computed from the final hidden state of an LSTM processing the sequence, forcing it to be time-invariant. Dynamic factors $d^\tau_0$ are low-dimensional vectors (e.g., size 12 or 16), creating a bottleneck that theoretically prevents them from encoding high-dimensional static identity features.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Sequential Encoding
The model achieves modality-agnosticism by isolating sequence processing logic from the generative diffusion decoder. A "Sequential Semantic Encoder" (U-Net for video, MLP for others) processes raw sequences into a latent hierarchy using LSTMs, extracting $s_0$ (summary) and $d_{1:V}$ (residuals). These latents then condition a standard diffusion decoder via Adaptive Group Normalization, keeping the core generative mechanism unchanged across modalities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Score Matching & Diffusion Models (DDPMs)**
  - *Why needed here:* DiffSDA replaces VAE/GAN backbone with a diffusion process. Understanding how networks learn to predict noise to reverse corruption is essential.
  - *Quick check question:* Can you explain why a diffusion model requires a "forward process" (adding noise) to train the "reverse process" (denoising)?

- **Concept: Sequential Disentanglement (Static vs. Dynamic)**
  - *Why needed here:* This is the core objective. Distinguishing between time-invariant factors (e.g., speaker identity) and time-variant factors (e.g., speech content or motion) is fundamental.
  - *Quick check question:* In a video of a car driving, what constitutes the *static* factor and what constitutes the *dynamic* factor?

- **Concept: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**
  - *Why needed here:* DiffSDA operates on compressed latents, not pixels. Understanding the separation between the "perceptual compressor" (VQ-VAE) and the "diffusion model" is critical.
  - *Quick check question:* Why does the paper use a pre-trained VQ-VAE before applying the diffusion process, rather than diffusing directly on raw video frames?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** VQ-VAE Encoder -> Sequential Semantic Encoder (U-Net/MLP + LSTM) -> Stochastic Encoder (adds noise) -> Diffusion Decoder (U-Net with AdaGN)

- **Critical path:** The information flow for disentanglement happens in the Semantic Encoder. The strict separation of the final hidden state ($s_0$) vs. the sequence of residuals ($d_{1:V}$) is where the model forces the split. The Diffusion Decoder merely reconstructs based on these inputs; it does not enforce the disentanglement logic itself.

- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Latent Dimensions ($s_{dim}$ vs $d_{dim}$): Tables show $s_{dim}$ (256-1024) is much larger than $d_{dim}$ (4-64). Increasing $d_{dim}$ improves reconstruction fidelity but risks "leaking" static info into dynamic factors.
  - Dependent vs. Independent Prior: The paper argues for dependent sampling, but implementation requires specific DDIM sampler setup.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Identity Loss in Swap: If swapping dynamics results in face changing, the dynamic bottleneck ($d_{dim}$) is likely too large or the Static Encoder is not effectively forcing sharing across $\tau$.
  - Blurry Reconstructions: If the VQ-VAE is under-trained or the diffusion NFE is too low (< 20), outputs will lack detail.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Reconstruction):** Verify that the autoencoder can reconstruct a sequence $x$ given its own $s, d$ without diffusion sampling (deterministic pass).
  2. **Static/Dynamic Swap:** Manually swap the $s$ vector from Sequence A and $d$ vectors from Sequence B. Feed into the decoder. Visually inspect if the identity is preserved from A and motion from B.
  3. **Latent Traversal (PCA):** Perform PCA on a batch of extracted $s$ vectors. Modify the first principal component and decode. Check if the semantic attribute (e.g., gender) changes smoothly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
The authors state a key challenge ahead lies in fully extending the multifactor exploration procedure to effectively disentangle and represent multiple interacting factors. The current work reveals multifactor variations via post-hoc PCA traversal rather than explicitly learning or supervising multiple factor separation during training.

### Open Question 2
Future work includes extending applicability to more diverse sequence modalities, such as sensor data, noting they present unique challenges regarding varying temporal characteristics. The current model assumes fixed sequence structure and relies on architectures tested on regular video/audio/time-series grids, which may not suit irregular sensor patterns.

### Open Question 3
Optimizing computational efficiency is identified as a necessary direction for future research. While EDM samplers reduce steps (63 NFEs), the framework still relies on iterative diffusion denoising and a VQ-VAE latent space, which is computationally intensive compared to single-step generators.

## Limitations
- The paper's claim that dependency modeling is essential for expressiveness is moderately supported, with performance improvement compared to factorized alternatives not quantified
- Specific hyperparameter choices for stochastic encoding steps are not explicitly listed in the hyperparameter tables
- The method depends on pre-trained VQ-VAE weights for high-resolution video, potentially limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **Interdependent prior modeling:** Medium support - ablation studies show performance degradation when removed, but relative improvement is not quantified
- **Architectural disentanglement mechanism:** High confidence - explicit ablation studies in appendix demonstrate effectiveness
- **Modality-agnostic claim:** Well-supported - consistent performance across video, audio, and time series domains with minimal changes
- **Key uncertainties:** Network specifics for U-Net backbones, stochastic encoding details, and dependency on pre-trained VQ-VAE weights

## Next Checks
1. **Latent Dimension Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the dynamic latent dimension $k$ and static latent dimension $s_{dim}$ to quantify the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and disentanglement quality (using AED/AKD metrics).

2. **Prior Ablation:** Implement and compare a factorized (independent) prior model against the proposed dependent prior to measure the actual performance gap attributed to interdependence modeling.

3. **Encoder Robustness:** Test the semantic encoder with different backbone capacities (shallow vs. deep MLPs/U-Nets) on the same modality to establish the minimum required capacity for effective sequential encoding across domains.
