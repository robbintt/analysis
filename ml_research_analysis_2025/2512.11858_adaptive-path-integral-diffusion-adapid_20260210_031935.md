# Adaptive Path Integral Diffusion: AdaPID

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Adaptive path integral diffusion (AdaPID) with piece-wise constant stiffness enables neural-network-free oracles for Gaussian-mixture sampling and QoS-driven schedule optimization.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AdaPID, an adaptive path integral diffusion framework that generalizes harmonic PID by allowing time-varying stiffness in the quadratic potential. The key innovation is a piece-wise constant parameterization of the stiffness schedule, which enables closed-form Green's functions and stable, neural-network-free oracles for predicted-state maps and scores when the target is a Gaussian mixture. The authors develop a suite of schedule-sensitive quality-of-sampling (QoS) diagnostics, including Wasserstein metrics, cross-entropy, and energy efficiency measures, to guide adaptive scheduling. Experiments in 2D with three Gaussian mixture models demonstrate that QoS-driven schedules improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning, and speciation timing at fixed integration budgets, with optimal schedules often found at finite O(1) stiffness values.

## Method Summary
AdaPID extends harmonic PID by parameterizing the time-varying stiffness βt as a piece-wise constant (PWC) function over a discrete schedule. This allows closed-form computation of Green's functions and stable, neural-network-free oracles for predicted-state maps and scores when the target is a Gaussian mixture. The framework introduces a suite of schedule-sensitive quality-of-sampling (QoS) diagnostics—including Wasserstein metrics, cross-entropy, cost-to-go decompositions, velocity gradient statistics, drift-diffusion balance, Langevin mismatch, auto-correlations, energy efficiency, and speciation transients—to guide adaptive scheduling. Experiments in 2D with three Gaussian mixture models show that QoS-driven PWC schedules consistently improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning, and speciation timing at fixed integration budgets, with optimal schedules often found at finite O(1) stiffness values.

## Key Results
- QoS-driven PWC schedules in AdaPID improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, and conditioning of the dynamics compared to fixed schedules.
- Optimal schedules are often found at finite O(1) stiffness values rather than at extremes, suggesting robustness to hyperparameter tuning.
- The framework enables "programmable" temporal assembly of the target distribution, as evidenced by speciation transients and energy efficiency metrics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AdaPID's piece-wise constant parameterization of the stiffness schedule enables closed-form Green's functions and stable, neural-network-free oracles for Gaussian-mixture targets. This allows for efficient, adaptive control of the sampling dynamics via QoS diagnostics. The schedule-sensitive diagnostics provide a principled way to monitor and adjust the temporal evolution of the sampler, ensuring both high-fidelity terminal samples and controlled assembly of the target distribution. The framework's programmability stems from the ability to shape the temporal trajectory of the sampler via the PWC schedule, guided by real-time QoS feedback.

## Foundational Learning

**Path Integral Diffusion (PID)**
*Why needed:* Provides the underlying stochastic dynamics for sampling from complex distributions via controlled diffusion processes.
*Quick check:* Verify that the Green's function for the harmonic (constant β) case matches known results.

**Piece-wise Constant (PWC) Parameterization**
*Why needed:* Enables closed-form oracles and tractable adaptive control of the stiffness schedule.
*Quick check:* Confirm that the PWC schedule recovers the harmonic PID solution when all β values are equal.

**Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) Diagnostics**
*Why needed:* Quantify the fidelity, efficiency, and conditioning of the sampling process at each time step.
*Quick check:* Ensure that each diagnostic is well-defined and computable from the sampler's trajectory and schedule.

**Speciation Transients**
*Why needed:* Capture the temporal emergence of distinct modes or clusters in the target distribution during sampling.
*Quick check:* Verify that speciation timing correlates with changes in the schedule or QoS metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Initial distribution → PWC schedule (βt) → Green's function → Predicted-state map → Score oracle → Sampling dynamics → QoS diagnostics → Schedule update

**Critical Path**
Schedule selection → Green's function computation → State prediction → Score evaluation → QoS monitoring → Schedule adaptation

**Design Tradeoffs**
Analytical tractability (PWC, closed-form) vs. expressiveness (learned schedules); neural-network-free oracles vs. need for Gaussian-mixture assumption; fixed grid of β values vs. adaptive refinement.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor QoS metrics (e.g., high Wasserstein distance, low energy efficiency) indicate schedule mismatch or ill-conditioning; failure to speciate suggests schedule is too smooth or β is too low; excessive drift-diffusion imbalance indicates instability.

**First Experiments**
1. Validate closed-form Green's function against numerical integration for simple PWC schedules.
2. Test QoS diagnostics on synthetic trajectories with known properties (e.g., mixtures at different separations).
3. Compare adaptive PWC schedules to fixed schedules on 2D Gaussian mixtures using QoS metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation is limited to 2D toy mixtures; scalability to high-dimensional, structured targets (e.g., images, molecules) is unproven.
- The assumption that optimal schedules can be found via local QoS feedback on a fixed grid of O(1) stiffness values remains unverified for complex landscapes.
- The relative importance and interaction effects of the diverse QoS diagnostics are not formally prioritized, leaving uncertainty about which metrics best predict sample quality.

## Confidence
- **High**: Correctness of closed-form Green's function derivation for PWC βt, as it recovers known harmonic PID results and is analytically derived.
- **Medium**: Practical utility of QoS diagnostics for guiding adaptive schedules, as diagnostics are well-defined but impact on real-world sampling is not yet established.
- **Low**: Claim that O(1) stiffness values suffice for good performance, as this is only demonstrated on 2D mixtures without broader validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test AdaPID's adaptive scheduling in high-dimensional, structured target distributions (e.g., CIFAR-10 images or molecular conformations) to assess scalability and real-world robustness.
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the effect of each QoS metric on schedule optimization and final sample quality to identify which diagnostics are most predictive and actionable.
3. Compare adaptive PWC schedules to alternative adaptive or learned schedule strategies (e.g., neural ODEs, learned score models) on benchmarks where both can be applied, to quantify the trade-off between analytical tractability and expressivity.
