## Executive Summary
This paper introduces L2D-SLDS, a model for online expert routing in non-stationary time series under partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. The model uses a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model to capture signed expert residuals, with a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer. The routing policy follows an IDS-inspired rule that balances predicted cost against information gain about the latent regime and shared factor.

## Method Summary
L2D-SLDS models expert selection as a sequential decision problem under partial feedback, where expert availability varies over time and the underlying data distribution is non-stationary. The core innovation is a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) that models signed expert residuals through a factorized state-space representation: a global latent factor shared across experts, per-expert idiosyncratic states, and regime-dependent dynamics. The model supports dynamic expert entry and pruning through a registry mechanism. Routing decisions are made via an information-directed sampling (IDS) policy that trades off expected cost against information gain about both the latent regime and the shared factor. This enables efficient exploration-exploitation balance while adapting to regime shifts and expert availability changes.

## Key Results
- L2D-SLDS achieves cumulative costs of 13.58±0.07 on synthetic data
- L2D-SLDS achieves cumulative costs of 5.69±0.01 on Melbourne temperature data
- L2D-SLDS achieves cumulative costs of 0.004321±0.000003 on FRED DGS10 yield data
- Performance exceeds contextual bandit baselines and ablation without shared factor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by combining switching state-space dynamics with information-directed routing. The factorized SLDS structure allows sharing of global information across experts while maintaining expert-specific components. The IDS-inspired routing policy explicitly balances cost reduction against information gain, enabling adaptive exploration in the presence of regime uncertainty. The shared latent factor captures cross-expert dependencies that would be missed by treating experts independently.

## Foundational Learning
- Switching linear dynamical systems: Needed to model regime changes in non-stationary time series; Quick check: Can represent piecewise linear dynamics with discrete regime switches
- Information-directed sampling: Needed to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off under partial feedback; Quick check: Optimal in Bayesian settings for minimizing regret
- Factorized state-space models: Needed to share information across experts while maintaining individual characteristics; Quick check: Reduces parameter count while preserving expressiveness
- Dynamic expert registry: Needed to handle time-varying expert availability; Quick check: Supports addition/removal without retraining
- Signed expert residuals: Needed to capture both over- and under-prediction patterns; Quick check: Allows asymmetric loss modeling

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Expert observations -> SLDS factorized state-space -> Regime inference -> IDS routing policy -> Expert selection

Critical path: The critical path flows from observing expert predictions through the factorized state-space model to infer the current regime and shared factor, then through the IDS policy to select the next expert. The shared global factor enables cross-expert information transfer, while per-expert states capture individual behavior. Regime transitions drive both state evolution and routing decisions.

Design tradeoffs: The factorized structure trades off model complexity against information sharing efficiency. Gaussian assumptions simplify inference but may miss heavy-tailed noise. Linear dynamics within regimes enable efficient computation but may not capture nonlinear relationships. The IDS policy balances computational cost against optimal decision-making under uncertainty.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation when expert dependencies are nonlinear or when noise is heavy-tailed relative to Gaussian assumptions. Poor routing when regime transitions are too rapid for the state-space model to track. Overfitting to shared factor when expert idiosyncrasies dominate. Failure to adapt when expert availability patterns change structurally.

First experiments:
1. Synthetic data with known ground truth regime dynamics and expert dependencies to validate model recovery
2. Ablation study removing shared factor to quantify cross-expert information transfer benefits
3. Stress test with rapidly switching regimes to evaluate tracking performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation limited to three datasets (synthetic, Melbourne temperature, FRED DGS10)
- Model assumes Gaussian noise and linear dynamics within regimes
- Factorized structure may not capture complex expert dependencies
- No comparison with alternative switching state-space expert selection methods

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework and model specification: High
- Relative performance improvements over baselines: Medium
- Generalizability across domains: Medium
- Practical deployment value: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test L2D-SLDS on datasets with known ground truth expert availability patterns and routing decisions to validate both the model's ability to learn regime dynamics and its routing accuracy in controlled settings.
2. Evaluate performance across a broader range of non-stationary time series domains, including those with heavy-tailed noise, multiple shared factors, or nonlinear expert dependencies, to assess robustness beyond the Gaussian linear assumptions.
3. Compare against alternative switching state-space models or expert selection methods that explicitly handle missing experts, such as ensemble Kalman filters with adaptive gating or mixture-of-experts models with dynamic component selection, to establish the relative contribution of the IDS-inspired routing versus the state-space modeling approach.
