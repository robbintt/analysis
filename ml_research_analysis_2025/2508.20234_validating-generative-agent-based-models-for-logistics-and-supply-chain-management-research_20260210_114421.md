- Key outcome: Dual-validation framework reveals paradox where GPT-4o matches human behavior on surface metrics but fails process-level authenticity, while other models show reverse pattern

## Executive Summary
This study develops a dual-validation framework for Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) research, addressing the critical gap between surface-level behavioral equivalence and process-level decision authenticity. The framework systematically evaluates six state-of-the-art LLMs against human behavior in food delivery dyadic interactions using Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence and multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM). Results reveal a fundamental paradox: GPT-4o achieves surface-level equivalence on all three behavioral measures but demonstrates the weakest process-level validation (5/10 pathway matches), while four other models (GPT-4.1, Sonnet 3.5, Sonnet 4, Mistral Medium 3) achieve higher process fidelity (8/10 matches) despite weaker surface equivalence.

## Method Summary
The study employs a controlled experimental design using 957 human participants (477 dyads) from Prolific as a baseline, comparing their responses to 2,880 LLM-simulated dyads (480 per model across six models). A 4×2×2 factorial design varies Service Outcome (4 levels), Tip Adjustability (2 levels), and Tip Visibility (2 levels) across 16 experimental conditions. Each condition is replicated 30 times per model using standardized LLM API calls (temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95). Validation involves TOST equivalence testing (±0.2SD) for surface-level behavioral comparison and multi-group SEM with 5,000-bootstrap resampling to assess process-level decision pathway fidelity across eight direct pathways and two indirect effects.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieved surface-level equivalence on all three behavioral measures but performed worst in process-level validation (5/10 pathway matches)
- Four models (GPT-4.1, Sonnet 3.5, Sonnet 4, Mistral Medium 3) demonstrated highest process fidelity with 8/10 pathway matches
- 2025 models showed weaker surface equivalence than 2024 models, suggesting alignment trajectories may not improve behavioral fidelity
- Surface-level validation suffices for aggregate behavioral prediction applications, while process-level validation is essential for understanding causal mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TOST equivalence testing provides statistically rigorous assessment of LLM behavioral similarity to humans, addressing limitations of traditional null hypothesis testing
- Mechanism: Two One-Sided Tests evaluate whether LLM-human differences fall within pre-specified equivalence margins (±0.2SD), enabling affirmation of similarity rather than merely failing to detect differences
- Core assumption: LLMs producing statistically equivalent outputs to humans are suitable proxies for aggregate behavioral prediction
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "TOST for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level equivalence to humans"; section 4.5.1 explains TOST's ability to affirm practical equivalence versus NHST's failure to detect effects
- Break condition: Equivalence margins that are too narrow may fail to capture meaningful similarity; margins too wide may incorrectly validate divergent behavior

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-group SEM reveals whether LLMs replicate human decision-making pathways, exposing artificial reasoning processes undetectable by surface tests
- Mechanism: Simultaneous estimation of same causal model structure across human and LLM groups enables comparison of pathway significance patterns and coefficient directions/magnitudes
- Core assumption: If LLMs employ same psychological mechanisms as humans, their SEM pathway significance patterns should match human baselines
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "SEM reveals artificial decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs"; section 4.5.4 shows four models achieving 8/10 pathway matches
- Break condition: SEM assumes linear relationships and may miss non-linear decision processes; vignette-based experiments may not capture full behavioral complexity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges because LLMs can optimize for output similarity without replicating underlying reasoning mechanisms
- Mechanism: LLMs may learn to produce statistically appropriate responses through pattern matching rather than engaging in psychological processes that drive human decisions
- Core assumption: Authentic decision processes matter for policy design and theory development but may be less critical for routine operational predictions
- Evidence anchors: Abstract highlights GPT-4o's surface-level success but process-level failure; section 5.1.1 distinguishes between aggregate prediction needs versus causal mechanism understanding
- Break condition: Task complexity and novelty may increase gap between surface and process validity; validated models in one domain may not transfer to other LSCM contexts

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Equivalence Testing (TOST) vs. Traditional Hypothesis Testing**
  - Why needed here: Traditional NHST cannot confirm similarity—only fail to reject difference. TOST reverses burden of proof to affirm behavioral equivalence within specified bounds.
  - Quick check question: Given human mean satisfaction of 4.2 (SD=1.5), what TOST equivalence bounds would you use for comparing an LLM's mean of 4.1?

- Concept: **Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling**
  - Why needed here: Process-level validation requires comparing whether LLMs and humans follow same causal pathways between variables (e.g., service outcome → tip change → satisfaction).
  - Quick check question: If humans show significant indirect effect through tip change but an LLM does not, what does this imply about the LLM's decision process?

- Concept: **Dyadic Data Analysis**
  - Why needed here: LSCM interactions involve interdependent outcomes where customer and worker experiences mutually influence each other; modeling requires joint and differential satisfaction measures.
  - Quick check question: What does a positive differential satisfaction score (customer minus worker) indicate about the dyadic outcome distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - JSON vignette library → LLM agent instances → Response parser → Validation pipeline → Human baseline comparison
  - Vignettes with experimental factors → API calls (customer/worker roles) → Regex extraction (satisfaction, reasoning, tip) → TOST equivalence tests + multi-group SEM → Statistical comparison

- Critical path:
  1. Define experimental factors and generate all vignette combinations (4×2×2 = 16 conditions)
  2. Collect LLM responses (30 replications per condition per model = 480 dyads per LLM)
  3. Collect human baseline with identical vignettes and response formats
  4. Run TOST equivalence tests on three outcome variables (tip change, joint satisfaction, differential satisfaction)
  5. Estimate multi-group SEM comparing pathway significance across all groups
  6. Count pathway matches to rank process-level fidelity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Vignette vs. dynamic simulation**: Static vignettes enable controlled comparison but may not capture real-time adaptation; future work should validate in operational environments
  - **Equivalence margin selection**: ±0.2SD is conservative; tighter margins increase validation rigor but may reject useful models
  - **Sample size**: 30 replications per condition balances statistical power against API costs; Law & Kelton (1982) calculations guide minimum requirements

- Failure signatures:
  - **High surface equivalence, low process fidelity**: Model produces correct outputs through artificial pathways (GPT-4o pattern)
  - **Artificial indirect effects**: Model shows significant mediated relationships where humans show none, indicating spurious reasoning chains
  - **Newer models underperforming**: 2025 models showed weaker surface equivalence than 2024 models, suggesting alignment trajectories may not improve behavioral fidelity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate dual-validation framework on different LSCM dyadic context (buyer-supplier negotiation) to test generalizability of paradox
  2. Vary SEM model structure by adding additional mediators (e.g., trust, fairness perception) to test stability of process fidelity rankings
  3. Test whether models passing both validation levels in static vignettes maintain fidelity in dynamic simulations with multi-turn interactions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Domain specificity: Paradox between surface and process validity may be specific to food delivery dyadic interactions and might not generalize to other LSCM contexts
- Vignette limitations: Static scenario-based approach may not fully represent dynamic, real-time decision-making in operational environments
- Parameter selection: Equivalence margin (±0.2SD) and SEM model specifications (8 pathways, 2 indirect effects) were based on theoretical reasoning rather than empirical optimization

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in methodological framework - TOST equivalence testing and multi-group SEM are well-established statistical techniques with clear theoretical justification
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability of specific findings to other LSCM domains due to unique characteristics of food delivery context
- **Medium confidence** in practical utility for model selection given additional real-world factors like cost, latency, and integration requirements

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Apply dual-validation framework to different LSCM dyadic context (e.g., buyer-supplier negotiation) to test whether surface-process paradox persists across domains
2. **Dynamic Simulation Testing**: Validate models in dynamic multi-turn simulations where LLM agents interact across multiple service encounters to measure translation of process-level fidelity to operational environments
3. **Framework Parameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary equivalence margin (±0.1SD to ±0.3SD) and SEM model complexity to determine sensitivity of model rankings to analytical specifications
