# Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks Applied to Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19494
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19494
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: KAGNNs achieve state-of-the-art classification (99.5% F1 for crystal systems) but struggle with regression tasks on CHILI dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) on the CHILI dataset of inorganic nanomaterials. The authors propose KAEdgeCNN, a KAN-based version of EdgeCNN, and compare it with existing KAGCN and KAGIN models. Through extensive hyperparameter tuning on CHILI-3K and evaluation on both CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K, they demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks, with KAGCN achieving state-of-the-art F1-scores of 99.5% for crystal system classification and 96.6% for space group classification. However, regression tasks remain challenging, and the KAN-based models require more parameters than their MLP counterparts.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three KAGNN architectures (KAGCN, KAGIN, KAEdgeCNN) on 8 tasks using the CHILI inorganic nanomaterials dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned via Optuna (40 trials) on CHILI-3K (80/10/10 train/val/test split), then models were evaluated on both CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K with 3 different seeds. The KAGNNs use efficient-KAN backend with B-spline kernels. Classification tasks use weighted F1-score, absolute position regression uses MAE, and other regression tasks use MSE. Models were trained with early stopping (patience=20) for up to 500 epochs on RTX 3080 10GB GPU.

## Key Results
- KAGCN achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores: 99.5% for crystal system classification and 96.6% for space group classification on CHILI-3K
- KAGNNs significantly outperform vanilla GNNs on classification tasks across both CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K datasets
- Regression tasks remain challenging for all KAGNN modifications, with performance comparable to or worse than vanilla GNNs
- KAN-based models require substantially more parameters than their MLP counterparts due to spline parameter counts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KAGNNs leverage the Kolmogorov-Arnitzer representation theorem through KAN layers, which approximate continuous functions using compositions of continuous univariate functions. This allows the models to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the graph-structured data of inorganic nanomaterials more effectively than traditional MLPs, particularly for classification tasks where the decision boundaries are complex but well-defined.

## Foundational Learning

**Kolmogorov-Arnitzer representation theorem**: Any continuous multivariate function can be represented as a composition of continuous univariate functions. This is the theoretical foundation that enables KANs to approximate complex functions without traditional weight matrices.

*Why needed*: Provides the mathematical basis for replacing traditional linear transformations with spline-based compositions.

*Quick check*: Verify that KAN layers use univariate functions (splines) composed together rather than matrix multiplications.

**Graph Neural Networks**: Message-passing neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes.

*Why needed*: The CHILI dataset consists of graph-structured representations of inorganic nanomaterials, requiring GNN architectures for effective processing.

*Quick check*: Confirm the models implement message-passing between nodes with edge information.

**B-spline kernels**: Piecewise polynomial functions used in KANs to represent the univariate functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnitzer decomposition.

*Why needed*: Provide smooth, continuous representations that can approximate complex functions with controllable accuracy.

*Quick check*: Verify the number of bins and spline order parameters in the KAN configurations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input graph → KAGNN layers (KAGCN/KAGIN/KAEdgeCNN) -> KAN-readout -> Head (classification/regression) -> Output

**Critical path**: Graph features → KAN layers → Readout pooling → Task-specific head → Final prediction

**Design tradeoffs**: KAGNNs offer superior function approximation capability but at the cost of significantly increased parameter count and memory usage compared to MLP-based GNNs. This tradeoff favors classification tasks with well-defined boundaries but may be prohibitive for resource-constrained applications or when regression accuracy is paramount.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Out-of-memory errors during training (especially for KAEdgeCNN with large spline parameters)
- Unstable convergence on regression tasks (indicated by high variance in MSE across runs)
- Performance degradation when moving from CHILI-3K to CHILI-100K (indicating overfitting or data distribution shifts)

**First experiments**:
1. Train KAGCN on crystal system classification task with default hyperparameters to establish baseline performance
2. Compare KAGIN vs. KAGCN on space group classification to understand architectural differences
3. Evaluate regression performance on absolute position task to identify specific challenges in regression settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can specialized architectural modifications significantly improve KAGNN performance on the regression tasks within the CHILI dataset?
The authors state that regression tasks "remain challenging for all modifications of KAGNNs" and require "further investigation with a different approach." Current KAGNN architectures yielded substantial classification gains but failed to significantly improve regression metrics compared to vanilla GNNs. Demonstrating a KAGNN variant achieving state-of-the-art Mean Squared Error (MSE) on tasks like SAXS or XRD prediction would resolve this question.

**Open Question 2**: Under what specific data conditions does the accuracy gain of KAGNNs justify their higher parameter count and memory usage compared to vanilla GNNs?
Section V notes performance comes "at the cost of a large number of learnable parameters," leaving it "yet to be explored when it is reasonable to use KAGNNs." While effective, KAGNNs generally require significantly more weights due to splines, raising efficiency concerns compared to lighter MLP-based models. A comparative analysis of accuracy-per-parameter or inference-speed trade-offs across varying dataset complexities would resolve this question.

**Open Question 3**: Would utilizing lightweight KAN kernels, such as RBF or Fourier implementations, enable the training of deeper KAEdgeCNN models?
The authors note memory constraints prevented training multi-layer KAEdgeCNN, suggesting "implementing this model with a more lightweight kernel." The current B-spline implementation is memory-intensive, restricting the model to one hidden layer and potentially limiting its capacity. Successful training and benchmarking of a multi-layer KAEdgeCNN using FastKAN or FourierKAN kernels would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- Software version specifications (PyTorch, CUDA, efficient-KAN) are not provided, making exact numerical reproducibility difficult
- Specific random seed values for the 3 evaluation runs are not disclosed, potentially affecting reported mean and standard deviation values
- Data preprocessing and normalization details for the CHILI dataset are incomplete, particularly regarding target scaling for regression tasks
- Head architectures and pooling implementations beyond Figure 1 are not fully specified

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The overall methodology and experimental setup are clearly described, with well-defined tasks, metrics, and hyperparameter search procedures. The improvements in classification tasks are consistently reported across multiple runs.

**Medium confidence**: The regression task results and their instability are well-documented, but the exact causes and potential solutions are not fully explored in the paper.

**Low confidence**: Exact numerical reproducibility due to missing software version specifications and specific random seed values.

## Next Checks

1. Verify the exact data preprocessing and normalization procedures, particularly for regression targets, to ensure proper scaling and distribution.

2. Test the model's performance with different software versions (PyTorch, efficient-KAN) to establish version sensitivity and identify optimal configurations.

3. Implement and compare alternative head architectures and pooling mechanisms to validate the choices made in the original study.
