# DRIFT: Detecting Representational Inconsistencies for Factual Truthfulness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14210
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14210
- Reference count: 12
- The method achieves state-of-the-art AUROC on 10 out of 12 settings across four QA benchmarks and three LLM families, with gains of up to 13 points over prior methods.

## Executive Summary
DRIFT addresses hallucination detection in LLMs by identifying representational inconsistencies in intermediate hidden states. The method exploits the observation that intermediate transformer layers encode uncertainty signals that are lost during final-layer projection to token space. By probing these intermediate representations with a lightweight classifier, DRIFT achieves state-of-the-art detection performance while running in parallel with generation, enabling proactive detection before answers are produced. The approach generalizes across model architectures and dataset shifts without retraining.

## Method Summary
DRIFT detects hallucinations by extracting hidden states from a single intermediate transformer layer during LLM forward pass, applying pooling to obtain fixed-dimensional representations, and training a lightweight MLP or transformer classifier to predict answer correctness. The detector operates on question tokens alone for zero-latency detection, or on both question and answer tokens for improved accuracy. Training uses BCE loss with correctness labels obtained from GPT-4o. The method adds less than 0.1% computational overhead and enables an LLM router that routes uncertain queries to stronger models without latency penalties for confident queries.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art AUROC on 10 out of 12 settings across four QA benchmarks (TriviaQA, NQ-Open, MMLU-Pro, WebQuestions)
- Gains of up to 13 points over prior methods on WebQuestions for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
- Question-only detection achieves 79.87-87.31 AUROC across model-dataset pairs, outperforming most baselines
- Generalizes well across dataset shifts without retraining when trained on mixed data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intermediate-Layer Signal Preservation
Intermediate transformer layers (around 60-70% depth) encode confidence signals that are attenuated or discarded during final-layer projection to token space. Hidden states at these layers retain information about whether the model "knows" the answer, while final layers project toward vocabulary distribution, discarding features informative for confidence estimation.

### Mechanism 2: Question-Only Proactive Detection
Hallucination risk can be estimated from question representations alone before any answer tokens are generated. The detector operates on hidden states of question tokens at a single intermediate layer, enabling fully parallel detection during generation.

### Mechanism 3: Scale-Dependent Signal Strength
Larger models exhibit stronger, more detectable uncertainty signals in intermediate representations. Model scale correlates with richer latent computation beyond next-token prediction, increasing the fidelity gap between internal representations and surface outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer Hidden States**: Hidden states at different layers contain different information; layer 15 vs layer 30 encode progressively more abstract representations. Why needed: The detector consumes h_l from intermediate layers; understanding what these vectors encode is prerequisite to interpreting why probing works. Quick check: Can you explain why hidden states at layer 15 might contain different information than layer 30 in a 32-layer transformer?

- **AUROC and Selective Prediction Metrics**: Paper uses AUROC as primary metric and AURAC for rejection-quality evaluation. Why needed: Misinterpreting these metrics leads to wrong conclusions about detector utility. Quick check: If a detector achieves 90% AUROC but you reject the bottom 50% by confidence, does that guarantee 95% accuracy on retained samples?

- **Probe Training (Logistic Regression / MLP on Representations)**: DRIFT trains a small network g_θ to map hidden states → confidence scores; this is representation probing, not model fine-tuning. Why needed: Understanding probe training is essential for reproducing results. Quick check: What would happen if you trained the probe on the same data used to train the base LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base LLM -> Feature extractor (pooling/PCA) -> Detector head (MLP/transformer) -> Confidence score
- **Critical path**: 1) Layer selection via ablation, 2) Architecture choice (Transformer+attention pooling slightly outperforms MLP+last-token), 3) Training data construction (GPT-4o-labeled correctness)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Question-only vs. question+answer (zero-latency vs. +5-12 AUROC), MLP vs. Transformer detector (simplicity vs. token interaction capture), layer selection (earlier=faster/weaker vs. later=stronger until final-layer degradation)
- **Failure signatures**: Low AUROC on imbalanced datasets, poor generalization to distribution shift, degraded performance on multi-step reasoning tasks
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Layer ablation to find optimal layer (~60-70% depth), 2) Question-only vs. question+answer comparison (measure AUROC delta and latency impact), 3) Cross-dataset generalization (train on TriviaQA, evaluate on NQ-Open/WebQuestions without retraining)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to other generation tasks**: The authors expect DRIFT to generalize to dialogue, code generation, summarization, and tool use, but this requires further validation. The core assumption (intermediate layers encode uncertainty) is task-agnostic, but no experiments validate this across diverse task types.

- **Detection of systematic vs. reasoning errors**: DRIFT may only capture epistemic uncertainty, not aleatoric or reasoning errors. The probe is trained on correctness labels that conflate multiple error types, but controlled experiments isolating each error type are needed to measure detection performance per category.

- **Architecture-dependent layer dynamics**: Different model architectures exhibit different optimal layers and fluctuation patterns. Gemma-3-4B shows notable fluctuations across layers, suggesting qualitatively different information encoding, but mechanistic interpretability analysis comparing layer-wise representations across architectures is needed.

## Limitations
- Layer selection optimization is not fully specified, creating reproducibility risk
- GPT-4o labeling introduces potential bias coupling detector performance to GPT-4o's judgment
- Limited evaluation to single-turn, closed-book QA tasks without testing multi-turn dialogue, tool use, code generation, or summarization

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Intermediate-layer superiority over final-layer representations (supported by consistent ablation results across models)
- **Medium confidence**: Question-only detection efficacy (strong results but lacks direct comparison to answer-token baselines)
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-dataset generalization without retraining (OOD results demonstrated but mostly trained on dataset unions)

## Next Checks
1. **Layer Selection Ablation with Fixed Policy**: Run experiments using a fixed intermediate layer (e.g., layer 19) across all model-dataset combinations without per-dataset tuning to quantify the cost of avoiding layer selection optimization.

2. **Human Annotation Validation**: Take a subset of questions where GPT-4o and DRIFT disagree on correctness and have human annotators label the true answers to validate whether DRIFT's judgments align better with ground truth.

3. **Large-Scale Model Scaling Study**: Test DRIFT on models larger than 32B parameters (e.g., Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3-70B) to validate the conjecture that scaling continues to improve intermediate-layer signal strength.
