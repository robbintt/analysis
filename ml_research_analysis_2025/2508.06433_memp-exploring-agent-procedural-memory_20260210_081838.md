# Memp: Exploring Agent Procedural Memory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06433
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Procedural memory framework improves LLM agent task success rates by up to 50% and reduces steps by 50% on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of brittle procedural memory in LLM-based agents by proposing Memp, a framework that distills past agent trajectories into reusable procedural knowledge and explores strategies for building, retrieving, and updating this memory. By leveraging both fine-grained step-by-step instructions and higher-level script abstractions, agents can reuse learned behaviors and reduce redundant exploration. Evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld benchmarks shows that Memp improves task success rates and efficiency, with up to 50% accuracy gains and 50% fewer steps compared to agents without memory. The framework also supports continual learning through dynamic memory updates, and procedural memory built from strong models can transfer effectively to weaker models. Memp marks a step toward self-improving, adaptable agents.

## Method Summary
Memp addresses the challenge of brittle procedural memory in LLM-based agents by proposing a framework that distills past agent trajectories into reusable procedural knowledge. The approach explores strategies for building, retrieving, and updating this memory, leveraging both fine-grained step-by-step instructions and higher-level script abstractions. This dual-level memory structure enables agents to reuse learned behaviors and reduce redundant exploration across tasks. The framework supports continual learning through dynamic memory updates, allowing agents to adapt and improve over time.

## Key Results
- Up to 50% improvement in task success rates compared to agents without memory
- 50% reduction in required steps for task completion
- Procedural memory generated by strong models can effectively transfer to weaker models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its dual-level memory architecture that captures both atomic action sequences and higher-level procedural scripts. By distilling agent trajectories into structured procedural knowledge, Memp enables retrieval of relevant past experiences when facing similar tasks. The memory update mechanism allows for continual refinement of stored knowledge, preventing degradation over time. The step-by-step and script-level abstractions provide complementary representations that support both detailed execution guidance and strategic planning, reducing the need for redundant exploration.

## Foundational Learning

**Procedural Memory Distillation**: Converting agent trajectories into structured, reusable knowledge representations. Why needed: Agents need to leverage past experiences rather than starting from scratch. Quick check: Can the distilled memory be retrieved and applied to similar tasks?

**Dual-Level Memory Structure**: Maintaining both fine-grained step-by-step instructions and higher-level script abstractions. Why needed: Different task scenarios require different levels of guidance. Quick check: Does the dual structure improve retrieval relevance compared to single-level approaches?

**Memory Retrieval Strategies**: Implementing mechanisms to match current task contexts with relevant stored procedural knowledge. Why needed: Efficient retrieval is essential for practical utility. Quick check: What is the precision and recall of retrieved procedural memories?

**Dynamic Memory Updates**: Continuously refining and expanding the procedural memory repository. Why needed: Agent experiences evolve over time, requiring memory adaptation. Quick check: Does continual updating improve performance on previously encountered tasks?

**Cross-Model Knowledge Transfer**: Enabling procedural memories from strong models to benefit weaker models. Why needed: Leverages expertise across different model capabilities. Quick check: How much performance improvement do weaker models gain from strong model memories?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Agent Trajectory Capture -> Procedural Memory Distillation -> Dual-Level Memory Store -> Context-Aware Retrieval -> Memory Update Mechanism

**Critical Path**: The core workflow flows from agent action sequences through memory distillation into the dual-level store, followed by retrieval when similar contexts arise, with continuous updates refining the stored knowledge.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances memory granularity against retrieval efficiency, choosing a dual-level approach that provides both detailed guidance and strategic abstraction. This increases storage requirements but improves applicability across task types. The dynamic update mechanism trades computational overhead for improved long-term performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Retrieval failures manifest as irrelevant memory suggestions or missed opportunities for reuse. Memory degradation occurs when updates introduce conflicting or noisy procedural knowledge. Cross-model transfer failures appear when procedural abstractions are too model-specific to be useful for different architectures.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study comparing single-level vs dual-level memory on task completion rates, 2) Retrieval precision evaluation across varying memory sizes, 3) Transfer learning experiment measuring weaker model performance gains from strong model procedural memories.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific task domains (TravelPlanner and ALFWorld), constraining generalizability to broader real-world applications
- Reliance on strong models for initial procedural memory generation raises questions about performance with weaker base models
- Dynamic memory update mechanism may face scalability challenges as the memory repository grows larger

## Confidence

High confidence in core technical contributions: Procedural memory framework architecture, dual-level memory structure, and retrieval mechanisms are well-specified and logically sound.

Medium confidence in generalizability of results: Domain-specific improvements are well-demonstrated, but broader applicability requires validation across diverse task types and more complex real-world scenarios.

Medium confidence in continual learning claims: Dynamic update mechanism is theoretically sound, but long-term effectiveness and memory management strategies need more extensive evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain transfer validation: Test Memp's procedural memory on at least three additional task domains beyond TravelPlanner and ALFWorld, including one real-world application scenario, to assess generalization capabilities.

2. Memory scaling analysis: Conduct experiments measuring retrieval latency and memory efficiency as the procedural memory repository grows from 100 to 10,000+ stored trajectories, identifying performance bottlenecks.

3. Weak-to-strong model transfer: Systematically evaluate the quality and effectiveness of procedural memory generated by progressively weaker base models, establishing minimum competency thresholds for useful memory creation.
