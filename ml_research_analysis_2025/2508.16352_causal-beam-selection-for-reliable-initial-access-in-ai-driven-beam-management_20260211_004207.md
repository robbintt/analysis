# Causal Beam Selection for Reliable Initial Access in AI-driven Beam Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16352
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16352
- Reference count: 17
- Achieves 87% top-1 and 95% top-2 beam alignment accuracy using only 13 sensing beams

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a causally-aware deep learning framework for efficient beam alignment in mmWave MIMO systems. The core innovation uses DirectLiNGAM causal discovery to identify a minimal set of RSSI features that directly influence beam selection, dramatically reducing both computational complexity and beam sweeping overhead. The method achieves near-exhaustive search performance while reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% compared to traditional approaches, making it highly suitable for 6G beam management.

## Method Summary
The framework combines causal discovery with deep learning for beam management. It uses DirectLiNGAM to estimate a causal graph from RSSI data, identifying direct parents of the target beam index. A connectivity-based heuristic then augments this selection with high-traffic intermediate features. The resulting minimal feature set feeds into a DNN classifier for beam prediction. The approach is validated using DeepMIMO Boston5G simulations, demonstrating significant overhead reduction while maintaining high alignment accuracy.

## Key Results
- 87% top-1 and 95% top-2 beam alignment accuracy using only 13 sensing beams
- 94.4% reduction in input selection time compared to exhaustive search
- 59.4% reduction in beam sweeping overhead while maintaining spectral efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Pruning via DirectLiNGAM
The framework uses DirectLiNGAM to estimate a causal graph (DAG) and effect matrix from observational RSSI data, identifying a minimal subset of "direct parents" of the target beam index. This filters out features that are merely correlated but not causally predictive, maintaining accuracy while lowering overhead. The core assumption is that RSSI relationships follow a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model.

### Mechanism 2: Connectivity-Based Feature Augmentation
Beyond direct parents, the algorithm ranks features by "total connectivity" (sum of incoming and outgoing edges) and supplements the parent set with these high-traffic nodes. This captures complex dependencies that direct parent selection alone might miss, improving robustness while staying within the feature budget.

### Mechanism 3: Overhead-Constrained Spectral Efficiency
By minimizing sensing beam count ($M_w$), the system reduces sweeping time ($T_{IA}$), directly boosting effective spectral efficiency. Since effective SE accounts for frame duration lost to initial access, this reduction translates to higher throughput. The core assumption is channel stationarity during the shortened sweeping and prediction window.

## Foundational Learning

- **DirectLiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model)**: The core algorithm used to distinguish causation from correlation in RSSI data. Why needed: Enables identification of truly predictive features rather than correlated noise. Quick check: How does assuming non-Gaussianity help determine the direction of a causal arrow (X -> Y vs Y -> X)?

- **Beam Sweeping vs. Exhaustive Search**: The paper aims to replace exhaustive search (high overhead) with targeted sensing. Why needed: Understanding the efficiency trade-off is crucial for appreciating the 59.4% overhead reduction. Quick check: Why does reducing sensing beams ($M_w$) increase "Effective Spectral Efficiency" even if peak SNR might slightly drop?

- **Causal DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: The output of discovery is a DAG where nodes are RSSI beams and edges are causal strengths. Why needed: The framework's validity depends on correctly interpreting the DAG structure. Quick check: In a DAG representing RSSI inputs and target beam, why is it physically valid to assume no edges point from the target back to RSSI inputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Generator -> Causal Discovery Engine -> Beam Alignment Engine
- **Critical path**: Causal Discovery. If feature selection fails, the subsequent DNN cannot recover lost spatial information
- **Design tradeoffs**: Interpretability vs. Accuracy. Trades absolute peak accuracy (100% coverage) for lightweight, interpretable subset (87-95% accuracy) to gain spectral efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: Dense multipath may create dense DAGs reducing pruning efficiency; non-stationarity may provide stale feature sets from offline discovery
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline Validation: Reproduce DAG using DeepMIMO Boston5G scenario, 2) Ablation Study: Compare "Direct Parents Only" vs. "Parents + Connectivity" selection, 3) Noise Sensitivity: Vary measurement noise to test degradation compared to correlation-based selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- The causal framework relies heavily on DirectLiNGAM's linear non-Gaussian assumption, which may not capture complex spatial correlations in dense multipath environments
- The offline causal discovery phase assumes stationarity, potentially limiting adaptation to rapid environmental changes
- The 6% performance gap versus exhaustive search, while acceptable for efficiency gains, may be critical in mission-critical applications requiring maximum reliability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The 94.4% reduction in input selection time and 59.4% reduction in beam sweeping overhead are directly measurable from the proposed algorithm and simulation parameters.

**Medium Confidence**: The 87% top-1 and 95% top-2 beam alignment accuracy claims are well-supported by simulation results but depend on DeepMIMO Boston5G scenario assumptions.

**Low Confidence**: The connectivity-based feature augmentation mechanism lacks direct experimental validation. While Algorithm 1 describes the approach, the contribution of connectivity ranking versus direct parent selection is not explicitly quantified through ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Causal Structure Validation**: Reconstruct the causal DAG using provided DeepMIMO parameters and verify DirectLiNGAM correctly identifies spatially proximate RSSI nodes as direct parents.

2. **Connectivity Heuristic Quantification**: Perform ablation study comparing (a) Direct Parents Only, (b) Parents + Connectivity, and (c) Random selection within same feature budget to measure connectivity heuristic contribution.

3. **Non-Stationarity Robustness**: Simulate mobile environment where optimal beam changes mid-transmission and measure how quickly causal discovery can be re-run while maintaining accuracy during retraining window.
