# Enhancing Aerial Combat Tactics through Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08995
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08995
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hierarchical MARL framework achieves strong performance in 15-vs-15 air combat scenarios with win rates over 50% in 3-vs-3 engagements

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for air combat scenarios with heterogeneous aircraft agents. The method decomposes decision-making into low-level control policies for individual units and a high-level commander policy for strategic mission planning. Through curriculum learning and self-play, the framework achieves strong performance in various combat scenarios, including complex engagements with up to 15-vs-15 agents. The hierarchical structure facilitates training by exploiting policy symmetries and separating control from command tasks.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a two-level hierarchical structure: low-level policies (πf for fighting, πe for escaping) control individual aircraft using Self-Attention and feedforward networks, while a high-level commander policy (πc) issues macro commands using a GRU network. Training proceeds through curriculum stages (L1-L5) with increasing complexity, followed by commander training using frozen low-level policies. The approach employs PPO optimization with CTDE (centralized training, decentralized execution) and parameter sharing for homogeneous agent types.

## Key Results
- Low-level fight policy achieves over 50% win rates in 3-vs-3 scenarios
- Escape policy successfully evades opponents in 50% of encounters
- High-level commander improves overall performance through look-ahead planning
- Framework scales effectively to 15-vs-15 agent scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Temporal Abstraction Through Hierarchical Decomposition
- Claim: Separating control and command decisions across abstraction levels improves learning efficiency and scalability
- Mechanism: Low-level policies execute real-time maneuvering with fast reaction cycles (0.1s timesteps), while the high-level commander issues macro commands over extended horizons (Tl = 10+ timesteps)
- Core assumption: Air combat decomposes cleanly into tactical maneuvering and strategic target assignment
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] decision-making split into two levels; [section 3.3] defines POSMDP with options framework

### Mechanism 2: Curriculum Learning with League-Based Self-Play
- Claim: Progressive difficulty scaling enables stable learning of complex combat behaviors
- Mechanism: Training proceeds through 5 levels (L1 static → L5 league play), where each level's trained policy initializes the next
- Core assumption: Skills learned in simpler scenarios transfer compositionally to complex engagements
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] structured into five levels; [section 5.2.2] SA-Net without curriculum underperforms

### Mechanism 3: Parameter Sharing with Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
- Claim: Shared policies for homogeneous agent types reduce sample complexity while preserving execution-time scalability
- Mechanism: All agents of type AC1 share πf,AC1 and πe,AC1; critic accesses global state during training; actor uses local observations during execution
- Core assumption: Agents of the same type are functionally interchangeable in the tactical context
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] agents of the same type use the same shared policies; [section 5.2.3] CTDE outperforms both CTCE and DTDE

## Foundational Learning

- **Partially Observable Markov Games (POMGs)**
  - Why needed here: Formal framework for multi-agent RL under partial observability; defines joint state/action spaces and interdependent rewards
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why each agent's optimal policy depends on π_{-i} in a POMG?

- **Options Framework (Semi-MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: Enables temporal abstraction where high-level commands invoke low-level policies for variable durations
  - Quick check question: How does an option's termination condition β_τ differ from a standard action's immediate completion?

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: Core optimization algorithm for all three policy types; clipping prevents destabilizing policy updates
  - Quick check question: What does the clip parameter ε=0.2 constrain in the PPO surrogate objective?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Commander πc (GRU-Net) → Options τ ∈ {0,1,2} → Low-level policies (SA-Net for πf, FC-Net for πe) → Discrete actions: {heading, velocity, cannon, rocket} → 2D simulation environment

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train πf through curriculum L1→L5 (curriculum is essential; see Fig. 12)
  2. Train πe against πf,L5 (single stage, L3 initialization)
  3. Freeze πf, πe; train πc with R_act assessment reward
  4. Evaluate in 3-vs-3, then scale to 15-vs-15

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - N2 vs N3 sensing: N2 (2 nearest opponents) outperforms N3 by ~10% win rate (Table 4) — reduced action space complexity outweighs additional targeting options
  - Shared reward (ShFrac) vs individual: Individual rewards prevent "lazy agent" problem (Fig. 9), especially critical for heterogeneous teams
  - GRU vs Self-Attention for commander: GRU better captures strategic temporal dependencies; SA sufficient for tactical πf

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Policy collapse under CTCE: Training converges but evaluation fails (Fig. 13) — indicates overfitting to global state
  - Escape policy with per-step distance rewards: Agents exit boundaries at high velocity (Section 5.3.1) — positive rewards can mask destruction penalties
  - N3 commander with R_act: Fight ratio >90%, reduced performance — excessive aggressiveness from misaligned intrinsic rewards

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce L1→L3 curriculum on 1-vs-1 scenario to validate training pipeline; compare against direct L3 training (should see ~15% win rate gap per Fig. 12)
  2. Ablate shared network layer between AC1 and AC2 instances; measure coordination degradation in 2-vs-2 heterogeneous scenarios
  3. Test πc generalization: train in 3-vs-3, evaluate in 5-vs-5 without retraining; expect win rate within 5% of 3-vs-3 baseline (per Fig. 19)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can extending the commander's command vocabulary beyond binary attack/evade options improve tactical performance in complex scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future Work section states: "We aim to enhance the diversity of low-level policies for a more fine-grained behavioral distinction. This includes in particular the investigation of detailed commands from the high-level policy, beyond the binary attack/evade choice described in this work."
- Why unresolved: The current binary command structure limits tactical nuance; the paper observes suboptimal fleeing behavior under fight policy in asymmetric scenarios, suggesting insufficient behavioral granularity
- What evidence would resolve it: Training commander with expanded command set and comparing win rates and behavioral diversity against binary baseline across multiple combat scenarios

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would integrating dedicated planning algorithms (Monte-Carlo Tree Search, AlphaZero) into the commander policy improve strategic decision-making compared to the current PPO-based approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future Work section states: "We aim to improve the training of the commander policy by using dedicated planning algorithms like Monte-Carlo Tree Search or AlphaZero."
- Why unresolved: Current commander uses reactive PPO without explicit look-ahead search; planning algorithms could better handle the stated challenge of integrating real-time control with look-ahead planning
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of MCTS/AlphaZero-enhanced commander versus PPO baseline on strategic metrics (e.g., win rate in scenarios requiring multi-step planning, performance in BVR engagements)

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the hierarchical framework generalize to 3D air combat dynamics with realistic physics beyond the simplified 2D constant-altitude assumption?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future Work states: "We are in the process of developing a 3D simulation environment based on the JSBSim package for precise aircraft dynamics." The paper also acknowledges: "Despite restricting motion to 2D by assuming constant aircraft altitude, the system realistically captures agent interactions and maneuvering behavior."
- Why unresolved: 2D simplification eliminates vertical maneuvering tactics (e.g., high/low yo-yo, split-S); state/action space complexity increases substantially in 3D, potentially challenging curriculum learning convergence
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation of hierarchical policies transferred to JSBSim-based 3D environment; performance comparison showing whether 2D-trained behaviors transfer or require full retraining

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the framework maintain performance under imperfect information and Beyond Visual Range (BVR) conditions where adversary state is partially observable?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states: "In this article, our focus lies on WVR combat in a perfect information setting." It acknowledges BVR involves "long-range sensors" and "larger distances might entail imperfect information scenarios."
- Why unresolved: Current POMG formulation assumes agents receive full opponent observations; real BVR combat involves sensor limitations, uncertainty, and delayed information that fundamentally change decision-making requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing with occluded observations, sensor noise, and delayed state updates; measuring performance degradation and whether hierarchy provides robustness advantages over flat approaches

## Limitations
- Perfect information assumption significantly simplifies tactical environment compared to real-world conditions
- 2D abstraction omits vertical maneuvering dynamics that can be decisive in actual aerial combat
- Training methodology requires substantial computational resources and domain-specific reward engineering

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The hierarchical decomposition mechanism and its benefits for training efficiency - well-supported by ablation studies and systematic evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: The necessity and effectiveness of curriculum learning - demonstrated within this specific domain but limited external validation
- **Medium confidence**: The CTDE approach with parameter sharing - strong empirical support but potential generalization concerns to heterogeneous agent types

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain generalization test: Apply the hierarchical framework to a non-military multi-agent scenario (e.g., warehouse robot coordination) and measure transfer of performance gains
2. Partial observability stress test: Systematically degrade information quality (add noise, delay, occlusion) and quantify degradation in performance compared to perfect information baseline
3. Real-time deployment validation: Implement the trained policies in a high-fidelity 3D flight simulator and measure performance degradation due to 2D-to-3D transfer
