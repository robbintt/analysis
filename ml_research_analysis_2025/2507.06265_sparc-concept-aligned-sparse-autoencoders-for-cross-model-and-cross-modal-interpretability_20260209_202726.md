# SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.06265
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06265
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: SPARC achieves 0.80 Jaccard similarity for cross-model concept alignment, more than tripling previous methods.

## Executive Summary
SPARC addresses the challenge of cross-model and cross-modal interpretability by learning a unified sparse latent space shared across diverse architectures. It introduces two key innovations: (1) Global TopK sparsity that enforces identical activation patterns across all input streams, and (2) Cross-Reconstruction Loss that promotes semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC achieves a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than tripling alignment compared to previous methods. This enables direct comparison of concept representations across models and modalities, supports text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models, and facilitates cross-model retrieval tasks.

## Method Summary
SPARC extends sparse autoencoders to multi-model settings by introducing Global TopK sparsity and cross-reconstruction loss. The architecture consists of stream-specific encoder-decoder pairs that share a unified latent space. Global TopK aggregates pre-activation logits across all streams, selects top-k indices globally, and applies them uniformly to ensure identical activation patterns. Cross-reconstruction loss trains each stream's latents to reconstruct other streams' features, promoting semantic alignment. The total loss combines self-reconstruction, cross-reconstruction, and auxiliary sparsity terms. SPARC is trained on Open Images using features from DINOv2, CLIP-image, and CLIP-text models, achieving superior concept alignment compared to local sparsity methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.80 Jaccard similarity for concept alignment on Open Images, more than tripling previous methods
- Eliminates mixed activation patterns (48.8% → 0%) and ensures equal dead neuron distribution across streams
- Enables cross-model retrieval with R@1=40% on MS-COCO and R@1=3% on Open Images
- Supports text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models through cross-modal concept alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Global TopK Sparse Activation
Enforcing identical latent activation indices across all input streams produces concept-aligned representations. Instead of selecting top-k activations independently per stream (Local TopK), SPARC aggregates logits from all encoders, selects a single global index set, then applies those indices uniformly. This structural constraint ensures each latent dimension either activates across all streams or remains dead across all streams. The core assumption is that forcing different model architectures to use identical sparse dimensions creates optimization pressure for those dimensions to encode shared semantics. Evidence shows Global TopK with λ=1 achieves 84.4% all-alive neurons with 0% mixed patterns, while Local TopK produces 48.8% mixed activation patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Reconstruction Loss
Training each stream's latents to reconstruct other streams' features creates semantic alignment beyond statistical correlation. The total loss combines self-reconstruction with cross-reconstruction, where stream s's latent reconstructs stream t's input. This creates continuous optimization pressure ensuring activations are semantically transferable. The core assumption is that if latent dimension j from stream s can reconstruct the features of stream t, then dimension j encodes information relevant to both streams' representations. Evidence shows without cross-loss (λ=0), Global TopK achieves only 0.73 Jaccard similarity; with λ=1, achieves 0.80. Cross-reconstruction loss drops rapidly up to λ≈1, then saturates.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Concept Verification via Jaccard Similarity
Measuring label overlap at multiple semantic depths validates that aligned latents capture hierarchical concept structure, not just surface correlations. For each latent, identify top-activating samples across streams, map their labels to ancestors at varying depths in the Open Images taxonomy, then compute generalized Jaccard similarity between label distributions. The core assumption is that if a latent activates on "tiger" in one stream and "leopard" in another, these should count as aligned at intermediate depths (both → "carnivore") even if mismatched at leaf level. Evidence shows Global TopK with λ=1 achieves >0.80 Jaccard across all depths, indicating robust hierarchical alignment.

## Foundational Learning

- **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: Why needed here: SPARC extends SAEs from single-model to multi-model settings. Understanding the baseline—encoding activations into sparse latents where individual dimensions ideally correspond to interpretable concepts—is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why L1 penalty vs. TopK selection leads to different sparsity behaviors?

- **Reconstruction Loss (MSE/NMSE)**: Why needed here: The training objective balances self-reconstruction (faithfulness) against cross-reconstruction (alignment). NMSE handles varying feature scales across heterogeneous streams.
  - Quick check question: Why use normalized MSE rather than raw MSE when comparing reconstruction quality across streams with different dimensionalities?

- **TopK Selection Mechanisms**: Why needed here: The paper's core innovation replaces independent per-stream TopK with globally-aggregated TopK. Understanding standard TopK is a prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: How does hard TopK differ from soft sparsity (L1) in terms of gradient flow and dead neuron behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Input streams (M total) → Stream-specific encoders E_s → Pre-activation logits h_s → Global aggregation: h_agg = Σh_s → Global TopK: I_global = TopK(h_agg, k) → Shared indices → z_s for each stream → Decoder D_s → Reconstruction x̂_s

- **Critical path**:
  1. Feature extraction from pretrained models (DINO, CLIP-image, CLIP-text)
  2. Encoder projects features to shared latent dimension L
  3. Global TopK enforces cross-stream index alignment
  4. Cross-reconstruction loss propagates semantic constraints
  5. Latent visualization and downstream task evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Self-reconstruction vs. cross-reconstruction: Global TopK incurs 0.030-0.060 NMSE self-reconstruction penalty but gains 0.044-0.156 in cross-reconstruction
  - Latent dimension L vs. sparsity k: Higher L with fixed k improves cross-reconstruction for Global TopK but degrades Local TopK
  - λ weighting: Beyond λ≈1, alignment gains saturate while self-reconstruction continues degrading

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Dead neurons: Without Global TopK, CLIP-text stream shows 45% dead neurons; Global TopK distributes dead neurons equally across streams
  - Mixed activation patterns: Local TopK produces 48.8% partial activation; Global TopK eliminates this
  - Cross-modal retrieval degradation: Open Images shows weak retrieval performance (R@1 ≈ 3%) compared to MS-COCO (R@1 ≈ 40%)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train Local TopK with λ=0 (no cross-loss) to establish lower bound; expect near-zero alignment in retrieval tasks (Table 5 confirms R@1 = 0%)
  2. Ablation on k: Sweep k ∈ {16, 32, 64, 128, 256} with L=8192, λ=1; verify that Global TopK cross-reconstruction improves with higher k while Local TopK degrades
  3. Concept alignment validation: For a sample latent, visualize top-activating images across all streams; verify semantic consistency (e.g., latent 6463 should activate on similar object types across DINO, CLIP-image, CLIP-text)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question**: Can the SPARC architecture be modified to support fine-grained attribution (e.g., object parts) which currently fails to produce distinct spatial patterns?
**Basis in paper**: Appendix D.3 states that SPARC "fails in the case of detailed heatmaps" when queries target specific parts like "Cat's Eyes" or "Nose," resulting in similar, poorly localized attribution patterns for all queries.
**Why unresolved**: The authors identify this failure mode but do not propose architectural changes to resolve the loss of spatial precision for granular concepts.
**What evidence would resolve it**: A demonstration of SPARC successfully localizing object parts (e.g., ears vs. nose) with distinct heatmaps, potentially requiring a hierarchical or multi-scale latent space.

### Open Question 2
**Question**: How can the framework prevent common concepts (e.g., "person", "car") from monopolizing hundreds of latent dimensions, which currently causes spurious activations?
**Basis in paper**: Appendix C.4 notes that common classes break selective attribution because "many latents receive concept assignments," leading to non-zero gradients and false positives even when the concept is absent.
**Why unresolved**: The current label assignment method (purity > 0.3) lacks a mechanism to cap or distribute latent usage for high-frequency concepts.
**What evidence would resolve it**: A revised assignment mechanism that maintains concept alignment while limiting latent allocation per class, reducing false positive rates in attribution tasks.

### Open Question 3
**Question**: Does the Global TopK constraint inherently degrade the linear probe-ability of individual latent dimensions compared to local sparsity methods?
**Basis in paper**: Table 3 shows Global TopK often yields higher (worse) probe loss than Local TopK, and Section 4.3 suggests probe losses may not reflect alignment quality, hinting at a trade-off.
**Why unresolved**: It is unclear if forcing identical activation indices across streams makes the dimensions less linearly separable for specific classification tasks.
**What evidence would resolve it**: An analysis comparing the orthogonality and linear separability of Global vs. Local TopK features on a diverse set of probing tasks.

## Limitations
- Caption generation for Open Images images is not specified, creating a critical reproducibility gap
- Hierarchical Jaccard metric may overestimate alignment at higher taxonomic levels where concepts become overly general
- Global TopK assumes sufficient concept diversity within the k-dimensional budget; failure cases where k is too small are not explored

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of Global TopK sparsity and its effect on eliminating mixed activation patterns (48.8% → 0%) is well-supported by quantitative evidence
- **Medium confidence**: The hierarchical Jaccard evaluation methodology is sound, though its sensitivity to taxonomy granularity requires further investigation
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-model retrieval results on MS-COCO (R@1=40%) are strong, but Open Images performance (R@1≈3%) suggests dataset-specific limitations

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the dead neuron distribution with Local TopK vs Global TopK to verify the claimed elimination of mixed activation patterns
2. Systematically vary k values (16, 32, 64, 128, 256) to identify the threshold where concept collisions begin degrading alignment quality
3. Implement hierarchical Jaccard evaluation on a held-out subset to verify consistency across multiple runs and assess sensitivity to taxonomy depth
