# Acoustic Classification of Maritime Vessels using Learnable Filterbanks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23964
- Authors: Jonas Elsborg; Tejs Vegge; Arghya Bhowmik
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: 96.63% test accuracy on VTUAD dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CATFISH, a deep learning model for classifying maritime vessels using passive underwater acoustic data. The model uses a trainable Gabor filterbank frontend that learns to emphasize frequency components robust to varying source-sensor distances and recording conditions. Trained on the VTUAD hydrophone dataset, CATFISH achieves 96.63% test accuracy across all recording scenarios, outperforming the previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. The approach includes 2D attention pooling to focus on invariant spectral cues and optionally fuses environmental metadata (conductivity, temperature, depth, salinity, and sound velocity).

## Method Summary
CATFISH processes raw underwater acoustic recordings through an end-to-end trainable architecture. The model employs a learnable Gabor filterbank frontend that automatically discovers optimal frequency representations for vessel classification. A 2D attention pooling mechanism identifies invariant spectral features across different recording conditions. The system optionally incorporates environmental metadata fusion when sensor data is available. The entire model is trained on the VTUAD dataset, which contains recordings from 15 vessel types under various operational scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.63% test accuracy across all VTUAD recording scenarios
- Outperforms previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points
- Ablation studies show either attention pooling or metadata fusion can independently improve robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The learnable Gabor filterbank automatically adapts to emphasize frequency components that remain stable across varying distances and recording conditions. This data-driven approach eliminates the need for hand-engineered acoustic features that typically require domain expertise. The 2D attention pooling mechanism focuses computational resources on invariant spectral patterns that consistently differentiate vessel types regardless of environmental factors.

## Foundational Learning

### Learnable Filterbanks
**Why needed**: Traditional fixed filterbanks require manual tuning and may miss important frequency patterns
**Quick check**: Verify that learned filters adapt to dataset characteristics during training

### 2D Attention Pooling
**Why needed**: Standard pooling methods can lose important spatial-temporal relationships in spectrograms
**Quick check**: Confirm attention weights highlight consistent features across different vessel recordings

### Environmental Metadata Fusion
**Why needed**: Underwater acoustic propagation varies with temperature, salinity, and depth
**Quick check**: Validate that metadata improves classification when environmental conditions vary significantly

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Raw Waveform -> Gabor Filterbank -> 2D Attention Pooling -> Classification Head
(Optional: Metadata Fusion Branch -> Classification Head)

### Critical Path
The learnable filterbank frontend is the critical path component, as it transforms raw waveforms into meaningful representations that the rest of the network builds upon. The quality of learned filters directly impacts classification accuracy.

### Design Tradeoffs
End-to-end trainability vs. interpretability: The learnable filters sacrifice human-understandable feature engineering for automated optimization. Computational overhead vs. accuracy: The Gabor filterbank adds processing cost but enables superior performance. Metadata dependency: Environmental sensor fusion improves accuracy but requires additional hardware.

### Failure Signatures
Poor generalization to vessel types not present in training data. Performance degradation in extreme noise conditions or when multiple vessels overlap. Reduced accuracy when environmental metadata is unavailable or inaccurate.

### First Experiments
1. Train on subset of vessel types to test scalability
2. Evaluate on recordings with artificially degraded signal quality
3. Test with and without metadata fusion to measure contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset generalizability uncertain due to limited vessel diversity
- Environmental metadata fusion assumes availability of CTD-SV sensors
- Performance under extreme noise conditions remains untested

## Confidence

### Claims and Confidence Levels
- 96.63% accuracy claim: **High** (rigorous train-validation-test split)
- Real-world deployment effectiveness: **Medium** (limited testing conditions)
- Generalization across recording scenarios: **Medium** (only VTUAD scenarios tested)
- No hand-engineered features required: **High** (clearly demonstrated end-to-end architecture)

## Next Checks
1. Test CATFISH on additional maritime acoustic datasets with different vessel types, geographic regions, and recording equipment to assess true generalization
2. Evaluate performance under extreme signal-to-noise ratios and overlapping vessel signatures to measure robustness limits
3. Compare computational efficiency and inference speed against traditional feature-engineering approaches for deployment on resource-constrained autonomous underwater vehicles
