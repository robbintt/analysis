# Federated Low-Rank Tensor Estimation for Multimodal Image Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.02761
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02761
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Key outcome:** Proposed federated low-rank tensor estimation method achieves superior reconstruction quality and communication compression compared to existing approaches, particularly under noisy and undersampled conditions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a federated low-rank tensor estimation method for multimodal image reconstruction that extends the FIRM framework with Tucker decomposition. The approach combines joint factorization and randomized sketching to manage large-scale multimodal data, enabling clients to transmit compressed tensor components without reconstructing full-size tensors. The method supports heterogeneous ranks, allowing clients to select decomposition ranks based on prior knowledge or communication capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves superior reconstruction quality and communication compression compared to existing approaches, particularly under noisy and undersampled conditions.

## Method Summary
The method extends federated learning to multimodal image reconstruction by incorporating Tucker decomposition for low-rank tensor estimation. Each client performs local reconstruction using projected gradient descent with ST-HOSVD projection to enforce rank constraints, then transmits compressed components (core tensor and factor matrices) to the server. The server performs joint factorization to compute shared factor matrices, followed by FIRM multimodal updates on core tensors. The approach avoids full tensor reconstruction during communication, enabling significant compression. The framework supports heterogeneous Tucker ranks across clients, trading reconstruction quality for communication efficiency based on local constraints.

## Key Results
- Outperforms popular compression techniques such as Top-k and sparse encoding in both reconstruction quality and communication compression
- Achieves superior performance under noisy and undersampled conditions compared to baseline FIRM and FedAvg methods
- Demonstrates effectiveness of joint factorization approach, as direct factor matrix averaging fails to produce meaningful training
- Provides theoretical guarantee (Proposition 1) for compression benefit when Tucker ranks satisfy r < n/(√2+1) for d=2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Low-Rank Regularization via Tucker Decomposition Constrains Ill-Posed Inverse Problem Solution Space
Enforcing low-rank structure through Tucker decomposition suppresses noise and artifacts in reconstructed images under undersampled, noisy conditions by constraining the solution to a low-dimensional subspace. The projected gradient descent update projects iterates onto the feasible set defined by multilinear rank constraints via ST-HOSVD, reducing overfitting to noise while preserving signal structure. Core assumption: The underlying signal admits a low multilinear rank approximation; noise does not share this structure.

### Mechanism 2: Joint Factorization Enables Latent Space Aggregation Without Full Tensor Reconstruction
Server aggregation via joint factorization preserves orthogonality of factor matrices and enables aggregation in compressed form. Rather than reconstructing full tensors to average, the server computes left singular vectors of concatenated mode-k unfoldings using Lemma II.1, enabling factor matrix computation from compressed components alone. Core assumption: Factor matrices maintained orthogonal (SᵀS = I); clients perform consistent decomposition structure.

### Mechanism 3: Randomized Sketching Reduces Server Complexity Independent of Client Count
Randomized QR-based joint factorization (CompRandJF) reduces server computation while maintaining reconstruction quality for moderate ranks. Rather than SVD on Y ∈ ℝⁿᵏˣⁿᴺΠʳ (growing with N), generate Gaussian sketch Z = WΩ and compute orthonormal basis via QR. The sketch dimension is rk, independent of N and other dimension sizes. Core assumption: Random sketch captures dominant column space; rank sufficiently large relative to intrinsic tensor rank.

## Foundational Learning

- **Tucker Decomposition:** Core representation; all client-server communication encodes tensors as core G plus factor matrices S₁...Sₐ. Quick check: Given tensor X ∈ ℝ²⁵⁰ˣ²⁵⁰ with rank-(40,40) Tucker, what is the compression ratio vs. full tensor?
- **Projected Gradient Descent:** Local client optimization enforces rank constraint via projection (ST-HOSVD) after each gradient step. Quick check: Why project after gradient descent rather than adding rank penalty to the loss?
- **Federated Learning Communication Constraints:** Motivates entire architecture; Tucker rank selection directly trades reconstruction quality for bandwidth. Quick check: If upstream and downstream bandwidth are asymmetric, how should rank selection differ for client vs. server transmissions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Client local update (Reconstruct → Gradient step → ST-HOSVD → Transmit) -> Server joint factorization (CompJF/CompRandJF → Broadcast factor matrices) -> Server core aggregation (Recompute cores → FIRM update → Transmit personalized cores)
- **Critical path:** Initialize Gᵢ(0), Sₖ(0) and broadcast → Each epoch: client gradient + projection → server joint factorization → core update → distribute → Early stopping via discrepancy principle: fᵢ⁽ᵗ⁾ ≤ max(Bᵢ)√(θτ)σ
- **Design tradeoffs:** CompJF vs. CompRandJF: CompRandJF is O(rd+rd+1) vs. CompJF's O(nrd), but CompRandJF degrades for small r; Rank selection: Higher r → better reconstruction but compression ratio drops; Heterogeneous ranks: Flexibility for client constraints, but server computes r*k = max(r1k,...,rNk)
- **Failure signatures:** PSNR/SSIM improving then declining while loss decreases → overfitting to noise; CompRandJF underperforming CompJF at same rank → sketch too small; Direct FedAvg-style averaging of factor matrices yields meaningless training
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline sanity check: Run FIRM on synthetic Shepp-Logan phantom with σ=0.05 noise, 100 angles. 2) Rank sweep: Run CompJF with r ∈ {20, 40, 60, 80, 100} on same data. 3) Heterogeneous rank test: Assign each of 4 clients random r ∈ [20,100] sampled once. Run CompRandJF.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed federated low-rank tensor estimation method? The conclusion states plans to conduct convergence analyses, noting that the current study relies on numerical validation. Unresolved because the paper demonstrates empirical success but lacks a mathematical proof that the projected gradient descent and joint factorization scheme converges to a stationary point or solution.

### Open Question 2
How can clients adaptively select optimal Tucker ranks without prior knowledge of the true data rank? The authors identify "randomized rank selection" as a "valuable research avenue" because "true data ranks are often unknown in practice." Unresolved because the experiments pre-define or randomly sample ranks; there is no mechanism to automatically determine the optimal rank that balances compression and reconstruction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
How does the method perform on higher-dimensional datasets beyond the 2D synthetic examples presented? The authors explicitly list plans to "explore higher-dimensional datasets" in the future work section. Unresolved because the numerical experiments are restricted to 2D images ($250 \times 250$), and it is unclear how computational costs and joint factorization scale to 3D or 4D tensors.

## Limitations

- Theoretical convergence guarantees for the federated joint factorization procedure are not established
- No principled method for determining optimal Tucker ranks in heterogeneous settings
- Scalability with increasing client count and tensor dimensionality requires further validation
- Performance under extreme communication constraints and real-world data heterogeneity not fully characterized

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core Tucker decomposition framework for local client updates; the FIRM multimodal update procedure; the principle that low-rank regularization can improve ill-posed inverse problems
- **Medium confidence:** The joint factorization aggregation method (CompJF); the randomized sketching variant (CompRandJF) for moderate ranks; the overall federated learning architecture
- **Low confidence:** Theoretical guarantees for convergence; exact rank selection criteria in heterogeneous settings; scalability bounds for large N; performance under extreme communication constraints

## Next Checks

1. **Rank sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary Tucker ranks across a wider range (r ∈ [10, 150]) on the synthetic phantom dataset with multiple noise levels (σ ∈ {0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2}). Plot reconstruction quality vs. communication compression ratio to characterize the Pareto frontier.

2. **Scalability benchmark:** Extend experiments beyond N=4 to N ∈ {8, 16, 32} clients with heterogeneous data distributions. Measure wall-clock time, communication volume, and reconstruction quality to validate scalability claims, particularly for CompRandJF. Test with larger tensor dimensions (e.g., 512×512).

3. **Cross-dataset generalization:** Apply the method to a different multimodal imaging dataset (e.g., real CT-PET or multi-spectral MRI data) to assess whether the federated Tucker decomposition approach generalizes beyond synthetic phantoms. Compare against established federated imaging methods and evaluate robustness to realistic data heterogeneity.
