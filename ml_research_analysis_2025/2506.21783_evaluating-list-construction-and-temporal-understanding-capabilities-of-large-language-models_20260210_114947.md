# Evaluating List Construction and Temporal Understanding capabilities of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21783
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21783
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Large language models struggle with both list completeness and temporal accuracy in time-referenced question answering, even with golden evidence

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TLQA, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on list construction and temporal understanding. TLQA requires models to generate lists of entities with corresponding time intervals, reflecting real-world queries involving historical events or news. The authors create TLQA using an automated pipeline that extracts entities from Wikipedia infoboxes and generates questions using templates. They evaluate several LLMs in closed-book, open-domain, and golden evidence setups. Results show that models struggle with both list completeness and temporal accuracy, particularly in closed-book settings. Retrieval augmentation improves performance, but even with golden evidence, models exhibit temporal understanding limitations, such as incorrect time bounds. The study highlights the need for improved retrieval and temporal reasoning in LLMs for real-world applications like healthcare, historical research, and journalism.

## Method Summary
The TLQA benchmark evaluates LLMs on time-referenced list-based question answering through three variants: base TLQA (full list generation), TLQA-TS (time-span constrained), and TLQA-TM (implicit temporal markers). The benchmark uses 1655 questions across sports and political domains, with Wikipedia corpus variants (title+infobox+summary and title+summary documents). Models are evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 for list construction, plus temporal overlap and temporal Jaccard for time interval accuracy. The evaluation tests Mistral v0.2 7b and GPT-4o-mini across closed-book, open-domain RAG with various retrieval methods (BM25, dense embeddings), and golden evidence setups. Temperature is set to 0.3 for all experiments.

## Key Results
- Models show high precision but low recall in closed-book settings, generating correct but incomplete entity lists
- Retrieval augmentation improves performance, but even with golden evidence, models exhibit temporal understanding limitations with incorrect time bounds
- Temporal performance on TLQA-TM (implicit temporal markers) is the lowest, as models struggle to detect implicit temporal references in questions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None specified in the paper

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal reasoning in LLMs**: Understanding how models process and reason about time intervals and temporal relationships. Why needed: TLQA specifically tests temporal understanding capabilities. Quick check: Can the model correctly order events chronologically from a given passage?
- **List generation and ranking**: The ability to generate ordered lists of entities with associated attributes. Why needed: TLQA requires generating ranked lists of entities with time intervals. Quick check: Can the model generate a ranked list of presidents with their terms from general knowledge?
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Combining retrieval systems with LLMs to provide relevant context. Why needed: TLQA tests both closed-book and open-domain setups. Quick check: Can the model answer questions more accurately when provided relevant retrieved documents?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question -> Retrieval System -> LLM -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: Question processing → Entity extraction → Temporal span identification → List generation → Temporal validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Closed-book vs retrieval-augmented setups balance knowledge coverage against generation quality. Using Wikipedia infoboxes provides structured data but may miss temporal nuances. Template-based question generation ensures consistency but may not capture all real-world query patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High precision, low recall: Models generate correct but incomplete entity lists
- Temporal Overlap >> Temporal Jaccard: Models frequently overshoot or undershoot time intervals
- Poor performance on TLQA-TM: Models fail to decode implicit temporal markers

**First Experiments**:
1. Test few-shot prompting with 3-5 examples from training set to establish baseline performance
2. Compare BM25 vs dense retrieval (all-MiniLM-L2-v2) for entity-centric queries to identify optimal retrieval approach
3. Evaluate model performance on TLQA-TM subset to quantify difficulty of implicit temporal understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can LLMs' temporal understanding be improved to correctly bound time intervals even when golden evidence is provided? The paper demonstrates that even with golden evidence, models exhibit temporal understanding limitations such as incorrect time bounds, with Temporal Overlap scores exceeding Temporal Jaccard scores indicating overshooting/undershooting errors.

### Open Question 2
Can specialized tabular retrieval methods for infoboxes improve performance on TLQA over general-purpose retrieval approaches? The paper found BM25 outperformed dense retrieval on entity-centric queries and concluded there exists scope for improvement of tabular retrieval, suggesting current methods may not be optimized for structured infobox data.

### Open Question 3
How can implicit temporal understanding be improved for questions containing temporal markers that require inferring specific time periods? Results show temporal performance on TLQA-TM is the lowest, as models are unable to detect implicit temporal references made by markers in questions, such as interpreting "after serving as Minister of National Defence."

## Limitations
- Limited model evaluation using only two model families (Mistral v0.2 7b and GPT-4o-mini) may not generalize to other architectures
- Template-based question generation may not capture all real-world query patterns and complexities
- No human baseline established to contextualize the absolute difficulty of the temporal understanding task

## Confidence
- **High**: Model performance differences across closed-book, retrieval-augmented, and golden evidence setups are well-supported by consistent metrics
- **Medium**: Conclusions about specific model capabilities may not generalize beyond tested architectures (Mistral v0.2 7b and GPT-4o-mini)
- **Low**: Absolute difficulty of the task cannot be fully assessed without human performance baselines or comparison to general question answering

## Next Checks
1. Implement human evaluation of temporal understanding by having annotators rate the accuracy of time intervals in model-generated lists, focusing on cases where Temporal Overlap is high but Temporal Jaccard is low
2. Test additional model architectures (e.g., Llama 3, Claude Haiku) in both closed-book and retrieval-augmented setups to verify the generalizability of performance patterns across model families
3. Conduct ablation studies on the corpus variants (T-S vs T-I-S) to quantify the impact of infobox information on both entity recall and temporal accuracy, determining whether the additional structured data meaningfully improves temporal reasoning
