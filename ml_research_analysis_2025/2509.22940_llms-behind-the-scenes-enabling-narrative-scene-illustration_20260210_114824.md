# LLMs Behind the Scenes: Enabling Narrative Scene Illustration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.22940
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22940
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LLM-generated captions significantly improve image quality for narrative scene illustrations compared to raw text

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a pipeline for generating narrative scene illustrations by combining large language models (LLMs) with text-to-image generation systems. The approach fragments story text into individual scenes, uses LLMs to generate detailed captions for each scene, and then produces corresponding images through text-to-image models. Human evaluation demonstrates that LLM-generated captions produce substantially higher quality images compared to using raw story text directly. The work also introduces a novel dataset of 2,990 annotated illustrations and shows that LLMs can effectively generate evaluation criteria for assessing illustration quality.

## Method Summary
The pipeline operates through a multi-stage process where narrative text is first segmented into distinct scenes, then LLMs generate rich, descriptive captions for each scene segment, and finally these captions are fed into text-to-image models to create corresponding illustrations. The LLM caption generation serves as an intermediate step to bridge the gap between narrative text and visual representation, effectively translating story context into detailed visual descriptions that text-to-image models can render more effectively than raw narrative text.

## Key Results
- Human annotations show LLM-generated captions significantly improve image quality over raw text input
- Novel dataset of 2,990 annotated narrative scene illustrations released for research
- LLMs can generate effective evaluation criteria for assessing illustration quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline works by addressing the fundamental mismatch between narrative text structure and image generation requirements. Raw story text often contains implicit information, complex narrative structures, and context that text-to-image models struggle to interpret directly. By using LLMs to generate explicit, detailed captions that describe visual elements, scene composition, and character details, the system provides text-to-image models with clearer, more actionable instructions that align with their training on captioned image data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Scene fragmentation techniques**: Why needed - to break continuous narrative into discrete visual moments; Quick check - verify fragments capture complete visualizable events
- **LLM-based caption generation**: Why needed - to translate narrative context into explicit visual descriptions; Quick check - ensure captions contain concrete visual elements
- **Text-to-image model integration**: Why needed - to convert descriptive captions into visual representations; Quick check - verify caption length and detail level match model requirements
- **Human evaluation methodology**: Why needed - to assess qualitative improvements in generated illustrations; Quick check - establish clear evaluation criteria and rater training
- **Dataset annotation processes**: Why needed - to create reliable ground truth for evaluation; Quick check - validate annotation consistency across raters
- **Evaluation criteria generation**: Why needed - to automate quality assessment of illustrations; Quick check - compare generated criteria against expert standards

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Story Text -> Scene Fragmentation -> LLM Caption Generation -> Text-to-Image Model -> Final Illustration

Critical Path: The bottleneck occurs at LLM caption generation, as this step determines the quality of all downstream outputs. The scene fragmentation must accurately identify visually distinct moments, and the text-to-image model must effectively interpret the generated captions.

Design Tradeoffs: The system trades computational efficiency for quality by adding the LLM caption generation step. While raw text could be used directly, the additional processing time yields significantly better results. The approach also requires careful balance in caption detail - too sparse and images lack quality, too verbose and text-to-image models may struggle.

Failure Signatures: Common failures include scene fragmentation breaking mid-action, LLM captions missing key visual elements or adding hallucinated details, and text-to-image models failing to render complex scene compositions. When any stage fails, the final illustration quality degrades proportionally.

First Experiments:
1. Test scene fragmentation accuracy on diverse narrative styles (action-heavy vs. dialogue-heavy stories)
2. Evaluate caption quality variation across different LLM prompts and temperature settings
3. Assess text-to-image model performance with captions of varying length and detail complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation without objective quality metrics makes it difficult to quantify actual improvement magnitude
- Unknown dataset representativeness across different story genres and complexity levels
- LLM-generated evaluation criteria not validated against established quality assessment frameworks

## Confidence
High confidence: The core pipeline architecture is technically sound and follows established multimodal AI practices.

Medium confidence: The qualitative claim about caption improvement based on human annotations, though lacking quantitative metrics and reliability measures.

Low confidence: The assertion that LLMs can autonomously generate effective evaluation criteria without rigorous validation against expert benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator reliability analysis on human evaluation data to establish consistency and determine statistical significance of quality improvements.

2. Implement automated quality metrics (such as CLIP-based similarity scores) to complement human evaluations and provide objective quality measures across the dataset.

3. Test the pipeline on diverse story genres including complex narratives with abstract concepts, non-linear storytelling, and culturally specific references to assess generalizability and identify failure modes.
