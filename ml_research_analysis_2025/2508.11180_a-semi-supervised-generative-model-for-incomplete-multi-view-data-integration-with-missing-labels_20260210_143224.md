# A Semi-supervised Generative Model for Incomplete Multi-View Data Integration with Missing Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11180
- Reference count: 4
- Proposes a semi-supervised generative model for incomplete multi-view data with missing labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-view learning with missing views and missing labels, which is common in real-world applications like multi-omics data analysis. The authors propose a semi-supervised generative model that combines variational inference with mutual information maximization to learn robust joint representations from incomplete multi-view data. Their method uses a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present views, incorporates a supervised information bottleneck loss on labeled data, applies generative modeling on unlabeled data, and introduces cross-view mutual information regularization to enhance shared information extraction.

## Method Summary
The proposed method is a semi-supervised generative model for incomplete multi-view data that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data. The model employs a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from available views, uses a supervised information bottleneck loss for labeled samples, applies generative modeling for unlabeled data, and incorporates cross-view mutual information maximization to enhance shared information extraction across views. This approach addresses the dual challenge of missing views and missing labels simultaneously through a unified probabilistic framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUROC up to 0.75 on TCGA multi-omics data and 0.9996 on PolyMNIST
- Outperforms existing approaches in both predictive performance and missing-view imputation quality
- Demonstrates effectiveness of leveraging unlabeled data and cross-view mutual information for incomplete multi-view learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating three key mechanisms: (1) product-of-experts aggregation that effectively combines information from available views while handling missingness naturally, (2) information bottleneck regularization that balances predictive power with representation compression, and (3) mutual information maximization that explicitly encourages shared information extraction across views. This combination allows the model to learn robust joint representations that are both predictive and generalizable across missing-view scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Variational Inference**
- Why needed: Provides probabilistic framework for learning latent representations from incomplete data
- Quick check: Model should converge to stable ELBO values during training

**Product-of-Experts**
- Why needed: Enables natural handling of missing views by combining available expert opinions
- Quick check: Representation quality should degrade gracefully as views become missing

**Information Bottleneck**
- Why needed: Balances predictive performance with representation compression for better generalization
- Quick check: Trade-off parameter β should significantly impact model performance

**Mutual Information Maximization**
- Why needed: Encourages extraction of shared information across different views
- Quick check: Cross-view MI should correlate with downstream task performance

**Critical Path**
1. Encode each available view through separate encoders
2. Aggregate encoded representations using product-of-experts
3. Apply information bottleneck to balance prediction and compression
4. Maximize mutual information across views for shared representation learning

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Product-of-experts vs. concatenation: Experts provide natural missingness handling but may lose view-specific information
- Information bottleneck weight β: Higher values improve generalization but may reduce predictive accuracy
- Mutual information weight α: Controls emphasis on shared information vs. individual view learning

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor imputation quality when missingness is systematic rather than random
- Performance degradation under extreme view imbalance (>80% missing views)
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, particularly β and α

**First Experiments**
1. Compare product-of-experts vs. simple concatenation under controlled missingness
2. Ablate information bottleneck component to measure its contribution
3. Vary mutual information weight α to find optimal trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes shared latent space across views, which may not hold when views capture fundamentally different aspects of data
- Performance on datasets with severe view imbalance or systematic missingness patterns remains untested
- Mutual information regularization may introduce computational overhead and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning

## Confidence
- High confidence in predictive performance improvements on TCGA and PolyMNIST datasets
- Medium confidence in generalization to other multi-view domains due to limited dataset diversity
- Low confidence in claimed robustness to varying levels of missing views (experiments focus on controlled scenarios)

## Next Checks
1. Test on datasets with systematic rather than random missingness patterns to assess robustness
2. Evaluate performance under extreme view imbalance (e.g., 90% missing views) to determine practical limits
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of information bottleneck, generative modeling, and mutual information components
