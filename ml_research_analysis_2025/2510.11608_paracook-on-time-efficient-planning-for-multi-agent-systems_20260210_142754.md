## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11608
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11608
- Authors: Shiqi Zhang; Xinbei Ma; Yunqing Xu; Zouying Cao; Pengrui Lu; Haobo Yuan; Tiancheng Shen; Zhuosheng Zhang; Hai Zhao; Ming-Hsuan Yang

- Key outcome: Benchmark reveals LLMs achieve 65% success rate on multi-agent cooking tasks, significantly below human efficiency in movement and coordination

## Executive Summary
ParaCook introduces a benchmark for evaluating time-efficient parallel planning in multi-agent systems, focusing on cooking tasks with simplified action spaces to isolate strategic scheduling capabilities. The benchmark evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro on both embodied and abstract tasks, measuring success rate, order completion time, movement distance, and agent utilization. Results demonstrate that while GPT-5 achieves the highest success rate (65%), it significantly lags behind human performance in efficiency and coordination, particularly in complex scenarios involving resource contention and spatial optimization.

The analysis reveals a stark contrast between LLMs' near-optimal performance on abstract high-level scheduling tasks and their suboptimal low-level embodied execution, highlighting the need for structured planning approaches as a bridge. This gap suggests that current models excel at strategic reasoning but struggle with the practical implementation of efficient multi-agent coordination, pointing to opportunities for hierarchical planning frameworks and novel algorithmic solutions to overcome these limitations.

## Method Summary
ParaCook introduces a cooking-focused benchmark with simplified action spaces to evaluate time-efficient parallel planning in multi-agent systems. The benchmark includes both embodied tasks (with spatial movement constraints) and abstract tasks (focusing on high-level scheduling without physical constraints). Evaluation metrics include success rate, order completion time, movement distance, and agent utilization. The study tests state-of-the-art LLMs using various prompting strategies, including Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and compares their performance against human baselines. The simplified action space design isolates strategic scheduling from execution complexity, allowing researchers to identify specific bottlenecks in multi-agent coordination.

## Key Results
- GPT-5 achieves highest success rate (65%) among evaluated LLMs but significantly lags behind human performance
- Abstract tasks reveal LLMs' strong potential in high-level scheduling compared to embodied execution
- Humans demonstrate superior efficiency in movement distance (47.75 vs 143.55 for GPT-5) and agent utilization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ParaCook works by isolating strategic scheduling from execution complexity through its simplified action space design. By focusing on cooking tasks with clearly defined workstations and sequential action requirements, the benchmark creates a controlled environment where multi-agent coordination challenges become apparent. The separation between embodied and abstract tasks allows researchers to identify whether performance gaps stem from high-level planning deficiencies or low-level execution problems. This isolation mechanism reveals that current LLMs excel at strategic reasoning (as evidenced by near-optimal abstract task performance) but struggle with practical implementation aspects like spatial optimization and resource contention resolution.

## Foundational Learning
**Multi-Agent Coordination** - Understanding how multiple agents can work together efficiently without interfering with each other's tasks.
*Why needed*: Essential for identifying bottlenecks in parallel planning and evaluating coordination strategies.
*Quick check*: Can you explain how resource contention affects multi-agent performance in shared environments?

**Parallel Planning** - The ability to generate schedules that optimize task completion time across multiple agents working simultaneously.
*Why needed*: Core capability being evaluated; determines how well agents can work in parallel without idle time.
*Quick check*: What distinguishes parallel planning from sequential planning in multi-agent contexts?

**Hierarchical Planning Frameworks** - Architectural approaches that separate high-level strategic planning from low-level execution details.
*Why needed*: Proposed solution to bridge the gap between abstract reasoning and embodied execution performance.
*Quick check*: How would a two-layer hierarchy improve LLM performance on embodied tasks?

**Resource Contention Management** - Strategies for handling situations where multiple agents compete for the same limited resources.
*Why needed*: Critical bottleneck identified in the benchmark where human performance significantly exceeds LLM performance.
*Quick check*: What mechanisms can prevent deadlock when multiple agents need the same workstation?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Task Generator -> Environment Simulator -> LLM Planner -> Action Executor -> Performance Metrics

Critical path: Task Generator → LLM Planner → Action Executor → Performance Metrics
The LLM Planner receives task specifications and generates schedules, which are then executed in the Environment Simulator. Performance metrics are collected throughout execution to evaluate success rate, completion time, movement distance, and agent utilization.

Design tradeoffs:
- Simplified action space vs. real-world complexity: The benchmark sacrifices environmental realism for controlled evaluation of strategic scheduling
- Embodied vs. abstract tasks: Separating physical constraints from planning logic reveals whether performance gaps are fundamental or implementation-specific
- Limited agent methods vs. comprehensive evaluation: Focus on IO and CoT strategies may miss other potentially effective prompting approaches

Failure signatures:
- High movement distance with low agent utilization indicates poor spatial optimization
- Success rate drops in complex maps suggest limitations in handling resource contention
- Large gaps between abstract and embodied performance reveal execution-level coordination problems

First experiments:
1. Run GPT-5 with CoT prompting on a simple 2-agent, 3-workstation cooking task to establish baseline performance
2. Compare embodied vs. abstract performance on identical task specifications to identify planning vs. execution bottlenecks
3. Vary agent count while holding task complexity constant to measure scalability of different LLM approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can hierarchical planning frameworks effectively bridge the gap between LLMs' near-optimal abstract scheduling and their suboptimal low-level embodied execution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The analysis concludes that "the contrast between near-optimal performance on abstract tasks and the inefficiency in real ParaCook highlights the need for structured approaches as a bridge, such as hierarchical planning frameworks."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates current models and identifies the discrepancy but does not propose or test specific hierarchical architectures to resolve it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study implementing a hierarchical planner that successfully translates high-level schedules into efficient low-level actions with comparable time efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What novel algorithmic solutions are required to overcome the challenges of parallel planning that standard prompting strategies fail to address?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that the work "does not propose a novel solution to overcome the parallel planning challenges" and that "The scope of Agent methods tested was limited, primarily focusing on IO and CoT strategies."
- Why unresolved: The benchmark reveals that current approaches yield suboptimal plans, but the development of specialized algorithms is designated as future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: The proposal of a new planning method that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (GPT-5 with CoT) on the ParaCook benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can multi-agent planning models be improved to handle resource contention and spatial optimization to match human efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Results in Section 6.2 show a "stark" disparity in Movement Distance (pMD), where humans (47.75) significantly outperform GPT-5 (143.55), indicating a failure in spatial optimization and resource handling.
- Why unresolved: The paper quantifies the gap but does not investigate specific mechanisms to reduce unnecessary movement or resolve workstation contention effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model achieving human-comparable Movement Distance (MD) and Agent Utilization (AU) scores on complex, multi-agent maps.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology may be influenced by simplified action space design that could artificially constrain LLM performance
- Comparison against human baselines lacks specificity about reference group composition and expertise level
- Focus on cooking tasks may not generalize to other multi-agent domains with different coordination requirements
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture emergent behaviors and qualitative aspects of multi-agent coordination

## Confidence

The claim that ParaCook addresses a gap in evaluating time-efficient parallel planning for multi-agent systems receives **High confidence** - this is a factual statement about the benchmark's purpose and design.

The claim about GPT-5 achieving the highest success rate (65%) among evaluated LLMs receives **Medium confidence** - while the result is reported, the comparison methodology and baseline specifications require clarification.

The claim that abstract tasks reveal LLMs' strong potential in high-level scheduling receives **Low confidence** - this interpretation extends beyond the reported metrics and requires additional validation to confirm practical significance.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying the complexity of the action space to determine how much the simplified design impacts LLM performance relative to humans, establishing whether the performance gap is due to planning capabilities or environmental constraints.

2. Implement cross-domain validation by applying the same evaluation framework to non-cooking multi-agent scenarios (such as warehouse logistics or traffic management) to test the generalizability of the findings about LLM scheduling capabilities.

3. Design and execute a controlled experiment comparing LLM performance against human experts on identical tasks, measuring not just success rates but also qualitative aspects of coordination and adaptability to determine whether the observed efficiency gaps are fundamental or implementation-specific.
