# Deep learning approaches to surgical video segmentation and object detection: A Scoping Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16459
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Analysis of 58 studies showing larger organs like liver achieve high accuracy (Dice score: 0.88), while smaller structures like nerves show lower accuracy (Dice score: 0.49)

## Executive Summary
This scoping review analyzed 58 studies on deep learning-based computer vision models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in surgical videos. The review found that U-Net and DeepLab were the most commonly used models, with laparoscopic procedures dominating the research landscape. Performance varied significantly based on target anatomy, with larger organs achieving substantially higher accuracy than smaller structures. Real-time inference speeds demonstrated practical applicability, ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second across different implementations.

## Method Summary
The review employed a scoping methodology to examine deep learning approaches for surgical video segmentation and object detection. Researchers systematically identified and analyzed studies focusing on anatomical structure identification, with particular attention to model architectures, target procedures, and performance metrics. The analysis included examination of dataset characteristics, annotation protocols, and inference capabilities across the selected studies, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field.

## Key Results
- Larger organs like liver achieved high accuracy (Dice score: 0.88), while smaller structures like nerves showed lower accuracy (Dice score: 0.49)
- U-Net (24.1%) and DeepLab (22.4%) were the most commonly used models
- Majority of studies focused on laparoscopic procedures, particularly cholecystectomy (24.1%) and anterior rectal resection (8.6%)
- Real-time inference speeds ranged from 5-298 frames-per-second, demonstrating practical applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of deep learning models in surgical video segmentation stems from their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations from raw pixel data. Convolutional neural networks excel at capturing spatial patterns and contextual information, which is crucial for distinguishing anatomical structures in complex surgical scenes. The U-Net architecture's skip connections enable precise localization by combining high-resolution features with semantic context, while DeepLab's atrous convolutions allow for capturing multi-scale information without losing resolution. These architectural choices, combined with large annotated datasets and transfer learning from general computer vision tasks, enable models to achieve the reported Dice scores and real-time inference capabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Segmentation/Detection -> Post-processing -> Inference Output

### Critical Path
Input Video Frames -> CNN Feature Extraction -> Feature Map Generation -> Segmentation Mask Prediction -> Refined Output

### Design Tradeoffs
- Accuracy vs. Real-time Performance: Higher resolution processing improves accuracy but reduces inference speed
- Model Complexity vs. Generalization: More complex models may overfit to specific datasets
- Training Data Size vs. Performance: Larger, diverse datasets improve model robustness but require more resources

### Failure Signatures
- Poor performance on small anatomical structures
- Reduced accuracy with varying lighting conditions
- Overfitting to specific surgical procedures or equipment

### First Experiments
1. Test baseline U-Net model on standard surgical video dataset
2. Compare performance on large vs. small anatomical structures
3. Evaluate inference speed across different hardware configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can models be adapted to handle the extreme variability in surgical video quality and lighting conditions?
- What annotation strategies can reduce the burden of creating large-scale datasets for rare surgical procedures?
- Can transfer learning from general computer vision tasks be effectively leveraged for surgical video analysis?
- How can real-time performance be maintained while improving accuracy for smaller anatomical structures?

## Limitations
- Scoping review methodology may have missed non-English studies or those in non-indexed journals
- Performance comparisons complicated by varying dataset sizes, image resolutions, and annotation quality
- Limited geographic diversity in datasets and potential publication bias toward successful implementations
- Focus on laparoscopic procedures may not generalize to other surgical specialties
- Lack of standardized evaluation protocols across studies makes direct comparison difficult

## Confidence
- High confidence in model prevalence findings (U-Net, DeepLab)
- Medium confidence in performance metrics due to heterogeneous study conditions
- Low confidence in generalizability claims across different surgical contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic comparison of Dice scores across studies using normalized datasets and standardized annotation protocols
2. Evaluate real-time inference performance on diverse hardware configurations to verify reported 5-298 FPS range
3. Assess model performance on underrepresented surgical specialties and anatomical structures beyond the most studied procedures
