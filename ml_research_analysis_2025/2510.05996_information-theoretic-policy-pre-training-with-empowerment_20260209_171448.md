# Information-Theoretic Policy Pre-Training with Empowerment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.05996
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05996
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Pre-training policies with discounted empowerment as intrinsic reward improves sample efficiency across multiple RL algorithms in gridworld environments.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to policy pre-training in reinforcement learning using discounted empowerment as an intrinsic reward signal. The authors extend traditional empowerment to discounted empowerment, balancing short- and long-term agent control over the environment. They demonstrate that pre-training policies to maximize discounted empowerment leads to data-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks across multiple RL algorithms in both deterministic and stochastic gridworld environments. The results show consistent performance improvements compared to training from scratch, with the most significant gains observed in simpler RL algorithms like REINFORCE and Actor-Critic.

## Method Summary
The method involves computing discounted empowerment values for all states in a gridworld environment using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for stochastic dynamics or reachability analysis for deterministic dynamics. Policies are then pre-trained using standard RL algorithms (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, PPO, DQN) to maximize these empowerment values as intrinsic rewards. The pre-trained policies are subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks with extrinsic rewards. The authors find that capacity-maximizing policies (which navigate to high empowerment states) outperform capacity-achieving policies (which maximize channel capacity at a state) for pre-training purposes.

## Key Results
- Pre-trained policies show consistent performance improvements across all tested RL algorithms compared to training from scratch
- The most significant gains are observed in high-variance algorithms like REINFORCE and Actor-Critic
- Capacity-maximizing policies outperform capacity-achieving policies for pre-training
- Discounted empowerment (λ=0.95, H=32) provides a more effective pre-training signal than fixed-horizon n-step empowerment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information-Geometric Initialization
Pre-training with empowerment creates a policy initialization that is robust and adaptable by positioning the policy in a "central" region of the state-visitation manifold. Maximizing mutual information minimizes the maximum KL divergence between the agent's state distribution and all other achievable state distributions, placing the initialization near the center of the "information ball" of reachable distributions.

### Mechanism 2: Discounted Horizon Balancing
Discounted empowerment provides a more stable and effective pre-training signal than fixed-horizon n-step empowerment by summing channel capacities across multiple horizons with a discount factor λ. This balances short-term and long-term control, preventing the signal degradation that occurs with large fixed horizons where most states become reachable.

### Mechanism 3: Variance Reduction via Competence
Empowerment pre-training functions as a variance reduction mechanism by giving the agent a basic understanding of dynamics before task-specific learning. This prevents the "blind" exploration of random initialization, particularly benefiting high-variance algorithms like REINFORCE by stabilizing early gradient estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mutual Information & Channel Capacity**
  - **Why needed here**: The core objective is maximizing the channel capacity between action sequences and future states
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is necessary to calculate the capacity-achieving distribution in stochastic environments?

- **Concept: Policy Gradient Variance**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper posits that empowerment reduces variance in policy gradient methods
  - **Quick check question**: How does the addition of a baseline (or critic) reduce variance in policy gradient methods without biasing the gradient?

- **Concept: State-Marginal Distribution Geometry**
  - **Why needed here**: The theoretical justification relies on the "information ball" of state-marginal distributions
  - **Quick check question**: How does a policy π induce a specific state-marginal distribution ρ(s), and why would minimizing the distance to the "center" of ρ help in unknown tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment -> Empowerment Calculator -> Pre-training Loop -> Fine-tuning Loop
- **Critical path**: The accuracy of the Empowerment Calculator, which computes E_λ(s) for all states
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Capacity-Maximizing vs. Capacity-Achieving: Capacity-Maximizing policies perform better for pre-training
  - Observation Space: Low-dimensional encodings show clear benefits; high-dimensional inputs require CNNs
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Uniform Reward Landscape: Large horizons create flat empowerment landscapes
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: High learning rates during fine-tuning may overwrite pre-training knowledge
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check (Gridworld): Reproduce Figure 2 comparing 32-step vs. discounted empowerment
  2. Algorithm Sensitivity: Train REINFORCE and PPO agents, then fine-tune on sparse goal rewards
  3. Policy Type Ablation: Compare capacity-achieving vs. capacity-maximizing policies for pre-training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can empowerment-based pre-training be scaled to high-dimensional, complex environments where exact empowerment computation is intractable? (Basis: Abstract and Discussion sections; unresolved due to computational challenges in high-dimensional spaces)

- **Open Question 2**: Why does pre-training a value network with empowerment signals transfer effectively to downstream tasks, given that the pre-training objective differs semantically from the downstream task value? (Basis: Page 10 discussion; unresolved due to lack of theoretical justification)

- **Open Question 3**: Does the information geometric intuition hold for unconditioned policy pre-training, or is it specific to skill discovery? (Basis: Appendix B; unresolved due to fundamental distinction between skill-based and action-based pre-training)

## Limitations
- Empirical validation restricted to gridworld environments with discrete states and actions
- Requires exact knowledge of transition dynamics for empowerment calculation
- Distinction between policy types may not translate to complex environments
- Computational intractability of empowerment estimation in high-dimensional spaces

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Variance reduction through competence mechanism is well-supported by experimental evidence
- **Medium confidence**: Information-geometric interpretation is theoretically sound but lacks rigorous empirical validation beyond gridworlds
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to high-dimensional continuous control tasks remains untested

## Next Checks

1. Test discounted empowerment pre-training on continuous control benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo) using variational approximations of empowerment
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different discount factors λ to identify optimal balance between short-term and long-term control signals
3. Evaluate the approach on partially observable environments where the agent must learn both dynamics and state estimation during pre-training
