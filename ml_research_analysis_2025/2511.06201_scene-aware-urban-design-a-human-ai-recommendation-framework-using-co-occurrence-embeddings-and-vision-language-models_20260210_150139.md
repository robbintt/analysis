# Scene-Aware Urban Design: A Human-AI Recommendation Framework Using Co-Occurrence Embeddings and Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.06201
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06201
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: A human-in-the-loop framework for micro-scale urban design that combines computer vision, co-occurrence embeddings, and VLM to generate contextually appropriate public space interventions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a human-in-the-loop computer vision framework for micro-scale urban design that uses generative AI to suggest contextually appropriate public space interventions. The method combines Grounding DINO object detection, co-occurrence embeddings derived from the ADE20K dataset, and vision-language models to propose urban object additions grounded in statistical spatial patterns and visual context. Users select an anchor object, receive statistically likely complements, and obtain five additional recommendations via semantic reasoning. In a pilot interface, the system produced contextually specific suggestions such as bus stops, kiosks, and wayfinding signage, demonstrating its ability to generate functionally relevant, visually coherent design options. Limitations include 2D spatial analysis and dataset bias, with future work targeting 3D understanding, AR deployment, and participatory evaluation.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a four-stage pipeline: (1) object detection using Grounding DINO to identify urban elements in input images, (2) co-occurrence embedding extraction from the ADE20K dataset to capture statistical spatial relationships between objects, (3) user interaction where participants select an anchor object and receive statistically likely complements, and (4) VLM-based semantic reasoning to generate five additional design recommendations. The system is implemented in a web interface that allows users to upload urban images, select anchor objects, and view AI-generated intervention suggestions. The approach integrates computer vision for scene understanding with statistical and semantic reasoning to produce contextually appropriate urban design recommendations.

## Key Results
- The system successfully generated contextually specific design suggestions including bus stops, kiosks, and wayfinding signage in a pilot interface.
- VLM-based semantic reasoning produced five additional recommendations that complemented the statistically derived complements.
- The human-in-the-loop approach demonstrated potential for generating functionally relevant and visually coherent urban design options.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages co-occurrence patterns learned from large-scale urban imagery to identify statistically likely spatial relationships between objects. By combining these patterns with semantic reasoning through vision-language models, the system can suggest contextually appropriate interventions that go beyond simple statistical matching. The human-in-the-loop component ensures that recommendations are grounded in the user's specific design intent while benefiting from AI's ability to recognize patterns across thousands of urban scenes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Object detection with Grounding DINO**: Essential for identifying and localizing urban elements in images. Quick check: Verify detection accuracy on diverse urban imagery.
- **Co-occurrence embeddings from ADE20K**: Captures statistical spatial relationships between objects in urban scenes. Quick check: Validate embedding quality through similarity retrieval tasks.
- **Vision-language model integration**: Enables semantic reasoning beyond statistical patterns. Quick check: Test VLM output quality with varied prompts.
- **Human-in-the-loop interaction design**: Ensures user agency in the recommendation process. Quick check: Evaluate interface usability through heuristic evaluation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Image -> Grounding DINO (Object Detection) -> ADE20K Co-occurrence Embeddings -> Statistical Complement Selection -> VLM Semantic Reasoning -> 5 Recommendations -> User Interface

**Critical Path**: Image input flows through object detection to identify anchor objects, then co-occurrence analysis generates complements, followed by VLM reasoning to produce final recommendations delivered via web interface.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 2D pixel-distance co-occurrence versus 3D spatial understanding (accuracy vs. computational complexity); dataset-driven recommendations versus rule-based systems (generalization vs. control); automated suggestions versus fully manual design (efficiency vs. creative freedom).

**Failure Signatures**: Poor object detection leading to incorrect anchor selection; co-occurrence patterns reflecting dataset bias rather than real-world urban design principles; VLM hallucinations producing implausible recommendations; user interface confusion preventing effective interaction.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test object detection accuracy across diverse urban imagery types
2. Validate co-occurrence embedding quality through controlled similarity queries
3. Evaluate recommendation relevance through expert urban designer review

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do AI-generated recommendations influence, align with, or diverge from user intent when participants directly edit proposed urban scenes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 states: "Future iterations will ideally include a participatory evaluation, where users can directly edit proposed scenes. This will allow measurement of how the AI's recommendations influence, align with, or diverge from user intent."
- Why unresolved: The current pilot interface only demonstrates technical feasibility; no user study has been conducted to assess alignment between system suggestions and human design decisions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative and qualitative data from participatory design sessions measuring edit rates, rejection patterns, and user-reported satisfaction across diverse participant groups.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can integrating 3D scene understanding from RGB-D or multi-view video significantly improve the precision of site-specific intervention proposals compared to 2D pixel-distance co-occurrence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 identifies as a limitation: "The current system estimates object co-occurrence based on pixel distance in 2D images, which does not capture true 3D spatial relationships and may reduce precision when proposing site-specific interventions."
- Why unresolved: The co-occurrence embeddings are computed from 2D image data only; depth information and true spatial proximity remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of recommendation quality using RGB-D datasets versus the current 2D approach, measuring spatial plausibility of suggested object placements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do recommendations vary when trained on geographically and culturally diverse urban datasets compared to the current ADE20K subset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes: "the dataset is biased toward certain geographic and cultural contexts, limiting generalization" and lists "expanding datasets for greater diversity" as future work.
- Why unresolved: ADE20K's imagery is skewed toward specific regions; the system's applicability to underrepresented urban contexts remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-regional validation comparing recommendation appropriateness scores across datasets from diverse geographic areas.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can real-world deployment outcomes, integrated via civic reporting platforms, meaningfully refine future recommendation accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 proposes "linking the system with civic reporting platforms... allowing proposed interventions to be shared with local authorities and, over time, letting real-world outcomes inform future recommendations."
- Why unresolved: The feedback loop between deployed interventions and system refinement is conceptual; no implementation or evaluation exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal study tracking whether interventions rated as successful by communities correlate with higher co-occurrence probabilities or improved VLM suggestions over time.

## Limitations
- Reliance on 2D imagery and pixel-distance co-occurrence limits spatial accuracy for site-specific interventions
- Dataset bias toward certain geographic and cultural contexts may skew recommendations
- System performance with occluded or atypical urban scenes remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical feasibility of combining object detection, co-occurrence embeddings, and VLM for generating contextually appropriate urban design suggestions
- **Medium confidence**: Ability to produce functionally relevant and visually coherent recommendations, as demonstrated in pilot interface
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability and performance in handling complex, occluded, or culturally distinct urban environments due to limited testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a cross-cultural validation study using urban imagery from multiple geographic regions to assess the framework's adaptability and identify dataset-induced biases in recommendations
2. Evaluate the system's performance on occluded or atypical urban scenes through controlled testing with synthetic and real-world image perturbations to determine robustness
3. Implement a longitudinal user study with urban planners and designers to measure the consistency, usability, and practical value of the recommendations across varied design scenarios and expertise levels
