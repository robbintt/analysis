# Animating Language Practice: Engagement with Stylized Conversational Agents in Japanese Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06483
- Reference count: 40
- Participants frequently interacted with anime-inspired agents, especially advanced learners who used more expressive forms.

## Executive Summary
Jouzu is a Japanese language learning app that uses stylized anime-inspired conversational agents with expressive text-to-speech to create engaging dialogue scenarios. In a two-week deployment with 52 learners, participants frequently interacted with the agents, with advanced learners showing particular engagement through use of expressive language forms. The anime-inspired style was reported to make practice more enjoyable and encouraged experimentation with different language registers. While beginners found the stylization engaging, they also reported confusion and a need for more structured support. The study demonstrates that culturally grounded, affective stylization can enhance engagement and creative language use, though effectiveness depends on learner proficiency and may require adaptive scaffolding.

## Method Summary
The study deployed a mobile Japanese learning app featuring three anime-inspired conversational agents (Hikari, Kitsune, Samurai) with distinct character language styles. The system used GPT-4/5 for dialogue generation with character-specific prompts and Style-BERT-VITS2 for expressive speech synthesis, fine-tuned on professional voice actor recordings. The deployment included 52 learners over two weeks, measuring engagement through interaction frequency and subjective ratings across six dimensions (Characters, Fun, Immersion, Cultural Relevance, Helpfulness, Amount Learned). Pre/post assessments included multiple-choice quizzes and rubric-scored paragraph writing.

## Key Results
- Advanced learners used more expressive language forms and showed higher engagement with character dialogue
- Beginners found stylization engaging but reported confusion and need for more structured support
- Chinese speakers rated characters and aesthetics significantly higher than non-Chinese speakers (M=4.29 vs 2.97, p=.0026)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stylized, affectively rich character personas may increase learner willingness to engage and experiment with language.
- Mechanism: Anime-inspired visuals, character-specific language, and expressive speech synthesis create an emotionally resonant, low-judgment environment that reduces social anxiety and encourages playful exploration.
- Core assumption: Learners have some cultural affinity or openness to anime-style aesthetics; engagement translates to more practice time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Participants reported that the anime-inspired style made practice more enjoyable and encouraged experimenting with different registers."
  - [section 6.1] "Learners described enjoyment from story interactions, chatting with voiced characters... 'It wasn't just study, it felt like real communication.'"
  - [corpus] VTutor paper confirms animated pedagogical agents boost engagement via adaptive support, though notes high development costs.
- Break condition: Learners without cultural familiarity with anime tropes or who find stylization childish may disengage; beginners reported confusion without scaffolding (Section 8).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Proficiency moderates the effectiveness of stylized agent dialogue—intermediate and advanced learners benefit more than complete beginners.
- Mechanism: Advanced learners can comprehend character language and mirror stylistic features; beginners lack the foundational vocabulary/grammar to parse responses, leading to confusion despite enjoying aesthetics.
- Core assumption: Learners have sufficient baseline proficiency to extract meaning from stylized input.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Beginners found the stylization engaging, they also reported confusion and a need for more structured support."
  - [section 5.3.2] Intermediate and native-level users rated Characters at M=4.00+, while complete beginners rated M=3.12.
  - [corpus] ConversAR notes group conversation tools require scaffolding for learners at different levels; similar proficiency-dependent effects.
- Break condition: Adaptive scaffolding not present; beginners given same stylized density as advanced users.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Native Chinese speakers may experience amplified engagement due to Kanji familiarity and cultural alignment with East Asian media aesthetics.
- Mechanism: Shared orthographic system (Kanji/Hanzi) reduces reading barrier; cultural proximity to anime aesthetics increases affective resonance.
- Core assumption: Kanji transfer effects hold across learners; aesthetic alignment is consistent within cultural groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3.1] Chinese speakers rated Characters M=4.29 vs. non-Chinese M=2.97 (p=.0026); Visuals/Aesthetic M=4.29 vs. 3.17 (p=.0059).
  - [section 8.1] "Cultural alignment (e.g., anime style for East Asian learners) boosts affective engagement, but may limit generalizability."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on Kanji transfer in stylized agent contexts—this remains an assumption requiring further study.
- Break condition: Learners from non-East-Asian cultural backgrounds without anime familiarity; generalizability to other languages/cultures uncertain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Character Language (役割語)**
  - Why needed here: The agents use stylized pronouns (e.g., first-person variants), archaic verb forms, and sentence-final particles that differ from textbook Japanese. Learners must recognize these as persona markers, not errors.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify why a samurai character might use "拙者" over "私"?

- **Concept: Register and Politeness Levels (敬語/普通体)**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes characters use casual/stylized registers; learners need baseline understanding of when polite vs. plain forms are appropriate to avoid pragmatic errors.
  - Quick check question: What contextual cues signal whether to use "-desu/masu" vs. plain form?

- **Concept: Japanese Phonology and Pitch Accent**
  - Why needed here: Style-BERT-VITS2 synthesizes expressive speech; learners must perceive prosodic cues correctly. Assumption: synthesized speech quality is near-native (paper cites prior benchmark, but not validated in this study).
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish synthesized speech from natural speech in the target language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - LLM (GPT-4/5) -> Character prompts with stylization rules -> Real-time dialogue generation
  - Human-LLM QA scripts -> Voice actor recordings -> Style-BERT-VITS2 fine-tuning -> Expressive speech synthesis
  - In-text inspector -> Word definitions/readings -> Flashcard generation -> Learning reinforcement

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define character personas with explicit linguistic rules (pronouns, particles, register).
  2. Generate QA scripts via human-LLM dialogue; have voice actors record in character.
  3. Fine-tune Style-BERT-VITS2 on recordings for each character.
  4. Deploy real-time LLM prompting with persona constraints for open chat.
  5. Integrate in-text inspector for on-demand scaffolding.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Stylization vs. Accessibility**: High stylization increases engagement for intermediate+ learners but risks beginner confusion—consider toggleable stylization or adaptive scaffolding.
  - **Open-ended chat vs. Pedagogical control**: LLM enables flexible dialogue but may drift from learning objectives; QA scripts provide structure but limit creativity.
  - **Voice quality vs. Development cost**: Professional voice actor recordings improve synthesis quality but require significant upfront investment.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Beginners consistently rate Characters/Fun lower than advanced users (Section 5.3.2)—indicates need for proficiency-gated content.
  - Users report "didn't know how to use flashcards," "confusing navigation" (Section 6.1)—onboarding UI needs improvement.
  - Low "Amount Learned" ratings (M=2.48) despite high engagement—suggests perceived learning doesn't match affective experience.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **A/B test adaptive scaffolding**: Randomize beginners to receive either full stylization or simplified register + vocabulary hints; measure comprehension and retention.
  2. **Longitudinal engagement tracking**: Monitor usage patterns over 4-8 weeks to assess whether initial engagement sustains or drops; correlate with proficiency gains.
  3. **Cross-cultural replication**: Deploy with non-anime-styled characters (e.g., neutral or Western cartoon aesthetics) to test whether engagement effects are culture-specific or generalizable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can adaptive scaffolding mechanisms (e.g., toggleable or dynamically calibrated stylization) improve beginner comprehension and engagement without sacrificing the affective richness that motivates advanced learners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should add adaptive scaffolding for beginners" (Conclusion); "systems may benefit from adaptive scaffolding mechanisms that calibrate agent responses based on learner proficiency" (Section 8.1)
- Why unresolved: The current study tested a fixed stylization level; beginners reported confusion and a need for structured support, but no adaptive mechanism was implemented or evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing fixed vs. adaptive stylization conditions, measuring comprehension accuracy, engagement duration, and subjective frustration for beginners specifically.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does sustained engagement with stylized conversational agents lead to measurable improvements in longer-term spoken fluency beyond the expressive writing gains observed in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should...examine how sustained engagement with stylized agents impacts longer-term spoken fluency" (Conclusion)
- Why unresolved: The two-week deployment captured short-term expressive writing gains and engagement, but did not assess oral production or retention over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study (e.g., 3–6 months) with pre/post oral proficiency assessments (e.g., OPIc-style interviews) comparing Jouzu users to a control group using neutral chatbots.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can culturally grounded stylization approaches transfer effectively to other language learning contexts, or does their effectiveness depend on learners' pre-existing cultural familiarity with the aesthetic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "different cultural stylizations may be needed to engage other learner communities" (Limitations); "opportunities for generalization beyond Japanese contexts" (Abstract)
- Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on anime-inspired stylization for Japanese; it is unclear whether similar effects would hold for learners without cultural affinity for the target language's media tropes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication studies using different cultural stylizations (e.g., telenovela-inspired agents for Spanish learning) with diverse learner populations, measuring engagement and learning outcomes.

## Limitations
- Sample composition primarily Chinese heritage learners with anime familiarity limits generalizability
- Short two-week deployment period prevents assessment of long-term learning outcomes
- Lack of control group limits causal claims about effectiveness relative to traditional methods

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The correlation between proficiency level and effectiveness of stylized dialogue (Mechanism 2) is well-supported by the rating data across user groups.
- **Medium Confidence**: The engagement benefits of anime-inspired aesthetics for intermediate/advanced learners (Mechanism 1) are supported but limited to specific cultural contexts.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that Chinese speakers benefit from Kanji transfer (Mechanism 3) lacks direct corpus validation and may reflect cultural alignment rather than orthographic advantages.

## Next Checks

1. **A/B test adaptive scaffolding**: Randomize beginners to receive either full stylization or simplified register + vocabulary hints; measure comprehension and retention.
2. **Longitudinal engagement tracking**: Monitor usage patterns over 4-8 weeks to assess whether initial engagement sustains or drops; correlate with proficiency gains.
3. **Cross-cultural replication**: Deploy with non-anime-styled characters (e.g., neutral or Western cartoon aesthetics) to test whether engagement effects are culture-specific or generalizable.
