# CoBA: Integrated Deep Learning Model for Reliable Low-Altitude UAV Classification in mmWave Radio Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20605
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: 99.89% classification accuracy for low-altitude UAVs in mmWave environments using CoBA deep learning model

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs in mmWave environments, where traditional machine learning models struggle due to complex signal propagation. To overcome this, the authors propose CoBA, a deep learning model integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention mechanisms to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in 5G mmWave radio measurements. Using a real-world dataset collected via TalTech's 5G mmWave network, CoBA achieves 99.89% accuracy in classifying UAVs in authorized versus restricted airspace—significantly outperforming conventional ML models (around 90–91%) and fingerprinting benchmarks (99.78%). Notably, PCI and SSB Idx were identified as the most decisive features, with CoBA maintaining 99.82% accuracy using only these two. The model also demonstrated favorable scalability with feature complexity, showing only a modest computational increase compared to baseline models. This work establishes CoBA as a reliable and efficient solution for secure, low-altitude UAV airspace monitoring in dense mmWave environments.

## Method Summary
The CoBA model integrates CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention mechanisms to process 5G mmWave radio measurements for UAV classification. The approach captures both spatial patterns through CNN layers and temporal dependencies via BiLSTM, while Attention mechanisms help focus on the most relevant signal features. The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from TalTech's 5G mmWave network, using features such as PCI, SSB Idx, RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR. The classification task distinguishes between authorized and restricted airspace UAVs. The model architecture was designed to handle the unique challenges of mmWave signal propagation, including multipath effects and environmental interference.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.89% accuracy in classifying UAVs in authorized versus restricted airspace
- Outperformed conventional ML models (90–91% accuracy) and fingerprinting benchmarks (99.78% accuracy)
- Identified PCI and SSB Idx as the most decisive features, maintaining 99.82% accuracy with only these two features
- Demonstrated favorable scalability with feature complexity, showing modest computational increase compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoBA works by integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention mechanisms to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in 5G mmWave radio measurements. The CNN layers extract spatial features from the signal measurements, while BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies and long-range patterns. The Attention mechanism dynamically weights the importance of different features, allowing the model to focus on the most discriminative information for classification. This multi-modal approach addresses the complex signal propagation characteristics of mmWave environments, where traditional single-method approaches struggle with multipath effects and environmental interference.

## Foundational Learning
- 5G mmWave signal propagation: Understanding how mmWave signals behave in real-world environments is crucial for interpreting radio measurements and designing effective classification models
- Deep learning architectures: Knowledge of CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention mechanisms is essential for understanding how CoBA processes and classifies radio measurements
- Feature engineering: Understanding the importance of different radio features (PCI, SSB Idx, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) and how they contribute to classification accuracy
- UAV airspace monitoring: Understanding the regulatory and security context of UAV classification in authorized versus restricted airspace

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: CNN -> BiLSTM -> Attention -> Classification
Critical Path: Radio measurements → CNN feature extraction → BiLSTM temporal processing → Attention feature weighting → Classification output
Design Tradeoffs: Integration of multiple deep learning mechanisms increases model complexity but improves accuracy and robustness compared to single-method approaches
Failure Signatures: Performance degradation may occur in highly dynamic environments with significant signal interference or when trained on limited datasets
First Experiments:
1. Evaluate CoBA on independent datasets from multiple mmWave networks and UAV models
2. Conduct adversarial robustness testing using signal spoofing and interference scenarios
3. Benchmark inference latency and resource consumption on embedded hardware platforms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reported accuracy is based on a single dataset from TalTech's 5G mmWave network, limiting generalizability to other operational environments
- Analysis relies on feature importance methods that don't account for feature interactions or sampling bias
- Computational cost analysis is limited to training time, without evaluating real-time inference performance on embedded systems
- Study does not address adversarial robustness or performance under intentional signal interference

## Confidence
- Accuracy claims: High for specific dataset and conditions tested, Medium for generalizability
- Scalability claims: Low due to limited testing across diverse hardware and operational scenarios
- Robustness claims: Medium due to lack of adversarial testing

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CoBA on independent datasets from multiple mmWave networks and UAV models
2. Conduct adversarial robustness testing using signal spoofing and interference scenarios
3. Benchmark inference latency and resource consumption on embedded hardware platforms representative of field deployments
