# Acquiring Common Chinese Emotional Events Using Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04989
- Reference count: 40
- Acquired 102,218 high-quality common Chinese emotional events with sentiment polarity labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of acquiring common emotional events in Chinese language, which are context-independent events that provoke particular emotions. The authors propose a novel method using large language models (LLMs) to generate emotional events based on linguistic indicators. They collect 726 Chinese emotional event indicators and use the SparkDesk LLM to generate events through carefully designed prompts. A binary classifier filters out invalid results, and the final dataset includes sentiment polarity labels. The method achieves 0.96 precision in intrinsic evaluation and demonstrates strong potential for enhancing emotion cause extraction (ECE) models, significantly improving their performance on Chinese emotion cause corpora.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a method for acquiring common Chinese emotional events using LLMs. First, they collect 726 Chinese emotional event indicators - linguistic cues that mark the presence of emotional events. Using the SparkDesk Chinese LLM, they generate emotional events by designing natural language prompts based on these indicators. To ensure quality, they train a binary classifier to filter out invalid results from the LLM output. The final dataset of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events is classified as positive or negative using different techniques. The method is validated through intrinsic evaluation and demonstrated to enhance eight representative ECE models when applied to a Chinese emotion cause corpus.

## Key Results
- Acquired 102,218 high-quality common Chinese emotional events with sentiment polarity labels
- Achieved 0.96 precision in intrinsic evaluation for acquiring emotional events
- Enhanced eight representative ECE models, significantly improving their performance on Chinese emotion cause extraction tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of large language models to generate emotional events based on linguistic indicators. The SparkDesk LLM can understand the relationship between specific linguistic cues and the emotional events they signal, allowing it to generate contextually appropriate but context-independent emotional events. The binary classifier serves as a quality control mechanism, filtering out invalid or low-quality generations. By combining LLM generation with classifier-based filtering, the method achieves high precision while maintaining scalability to generate a large number of emotional events.

## Foundational Learning
- **Emotional Event Indicators**: Linguistic cues that mark the presence of emotional events - needed to guide LLM generation with specific triggers; quick check: verify indicator list covers diverse emotional contexts
- **Context-independent Events**: Events that provoke emotions regardless of surrounding context - needed to ensure generalizability of acquired knowledge; quick check: test events across multiple discourse contexts
- **SparkDesk LLM**: Off-the-shelf Chinese language model - needed for generating emotionally relevant content in Chinese; quick check: evaluate generation quality across different prompt styles
- **Binary Classifier for Quality Control**: Model that filters invalid LLM outputs - needed to maintain high precision in final dataset; quick check: measure classifier precision and recall on validation set
- **Sentiment Polarity Classification**: Labeling events as positive or negative - needed for downstream applications in emotion analysis; quick check: validate classification accuracy against human annotations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Emotional Event Indicators -> LLM (SparkDesk) -> Binary Classifier -> Sentiment Polarity Classifier -> Final Dataset

Critical Path:
The critical path involves generating emotional events using the LLM, followed by binary classifier filtering, then sentiment polarity classification. This sequence ensures that only high-quality, valid emotional events with appropriate sentiment labels are included in the final dataset.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades computational cost (running LLM and classifier) for high-quality, scalable acquisition of emotional events. Using an off-the-shelf LLM enables rapid development but may introduce model-specific biases. The binary classifier adds an additional processing step but significantly improves precision by filtering invalid generations.

Failure Signatures:
- Low precision in intrinsic evaluation suggests issues with binary classifier effectiveness
- Poor performance in enhancing ECE models indicates potential mismatch between acquired events and target application
- Limited diversity in generated events may result from overly restrictive indicators or LLM biases
- Context-dependence in acquired events suggests the LLM is generating contextually bound rather than context-independent events

First Experiments:
1. Run LLM with a subset of 50 emotional event indicators to generate sample outputs
2. Test binary classifier on a validation set of 500 LLM-generated events to measure precision
3. Apply sentiment polarity classifier to 100 validated events to check classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quality validation relies primarily on binary classifier rather than comprehensive human annotation
- Context-independence claim is asserted but not systematically validated across different contexts
- Results are limited to Chinese language, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Lacks analysis of which specific emotional events contribute most to ECE model improvements
- Does not address potential biases in LLM-generated emotional events

## Confidence
- High confidence: The methodology for generating emotional events using LLM prompts based on linguistic indicators is clearly described and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The intrinsic evaluation results showing 0.96 precision, as this relies on classifier-based filtering rather than comprehensive human validation
- Low confidence: The claim about context-independence of acquired emotional events, as this is asserted but not empirically demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human annotation study on a random sample of 500 generated emotional events to independently verify the claimed 0.96 precision rate
2. Design context variation experiments where acquired emotional events are tested across multiple discourse contexts to empirically validate the context-independence claim
3. Perform ablation studies to identify which emotional event indicators and LLM prompting strategies contribute most significantly to high-quality event generation
