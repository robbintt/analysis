# ReLaX: Reasoning with Latent Exploration for Large Reasoning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07558
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07558
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ReLaX achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7B-scale multimodal reasoning, outperforming entropy-based RLVR methods on mathematical reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses performance saturation in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large reasoning models (LRMs) caused by entropy collapse during training. The authors introduce a novel approach using Koopman operator theory to analyze latent dynamics of hidden states, leading to a new metric called Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD) that quantifies policy heterogeneity. ReLaX incorporates DSD-based regularization into the GRPO objective to maintain exploration and balance exploitation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods across 7 multimodal and 6 text-only reasoning benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes ReLaX, a training paradigm that analyzes latent dynamics through Koopman operator theory to measure policy heterogeneity using Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD). This metric captures the diversity of reasoning trajectories in hidden state space, preventing entropy collapse that typically occurs in RLVR training. ReLaX integrates DSD regularization into the GRPO objective function, encouraging exploration while maintaining performance. The approach is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to token-level entropy regularization methods.

## Key Results
- Sets new records for 7B-scale multimodal reasoning models on 7 benchmarks
- Achieves significant gains on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to entropy-based methods
- Demonstrates more robust and structured reasoning behaviors in qualitative analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by analyzing the latent dynamics of reasoning processes through Koopman operator theory, which provides a framework for understanding complex nonlinear dynamics in high-dimensional spaces. By measuring Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD) of hidden states, ReLaX captures the heterogeneity of reasoning trajectories that traditional token-level entropy measures miss. This latent-space regularization maintains exploration during training, preventing the model from prematurely converging to suboptimal reasoning patterns while still benefiting from verifiable reward signals.

## Foundational Learning

**Koopman Operator Theory**: Mathematical framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems by transforming them into linear systems in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Needed to understand complex latent dynamics in neural networks; quick check: verify understanding of how Koopman modes capture system behavior.

**Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**: Training paradigm where models learn through trial-and-error with reward signals based on correctness verification. Essential context for reasoning model training; quick check: distinguish between policy gradient methods used in RLVR.

**Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD)**: Novel metric measuring heterogeneity of latent dynamics by analyzing spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Core innovation that enables exploration maintenance; quick check: understand how spectral properties relate to policy diversity.

**GRPO (Generalized Reward Policy Optimization)**: Advanced policy optimization algorithm that extends traditional REINFORCE by incorporating baseline functions and advantage estimation. Training framework used with ReLaX; quick check: compare GRPO to other policy gradient methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Reasoning Model (hidden states) -> Koopman Analysis -> DSD Metric -> GRPO Objective -> Updated Policy

**Critical Path**: The forward reasoning process generates hidden states, which are analyzed through Koopman decomposition to compute DSD, feeding back into the GRPO update rule to adjust policy parameters.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Balances exploration (maintaining policy diversity through DSD) against exploitation (maximizing verifiable rewards), versus traditional entropy regularization that operates at token level rather than latent space.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance plateaus despite continued training, reduced diversity in reasoning trajectories, or degradation in verifiable reward signals while DSD remains high.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify DSD computation on pre-trained model hidden states across different reasoning tasks
2. Compare GRPO with and without DSD regularization on a simple mathematical benchmark
3. Analyze latent space trajectories with t-SNE visualization to confirm exploration maintenance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on theoretical constructs from Koopman operator theory applied to neural network latent spaces
- Assumes DSD effectively measures policy heterogeneity without theoretical guarantees
- Performance improvements demonstrated empirically but fundamental assumptions about DSD remain primarily correlation-based

## Confidence
- High: Technical soundness of Koopman operator theory application
- Medium: Core claims about DSD preventing entropy collapse and improving performance
- Low: Generalization to reasoning tasks beyond mathematical domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the DSD regularization component to quantify its specific contribution
2. Test ReLaX on reasoning tasks outside the mathematical domain to verify generalizability
3. Perform longitudinal studies tracking policy dynamics throughout training to confirm DSD prevents premature convergence
