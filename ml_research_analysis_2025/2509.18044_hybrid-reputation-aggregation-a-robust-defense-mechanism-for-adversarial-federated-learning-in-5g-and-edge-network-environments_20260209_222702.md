# Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18044
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044
- Reference count: 19
- Outperforms state-of-the-art aggregators (Krum, Trimmed Mean, Bulyan) achieving 98.66% and 96.60% accuracy on 5G and NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses security vulnerabilities in federated learning within 5G and edge networks, where adversarial clients can perform label flipping, backdoor injection, or Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. The authors propose Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), which combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking to dynamically identify and downweight malicious updates without prior knowledge of attack type. HRA detects outlier model updates in each round while maintaining trust scores for clients based on historical behavior. Evaluated on a proprietary 5G dataset (3M+ records) and the NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark, HRA achieved 98.66% and 96.60% accuracy respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators like Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan.

## Method Summary
HRA operates in federated learning rounds where clients train local models and send updates to a central server. The server computes a geometric median of all received updates as a robust reference point, then calculates L2 distances from this reference for each client. These distances are converted to anomaly weights, which are combined multiplicatively with historical reputation scores maintained through momentum updates. The final aggregation weights each client's update by both its current anomaly score and cumulative reputation, effectively filtering out malicious contributions while preserving benign updates. The system was evaluated using logistic regression on binary classification tasks with non-IID data partitioning across 10 clients, comparing performance against baselines under various attack scenarios.

## Key Results
- HRA achieved 98.66% accuracy on proprietary 5G dataset versus 79.77% for Krum, 77.83% for Trimmed Mean, and 76.77% for Bulyan
- On NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark, HRA reached 96.60% accuracy compared to 89.88% for Krum, 86.64% for Trimmed Mean, and 85.46% for Bulyan
- Ablation studies showed the full hybrid system achieved 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants dropped to 84.77% and 78.52% respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Filtering updates based on their geometric distance from a central reference point suppresses gross outliers in the current round. The server calculates the Geometric Median ($w_{ref}$) of all client updates, then computes an anomaly score $\Delta_j$ (L2 distance) for each client $j$ relative to $w_{ref}$. A weighting function $\phi(\Delta_j)$ assigns low scores to distant updates. This assumes honest updates cluster densely in the parameter space while malicious updates are statistical outliers.

### Mechanism 2
Tracking client behavior over time using momentum allows the system to penalize persistent attackers who may evade single-round detection. A reputation score $r_j$ is maintained for each client, updated via momentum: $r_j^{(t+1)} = \rho r_j^{(t)} + (1-\rho)\phi(\Delta_j)$. Clients with consistently high anomaly scores suffer cumulative reputation decay. This assumes adversarial behavior is repetitive enough to lower long-term average reputation, distinguishing it from one-off benign deviations.

### Mechanism 3
Combining instantaneous anomaly detection with historical reputation creates a synergistic defense superior to either component alone. The final aggregation weight is the product of the instantaneous anomaly weight and the historical reputation score. This assumes neither spatial outlier detection nor temporal tracking is sufficient independently for all attack vectors, and that a multiplicative combination enforces a stricter constraint.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Federated Learning (FL) & Non-IID Data** - FL assumes local training on non-identically distributed data across edge devices. Understanding non-IID is crucial because HRA must handle cases where legitimate clients have unique data distributions that shouldn't be flagged as adversarial. Quick check: How does HRA handle a legitimate client whose data distribution is unique compared to the majority?

- **Concept: Robust Aggregation (Byzantine Tolerance)** - Federated learning must tolerate malicious clients who can send arbitrary updates. HRA is compared against baselines like Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan, which use different strategies to filter outliers. Quick check: Why do the authors argue that "memoryless" aggregators (like Krum) fail against adaptive adversaries?

- **Concept: Geometric Median vs. Arithmetic Mean** - The core of HRA's anomaly detection relies on the Geometric Median, which minimizes L2 distance and is robust to outliers, unlike the standard Mean. Quick check: Why is the Geometric Median computationally harder to calculate than a simple average, and why is it preferred for finding the "reference update"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Local Trainer -> Attack Simulator -> Update Sender -> Geometric Median Calculator -> Anomaly Scorer -> Reputation Manager -> Hybrid Aggregator

- **Critical path:** Receive updates $\{w_j\}$ from clients → Compute $w_{ref}$ (Geometric Median) → Calculate distances $\Delta_j$ and update reputation $r_j$ → Compute final weights $r_j \times \phi(\Delta_j)$ and aggregate

- **Design tradeoffs:** Setting $T_{high}$ too low filters attacks but risks dropping benign non-IID updates, slowing convergence or degrading accuracy. High momentum ($\rho$) ensures stable reputations but reacts slowly to sudden changes in client behavior.

- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy collapse (<60%) likely indicates $T_{high}$ is too loose or $T_{low}$ is too high. Stalled reputation updates suggest $\rho$ is too high or learning rate is too low, preventing differentiation between malicious and benign clients.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Replication: Run HRA vs. Krum/Median on 5G dataset with 0% adversaries to verify HRA doesn't degrade baseline accuracy. 2) Synergy Ablation: Disable reputation (set $\rho=0$) and run "Anomaly-only" variant to replicate the drop to ~84.77% accuracy under attack. 3) Threshold Sweeps: Vary $T_{high}$ (e.g., 7.0 vs 20.0) under Sybil attack to observe sensitivity and determine safe operating zone.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Strategic "on-off" attacks:** How does HRA perform against adversaries who cycle between benign behavior to build trust and malicious attacks? Current evaluations assume persistent maliciousness, but the momentum-based reputation mechanism may be slow to penalize clients who have accumulated high trust scores.

- **Non-stationary data distributions:** Can HRA maintain robustness under concept drift typical in live edge environments? Experiments used static datasets, but real-world data distribution shifts might trigger false positives in the geometric anomaly detection component.

- **Personalized federated learning:** How can HRA's trust scores be utilized to enhance personalized federated learning? The paper focuses on global model aggregation, but the application of trust metrics to client-specific model customization is unexplored.

## Limitations

- **Proprietary data:** The primary 5G dataset is not publicly accessible, limiting reproducibility of the main evaluation results.
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Critical thresholds (T_low=3.0, T_high=7.0) and momentum parameter ρ were not thoroughly analyzed across attack types.
- **Scalability concerns:** The geometric median computation complexity O(n²) per round was not addressed for large client populations.

## Confidence

- **Performance claims:** High confidence in accuracy improvements over baselines based on presented ablation studies and cross-dataset validation.
- **Theoretical robustness:** Medium confidence in hybrid mechanism effectiveness due to well-supported claims about spatial-temporal complementarity.
- **Generalizability:** Low confidence in real-world deployment without validation on additional datasets and larger client populations.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary T_low, T_high, and ρ across attack types to identify robust operating regions.
2. **Scalability benchmarking:** Evaluate geometric median computation time and memory requirements for 100+ clients with varying update dimensions.
3. **Adversarial resilience testing:** Implement adaptive attacks where adversaries learn to mimic benign update patterns and measure HRA's sustained effectiveness.
