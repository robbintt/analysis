# Toward Accessible Dermatology: Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Learning Models on Mobile-Acquired Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04800
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04800
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Swin Transformer achieves 81% accuracy on mobile-acquired skin lesion classification

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of diagnosing skin diseases using deep learning models trained on mobile-captured images. The authors curate a large dataset of over 27,000 images spanning more than 50 skin disease categories, collected from diverse online sources. They evaluate multiple convolutional neural network and Transformer-based architectures, finding that the Swin Transformer emerges as the top performer with 81% accuracy. The study incorporates Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability, demonstrating that the model attends to clinically relevant lesion regions. The results show that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer, effectively capture global contextual features for mobile-acquired skin lesion classification, offering a promising approach for accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening in resource-limited environments.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates transfer learning with frozen ImageNet-pretrained backbones for multi-class skin lesion classification from mobile-acquired images. Models include CNNs (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV2) and Transformers (ViT, Swin-Tiny, Swin-Base). Training uses categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4), and batch size 32, with input sizes varying by architecture. The classification head consists of GlobalAvgPool → FC (128-256) → ReLU → Dropout (0.3-0.4) → Softmax. Grad-CAM is applied for interpretability. The dataset contains 27,000+ images across 51 classes with 70/15/15 train/val/test splits.

## Key Results
- Swin Transformer achieves highest accuracy of 81% among evaluated models
- Grad-CAM visualizations confirm model attention aligns with clinically relevant lesion regions
- Transfer learning with frozen backbones outperforms fine-tuning approaches
- CNNs show significant performance gap compared to Transformer architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Transformer-based architectures (Swin) outperform CNNs for mobile-acquired skin lesion classification by capturing global contextual features.
- **Mechanism:** Self-attention mechanisms model relationships across image patches, enabling long-range dependency capture. Unlike CNNs with local receptive fields, transformers can associate distant visual patterns—critical for diffuse lesions like psoriasis or pox.
- **Core assumption:** Skin lesions require holistic pattern recognition, not just local texture/edge detection.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer, achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features."
  - [section III.B] "CNNs...reliance on local receptive fields often limits their capacity to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual patterns."
  - [corpus] MedLiteNet paper corroborates: "Convolutional neural networks, while effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to model long-range dependencies."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Transfer learning with frozen ImageNet-pretrained backbones provides stable, generalizable features for medical imaging without requiring large domain-specific datasets.
- **Mechanism:** Pretrained weights encode generic visual primitives (edges, textures, shapes) that transfer across domains. Freezing the backbone prevents disruption of these features while a lightweight classifier head adapts to the target task.
- **Core assumption:** Generic natural image features are reusable for medical skin lesion patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.C] "These weights, obtained from training on the large-scale ImageNet dataset...provide generic visual feature representations...particularly valuable for medical imaging tasks where data per class is limited."
  - [section V.C] "Transfer learning with frozen backbones and a lightweight classifier head has proven more effective than deeper fine-tuning."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Grad-CAM visualization provides clinically meaningful interpretability by highlighting lesion regions influencing predictions.
- **Mechanism:** Gradient backpropagation to final convolutional layers generates heatmaps showing spatial attention. If heatmaps align with visible lesions rather than background artifacts, model decisions are clinically plausible.
- **Core assumption:** Models attending to lesion regions (vs. spurious correlations) indicates trustworthy predictions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlight clinically relevant regions of skin lesions."
  - [section IV.D] "The highlighted regions closely align with the visible lesions, indicating that the model is attending to clinically relevant areas rather than unrelated background features."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformer architecture
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's best model uses Swin; understanding patch embeddings, self-attention, and shifted windows explains why it outperforms CNNs.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why shifted windows in Swin reduce computational cost compared to full self-attention while maintaining cross-patch connectivity?

- **Concept:** Transfer learning with frozen vs. fine-tuned backbones
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly shows fine-tuning fails; understanding feature reuse vs. overfitting is critical for implementation.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have 500 images per class instead of 100, would you still freeze the backbone? What signals would inform your decision?

- **Concept:** Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for imbalanced multiclass evaluation
  - **Why needed here:** Dataset is imbalanced; accuracy alone is misleading. MCC accounts for all confusion matrix entries.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would MCC be preferred over weighted F1-score when class imbalance is severe and false positives/negatives have asymmetric costs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Image (224×224 / 384×384) → Pretrained Backbone (ImageNet weights, FROZEN) → Classification Head (GlobalAvgPool → FC 128-256 + ReLU + Dropout → Softmax) → Grad-CAM (post-hoc visualization)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Dataset curation** → Filter low-quality images, ensure >100 samples per class minimum
  2. **Backbone selection** → Start with Swin-Base for best reported performance (80.8% accuracy)
  3. **Frozen training** → Train head only for 15-20 epochs with early stopping
  4. **DO NOT unfreeze** → Fine-tuning causes overfitting (validated in Section V.C)
  5. **Grad-CAM sanity check** → Verify attention on lesions, not artifacts

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  | Decision | Option A | Option B | Paper's Finding |
  |----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
  | Architecture | CNN (ResNet-50) | Transformer (Swin) | Swin +16% accuracy over best CNN |
  | Model size | Swin-Tiny | Swin-Base | Base better (80.8% vs 77.5%) despite overfit risk |
  | Training strategy | Frozen backbone | Fine-tuned backbone | Frozen essential; fine-tuning causes divergence |
  | Data augmentation | Conventional/GAN | None | Neither improved results with limited data |

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Rapid overfitting:** Training accuracy →95% in <10 epochs while validation plateaus → stop immediately
  - **Class confusion matrix diagonal dominance failure:** Basal cell carcinoma ↔ squamous cell carcinoma; eczema ↔ psoriasis—these are expected confusions
  - **Rare class collapse:** Classes with <150 samples (e.g., Kaposi sarcoma, lupus) show high misclassification rates
  - **GAN augmentation failure:** Generated images lack quality when source samples are scarce

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Establish CNN baseline** with ResNet-50 (frozen backbone, 224×224 input). Expect ~64% accuracy. If significantly lower, check data preprocessing/normalization.
  2. **Compare Swin-Tiny vs. Swin-Base** to validate model capacity hypothesis. Monitor train/val gap—if Base overfits more than Tiny despite better validation, consider regularization increase.
  3. **Grad-CAM diagnostic run** on misclassified samples. If heatmaps highlight non-lesion regions, investigate dataset artifacts (backgrounds, watermarks, inconsistent sources).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does incorporating multimodal clinical data (e.g., patient history, dermoscopic patterns) significantly improve classification accuracy over image-only models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states future work will focus on "incorporating multimodal clinical data" to address current limitations.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study relied exclusively on image-based features, whereas real-world diagnosis often utilizes non-visual patient metadata.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study evaluating model performance on the current dataset versus a dataset enriched with clinical metadata.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can advanced domain adaptation techniques effectively bridge the performance gap between heterogeneous online images and standardized clinical settings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion suggests "exploring advanced domain adaptation techniques to bridge variations across acquisition modalities."
- **Why unresolved:** Section V (Limitation) notes that variability in image quality and resolution from online sources may hinder generalizability in standardized clinical deployments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks demonstrating stable performance when models trained on online data are applied to controlled clinical acquisition datasets.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can high-quality synthetic data generation enable effective fine-tuning of deep backbone layers without causing overfitting in low-sample disease categories?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section V.C states that GAN-based augmentation failed due to poor image quality and fine-tuning caused overfitting, suggesting a need for better data generation strategies.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors found that limited sample sizes prevented the successful use of generative augmentation or backbone fine-tuning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A training pipeline using improved synthetic augmentation that successfully increases validation accuracy for underrepresented classes.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability beyond the curated dataset; model performance on diverse real-world mobile images remains untested
- Potential dataset artifacts (rulers, watermarks, inconsistent lighting) may drive predictions rather than lesion features
- Class imbalance (some categories <100 samples) may inflate accuracy metrics while hiding poor rare-class performance
- No external validation on clinically acquired images or comparison with dermatologist performance

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Swin Transformer architecture superiority for global feature capture; frozen backbone transfer learning effectiveness; Grad-CAM highlighting clinically relevant regions
- **Medium Confidence**: Accuracy metrics on curated test set; generalizability to other mobile-acquired skin datasets; model robustness to image quality variations
- **Low Confidence**: Real-world clinical utility; performance on images with multiple concurrent conditions; ability to handle out-of-distribution cases

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on independent mobile-acquired skin lesion datasets not used in training (e.g., ISIC 2019 challenge data)
2. Conduct ablation study comparing frozen vs. fine-tuned backbones across different dataset sizes to quantify transfer learning benefits
3. Perform Grad-CAM analysis on systematically corrupted images (adding rulers, text, inconsistent lighting) to identify reliance on spurious correlations
