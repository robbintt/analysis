# Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process Surrogate with Active Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.16434
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16434
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Proposes deepICMGP, a multi-output GP surrogate extending ICM to hierarchical DGP structure, demonstrating competitive performance on synthetic benchmarks and real-world thermal stress analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces deepICMGP, a novel multi-output Gaussian process surrogate model designed for computer simulation experiments. By extending the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) into a hierarchical deep Gaussian process framework, deepICMGP captures complex nonlinear and structured dependencies across multiple outputs. The model achieves this through two ICM layers—one for latent warping and one for output mapping—while analytically integrating out coregionalization matrices for computational efficiency. The authors validate deepICMGP on synthetic benchmarks and apply it to a real-world thermal stress analysis case study, demonstrating its ability to improve prediction accuracy and enable efficient sequential design via a tailored active learning strategy.

## Method Summary
The deepICMGP model extends ICM by introducing hierarchical coregionalization structures across two layers of a deep Gaussian process. The first layer applies an ICM-based latent warping (Bw, θw) to transform inputs into a shared latent space, while the second layer maps these latents to outputs via another ICM (By, θy). Coregionalization matrices Bw and By are analytically marginalized under Jeffreys priors, reducing inference to estimating only lengthscale hyperparameters. MCMC inference combines Metropolis-Hastings updates for lengthscales with elliptical slice sampling for latent variables. For active learning, the model uses a determinant-based ALC criterion that integrates over a reference set in latent space, selecting points that maximize joint predictive uncertainty reduction across all outputs.

## Key Results
- deepICMGP achieves competitive RMSE and multivariate log scores compared to state-of-the-art multi-output GP methods on synthetic benchmarks.
- The hierarchical ICM structure enables effective modeling of nonlinear output dependencies, outperforming independent GPs.
- Active learning with deepICMGP concentrates samples in regions of high joint uncertainty, improving prediction efficiency in the jet engine turbine blade thermal stress case study.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Coregionalization for Nonlinear Output Dependencies
Introducing ICM structures at each DGP layer enables modeling of nonlinear, structured dependencies across outputs that traditional linear coregionalization cannot capture. The model composes two ICM layers: (1) a latent warping layer Wn = f₁(Xn) transforms inputs through shared latent representations governed by coregionalization matrix Bw; (2) the output layer Yn = f₂(Wn) maps warped latents to final outputs via By. The posterior mean in deepICMGP indirectly depends on Bw through the sampled latent values w(t)n+1, unlike standard ICM where coregionalization only affects covariances. Core assumption: Output dependencies benefit from nonlinear transformation rather than purely linear combinations of shared latent functions. Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section 3, p.7-8], [corpus]. Break condition: If outputs are linearly related with stationary covariance, standard ICM should suffice; deepICMGP's added complexity may overfit small training sets.

### Mechanism 2: Parameter Efficiency via Marginalized Coregionalization Matrices
Analytically integrating out coregionalization matrices under Jeffreys priors reduces inference complexity while preserving dependency modeling. By placing non-informative priors π(B) ∝ |B|^{-(dim+1)/2} and integrating, the marginal likelihood depends only on lengthscale parameters θw and θy (one per layer rather than D separate lengthscales). The GLS estimators ˆBw = W⊤K⁻¹W/n and ˆBy = Y⊤K⁻¹Y/n capture cross-output covariance without explicit MCMC sampling of high-dimensional positive semi-definite matrices. Core assumption: The Jeffreys-type prior adequately represents prior uncertainty; the marginalization does not lose critical information about output correlations. Evidence anchors: [Section 3.2, p.10-11], [Section 5.1.5, p.22], [corpus]. Break condition: If the true cross-output covariance structure is complex (e.g., low-rank but not well-captured by GLS estimators), the marginalized approach may underfit compared to full LMC estimation.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Output Active Learning via D-Optimal Uncertainty Reduction
Adapting the ALC criterion using the determinant of predictive covariance enables unified point selection that benefits all correlated outputs simultaneously. The criterion ALC(x) ≈ ∑ K_y(w|W_n∪w_n+1)^Q integrates over a reference set in latent space. Because ˆBy is constant within the integral, selection depends only on kernel-based variance reduction, efficiently computed via partitioned inverse formulas. This concentrates samples in regions where the latent warping creates high joint uncertainty. Core assumption: The latent space reference set (via posterior predictive mapping) adequately covers uncertainty regions; determinant reduction correlates with prediction improvement. Evidence anchors: [Section 4, p.15-17], [Section 5.2, p.23, Figure 8], [corpus]. Break condition: If outputs have vastly different uncertainty scales or priorities, the determinant criterion may favor outputs with naturally larger variance; weighted or Pareto-style selection may be needed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kronecker Product Covariance Structure**
  - Why needed here: The ICM's separable kernel B ⊗ K(X) enables efficient multi-output modeling; understanding this decomposition is essential for grasping how deepICMGP extends ICM hierarchically.
  - Quick check question: Given outputs with covariance B ∈ ℝ^(Q×Q) and inputs with kernel K ∈ ℝ^(n×n), what is the dimension of the joint covariance, and why does the Kronecker structure allow efficient inversion?

- **Concept: Elliptical Slice Sampling (ESS)**
  - Why needed here: ESS is the primary MCMC workhorse for sampling latent variables Wn; understanding its reliance on prior samples and the "shrinking bracket" procedure is necessary for debugging convergence.
  - Quick check question: Why does ESS require drawing Wprior from the marginal prior rather than the full posterior, and what happens if the bracket shrinking loop never accepts?

- **Concept: D-Optimality in Experimental Design**
  - Why needed here: The multi-output ALC criterion uses determinant reduction (D-optimality) to quantify information gain; this differs from A-optimality (trace) or variance-focused criteria.
  - Quick check question: For a 3-output problem, if adding a candidate point reduces the determinant of Σ by 40% but increases the trace of Σ, would the D-optimal ALC criterion select it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Xn → [Layer 1: ICM with Bw, θw] → Latent Wn → [Layer 2: ICM with By, θy] → Output Yn
  MCMC Loop: Initialize θ, W → Gibbs cycle: (update θw via MH → update θy via MH → update Wn via ESS)
  Active Learning: Candidate pool → compute ALC(x) via latent mapping → select argmin → augment training set

- **Critical path:**
  1. Set D = max(d, Q) latent nodes
  2. Initialize lengthscales with Gamma(3/2, b) priors; b[θw] < b[θy] to encourage smoother latent layer
  3. Run MCMC for 5000 iterations, burn-in 1000, thin by 2 → retain 2000 posterior samples
  4. For prediction: sample w* from Student-t (layer 1), then y* from Student-t (layer 2); aggregate via empirical mean/covariance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Deeper networks (3+ layers):** May capture more complex non-stationarity but increase MCMC mixing difficulty and overfitting risk with small n. Paper focuses on 2 layers for stability.
  - **Higher latent dimensions D:** More expressive warping but slower ESS sampling. Paper uses D = max(d, Q) as heuristic.
  - **Larger reference sets Xref:** Better ALC approximation but O(n²|Xref|) cost per candidate evaluation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **MCMC non-convergence:** Lengthscales stuck at extreme values; Wn samples show autocorrelation >0.8 across iterations → check Gamma prior rates or reduce proposal bounds.
  - **ALC selects redundant points:** Sequential design clusters near existing samples → reference set too small or latent mapping collapsing.
  - **Multivariate Score degrades with more samples:** Overfitting to noise in deterministic simulations → check nugget addition (paper uses ~10⁻⁸) or reduce model depth.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check on synthetic Forrester (Q=2, d=1, n=10):** Fit deepICMGP vs. independent GP; verify RMSE improvement and confirm ˆBy has off-diagonal correlation matching known output relationship (f2 = 0.5f1 + 10(x-0.5) + 5).
  2. **Latent dimension sweep on Branin (Q=3, d=2):** Compare D ∈ {2, 3, 5, 10} with n=30 training points; plot computational time vs. multivariate Score to validate D = max(d, Q) heuristic.
  3. **Active learning trajectory on turbine blade data:** Start with n₀=20; run 10 sequential ALC selections; compare RMSE reduction curves for deepICMGP vs. DGP.Ind to confirm joint modeling advantage in selecting points benefiting all three outputs (Shift, Stress, Strain).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can Vecchia approximations or inducing point techniques be effectively integrated into deepICMGP to maintain predictive accuracy while scaling to large datasets?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 states that deepICMGP "encounters challenges when applied to large-scale datasets" and explicitly identifies Vecchia approximations and inducing point techniques as directions to address this.
- **Why unresolved:** The current MCMC inference scheme relies on exact covariance inversions, which limits the model's applicability to the small-to-medium sample sizes used in the benchmarks (n ≤ 1000).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified deepICMGP implementation applied to datasets with n > 5000, showing competitive RMSE and computational time against sparse GP baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can co-active subspace methods be incorporated into the deepICMGP framework to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional input spaces?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion proposes investigating "co-active subspace methods... to mitigate the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional data" as a specific avenue for future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The numerical studies and real-world case study are restricted to low-dimensional inputs (d ∈ {1, 2, 4}), leaving the model's efficacy on high-dimensional problems unproven.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of the extended model to high-dimensional engineering simulations, demonstrating effective dimension reduction and improved prediction over the standard deepICMGP.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does increasing the number of latent nodes D beyond the heuristic D = max(d, Q) significantly improve the modeling of complex output dependencies?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3 states that D is set to max(d, Q) based on empirical performance, but provides no theoretical justification or sensitivity analysis regarding this structural choice.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if this heuristic limits the model's capacity to represent highly complex inter-output correlations or if larger D values lead to overfitting.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis varying D on synthetic data with known high-rank coregionalization structures to identify the optimal relationship between D and data complexity.

## Limitations

- **MCMC Convergence:** The paper does not provide detailed convergence diagnostics or sensitivity analysis to initialization, assuming adequate mixing for 2000 retained samples.
- **Active Learning Approximation:** The ALC criterion's approximation via a fixed reference set lacks rigorous validation, potentially leading to suboptimal point selection if the reference set poorly represents high-uncertainty regions.
- **Scalability:** The O(n³) computational cost for matrix inversions and O(n²) per candidate in ALC limits applicability to larger datasets, with scalability concerns unaddressed beyond n = 100.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The hierarchical ICM structure and its extension to DGPs is well-founded theoretically. The benchmark results on synthetic examples are consistent and show clear performance gains over independent GPs.
- **Medium Confidence:** The marginalization of coregionalization matrices under Jeffreys priors is a novel efficiency gain, but its robustness to complex cross-output covariance structures is not extensively tested. The ALC criterion's approximation via reference sets is reasonable but lacks rigorous validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The active learning strategy's superiority in real-world settings (e.g., turbine blade) is suggested but not conclusively proven. The sensitivity of results to MCMC initialization, reference set choice, and latent dimension D is not explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence Diagnostics:** Run MCMC with multiple initializations on the Forrester benchmark. Report trace plots, autocorrelation, and effective sample sizes for θw, θy, and key Wn dimensions. Test if posterior estimates are stable across runs.

2. **Reference Set Sensitivity:** For the Branin (Q=3) problem, compare ALC performance using reference sets of sizes 10, 50, and 100. Measure RMSE reduction and computational cost. Determine if ALC selection changes significantly with reference set size.

3. **Scalability Test:** Apply deepICMGP to a synthetic problem with n=200 training points (e.g., scaled Forrester). Measure MCMC runtime and ALC evaluation time. Compare RMSE and multivariate Score against independent GPs to assess if joint modeling still provides benefits at larger scales.
