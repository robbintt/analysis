# Can Conversational AI Counsel for Change? A Theory-Driven Approach to Supporting Dietary Intentions in Ambivalent Individuals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02428
- Reference count: 40
- CounselLLM is a theory-driven LLM system for dietary counseling that integrates Motivational Interviewing and Transtheoretical Model principles through persona design and few-shot learning

## Executive Summary
CounselLLM is an LLM-based conversational AI system designed to support dietary behavior change in ambivalent individuals through integration of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM) principles. The system employs persona design and few-shot learning to deliver empathetic, non-judgmental counseling conversations. User studies demonstrated significant increases in participants' intentions to change dietary behaviors following interactions with CounselLLM, with the system achieving comparable linguistic quality to human counselors while producing more concrete, actionable language.

The research addresses a critical gap in digital health interventions by leveraging conversational AI for scalable, theory-driven behavior change support. CounselLLM effectively engaged participants in cognitive and affective reflection about dietary change, receiving positive ratings for supportiveness, ease of use, and understandability. The system's success in matching human counselor linguistic quality while providing more frequent affirmations suggests its potential as a complementary tool in digital health interventions targeting behavior change.

## Method Summary
The study employed a between-subjects design comparing CounselLLM with two human counselors, recruiting 41 participants through convenience sampling. Participants completed pre- and post-interaction questionnaires measuring knowledge, perceptions, and intentions regarding dietary behaviors, with qualitative interviews conducted post-interaction. The analysis examined linguistic features and MI techniques, including reflections, questions, affirmations, and planning language, to evaluate the system's performance relative to human counselors.

CounselLLM was developed using GPT-4 with few-shot learning and persona design incorporating MI and TTM principles. The system underwent validation through human evaluation and alignment with counseling best practices. Quantitative analysis used paired t-tests to assess changes in knowledge, perceptions, and intentions, while qualitative analysis employed thematic coding of interview transcripts to identify user experiences and system effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Participants showed significantly increased intentions to change dietary behaviors after interacting with CounselLLM
- CounselLLM matched human counselors in linguistic quality while producing more concrete, actionable language
- Participants rated the system as supportive, easy to use, and understandable
- CounselLLM employed more frequent affirmations compared to human counselors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CounselLLM's effectiveness stems from its integration of established behavior change theories into conversational AI design. By incorporating Motivational Interviewing principles, the system creates a non-judgmental environment that reduces resistance and enhances intrinsic motivation. The Transtheoretical Model framework allows CounselLLM to meet users at their current stage of change readiness, providing appropriate support for ambivalence and intention formation.

The persona design approach ensures consistent delivery of MI techniques while few-shot learning enables adaptation to individual user needs. This combination allows the system to engage users in both cognitive reflection (exploring pros and cons of change) and affective reflection (addressing emotional barriers), which are critical components for behavior change in ambivalent individuals.

## Foundational Learning
1. Motivational Interviewing (MI) - A counseling approach that enhances intrinsic motivation for behavior change through empathetic, non-confrontational dialogue. Needed because it reduces resistance and increases engagement in ambivalent individuals. Quick check: System maintains non-judgmental tone and avoids directive language.

2. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) - A framework describing stages of behavior change readiness. Needed because it allows the system to tailor interventions to users' current change stage. Quick check: System identifies and responds appropriately to user's stage of change.

3. Persona Design - Creating consistent character profiles for AI systems. Needed because it ensures coherent counseling style and builds user trust. Quick check: System maintains consistent personality and counseling approach throughout interaction.

4. Few-shot Learning - Training approach using limited examples to guide model behavior. Needed because it enables rapid adaptation of general LLMs to specific counseling contexts. Quick check: System produces desired counseling responses without extensive retraining.

5. Linguistic Alignment - Matching human counselor communication patterns. Needed because it ensures the system provides natural, therapeutic dialogue. Quick check: System output is comparable to human counselor responses in quality and appropriateness.

6. Reflection Techniques - Methods of paraphrasing and summarizing user statements. Needed because they demonstrate understanding and encourage deeper exploration. Quick check: System uses appropriate reflections that match user statements accurately.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Input -> CounselLLM Engine -> Response Output -> Feedback Loop

**Critical Path:** User statement → MI technique selection → Persona-based response generation → Output delivery → User reflection

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes empathy and non-judgmental support over directive advice, trading immediate problem-solving for long-term behavior change potential. This approach sacrifices efficiency for effectiveness in engaging ambivalent individuals.

**Failure Signatures:** System may produce overly generic responses when faced with novel user situations, or may fail to appropriately escalate when users express severe distress. The few-shot learning approach may also lead to inconsistent MI technique application across different user types.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Test system response consistency across multiple interactions with the same user scenario
2. Evaluate MI technique frequency and appropriateness across different user demographics
3. Measure user engagement duration and quality across various dietary topics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Sample composition was predominantly White and well-educated, limiting generalizability to diverse populations
- Short-term intervention with immediate post-measurement raises questions about long-term behavior change sustainability
- Limited comparison with human counselors (only two counselors without detailed demographic information)
- Linguistic analysis did not comprehensively evaluate therapeutic alliance formation

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the system's technical implementation and linguistic quality matching human counselors
- **Medium confidence** in the effectiveness for intention formation based on within-subjects pre-post design
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability to real-world clinical settings
- **Low confidence** in long-term behavior change outcomes due to lack of follow-up data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing CounselLLM against human counselors with follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months to measure actual behavior change and intention sustainability

2. Test the system with diverse populations across different age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and cultural contexts to establish external validity

3. Implement A/B testing with variations in persona design and MI technique implementation to optimize engagement and effectiveness for different user segments
