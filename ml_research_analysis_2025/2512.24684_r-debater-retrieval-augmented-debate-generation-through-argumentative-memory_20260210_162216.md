# R-Debater: Retrieval-Augmented Debate Generation through Argumentative Memory
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.24684
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24684
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: R-Debater achieves near-perfect logical coherence and outperforms LLM baselines in both single-turn InspireScore and multi-turn Debatrix performance

## Executive Summary
R-Debater introduces a retrieval-augmented framework for multi-turn debate generation that integrates argumentative memory with role-based planning. The system retrieves stance-relevant evidence from a curated debate knowledge base and employs specialized agents to detect logical flaws, extract keywords, and generate coherent rebuttals. Evaluated on the ORCHID dataset with 32 debates across seven domains, R-Debater demonstrates superior performance in factual grounding, stance consistency, and cross-turn coherence compared to strong LLM baselines.

## Method Summary
R-Debater operates through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that first searches a curated debate knowledge base for stance-relevant evidence, then employs specialized agents for flaw detection, keyword extraction, and rebuttal generation. The framework integrates argumentative memory to maintain context across turns while role-based planning ensures consistent position adherence. The system processes inputs through multiple stages including evidence retrieval, logical analysis, and generation, with specialized components handling different aspects of debate construction and refinement.

## Key Results
- Achieved near-perfect logical coherence with high single-turn InspireScore performance
- Outperformed strong LLM baselines in multi-turn Debatrix evaluation metrics
- Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters showed R-Debater preferred in over 75% of pairwise comparisons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its integration of evidence-based retrieval with specialized debate reasoning agents. By grounding responses in retrieved argumentative evidence rather than pure generation, R-Debater maintains factual accuracy and logical consistency. The specialized agents for flaw detection and keyword extraction enable systematic identification of opponent weaknesses while maintaining stance coherence. The argumentative memory component preserves debate context across turns, preventing the logical drift that often plagues multi-turn debate systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Why needed - Grounds responses in factual evidence rather than pure generation; Quick check - Verify retrieved evidence relevance to debate stance
- **Argumentative memory**: Why needed - Maintains debate context across multiple turns; Quick check - Test cross-turn coherence preservation
- **Role-based planning**: Why needed - Ensures consistent position adherence throughout debate; Quick check - Validate stance consistency across responses
- **Logical flaw detection**: Why needed - Identifies opponent argument weaknesses systematically; Quick check - Measure accuracy of flaw identification
- **Keyword extraction**: Why needed - Focuses debate on relevant terms and concepts; Quick check - Evaluate keyword relevance to debate context

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input -> Retrieval Engine -> Flaw Detection Agent -> Keyword Extraction Agent -> Argumentative Memory -> Role-Based Planner -> Generation Agent -> Output
- **Critical path**: Retrieval -> Logical Analysis -> Memory Integration -> Generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Favors precision and logical consistency over generation speed; prioritizes evidence-based responses over creative but potentially inaccurate content
- **Failure signatures**: Missing relevant evidence retrieval, logical inconsistency across turns, stance drift from role-based planning failures
- **Three first experiments**: (1) Test retrieval accuracy on stance-relevant evidence, (2) Evaluate cross-turn coherence maintenance, (3) Assess logical flaw detection precision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on ORCHID dataset, potentially limiting generalizability to real-world debates
- System depends on curated debate knowledge base requiring significant maintenance and updates
- Performance metrics and human evaluation results may not fully capture adversarial debate scenarios

## Confidence
- **Technical approach**: High - Clear methodological description with reproducible components
- **Superiority over baselines**: Medium - Consistent improvements shown but limited external validation
- **Long-term effectiveness**: Low - Narrow domain scope and lack of adversarial stress testing

## Next Checks
1. Test R-Debater in open-domain debates with adversarial opponents to assess robustness
2. Conduct longitudinal study evaluating knowledge base maintenance and system performance over time
3. Implement cross-validation with alternative debate datasets and evaluation metrics to verify generalizability beyond ORCHID
