# Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.12243
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: PRISM achieves 84% semantic retention while sampling fewer than 5% of frames, outperforming baselines by up to 33% on METEOR score

## Executive Summary
This paper presents PRISM, a three-stage framework for summarizing procedural and instructional videos. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and LLM-based contextual validation to produce semantically grounded summaries. It dynamically generates and validates labels at the frame level, enabling bottom-up summarization that adapts to video content without external annotations. Evaluations on YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions show that PRISM achieves 84% semantic retention while sampling fewer than 5% of frames, outperforming baselines by up to 33% on METEOR score. On TVSum and SumMe datasets, it achieves competitive ranking performance. A case study on surgical datasets demonstrates strong phase coverage. Ablation studies confirm that semantic label-guided selection is critical for summary quality and efficiency.

## Method Summary
PRISM operates through three sequential stages: (1) adaptive visual sampling, which selects frames based on visual change and relevance, (2) label-driven keyframe anchoring, which generates and validates semantic labels for each frame using an LLM, and (3) LLM-based contextual validation, which ensures selected frames are semantically representative of the full video. The framework uses temporal adjacency and label co-occurrence to create clusters, which are then condensed into final summaries. This approach avoids reliance on external annotations and adapts to diverse video content.

## Key Results
- PRISM achieves 84% semantic retention while sampling fewer than 5% of frames on benchmark datasets
- Outperforms baselines by up to 33% on METEOR score and shows strong performance on TVSum and SumMe datasets
- Ablation studies confirm that semantic label-guided sampling is critical for summary quality and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PRISM works by combining adaptive sampling with semantic validation. Adaptive sampling reduces redundancy by selecting frames that capture significant visual or semantic changes. Label-driven anchoring ensures each selected frame is semantically meaningful by generating context-aware labels using an LLM. Contextual validation then filters and ranks frames to maintain coherence and completeness. This bottom-up approach dynamically adapts to video content without requiring external annotations, making it scalable and flexible across domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adaptive visual sampling**: Reduces redundancy by selecting frames based on visual change and relevance; needed to minimize data load while preserving semantic content; quick check: compare sampled vs. full video semantic coverage
- **Label-driven keyframe anchoring**: Generates semantic labels for frames using an LLM; needed to ground summaries in video content; quick check: evaluate label accuracy and coverage
- **LLM-based contextual validation**: Filters and ranks frames for coherence; needed to ensure summaries are semantically complete; quick check: measure summary coherence scores
- **Temporal clustering**: Groups adjacent frames by label co-occurrence; needed to capture procedural phases; quick check: assess phase boundary detection accuracy
- **Semantic retention metrics**: Quantifies how much meaning is preserved in summaries; needed to evaluate summary quality; quick check: compare METEOR/Rouge-L scores against baselines

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Visual sampling -> Label generation -> Contextual validation -> Summary assembly
- **Critical path**: Adaptive sampling → LLM label generation → Semantic validation → Summary output
- **Design tradeoffs**: High sampling efficiency vs. potential loss of nuanced details; label generation quality vs. computational cost
- **Failure signatures**: Poor label generation leads to irrelevant summaries; excessive sampling negates efficiency gains; contextual validation errors cause incoherence
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test adaptive sampling alone on YouCook2 to measure redundancy reduction
  2. Evaluate label generation accuracy on ActivityNet Captions
  3. Validate summary coherence on TVSum using human judges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to longer videos and unseen domains remains uncertain
- Temporal coherence across summaries is inferred but not formally measured
- Evaluation relies on automated metrics without perceptual or task-based human studies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Effectiveness of adaptive visual sampling combined with label-driven keyframe selection for reducing frame count while retaining semantic content
- **Medium confidence**: Framework's robustness to domain shift and long-form videos, as current validation is restricted to short-to-medium procedural content
- **Low confidence**: Sufficiency of automated metrics alone to capture summary utility, given absence of human judgment or task-oriented validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing PRISM summaries against full videos on task completion rates for procedural learning
2. Test scalability by applying PRISM to videos exceeding 30 minutes and evaluate temporal coherence and label consistency across extended durations
3. Validate cross-domain robustness by applying the framework to non-cooking instructional content (e.g., mechanical repair, medical procedures) and quantifying performance drops relative to domain-specific baselines
