# Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.06014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014

- One-line primary result: Laplacian Visual Prompting achieves 75.5% ML-SRA on MD-3k for zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of depth ambiguity in 3D spatial understanding, particularly in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture the full 3D structure. The authors propose a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models, introducing MD-3k - a new benchmark featuring multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics to evaluate depth biases in existing models. They develop Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. LVP enables robust geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference.

## Method Summary
The method introduces Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that addresses depth ambiguity by applying discrete Laplacian kernels to RGB inputs. For each image, LVP generates two depth predictions: one from the original RGB image and another from the Laplacian-transformed image. The Laplacian kernel ([[0,1,0],[1,-4,1],[0,1,0]]) acts as a high-frequency edge detector that emphasizes transparency boundaries. These dual predictions are evaluated on the MD-3k benchmark, which contains 3,161 images with multi-layer depth annotations. The approach achieves multi-layer depth estimation without model retraining by leveraging existing foundation models and their responses to frequency-modified inputs.

## Key Results
- LVP achieves Multi-Layer Spatial Relationship Accuracy (ML-SRA) scores up to 75.5% on the MD-3k benchmark
- The method demonstrates zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation capability without requiring model retraining
- LVP enables robust geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Laplacian Visual Prompting works by exploiting the frequency sensitivity of pre-trained depth models. The discrete Laplacian kernel emphasizes high-frequency edge information, which helps models distinguish between different depth layers in ambiguous scenes with transparent surfaces. When applied to RGB images, the Laplacian transform highlights boundaries between foreground and background elements, prompting the model to produce different depth predictions that correspond to multiple spatial layers. This spectral prompting approach effectively decouples the single-depth prediction problem into two complementary predictions that together capture the multi-layer structure of complex scenes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-layer depth estimation**: Understanding that single-depth predictions are insufficient for transparent scenes with multiple spatial layers; needed because real-world scenes often contain occlusions and transparency effects that require distinguishing between near and far depth layers
- **Laplacian spectral transformation**: Applying discrete Laplacian kernels to extract high-frequency features; needed to emphasize edge boundaries that help models differentiate between depth layers in ambiguous scenes
- **Depth bias measurement**: Using α(fθ) to quantify preference for near vs. far depth layers; needed to evaluate whether models systematically favor one depth layer over another in ambiguous situations
- **Spatial relationship accuracy**: Evaluating multi-layer depth predictions through ML-SRA metrics; needed to measure simultaneous correctness of both depth layers rather than individual predictions
- **Training-free prompting**: Modifying inputs rather than model weights to elicit different behaviors; needed to leverage existing pre-trained models without costly retraining procedures

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: RGB Input -> Depth Model fθ -> D1 (RGB depth) and D2 (Laplacian depth) -> ML-SRA Evaluation
**Critical Path**: Image preprocessing → Laplacian transform → Dual inference → Sparse point evaluation → Metric computation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Training-free approach vs. potentially suboptimal performance compared to fine-tuned models; simplicity and generalizability vs. dependence on baseline model quality
**Failure Signatures**: Similar depth predictions from RGB and Laplacian inputs (no decoupling); baseline RGB depth errors propagating to LVP outputs; poor performance on low-contrast or complex occlusion scenes
**First Experiments**: 1) Validate Laplacian transform visually produces edge-like high-frequency response; 2) Run baseline SRA on non-ambiguous subset to verify >85% performance; 3) Compute |α(fθ, RGB) - α(fθ, LVP)| divergence to diagnose decoupling effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends critically on baseline model's ability to produce reasonable single-depth estimates; LVP cannot recover from fundamentally incorrect baseline predictions
- The specific Laplacian kernel may not be optimal for all scene types, particularly those with gradual transparency or complex occlusions
- MD-3k benchmark relies on sparse point-pair annotations rather than dense depth maps, limiting evaluation granularity

## Confidence
- **Confidence: Medium** in the primary claim that Laplacian Visual Prompting reliably decouples depth layers without retraining
- **Confidence: Low** regarding the generality of the Laplacian transform across diverse scene types
- **Confidence: Medium** in the MD-3k benchmark's comprehensiveness

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline Dependency Analysis**: Run LVP on scenes where baseline RGB depth prediction has <80% SRA to quantify performance degradation when starting from poor initial estimates.
2. **Kernel Ablation Study**: Test alternative Laplacian kernels on a subset of MD-3k to determine if the specific [[0,1,0],[1,-4,1],[0,1,0]] kernel is optimal for eliciting depth layer separation.
3. **Temporal Consistency Validation**: Apply LVP to video sequences from MD-3k (if available) to verify the claimed temporal consistency, measuring depth prediction stability across frames with slight viewpoint changes.
