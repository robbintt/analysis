# From Words to Proverbs: Evaluating LLMs Linguistic and Cultural Competence in Saudi Dialects with Absher

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10216
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10216
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Qwen achieves highest overall accuracy (63% on words, 50.35% overall) on the Absher benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Absher, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' understanding of Saudi dialects and cultural nuances. The benchmark comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions across six categories, derived from authentic dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs from five major Saudi regions. The authors evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs in a zero-shot setting, revealing significant performance variability across dialects and question types, with all models struggling with culturally rich content and underrepresented dialects.

## Method Summary
The study scraped 3,094 dialectal items from ar.mo3jam.com, representing five Saudi regions, then used GPT-4o to generate 18,564 multiple-choice questions across six types (Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition). A hybrid quality control system combining automated filtering and manual human validation ensured question validity. Six models (ALLaM, LLaMA, Jais, Mistral, Qwen, and AceGPT) were evaluated in zero-shot settings using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Key Results
- Qwen achieved the highest overall accuracy (63% on words, 50.35% overall)
- ALLaM excelled in proverb interpretation (48% accuracy)
- All models struggled with culturally rich content and underrepresented dialects
- Performance degraded significantly for non-urban dialects (Southern, Eastern)
- Location Recognition was most successfully handled; True/False was most challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Data Scarcity and Imbalance Drives Performance Degradation in Low-Resource Dialects
- **Claim:** LLMs exhibit significant performance gaps on Saudi dialects versus Modern Standard Arabic, with further degradation for non-urban dialects
- **Mechanism:** Pretraining corpora are heavily skewed toward high-resource languages and standardized forms, while Saudi dialects are primarily oral and informal with fewer training tokens
- **Core assumption:** Performance bottleneck is primarily data availability, not architectural inability
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract notes struggles with underrepresented dialects; section 5.2 describes complete failure on Southern proverb attributed to limited training data; SaudiCulture paper [21838] corroborates LLM limitations in capturing cultural nuances

### Mechanism 2: Context-Rich and Structured Tasks Mitigate Dialectal Understanding Challenges
- **Claim:** Models perform better on proverbs and structured tasks than on isolated word definitions or binary reasoning
- **Mechanism:** Proverbs provide richer semantic context that aids disambiguation, while structured tasks like Location Recognition benefit from constrained output spaces
- **Core assumption:** Multilingual representations can leverage contextual cues from related languages to bootstrap understanding in low-resource dialects
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.3 notes proverbs consistently result in higher accuracy due to richer context and explicit cultural cues; Location Recognition was most successfully handled while True/False was most challenging due to limited context

### Mechanism 3: Multilingual Pretraining Can Yield Superior Dialectal Generalization Over Monolingual Specialization
- **Claim:** Multilingual models (e.g., Qwen) can outperform Arabic-specific models (e.g., Jais) on zero-shot dialectal benchmarks
- **Mechanism:** Models trained on massive diverse multilingual datasets develop more robust cross-lingual representations that transfer better to unseen dialectal variations
- **Core assumption:** Diversity of languages in pretraining acts as regularization, creating adaptable representations
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract reports Qwen achieving highest overall accuracy; section 5.1 notes Qwen (7B multilingual) outperformed larger Arabic-native Jais (13B) by nearly 10%

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zero-shot Evaluation**
  - **Why needed here:** The study evaluates LLMs without task-specific training, measuring inherent transferable capability
  - **Quick check question:** In a zero-shot evaluation on Absher, should a model have been exposed to the benchmark's multiple-choice questions during its training?

- **Concept: Sociolinguistic Nuance (Idioms & Proverbs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes between literal meaning and cultural interpretation, crucial for understanding Cultural Interpretation tasks
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model correctly translate a proverb's words but fail to identify its underlying cultural lesson?

- **Concept: Model Generalization vs. Specialization**
  - **Why needed here:** Central finding tension between broad multilingual models (Qwen) and narrow Arabic-specialized models (ALLaM)
  - **Quick check question:** According to the study, which trait correlated better with overall benchmark performance: being a large monolingual Arabic model or being a highly capable multilingual model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Curation -> Question Generation -> Quality Control -> Evaluation
- **Critical path:** Data Curation -> Question Generation -> Quality Control -> Evaluation. A failure in Quality Control layer invalidates final evaluation results
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Automation vs. Quality: GPT-4o enables massive scale but introduces hallucination risk, necessitating costly manual human evaluation
  - Scope vs. Depth: Focusing exclusively on Saudi dialects allows deep regional analysis but sacrifices wider Arab world applicability
  - Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuned: Zero-shot design assesses intrinsic capability but may underestimate potential of fine-tuned models
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Urban Bias: Models defaulting to major cities (Riyadh, Jeddah) for location recognition
  - Literalism: Failing on Cultural Interpretation by interpreting literally instead of pragmatically
  - Generator Hallucination: GPT-4o creating plausible-sounding but factually incorrect answers
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Few-shot Baseline: Re-evaluate models with example Q&A pairs to determine if poor performance is due to dialectal knowledge or task format
  2. Regional Ablation: Compare model performance on General Saudi category versus each specific regional dialect
  3. Fine-tuning Intervention: Fine-tune top-performing multilingual and Arabic-native models on Saudi dialectal corpus and re-evaluate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do few-shot prompting or fine-tuning strategies impact LLM performance on the Absher benchmark compared to zero-shot setting?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 6.3 states intention to conduct in-depth evaluations using few-shot and fine-tuning scenarios
- **Why unresolved:** Current study limited to zero-shot setting; unknown whether task-specific training can bridge performance gaps in low-resource dialects
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative evaluation of six models using few-shot prompts or fine-tuned weights on Absher test set, measuring accuracy improvements in Cultural Interpretation and Location Recognition

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific linguistic or cultural features drive performance degradation in underrepresented Saudi dialects?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 6.3 notes intention to perform deeper causal analyses on factors driving model performance across dialects
- **Why unresolved:** Paper identifies model failures on Southern and Eastern dialects but doesn't isolate whether failures are due to lexical uniqueness, syntactic divergence, or lack of cultural knowledge
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation study correlating specific sociolinguistic features (e.g., lexical overlap with MSA) with model accuracy scores

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does prompt structure influence reliability of cultural competence evaluations in Arabic LLMs?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 6.1 acknowledges all models assessed using fixed prompt structure and suggests exploring prompt variation impact
- **Why unresolved:** Performance variability might be partially attributable to specific phrasing of prompt rather than models' inherent lack of dialectal knowledge
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Sensitivity analysis running benchmark with varied instruction prompts (neutral, persona-based, English-instructed) to measure variance in accuracy and F1-scores

## Limitations
- Benchmark coverage limited to five major regions, potentially missing dialectal variations from smaller communities
- Use of GPT-4o for question generation introduces potential hallucination risks despite human validation
- Zero-shot evaluation methodology provides baseline insights but doesn't explore fine-tuning or few-shot potential

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Benchmark construction methodology and overall finding that all models struggle with culturally rich content
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific performance rankings of individual models (e.g., Qwen outperforming ALLaM)
- **Low Confidence**: Mechanism explaining why multilingual models outperform Arabic-native ones

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a few-shot evaluation using 5-10 exemplar questions to determine if poor performance stems from task format unfamiliarity
2. Perform ablation studies by region to quantify precise relationship between dialect representation in training data and model performance
3. Fine-tune a subset of top-performing models on auxiliary corpus of Saudi dialectal text and re-evaluate to test whether data scarcity alone explains performance gaps
