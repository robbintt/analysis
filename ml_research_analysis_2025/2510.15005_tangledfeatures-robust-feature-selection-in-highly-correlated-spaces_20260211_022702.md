# TangledFeatures: Robust Feature Selection in Highly Correlated Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15005
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15005

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of feature selection in highly correlated spaces, where traditional methods often degrade due to redundancy. The proposed method, TangledFeatures, introduces a stability-based pipeline that clusters highly correlated features, selects a representative from each cluster using ensemble-based stability selection, and refines the subset via Random Forest feature importance to ensure compactness and interpretability. The approach is validated on Alanine Dipeptide, predicting backbone torsional angles φ and ψ from intra-atomic distances. TangledFeatures consistently selects stable, interpretable, and structurally meaningful distances—such as N–C, C–C, and C–N interactions—that capture torsional variability. Compared to baselines like LASSO, Elastic Net, and Boruta, it achieves comparable predictive accuracy (R² > 0.87) while improving stability, as shown by higher Kuncheva index and Spearman correlation across bootstrap resamples. The method offers a principled way to reduce redundancy without sacrificing interpretability or robustness in correlated feature spaces.

## Method Summary
TangledFeatures is a three-stage pipeline for feature selection in correlated spaces. First, it constructs a correlation graph where nodes are features and edges connect features with Pearson correlation exceeding threshold τ; connected components define redundancy clusters. Second, it performs ensemble stability selection by training R Random Forests, each time sampling one representative from each cluster, then averaging feature importance scores to select the most stable representative per cluster. Third, it refines the selected representatives by ranking them by cumulative Random Forest importance and retaining features until 99% of predictive signal is captured. The method was validated on Alanine Dipeptide, transforming periodic torsional angles into sine/cosine components and predicting them from intra-atomic distances, demonstrating both high predictive accuracy and superior stability compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved R² > 0.87 predictive accuracy on Alanine Dipeptide torsional angle prediction while maintaining high feature stability
- Consistently selected interpretable distances (N–C, C–C, C–N) that capture torsional variability across bootstrap resamples
- Demonstrated superior Kuncheva index and Spearman correlation compared to LASSO, Elastic Net, and Boruta baselines
- Successfully handled the periodicity challenge by transforming angles into sine/cosine components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph-Based Redundancy Clustering
The system computes a pairwise Pearson correlation matrix Σ and constructs an undirected graph G=(V,E) where vertices are features and edges exist if |Σᵢⱼ| ≥ τ. Connected components in this graph define clusters of redundant information. This prevents selection algorithms from arbitrarily picking one feature from interchangeable predictors. The core assumption is that high linear correlation implies semantic redundancy such that one feature can represent the group. The break condition occurs when features are non-linearly dependent but linearly uncorrelated, causing the graph to fail to cluster them.

### Mechanism 2: Cluster-Constrained Stability Selection
During the selection phase, the algorithm trains R Random Forest models, sampling one candidate distance from each cluster Cₖ alongside uncorrelated variables. Importance scores are averaged over these runs to select a winning representative for the cluster. This reduces variance in feature importance scores compared to standard methods. The core assumption is that structural noise in feature importance is higher for redundant features than the variance introduced by sub-sampling representatives. The break condition is if the number of bootstrap resamples R is too low, causing averaged importance scores to not converge.

### Mechanism 3: Cumulative Importance Refinement
After selecting cluster representatives, the refinement module ranks them by Random Forest importance and retains features in descending order until their cumulative sum reaches 0.99 threshold. This ensures the final subset captures at least 99% of the predictive signal while discarding low-contributing variables. The core assumption is that Random Forest feature importance accurately reflects the ground-truth contribution to torsional angles. The break condition is if features interact multiplicatively, where standard importance metrics may prematurely discard one partner before the cumulative threshold is met.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kuncheva Index**
  - Why needed here: Primary metric used to prove "robustness" by measuring consistency of selected features across data resamples
  - Quick check question: If a feature selection method picks {A, B} on run 1 and {A, C} on run 2, how does the Kuncheva Index penalize this compared to picking {A, B} both times?

- **Concept: Torsional Angles & Periodicity (φ, ψ)**
  - Why needed here: Validation case study predicts these angles; standard regression fails due to periodicity (359° ≈ 1°)
  - Quick check question: Why is predicting raw angle φ using MSE loss problematic, and how does sine/cosine transformation fix this?

- **Concept: Connected Components in Graphs**
  - Why needed here: Data structure used to define "clusters" of correlation
  - Quick check question: Given correlation matrix and threshold τ, how do you determine which features belong to the same "redundancy group" using graph theory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input D (Conformations × Distances) → Correlation Module (Pearson → Adjacency → Connected Components) → Selection Module (R iterations: Sample 1/cluster → Train RF → Store Importance → Average → Select max) → Refinement Module (Rank → Accumulate until 0.99) → Output d'

- **Critical path:** Selection Module (sβ) is the computational bottleneck, training R Random Forests over sampled feature space

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Stability vs. Accuracy: Trades slight accuracy decrease for high feature stability
  - Threshold τ: High τ → smaller clusters (less redundancy reduction), Low τ → massive clusters (aggressive reduction, risk of information loss)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Arbitrary Selection: If τ is too low, distinct features slightly correlated are merged, discarding useful information
  - Metric Instability: If RF importance scores are noisy and R is low, representative selection fluctuates between runs

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sensitivity Analysis on τ: Vary threshold (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) on Alanine Dipeptide to observe trade-off between features selected and predictive R²
  2. Stability Benchmark: Compare against standard Lasso on synthetic dataset with known correlated blocks; measure Kuncheva Index over 10 bootstrap samples
  3. Downstream Linearity Check: Train Linear Regression on final subset d' and compare accuracy to RF results to test linear relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **High-dimensional performance:** How does TangledFeatures perform on high-dimensional, complex datasets compared to the small Alanine Dipeptide benchmark? (Basis: Software Availability mentions extensions to genomics, finance, government datasets)
- **Threshold sensitivity:** How sensitive is the selected feature subset to the user-specified correlation threshold (τ)? (Basis: Method 2.2 defines graph construction using τ but provides no sensitivity analysis)
- **Accuracy gap closure:** Can the pipeline be modified to close the predictive accuracy gap with methods that utilize redundant features? (Basis: Results note trades slight accuracy loss for stability compared to SVM with Elastic Net)

## Limitations

- Relies on Pearson correlation for clustering, potentially missing non-linear dependencies
- 0.99 cumulative importance threshold may exclude features with subtle but important interactions
- Performance heavily depends on proper calibration of correlation threshold τ and ensemble size R

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core mechanism of correlation-based clustering followed by ensemble selection is sound and theoretically justified; stability improvements via Kuncheva index are statistically robust
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific parameter choices (correlation threshold, ensemble size, importance threshold) and their impact on accuracy-stability trade-off require further exploration across diverse datasets
- **Low Confidence:** Long-term generalizability to completely different domains (genomics, finance) beyond molecular dynamics remains to be seen

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Apply TangledFeatures to high-correlation dataset from different domain (e.g., gene expression data) to test broader applicability
2. **Non-Linear Dependency Analysis:** Compare clustering results using Pearson vs. non-linear correlation measures (e.g., MIC) to quantify potential information loss
3. **Interactive Feature Impact:** Conduct ablation study where features with high interaction effects (measured by SHAP interaction values) are selectively reintroduced to assess impact on predictive performance
