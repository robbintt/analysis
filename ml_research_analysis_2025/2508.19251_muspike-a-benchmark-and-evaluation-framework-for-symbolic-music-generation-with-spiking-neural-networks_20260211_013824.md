# MuSpike: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Symbolic Music Generation with Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.19251
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19251
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Key outcome:** First systematic benchmark for SNN-based symbolic music generation, revealing misalignment between objective metrics and subjective human evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MuSpike, a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for symbolic music generation using spiking neural networks (SNNs). The authors evaluate five SNN architectures (S-CNN, S-RNN, S-LSTM, S-GAN, S-Transformer) across five symbolic music datasets using both objective metrics (pitch, rhythm, harmony) and a large-scale subjective listening study. The key finding is a fundamental misalignment between objective statistical performance and human perceptual judgment, highlighting the limitations of current evaluation metrics. S-Transformer achieves the best statistical performance but receives lower subjective ratings than human compositions, while listener expertise significantly influences perception of AI-generated music.

## Method Summary
The MuSpike framework converts MIDI files into compound word tokens representing seven musical features (tempo, chord, bar-beat, position, pitch, duration, velocity). These tokens are encoded into spike trains using a linear projection followed by Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with ATan surrogate gradients for training. Five SNN architectures process these spike trains to generate music, with outputs decoded back to symbolic format. The framework includes objective metrics covering pitch-related (Pitch Count, Pitch Range, etc.), rhythm-related (IOI, Empty Beat Rate, Groove Consistency), and harmony-related (Pitch Consonance Score, Chord Transition Entropy) dimensions. A subjective evaluation uses a 13-item Likert questionnaire plus Turing test across three listener groups (Normal, Amateur, Expert) with 76 total participants.

## Key Results
- S-Transformer achieves best objective performance across datasets but receives lower subjective ratings than human compositions
- Clear misalignment between objective metrics and subjective evaluation, particularly for "musical impression" and "pleasantness"
- Listener expertise affects perception: amateurs rate AI music lowest (1.56 vs 3.59 for human), while experts show higher tolerance and even exhibit "reverse Turing bias"
- S-RNN shows "pitch overflow" (excessive Pitch Count), while S-GAN has high Empty Beat Rate, indicating architectural limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spike-based Feature Encoding
Converting symbolic music tokens into sparse spike trains via linear projection and LIF neurons preserves musical semantics. Compound word tokens are embedded, concatenated, and passed through spike-based encoder with LIF neurons (τm=2.0, Vth=0.5). Core assumption: temporal precision and sparse representation capture discrete, time-based patterns effectively. Break condition: mismatched firing threshold or time constant causes dead neurons or saturation, losing information.

### Mechanism 2: Surrogate Gradient Optimization
ATan surrogate function enables backpropagation through non-differentiable spike generation. Continuous approximation during backward pass permits gradient flow to update projection weights, allowing adaptive mapping of symbolic features to spike trains. Core assumption: surrogate gradient closely approximates spike function gradient without destabilizing convergence. Break condition: poor surrogate match causes vanishing/exploding gradients, preventing coherent sequence learning.

### Mechanism 3: Expertise-Weighted Perceptual Evaluation
Framework contrasts objective metrics with subjective Likert ratings from Normal, Amateur, and Expert groups. Identifies misalignment where models score well objectively but receive lower subjective ratings. Core assumption: objective metrics insufficient proxies for "musicality" without validation against cognitive metrics. Break condition: relying solely on objective metrics to select production model likely results in system users perceive as "unpleasant" despite good scores.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Dynamics
  - **Why needed here:** Fundamental unit of all five architectures; understanding membrane potential, threshold, and time constant is required to debug spike encoder.
  - **Quick check question:** If you increase membrane time constant (τm) significantly, how would neuron's firing rate response to fast-changing musical input change?

- **Concept:** Compound Word Tokenization
  - **Why needed here:** Input data structure is compound word format combining 7 features into single token, determining input dimensionality for spike encoder.
  - **Quick check question:** What is advantage of treating musical attributes as single compound token rather than independent sequences for SNN encoder?

- **Concept:** Surrogate Gradient Descent
  - **Why needed here:** Training mechanism enabling SNNs to learn; without understanding this, cannot explain how discrete spiking network backpropagates error.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is surrogate function (like ATan) necessary for calculating gradients in spiking neural network regarding derivative of spike function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input: Compound Word Tokens (7 features) → Encoder: Linear Projection → LIF Neurons (τm=2.0, Vth=0.5) → Spike Trains → Backbone: 5 architectures → Decoder: Linear Heads → Output: Musical features
- **Critical path:** Data Processing: MIDI → Compound Word tokens → Spike Encoding: Project tokens → Generate spike trains (ATan surrogate) → Generation: Pass spikes through S-Transformer → Decoding: Output probability distributions → Validation: Compare statistics to original dataset + web platform for user ratings
- **Design tradeoffs:** S-Transformer vs S-RNN: S-Transformer achieves best objective/subjective balance but higher complexity; S-RNN shows "pitch overflow" suggesting lacks global context management. Objective vs Subjective Optimization: Optimizing for objective metrics does not guarantee higher "Pleasantness" ratings from human listeners.
- **Failure signatures:** Pitch Overflow (S-RNN): Generating abnormally high number of distinct pitches (e.g., 43.1 vs original 22.8 in JSB), indicating loss of tonal center. Empty Beat Rate (S-GAN): High rate of empty beats (e.g., 0.256 vs original 0.004 in EMOPIA), resulting in disjointed rhythms. Reverse Turing Bias (Experts): Experts misidentifying human music as AI because "too simple," skewing subjective evaluation.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Reproduction: Train S-Transformer on JSB Chorales and verify "Pitch-in-scale Rate" matches reported ~0.87. 2) Ablation on Neuron Parameters: Modify LIF threshold (try 0.3 and 0.7) and observe change in "Empty Beat Rate" to test sensitivity to sparsity. 3) Objective-Subjective Alignment Check: Generate 10 samples with S-Transformer and manually rate "Harmonic Progression" vs calculated "Pitch Consonance Score" to verify misalignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question:** How can objective evaluation metrics be redesigned to better align with human perceptual judgments in symbolic music generation?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors explicitly ask, "Can objective metrics truly reflect human perceptual judgments?" and identify "fundamental misalignment" where S-Transformers match statistical ground truths but fail subjective validity tests.
**Why unresolved:** Statistical similarity does not capture cognitive dimensions like "autobiographical association" or "musical impression," resulting in models that score well objectively but are rated poorly by humans.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Development of new loss functions or evaluation metrics demonstrating statistically significant correlation with subjective "cognitive-level" metrics.

### Open Question 2
**Question:** What underlying criteria cause expert listeners to misidentify human-composed music as AI-generated ("reverse Turing bias")?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] Turing test results show expert group had lowest accuracy (28.2%) in identifying human pieces; authors note this "interesting phenomenon" but don't validate cause.
**Why unresolved:** Unclear if experts apply overly strict structural criteria, misinterpreting simplicity of some human compositions as "artificial" lack of complexity.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Protocol analysis or qualitative interviews with expert participants immediately following identification tasks to map decision-making heuristics.

### Open Question 3
**Question:** Why do amateur musicians exhibit lower tolerance and higher polarization toward AI-generated music compared to non-musicians and experts?
**Basis in paper:** [inferred] While paper notes amateurs rated AI music lowest (1.56) and human highest (3.59), cognitive mechanism behind specific "polarized attitude" compared to "nuanced" view of experts is not fully explained.
**Why unresolved:** Study quantifies variance but leaves open whether skepticism stems from "uncanny valley" effect regarding musical rules or lack of familiarity with algorithmic aesthetics.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Targeted ablation study varying specific rule violations to measure amateur sensitivity thresholds relative to other groups.

## Limitations
- Significant gap between objective statistical metrics and subjective human evaluation reveals limitations of current evaluation frameworks
- Expertise-weighted evaluation framework introduces complexity in interpretation with relatively small expert sample size (26 experts)
- Claims about SNN superiority over state-of-the-art ANN methods not directly validated as no direct comparisons provided

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Technical implementation of MuSpike benchmark framework and comparative objective evaluation of five SNN architectures across five datasets are well-documented and reproducible. Methodology for spike-based encoding using LIF neurons with ATan surrogate gradients is clearly specified.

**Medium Confidence:** Subjective evaluation results and reported misalignment between objective and subjective metrics are convincing but limited by specific participant pool (76 total, with only 26 experts). Interpretation of expertise-weighted differences requires caution given relatively small expert sample size.

**Low Confidence:** Paper's claims about superiority of SNN approaches for music generation compared to state-of-the-art ANN methods (like diffusion models or LLMs) are not directly validated as no direct comparisons are provided. Specific reasons why certain architectures (like S-RNN) fail with "pitch overflow" are described but not deeply analyzed.

## Next Checks

1. **Direct Architecture Comparison:** Replicate benchmark using state-of-the-art ANN baseline (e.g., MusicLM or transformer-based diffusion) on same datasets to determine if SNNs offer any objective or subjective advantages over conventional approaches.

2. **Expert Sample Size Validation:** Expand subjective evaluation to include at least 100 expert participants to strengthen confidence in expertise-weighted findings, particularly "reverse Turing test" phenomenon and claim that experts show higher tolerance for AI-generated music.

3. **Metric Correlation Analysis:** Conduct systematic correlation study between each objective metric and subjective ratings across all listener groups to identify which metrics (if any) serve as reliable predictors of perceived musical quality, potentially leading to refined evaluation framework that better aligns statistical and perceptual measures.
