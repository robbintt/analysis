# Relative Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation: a more Robust Neural Networks eXplaination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14322
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: R-LRP achieves higher accuracy using fewer relevant pixels than existing LRP methods across multiple datasets and architectures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Relative Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (R-LRP), a novel method for explaining neural network decisions by computing input contributions without hyperparameter tuning or division by small values. R-LRP modifies the conservation law used in traditional LRP methods to preserve relative contributions, making it more robust and eliminating the need for method-specific hyperparameters like epsilon values. The method is evaluated across MNIST-like datasets, ImageNet-1K, and complex architectures including VGG and ResNet, demonstrating consistent superiority over existing LRP variants.

## Method Summary
R-LRP modifies traditional Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation by preserving a relative conservation law rather than absolute conservation. Instead of propagating relevance through division operations that can be unstable when denominators are small, R-LRP uses a reformulation that maintains the relative importance of neurons across layers. This eliminates the need for epsilon stabilization terms and hyperparameter tuning that plague existing LRP methods. The approach works by reformulating the relevance propagation equations to operate on normalized relevance scores, ensuring stability and consistency across different network architectures and input scales.

## Key Results
- R-LRP achieves 81% accuracy on cat vs. dog classification using only 15% of relevant pixels, compared to 62% for the best alternative LRP method
- The method consistently outperforms LRP-0, LPR-ϵ, LRP-αβ, and LRP-γ across multiple datasets including MNIST variants and ImageNet-1K
- Qualitative analysis shows R-LRP focuses more precisely on objects of interest compared to traditional LRP methods
- Results are consistent across both VGG and ResNet architectures, demonstrating architecture-agnostic performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
R-LRP works by reformulating the relevance propagation equations to preserve relative rather than absolute conservation laws. This mathematical reformulation eliminates division by small values and the need for epsilon stabilization, which are sources of instability in traditional LRP methods. By operating on normalized relevance scores throughout the propagation process, R-LRP maintains numerical stability and produces more consistent attributions across different input scales and network architectures.

## Foundational Learning

**Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation**: A technique for explaining neural network decisions by backpropagating relevance from output to input layers
- Why needed: Provides interpretable explanations of black-box model decisions
- Quick check: Can trace how input features contribute to final classification

**Conservation Laws in Neural Networks**: Mathematical constraints ensuring relevance preservation during backpropagation
- Why needed: Guarantees that total relevance remains consistent across layers
- Quick check: Sum of propagated relevance should equal output relevance

**Numerical Stability in Backpropagation**: Techniques to prevent division by small values and overflow/underflow errors
- Why needed: Ensures reliable relevance computation across all network layers
- Quick check: No NaN or infinite values in relevance propagation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Dense/CNN/Residual Layers -> Output -> R-LRP Backpropagation -> Input Relevance
**Critical Path**: Forward pass through network → Output relevance computation → R-LRP backward propagation → Input relevance attribution
**Design Tradeoffs**: R-LRP sacrifices absolute conservation for relative stability, eliminating hyperparameter tuning but potentially changing interpretation semantics
**Failure Signatures**: Numerical instability when relevance values become extremely small or large, loss of conservation property if implementation errors occur
**First Experiments**: 1) Test R-LRP on simple linear models to verify basic functionality, 2) Compare R-LRP with standard LRP on MNIST to validate performance claims, 3) Evaluate R-LRP on ResNet with varying input scales to test normalization robustness
