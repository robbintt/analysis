# V-EfficientNets: Vector-Valued Efficiently Scaled Convolutional Neural Network Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.05659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05659
- Authors: Guilherme Vieira Neto; Marcos Eduardo Valle
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved 99.46% accuracy on ALL-IDB2 dataset while using approximately 70% fewer parameters than original EfficientNetV2-B0

## Executive Summary
V-EfficientNets extend EfficientNet models to process vector-valued data using non-associative algebras, enabling inter-channel relationship modeling inherent in multidimensional data. The key innovation is the vector-valued depthwise convolution layer that leverages algebraic operations to reduce parameters while maintaining or improving accuracy. The models were evaluated on acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection from blood smear images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant parameter efficiency gains.

## Method Summary
The method introduces vector-valued neural networks that treat feature channels as components of higher-dimensional vectors, using non-associative algebras to define multiplication rules. The vector-valued depthwise convolution replaces standard depthwise operations, with weights constructed via Kronecker products between learnable parameters and fixed algebraic tensors. A vectorization factor hyperparameter λ controls the trade-off between parameter efficiency and model capacity. The architecture was tested on ALL-IDB2 dataset using HSV-encoded images with data augmentation, trained for 400 epochs with RMSProp optimizer.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.46% average accuracy on ALL-IDB2 dataset, the highest reported in literature
- Reduced parameters by approximately 70% compared to original EfficientNetV2-B0
- Outperformed state-of-the-art models while maintaining exceptional parameter efficiency
- Hyperbolic quaternion algebra showed superior performance among tested hypercomplex algebras

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Algebraic Intra-channel Coupling
The network captures inter-channel correlations by treating feature channels as components of a higher-dimensional vector using non-associative algebras. The multiplication rules defined by the algebra's multiplication tensor $P$ structurally link operations across channels, forcing the network to learn representations that respect the geometric structure of input data. This works when data channels possess intrinsic geometric relationships, but fails if channels are statistically independent.

### Mechanism 2: Parameter Efficiency via Weight Sharing
The algebraic structure enables weight sharing across dimensions according to multiplication rules, reducing parameter counts by reusing parameters multiple times per operation. Instead of learning $d$ independent weight sets for $d$ dimensions, the network learns vector-valued weights applied using algebraic multiplication rules. This provides sufficient basis for feature transformation without requiring dense independent weight matrices, though may bottleneck capacity for highly non-linear interactions orthogonal to the algebraic basis.

### Mechanism 3: Vector-Valued Depthwise Convolution
This extends depthwise convolution to vector-spaces, applying vector-filters to vector-inputs that combine computational efficiency with algebraic mixing. The operation maintains spatial filtering efficiency while preserving algebraic channel semantics through Kronecker product implementation. Success depends on correct channel summation/permutation to maintain algebraic consistency, with failure degrading into incorrect standard convolution.

## Foundational Learning

- **Non-Associative Algebras**: Needed to understand replacement of scalar multiplication with algebraic products (Quaternions, Hyperbolic Quaternions). Quick check: When multiplying two vectors in Quaternion algebra, does the result depend only on magnitudes or also on orientation/axis?

- **Depthwise Separable Convolution**: Essential for understanding EfficientNet MBConv blocks that V-EfficientNets modify. Quick check: How many parameters are in a standard depthwise convolution with input channels $C$ and kernel size $K \times K$?

- **EfficientNet Compound Scaling**: Required to understand where the vectorization factor $\lambda$ fits alongside depth/width/resolution scaling. Quick check: What are the three dimensions scaled in original EfficientNet, and does increasing width always improve performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input tensor $H \times W \times C$ → reinterpreted as $H \times W \times (C/d)$ vectors in $R^d$ → Vector Blocks (MBConv/Fused-MBConv with Vector-Valued Depthwise Convs) → Algebraic Kernel (Kronecker product construction) → Output (flattened real values)

- **Critical path**: 1) Define algebra (select $P$ tensor) 2) Implement weight transformation (Kronecker product between $W^{(R)}$ and $P$) 3) Execute convolution with correct channel summation/permutation to collapse augmented intermediate tensor

- **Design tradeoffs**: Vectorization Factor ($\lambda$): $\lambda=1/4$ maximizes compression but risks capacity loss; $\lambda=1$ increases capacity/parameters. Algebra Selection: Hyperbolic Quaternions performed best on medical imaging but choice dictates geometric prior.

- **Failure signatures**: Dimension mismatch (output has $d^2$ times expected channels), training instability (algebra-specific issues), no compression (parameter count not roughly $\lambda \times$ original)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement V-Dense layer on MNIST using Complex numbers ($d=2$) to verify Kronecker product implementation 2) Train V-EfficientNet-B0 on ALL-IDB2 varying $\lambda \in [1/4, 1/2, 1]$ to observe accuracy/parameter trade-off 3) Swap algebra tensor $P$ (Quaternion vs Hyperbolic Quaternion) to isolate impact of geometric prior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How can the optimal non-associative algebra be systematically selected or designed for a specific dataset or task? The authors acknowledge this as future research without providing theoretical or heuristic methods for predicting which algebra suits a given problem.

2. Do V-EfficientNets retain their superior parameter efficiency and accuracy when scaled to large-scale, general-purpose vision benchmarks? The experimental validation is restricted to the small ALL-IDB2 dataset, leaving performance on standard large-scale benchmarks unverified.

3. What is the optimal trade-off between parameter reduction and representational capacity when tuning the vectorization factor $\lambda$? The authors introduce $\lambda$ but only evaluate the extreme case of $\lambda=1/4$, without systematic ablation studies across the full range of values.

## Limitations
- Single dataset validation (ALL-IDB2 only) without testing on diverse medical imaging tasks
- Lack of comparison against recent transformer-based approaches
- Potential overfitting to the small dataset size (260 images)
- Empirical choice of $\lambda=1/4$ without systematic ablation studies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Parameter reduction claims (70% fewer parameters) and architectural framework
- **Medium confidence**: Accuracy improvement over SOTA given single dataset validation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability across different medical imaging tasks and optimal choice of hypercomplex algebra

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Evaluate V-EfficientNets on multiple medical imaging datasets (breast cancer histopathology, chest X-rays) to assess generalizability beyond ALL-IDB2.

2. **Algebra Ablation Study**: Systematically compare performance across different hypercomplex algebras (Quaternions, Coquaternions, Tessarines, Hyperbolic Quaternions) on the same dataset with statistical significance testing.

3. **Architecture Scaling Analysis**: Test compound scaling properties by training V-EfficientNet variants at different sizes (small, medium, large) to verify the vectorization factor λ maintains efficiency across the spectrum.
