- Claims 100% accuracy on HR benefits table QA vs 0% for Textract OCR

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting and querying structured tabular data from multimodal HR documents in talent management systems. Current OCR-based methods struggle with preserving semantic relationships between tabular elements, limiting their effectiveness in downstream RAG applications. The authors propose TalentMine, an LLM-based framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically enriched representations while preserving both structural and contextual information. The system uses Claude v3 Haiku via Amazon Bedrock to convert complex HR tables into contextual text optimized for question-answering. Experiments on employee benefits documents show TalentMine achieving 100% accuracy in query answering tasks, compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS Textract Visual Q&A capabilities.

## Method Summary
TalentMine uses a multimodal approach where table images from HR documents are passed to Claude v3 Haiku via Amazon Bedrock with specialized HR prompts. The LLM converts visual tables into contextual sentence-level text that preserves row-column relationships and conditional dependencies. This text is then indexed for semantic similarity search using Amazon Q. During query time, the system retrieves relevant context and generates answers using the LLM, enabling accurate retrieval of complex benefits information including HRA contributions, network deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums across various coverage tiers and time periods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 100% accuracy on employee benefits table question-answering tasks
- Outperforms AWS Textract OCR baseline (0% accuracy) and Textract Visual Q&A (40% accuracy)
- Successfully handles complex queries requiring cross-row comparisons and conditional logic
- Maintains numerical precision while converting tabular data to natural language format

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Text Linearization
Converting tabular data into sentence-level natural language preserves row-column relationships and contextual dependencies that CSV linearization destroys. Each table cell is transformed into a complete sentence that explicitly states its value, position context (month, coverage tier), and related header information. This creates retrieval-friendly text chunks where semantic similarity search can locate precise values based on natural language queries. Core assumption: LLMs can reliably generate faithful sentence representations that maintain numerical precision and relational context without hallucination.

### Mechanism 2: Multimodal Direct-to-Text Extraction
Bypassing traditional OCR-to-CSV pipelines and using vision-language models for direct table-to-text extraction prevents semantic information loss at the structural parsing stage. Claude v3 Haiku processes table images directly, interpreting visual layout (headers, merged cells, hierarchical groupings) and outputting contextual text in a single pass. This avoids the CSV intermediate representation that strips relationships. Core assumption: The vision-language model has sufficient table understanding capabilities to correctly parse complex multi-tier benefit structures without explicit structure detection.

### Mechanism 3: Domain-Specific Prompting for HR Context
HR-specialized prompts that explicitly instruct the model to preserve row-column relationships, numerical precision, and conditional dependencies improve extraction fidelity over generic table-to-text conversion. The system prompt instructs the model to act as a "document processing agent specialized in talent management documentation," with explicit requirements to maintain positional context and generate complete sentences optimized for RAG retrieval. Core assumption: Prompt engineering alone, without fine-tuning, is sufficient to achieve reliable extraction for HR document types.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: TalentMine's core value proposition is enabling accurate QA over tabular HR data. Understanding how vector similarity search retrieves context for LLM generation is essential for debugging retrieval failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a CSV representation of a benefits table would fail semantic similarity search for the query "What is the January deductible for family coverage?"

- Concept: **Vision-Language Model Capabilities and Limitations**
  - Why needed here: The architecture relies on Claude v3 Haiku's image understanding. Knowing what table structures VLMs handle well (simple grids) vs. poorly (nested headers, merged cells) helps set realistic expectations.
  - Quick check question: What types of table visual formatting would you expect to challenge a VLM's extraction accuracy?

- Concept: **Semantic vs. Structural Table Representation**
  - Why needed here: The key insight is that CSV preserves structure but loses semantics. Understanding this distinction clarifies why the LLM-based text conversion is necessary.
  - Quick check question: If you linearized a 5x10 benefits table into CSV, how would a query like "family coverage in March" fail during retrieval?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input PDF/images -> Table Detection -> LLM Extraction (Claude v3 Haiku) -> Vector Index -> Query Engine (AmazonQ) -> Answer Generation

- Critical path:
  1. Prompt design (Appendix E) → extraction quality
  2. Table image clarity → LLM parsing accuracy
  3. Sentence structure in output → retrieval relevance
  4. Model selection (Haiku vs. Sonnet) → latency/accuracy tradeoff

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Haiku vs. Sonnet/Opus**: Haiku selected for latency (90% accuracy vs. 100% for Sonnet) but paper reports 100% for Haiku on numerical extraction—apparent contradiction suggests test sets differ. Assumption: Haiku sufficient for HR benefits tables but may struggle with more complex structures.
  - **Offline vs. Real-time Processing**: Batch preprocessing enables faster queries but requires re-indexing for new documents.
  - **AmazonQ vs. Custom RAG**: Paper uses AmazonQ for retrieval; corpus evidence suggests structured representations could further improve tabular QA.

- Failure signatures:
  - **0% accuracy (AWS Textract baseline)**: Returns "No Response" or extracts values without context—CSV cannot answer conditional queries.
  - **40% accuracy (Textract Visual Q&A)**: Confuses coverage tiers (returns family value for individual query) and misinterprets row-column intersections.
  - **"No information found" responses**: Earlier Claude models (v2, Instant) fail retrieval on 20-30% of queries.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce baseline failures**: Run AWS Textract on sample benefits tables, confirm 0% QA accuracy, identify specific failure modes (missing context, wrong cell retrieval).
  2. **Prompt iteration**: Test the Appendix E prompt on 5 table images, manually verify numerical accuracy and sentence completeness. Try removing domain-specific instructions to measure impact.
  3. **Model comparison**: Run identical tables through Claude v3 Haiku and Sonnet, measure latency difference and accuracy delta on complex multi-tier tables with merged cells.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary dataset prevents independent verification of 100% accuracy claims
- Limited evaluation on complex table formats (nested headers, merged cells, multi-page tables)
- Underspecified architectural details around table detection and RAG configuration
- No comparison against specialized tabular QA models that preserve structure

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using LLM-based text linearization for table-to-text conversion is technically sound and aligns with established practices in the field (TALENT, TableLLM).
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported 100% accuracy figure is credible given the controlled domain (HR benefits tables) and the use of state-of-the-art vision-language models, but the lack of public dataset access prevents independent validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific architectural details around table detection and RAG configuration are underspecified, making exact reproduction challenging without additional implementation details.

## Next Checks
1. **Independent Accuracy Verification**: Test the approach on a publicly available table QA dataset (e.g., WikiTableQuestions or TabFact) to benchmark against the claimed 100% accuracy in a reproducible setting.
2. **Edge Case Analysis**: Evaluate the system on tables with complex formatting (merged cells, nested headers, multi-page tables) to identify the actual limits of Claude v3 Haiku's table understanding capabilities.
3. **Ablation Study**: Compare the performance of domain-specific HR prompts against generic table-to-text prompts to quantify the actual contribution of specialized prompt engineering to the overall accuracy gains.
