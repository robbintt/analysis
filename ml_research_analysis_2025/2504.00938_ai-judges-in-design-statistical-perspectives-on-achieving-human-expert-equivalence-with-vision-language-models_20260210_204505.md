# AI Judges in Design: Statistical Perspectives on Achieving Human Expert Equivalence With Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts

- AI vision-language models can achieve expert-human equivalence in engineering design evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a statistical framework to assess whether AI vision-language models (VLMs) can perform at expert-human levels in engineering design evaluation. Using in-context learning (ICL), four AI judges were developed to rate conceptual design sketches on uniqueness, creativity, usefulness, and drawing quality. These AI models were compared against two human experts and three trained novices using a comprehensive set of statistical tests including inter-rater reliability (Kappa, ICC), error metrics (MAE), hypothesis testing (Friedman, Wilcoxon), equivalence testing (TOST), and top-set overlap (Jaccard similarity). The best-performing AI judge, employing multimodal ICL with reasoning, achieved expert-level agreement for uniqueness and drawing quality, matching or outperforming trained novices across all metrics. For uniqueness, the AI judge matched expert-level agreement in 8/9 statistical tests and exceeded the majority of trained novices in 6/6 runs.

## Method Summary
The study developed four AI judges using vision-language models with in-context learning approaches to evaluate conceptual design sketches across four criteria: uniqueness, creativity, usefulness, and drawing quality. These AI evaluators were benchmarked against two human experts and three trained novices using a comprehensive statistical framework. The evaluation employed nine statistical tests: Cohen's Kappa for agreement, ICC(3,k) for inter-rater reliability, MAE for error measurement, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests for hypothesis testing, TOST for equivalence testing, and Jaccard similarity for top-set overlap. The best-performing AI judge used multimodal in-context learning with reasoning capabilities, achieving expert-level agreement in uniqueness and drawing quality while matching or exceeding trained novice performance across all evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- Best AI judge achieved expert-level agreement for uniqueness and drawing quality using multimodal ICL with reasoning
- For uniqueness, AI judge matched expert-level agreement in 8/9 statistical tests
- AI judge exceeded majority of trained novices in 6/6 runs across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of AI judges in design evaluation stems from their ability to process visual information through VLMs while applying consistent evaluation criteria through in-context learning. The multimodal ICL approach enables the AI to understand both the visual aspects of design sketches and the contextual requirements for evaluation, while the reasoning component allows for more nuanced judgment similar to human experts. The statistical framework provides rigorous validation by comparing AI performance against human experts using multiple complementary metrics, ensuring that equivalence is not determined by a single measure but through comprehensive assessment across reliability, accuracy, and consistency measures.

## Foundational Learning

1. **In-Context Learning (ICL)** - why needed: Enables VLMs to adapt to specific evaluation tasks without fine-tuning, allowing flexible application across different design criteria; quick check: Verify that prompts include sufficient examples for the AI to learn evaluation patterns.

2. **Inter-Rater Reliability Metrics** - why needed: Essential for quantifying agreement between evaluators, whether human or AI, to establish equivalence; quick check: Calculate both Cohen's Kappa and ICC to capture different aspects of agreement.

3. **Statistical Equivalence Testing** - why needed: Goes beyond simple correlation to determine if AI performance falls within an acceptable range of human expert performance; quick check: Use TOST with pre-defined equivalence bounds to establish practical equivalence.

4. **Multimodal VLMs** - why needed: Required to process both visual design sketches and textual evaluation criteria simultaneously; quick check: Validate that the model correctly interprets visual elements before evaluation.

5. **Jaccard Similarity for Top-Set Overlap** - why needed: Measures agreement on ranking, not just absolute ratings, which is crucial for design evaluation; quick check: Compare top-N selections between AI and human evaluators.

6. **Error Metrics (MAE)** - why needed: Quantifies the magnitude of differences between AI and human ratings to establish practical significance; quick check: Calculate MAE alongside correlation metrics for complete performance picture.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Design Sketches -> VLM Processing -> ICL Prompting -> Rating Output -> Statistical Analysis Pipeline -> Comparison Metrics

**Critical Path**: Sketch Input → Multimodal VLM Processing → In-Context Learning Prompt Application → Rating Generation → Statistical Validation → Expert Equivalence Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balanced between using pre-trained VLMs (avoiding costly fine-tuning) versus potential performance gains from specialized training, and between comprehensive statistical testing (ensuring robustness) versus practical implementation complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor ICL prompt design leading to inconsistent ratings, inadequate representation of human evaluation criteria in prompts, statistical tests showing significant divergence from expert performance, or failure to achieve equivalence in multiple test categories simultaneously.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test ICL prompts with a small validation set to ensure the AI produces reasonable initial ratings before full-scale evaluation
2. Run pairwise statistical comparisons between AI and individual human experts to identify specific areas of divergence
3. Validate that the VLM correctly processes visual elements by comparing AI-identified features against human-annotated sketch characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to engineering design domains beyond conceptual sketches
- Potential variability in human expert agreement not fully characterized
- Specific VLM architectures tested may not represent all possible approaches

## Confidence

High: Technical implementation of statistical tests and observed performance of best AI judge in matching expert-level agreement for uniqueness and drawing quality.

Medium: Broader claim that these AI judges can reliably replace human experts in engineering design evaluation, given domain-specific nature and limited number of human experts.

Low: AI judges' ability to generalize to more complex design tasks or different cultural/educational contexts not represented in training data.

## Next Checks
1. Test AI judges across multiple engineering disciplines and design complexity levels to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate consistency and reliability of AI judges over extended periods and varying conditions.
3. Implement blind validation studies where human experts evaluate same designs without knowledge of AI involvement to detect potential systematic biases or differences in evaluation criteria.
