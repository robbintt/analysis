# Forecasting Rare Language Model Behaviors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16797
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Accurately forecasts deployment-scale rare LLM failures by extrapolating tail behavior of elicitation probabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to forecast rare deployment-scale failures of language models from much smaller evaluation sets. It measures the elicitation probability of each evaluation query—the probability that its output exhibits a target behavior—and shows that the largest observed elicitation probabilities follow predictable power-law scaling as deployment query volume increases. By extrapolating the extreme quantiles of these probabilities, the method can forecast whether any query will produce a dangerous output at deployment. Experiments covering chemical/biological misuse and misaligned actions show accurate predictions of worst-case risk, behavior frequency, and aggregate risk over two to three orders of magnitude of query volume, enabling proactive mitigation before large-scale deployment.

## Method Summary
The method works by first sampling evaluation queries and computing elicitation probabilities for each—either via log-probabilities of specific target outputs/keywords or through repeated sampling to measure correctness. These probabilities are transformed into extreme value scores, and the Gumbel-tail model is fitted to the top-10 scores to capture tail behavior. The fitted model then extrapolates quantiles to predict deployment-scale risks, including worst-query risk, behavior frequency, and aggregate risk, which can be compared against decision thresholds for deployment safety.

## Key Results
- Accurate forecasting of worst-query risk over two to three orders of magnitude of query volume
- Superior performance compared to log-normal baselines, especially for behavior frequency and aggregate risk prediction
- Method reliably predicts rare behavior occurrences in chemical/biological misuse and misaligned action scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The largest elicitation probabilities scale predictably with query volume, following a power-law relationship.
- Mechanism: Rather than treating query outcomes as binary (safe/unsafe), the method computes elicitation probabilities by repeatedly sampling outputs. The extreme quantiles of these probabilities—specifically the logarithm of the top quantiles—scale linearly with the logarithm of query count, enabling extrapolation.
- Core assumption: The tail behavior of elicitation probabilities converges to a Gumbel distribution, which is justified under extreme value theory for many underlying distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the largest observed elicitation probabilities follow predictable power-law scaling as deployment query volume increases"
  - [section 3.3] "we assume that logarithm of the extreme quantiles scales according to a power law with respect to the number of queries n"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; corpus focuses on safety evaluation infrastructure rather than scaling laws for rare behaviors.
- Break condition: If the underlying elicitation probability distribution has heavy tails that do not converge to Gumbel (e.g., Fréchet domain), or if the evaluation set fails to capture any tail samples, the linear extrapolation will produce unreliable forecasts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Forecasting extreme quantiles suffices to predict three distinct deployment risk metrics.
- Mechanism: The method defines Q_p(n) as the threshold for the top 1/n fraction of elicitation probabilities. From this single quantity, it derives: (1) worst-query risk—the maximum elicitation probability across n queries; (2) behavior frequency—the fraction of queries exceeding a threshold; and (3) aggregate risk—the probability at least one output exhibits the behavior, computed via Monte Carlo sampling from the quantile distribution.
- Core assumption: Risk is concentrated in the tail of the elicitation probability distribution; the bulk of the distribution does not meaningfully contribute to deployment failures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Much of the risk at deployment frequently comes from the largest sampled elicitation probabilities"
  - [section 4.4] "aggregate risk can be high even when no individual query has a high elicitation probability"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; related work on behavioral safety assessment focuses on different evaluation paradigms.
- Break condition: If deployment failures arise from the compounding of many moderate-probability queries rather than any single high-probability query, and the tail is mischaracterized, aggregate risk forecasts will be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Gumbel-tail method outperforms parametric baselines because it directly models extreme tail behavior rather than average distribution properties.
- Mechanism: The log-normal baseline fits a parametric distribution to all observed scores and extrapolates from mean/variance. The Gumbel-tail method fits only to the 10 highest elicitation scores, exploiting the property that for Gumbel-type tails, the log survival function is approximately linear in the score. This focuses estimation on precisely the region needed for forecasting rare events.
- Core assumption: The 10 highest scores in the evaluation set are sufficient to estimate tail behavior and are not extreme outliers relative to the true tail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "The average absolute log error is 1.7 for the Gumbel-tail method, compared to 2.4 for the log-normal method"
  - [section 4.3] "the gap between the Gumbel-tail and log-normal methods is much larger than it was for worst-query risk"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence comparing extreme-value methods to parametric approaches for LLM risk forecasting.
- Break condition: If the evaluation set is too small to include representative tail samples, or if the highest observed scores are themselves stochastic outliers, the 10-score fit will produce biased extrapolations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core technical contribution relies on EVT's Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem, which characterizes the limiting distributions of sample maxima. Understanding why the Gumbel distribution arises from certain tail behaviors is essential for assessing when the method will generalize.
  - Quick check question: Given a distribution with a heavier tail than exponential (e.g., power-law with α < 1), which extreme value distribution will its maxima converge to?

- Concept: **Elicitation Probability vs. Binary Classification**
  - Why needed here: Standard safety evaluations treat outputs as binary (safe/unsafe). This method requires computing continuous probabilities, which can be done via log-probabilities of target outputs or repeated sampling. The trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy are central to practical implementation.
  - Quick check question: If computing elicitation probabilities via repeated sampling costs 100× more than log-probability estimation, when is the additional cost justified?

- Concept: **Quantile Extrapolation**
  - Why needed here: The method extrapolates from observed quantiles (e.g., top 1%) to unobserved quantiles (e.g., top 0.001%). Understanding the reliability of such extrapolation—and when it breaks down—is critical for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: If your evaluation set has m = 500 queries, what is the finest quantile you can directly estimate without extrapolation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Query Generator -> Elicitation Estimator -> Quantile Fitter -> Risk Forecaster -> Decision Interface

- Critical path:
  1. Sample m evaluation queries from D_eval
  2. For each query, estimate p_ELICIT (log-prob or sampling)
  3. Transform to scores ψ_i = -log(-log(p_ELICIT))
  4. Fit linear model to top 10 (ψ_i, log survival probability) pairs
  5. Extrapolate to quantile Q_p(n) for target deployment scale n
  6. Compute risk metrics and compare to decision thresholds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Log-prob vs. repeated sampling**: Log-prob is efficient but requires pre-specifying target outputs/keywords; sampling captures general correctness but is costly. The paper suggests adaptive sampling to reduce cost.
  - **Number of top scores for fitting**: Paper uses 10; more scores may reduce variance but include non-tail samples, biasing the fit.
  - **Evaluation set size m**: Larger m improves forecasts (Table 2 shows log error drops from 1.67 to 1.29 as m increases 100→1000) but increases evaluation cost.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Consistent overestimation**: May indicate the evaluation distribution D_eval has heavier tails than D_deploy, or the 10-score fit is biased by outliers.
  - **Consistent underestimation**: Dangerous; suggests the true tail is heavier than Gumbel assumptions permit, or evaluation queries are not representative.
  - **High forecast variance across evaluation set partitions**: Indicates the evaluation set is too small to stably capture tail behavior.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate scaling on held-out queries**: Partition 100K queries into train (m = 1000) and test (n = 10K-90K). Compute forecast error as a function of n. Replicate Figure 3a to verify Gumbel-tail accuracy.
  2. **Compare elicitation estimation methods**: For a subset of queries, compute p_ELICIT via log-prob (keyword-based) and repeated sampling (correctness-based). Assess correlation and whether the scaling relationship holds for both.
  3. **Test distribution shift sensitivity**: Generate queries from two different meta-prompts (e.g., Figure 7 vs. Figure 9). Train on one, test on the other. Quantify forecast degradation to understand robustness requirements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How robust are the Gumbel-tail scaling forecasts to distribution shifts between evaluation and deployment data, particularly when facing adaptive adversaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "We do not study distribution shifts between evaluation and deployment queries... We think studying how robust our forecasts are to distribution shifts is interesting subsequent work."
- Why unresolved: The current method assumes evaluation queries are drawn from the same distribution as deployment queries ($D_{eval} = D_{deploy}$), which may not hold if users adapt queries based on model responses or temporal changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation of forecast accuracy when $D_{deploy}$ is deliberately shifted or evolved adaptively relative to $D_{eval}$.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the method be modified to reduce the tendency to overestimate probabilities, particularly as the forecast length (number of deployment queries) increases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 notes that forecasts "tend to slightly overestimate the actual probability, and the overestimate grows with the length of the forecast," and identifies reducing this bias as important subsequent work.
- Why unresolved: The current ordinary least squares fitting on top elicitation scores introduces a systematic bias that accumulates when extrapolating to large query volumes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of fitting techniques (e.g., robust regression or bias correction terms) that maintains accuracy over longer extrapolation ranges.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the power-law scaling properties of elicitation probabilities hold for broader ranges of behaviors and more natural distributions of queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section lists exploring "forecasts for a broader range of behaviors on more natural distributions of queries" as an area for subsequent work.
- Why unresolved: The experiments primarily rely on synthetic red-teaming queries (for misuse) and multiple-choice questions (for misalignment), which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world user interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful forecasting using organic user logs or open-ended generation tasks rather than synthetic or structured evaluation sets.

## Limitations

- The Gumbel-tail assumption may not hold for all distributions of elicitation probabilities, particularly those with heavy tails
- The method assumes no distribution shift between evaluation and deployment data, which may not hold in practice
- Experiments focus on narrowly defined risk types, leaving generalization to other behaviors unproven

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The power-law scaling relationship between extreme quantiles and query volume is well-established across multiple experimental conditions and risk types
- **Medium confidence**: The Gumbel-tail mechanism works well for the studied risk types, but the underlying distributional assumptions are not fully validated
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to other rare behaviors, different model families, or significant distribution shift between evaluation and deployment remains unproven

## Next Checks

1. **Distributional assumption validation**: For each experimental condition, empirically verify that the top-10 elicitation scores follow the expected Gumbel tail behavior by testing the linear relationship between log survival probability and score. Quantify goodness-of-fit and test whether non-Gumbel tails (e.g., power-law with varying exponents) degrade forecast accuracy.

2. **Distribution shift robustness**: Generate evaluation queries from multiple distinct meta-prompts or distributions. Train the Gumbel-tail model on one distribution and test forecasting accuracy on queries from held-out distributions. Measure forecast degradation as a function of distributional divergence.

3. **Extreme value sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the number of top scores used for fitting (e.g., top-5, top-10, top-20). Measure forecast accuracy and stability across different choices. Identify the optimal trade-off between bias and variance for different evaluation set sizes.
