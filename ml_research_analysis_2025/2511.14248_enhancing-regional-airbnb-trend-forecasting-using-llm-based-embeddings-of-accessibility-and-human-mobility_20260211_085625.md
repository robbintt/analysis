# Enhancing Regional Airbnb Trend Forecasting Using LLM-Based Embeddings of Accessibility and Human Mobility

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.14248
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14248
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** Proposed LLM-based embeddings reduce average RMSE and MAE by ~48% compared to conventional baselines for regional Airbnb market forecasting.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel time-series forecasting framework for predicting regional Airbnb market trends using LLM-based embeddings. Unlike prior listing-level approaches, the model incorporates external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. By converting structured regional data into LLM prompts, rich embeddings are generated and fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer). Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves forecasting accuracy for Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations, offering practical insights for urban policy and housing market regulation.

## Method Summary
The framework converts structured regional data (Airbnb listings, accessibility features, human mobility) into text prompts, which are processed by LLaMA 3 to generate 3072-dimensional embeddings. These are compressed via 4-layer MLPs to 128-dimensional vectors for Airbnb features and 48-dimensional vectors for contextual features. A sliding window approach (6-month input, predict next 3 months) is used with LSTM/RNN/Transformer backbones, trained on multi-task loss across three Airbnb indicators.

## Key Results
- Average RMSE and MAE reduction of approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines
- LSTM outperforms RNN and Transformer baselines (RMSE 0.4075 vs 0.4240 vs 0.4746)
- Integration of external urban context (accessibility and human flow) significantly improves prediction accuracy
- Multi-horizon loss aggregation stabilizes training and improves generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Encoding of Structured Regional Data
Converting structured tabular data into natural language prompts allows the LLM to generate semantically richer representations than standard normalization or one-hot encoding. The model creates a text prompt for a region-month, which LLaMA 3 processes to produce a 3072-dimensional embedding capturing the semantic "meaning" of the region's status.

### Mechanism 2: Context-Aware Feature Fusion (Externalities)
Airbnb market trends are better predicted when internal listing data is augmented with external urban context—specifically human mobility (floating population) and accessibility (transport infrastructure). The architecture concatenates three distinct embedding streams, forcing the time-series model to learn correlations between physical urban dynamics and rental demand.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Horizon Loss Aggregation
Simultaneously predicting multiple targets (Revenue, Reservation Days, Reservations) using a weighted loss function stabilizes training and improves generalization over single-task learning. This compels the shared embedding layers to learn a representation useful for diverse aspects of market health.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Structured Data**
  - Why needed: The model serializes statistical summaries into text prompts that preserve magnitude and context for the LLM
  - Quick check: For a "Binary Column" (e.g., "Has Wifi"), does the prompt include "True/False" for each listing or a summary count? (Answer: A summary count)

- **Concept: Dimensionality Reduction (Projection Heads)**
  - Why needed: LLaMA 3 outputs 3072 dimensions, which is computationally prohibitive; need to project this into a dense latent space (e.g., 128d)
  - Quick check: Why use a 4-layer Fully Connected (FC) network instead of a single linear layer for reduction? (Likely to introduce non-linearity and better compress semantic information)

- **Concept: Sliding Window Time-Series Construction**
  - Why needed: The model learns from history (6 months) to predict the future (1-3 months)
  - Quick check: With a stride of 1 and 67 months of data, how many distinct training samples can be generated? (Requires calculating overlap)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (CSVs) -> Serialization (Python logic to text prompts) -> Encoder (LLaMA 3 → 3072d vectors) -> Projection (4-Layer MLPs → 48d/128d) -> Aggregator (Concatenation → Final Regional Embedding) -> Backbone (LSTM/RNN/Transformer) -> Head (Dense layer outputting 3 variables × 3 time steps)

- **Critical path:** The Prompt Construction is the highest-risk component. If the text template misrepresents the data, the LLM embedding is garbage, and no amount of LSTM tuning will fix it.

- **Design tradeoffs:** LSTM outperforms Transformer (0.4075 vs 0.4240 RMSE), suggesting LSTM is the optimal bias-variance tradeoff given limited data (67 months). Allocating 128d to Airbnb features vs 48d to Context suggests listing data is denser in information.

- **Failure signatures:** High variance in Revenue (often higher than Reservation Days), suggesting the model struggles with price outliers. If baseline performance matches LLM version, check the Projection Head for zeroing out LLM features.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Ablation): Replicate Table 7 - compare raw tabular data vs LLM embeddings on single district
  2. Sensitivity Analysis (Window Size): Replicate Table 4 - test Window=3 vs Window=6 on validation set
  3. Modality Drop (Ablation): Replicate Table 6 - train with only "Human Flow" embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Evaluating the generalizability of the framework across diverse urban contexts with different regulatory environments and data availability
- Investigating robustness under pandemic-induced anomalies and exogenous shocks that decouple historical mobility patterns from future demand
- Exploring GNN+LLM-based architectures to more effectively capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies
- Assessing whether training exclusively on high-activity regions impairs the model's ability to detect emerging trends in low-density areas

## Limitations
- Experiments conducted exclusively on Seoul's Airbnb dataset, limiting generalizability to other urban contexts
- Exact LLM prompt templates and architecture specifications (LSTM hidden size, learning rate, epochs) remain unspecified
- 48% RMSE reduction claim relies on comparison with unspecified baseline methods

## Confidence
- **High:** Multi-task loss framework improves stability (supported by Table 5 results)
- **Medium:** LLM embeddings capture semantic relationships (mechanism plausible but prompt template critical)
- **Low:** Absolute RMSE values (0.4075) without knowing baseline scales

## Next Checks
1. Replicate Table 7 ablation: Compare raw tabular data vs LLM embeddings on single district to verify claimed performance gap
2. Test window size sensitivity (Table 4): Compare Window=3 vs Window=6 on validation set to confirm optimal context length
3. Validate modality contribution (Table 6): Train with only Human Flow embeddings to confirm external context drives accuracy gains
