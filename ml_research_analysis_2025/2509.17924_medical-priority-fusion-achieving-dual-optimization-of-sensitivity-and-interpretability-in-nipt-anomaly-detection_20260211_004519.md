# Medical priority fusion: achieving dual optimization of sensitivity and interpretability in nipt anomaly detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.17924
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17924
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 89.3% sensitivity with 80% interpretability score on NIPT anomaly detection using MPF framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves the trade-off between diagnostic performance and interpretability in clinical machine learning for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) anomaly detection. MPF achieves this by fusing Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic using medical knowledge-guided weights (NB:0.8, DT:0.2) and adaptive thresholding under explicit medical constraints. Validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples with extreme class imbalance (43.4:1) showed MPF achieved 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) and 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms while meeting Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24).

## Method Summary
MPF employs a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that fuses Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic using medical knowledge-guided weights. The core innovation lies in the weighted fusion approach where Naive Bayes receives 0.8 weight and Decision Tree receives 0.2 weight, combined with adaptive thresholding under explicit medical constraints. This framework addresses the fundamental trade-off between diagnostic performance and interpretability in clinical machine learning. The method was validated on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1), demonstrating that MPF can achieve both high sensitivity and interpretability simultaneously.

## Key Results
- Achieved 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) on NIPT anomaly detection
- Attained 80% interpretability score while maintaining diagnostic performance
- Outperformed individual algorithms with significant improvement (McNemar's test, p < 0.001) and large effect size (d = 1.24)
- Met Grade A clinical deployment criteria with the first clinically-deployable solution balancing both accuracy and transparency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Medical Priority Fusion framework works by leveraging the complementary strengths of two distinct algorithmic approaches. Naive Bayes provides probabilistic reasoning that captures the statistical relationships in the data, while Decision Trees offer rule-based logic that enhances interpretability through explicit decision pathways. The medical knowledge-guided weighting (NB:0.8, DT:0.2) ensures that the probabilistic component dominates while the rule-based component provides sufficient interpretability. The adaptive thresholding under explicit medical constraints ensures that the fused model adheres to clinical requirements while optimizing for both sensitivity and interpretability. This hybrid approach is particularly effective for NIPT anomaly detection where both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency are critical for clinical acceptance and patient care.

## Foundational Learning

**Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization** - Optimization that considers multiple competing objectives simultaneously under explicit constraints.
*Why needed:* Essential for balancing diagnostic performance with interpretability requirements in clinical settings.
*Quick check:* Verify that optimization formulation explicitly includes both sensitivity and interpretability objectives with medical constraints.

**Medical Knowledge-Guided Weighting** - Integration of domain expertise into algorithmic weighting schemes rather than purely data-driven approaches.
*Why needed:* Ensures clinical relevance and acceptability of the machine learning model in healthcare settings.
*Quick check:* Confirm that weight assignments (NB:0.8, DT:0.2) are based on medical expert input rather than optimization alone.

**Extreme Class Imbalance Handling** - Techniques for dealing with datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the other (43.4:1 in this case).
*Why needed:* NIPT anomaly detection typically involves rare events requiring specialized handling to avoid bias toward majority class.
*Quick check:* Validate that performance metrics are appropriate for imbalanced datasets (e.g., sensitivity over accuracy).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> MPF Fusion Layer (NB:0.8 + DT:0.2) -> Adaptive Thresholding -> Clinical Constraints -> Output

**Critical Path:** The fusion layer combining Naive Bayes and Decision Tree with medical knowledge-guided weights represents the critical path, as it directly determines both diagnostic performance and interpretability outcomes.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The primary tradeoff involves the weighting between Naive Bayes (0.8) and Decision Tree (0.2), where increasing the Decision Tree weight would improve interpretability but potentially reduce sensitivity. The adaptive thresholding introduces another tradeoff between strict medical constraint adherence and optimal diagnostic performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation is likely when medical knowledge-guided weights become misaligned with the underlying data distribution, or when adaptive thresholding is too restrictive, causing loss of diagnostic sensitivity. The extreme class imbalance also makes the system vulnerable to overfitting on the minority class.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate fusion weight sensitivity by testing alternative weight combinations (e.g., NB:0.6/DT:0.4, NB:0.9/DT:0.1)
2. Test adaptive thresholding impact by comparing fixed versus adaptive threshold approaches
3. Evaluate individual algorithm performance (standalone NB and DT) as baseline comparisons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Clinical deployment claims require detailed validation framework specification for Grade A criteria designation
- Large effect size (d = 1.24) may be influenced by extreme class imbalance, affecting generalizability
- The 80% interpretability score measurement methodology needs clarification and standardized metrics

## Confidence
**High confidence:** The fusion methodology combining Naive Bayes and Decision Tree with medical knowledge-guided weights is technically sound with well-described mathematical framework and concrete 89.3% sensitivity result.
**Medium confidence:** The interpretability score of 80% is a key claim but requires clarification on exact measurement methodology and validation process.
**Low confidence:** The claim of being "the first clinically-deployable solution" requires broader literature review to confirm novelty in the medical machine learning domain.

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent NIPT datasets from multiple clinical centers to verify robustness across different populations and testing conditions, particularly given the extreme class imbalance in the current dataset.
2. Implementation of the interpretability score calculation in open-source frameworks to enable replication and verification of the 80% interpretability claim across different clinical contexts.
3. Prospective clinical trial comparing MPF against current clinical decision support systems in actual prenatal care settings to validate the claimed Grade A deployment criteria and measure real-world impact on diagnostic workflows.
