# Estimating the Error of Large Language Models at Pairwise Text Comparison

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.22219
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22219
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces a method to estimate LLM error rates at pairwise text comparison without ground truth using Copeland scoring and curve fitting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method to estimate the error rates of large language models (LLMs) when comparing pairs of text without requiring ground truth labels. The approach leverages pairwise comparisons with either uniform error or binary positional bias, analyzing the resulting outcomes through Copeland ranking to estimate error rates. Experiments across six different LLMs and five text types reveal consistent error estimates, with Claude demonstrating the best performance and robustness to prompt variations. The method outperforms alternative approaches like biased Bradley-Terry models and commutativity scores in indicating LLM error rates.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting pairwise comparison data from LLMs, where each pair of texts is compared multiple times with varying presentation order. For uniform error estimation, each pair is compared twice with swapped order, while positional bias estimation involves multiple comparisons in a specified sequence. The outcomes are aggregated into matrices and analyzed using Copeland scoring, which computes a score for each text based on its comparison outcomes. The deviation of observed Copeland scores from an ideal sequence is then used to estimate error rates through curve fitting via grid search.

## Key Results
- The method successfully estimates LLM error rates ranging from approximately 13-30% across different models and text types
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently showed the lowest error rates, demonstrating robustness to prompt variations
- The approach outperforms biased Bradley-Terry models and commutativity scores as an indicator of LLM error
- Poor scalability of LLM-based pairwise comparisons was observed, with error estimates becoming less reliable as dataset size increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the relationship between LLM inconsistency in pairwise comparisons and the resulting deviation in aggregated rankings. When LLMs make errors in comparisons, the Copeland scores deviate from a perfect sequence. By systematically varying the number of texts compared and analyzing how the deviation changes, the method can back-calculate the underlying error rate. The curve fitting process matches the observed deviation pattern against simulated patterns at different error rates, finding the best fit to estimate the actual error rate.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Copeland's Method
- **Why needed here:** It's the core aggregation algorithm that converts many pairwise comparisons into a single ranked list of all items
- **Quick check question:** If item A wins 3 comparisons, loses 2, and ties 1, what is its Copeland score? (Answer: It depends on the scoring system, but typically Wins - Losses)

### Concept: Positional Bias in LLMs
- **Why needed here:** It's the primary non-uniform error source being modeled - LLMs might prefer the first or second option presented regardless of content
- **Quick check question:** In a "Text 1 vs. Text 2" prompt, an LLM shows a strong preference for the first option. If the prompt is swapped to "Text 2 vs. Text 1," what would a model without positional bias do? (Answer: Consistently pick the superior text)

### Concept: Curve Fitting via Grid Search
- **Why needed here:** This is the parameter estimation technique - we simulate many possible outcomes at different error rates and find the best match to our real data
- **Quick check question:** You have an observed ΔS value of 500 for N=20. You run simulations for ε=0.1 and get ΔS=200, and for ε=0.2 you get ΔS=600. Would your best estimate for ε be closer to 0.1 or 0.2? (Answer: Closer to 0.2)

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input texts -> Pairwise comparison module -> Matrix construction -> Copeland scoring -> ΔS calculation -> Grid search parameter estimation -> Error rate output

### Critical Path
The accuracy of the error estimate is critically dependent on the data collection phase. If the pairwise comparison data is not generated according to the prescribed methods (swapping order, repeated trials), the subsequent Copeland scoring and curve fitting will produce invalid results.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Accuracy vs. Cost:** Positional bias estimation requires more LLM calls (repeated comparisons) than uniform error estimation, increasing cost but providing a more detailed error model
- **Assumed Simplicity vs. Real-world Complexity:** The model assumes uniform or binary positional bias, but real LLM errors might be more complex
- **Fitting Method:** Grid search is used for its transparency and robustness, though more sophisticated optimization methods could be faster

### Failure Signatures
- **High Error Estimates on Meaningless Text:** The method should yield error rates closer to 0.5 (random chance) for texts with no objective quality
- **Inconsistent Estimates:** Wildly inconsistent estimates from cross-validation subsets suggest the error model is flawed for that LLM
- **Biased BT Model Converges to Extremes:** If the alternative Bradley-Terry model frequently outputs 0 or 0.5, it indicates it is not a reliable estimator

### First 3 Experiments
1. **Validate the Core Mechanism:** Replicate with N=10 texts, comparing a high-error and low-error LLM to confirm the method distinguishes between them
2. **Scalability Test:** Run with increasing N (10, 20, 40, 80) on the same LLM to confirm the ΔS-N curve follows the predicted pattern
3. **Sensitivity to Prompting:** Re-run with "prompt variants" to observe how the estimated error rate changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does incorporating a "no preference" option for the LLM improve the characterization of binary positional bias?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state this might help further study binary positional bias, which are not significantly separated in current results
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology forces a binary choice, potentially masking uncertainty or conflating lack of preference with random error
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified experimental setup allowing neutral output, analyzed for statistically distinct estimates of forward and reverse positional biases

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the specific temporal sequence of comparisons influence error rates independently of aggregate counts?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper assumes sequence K breaks down to counts k+ and k-, but notes there might be another positional factor regarding its place in the comparison series
- **Why unresolved:** The current estimation method averages results over the sequence, potentially ignoring order effects within the repeated comparison series
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparison of error estimates from fixed counts arranged in different temporal sequences

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can soliciting reasoning or using few-shot prompts significantly reduce error rates in pairwise text comparisons?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors used zero-shot prompts without reasoning and suggest these might help reduce LLM error
- **Why unresolved:** It's unclear if observed errors are intrinsic to models' preferences or a byproduct of the zero-shot prompting strategy
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of estimated error rates between zero-shot approach and prompts requiring Chain-of-Thought reasoning

## Limitations
- The method assumes uniform or binary positional bias, which may not capture more complex real-world LLM error patterns
- Exact reproducibility may be challenging due to unspecified curve fitting metrics and potential model versioning issues
- The approach requires a large number of LLM calls, making it expensive and potentially impractical for large-scale applications

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core mechanism (Copeland scoring + curve fitting) is sound | High |
| Method correctly distinguishes between high-error and low-error LLMs | High |
| Scalability limitations and performance differences are well-supported | Medium |
| Exact numerical error estimates may vary with implementation details | Medium |
| Generalizability to more complex bias patterns is uncertain | Low |

## Next Checks

1. **Validate the Core Mechanism:** Replicate the experiment on a small scale (N=10) with a known high-error and low-error LLM. Confirm the method correctly distinguishes between them and that the estimated error rate is intuitive.

2. **Scalability Test:** Run the experiment with increasing N (e.g., N=10, 20, 40, 80) on the same LLM and text type. Confirm the ΔS-N curve follows the predicted pattern and the estimated error rate remains stable.

3. **Sensitivity to Prompting:** Re-run a single condition (e.g., one LLM, one text type) using the "prompt variants" described in the paper. Observe how the estimated error rate changes, demonstrating sensitivity to prompt variations.
