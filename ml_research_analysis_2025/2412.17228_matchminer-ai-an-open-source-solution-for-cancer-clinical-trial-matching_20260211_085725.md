# MatchMiner-AI: An Open-Source Solution for Cancer Clinical Trial Matching

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.17228
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17228
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Key result**: Open-source clinical trial matching system trained on synthetic EHR data, achieving 90% relevant match rate (vs 17% baseline) for enrolled patients

## Executive Summary
MatchMiner-AI is an open-source clinical trial matching system that uses synthetic electronic health record data to avoid privacy risks while maintaining high matching accuracy. The system extracts core clinical criteria from trial eligibility and patient records, embedding them in a shared vector space for comparison. When evaluated on real-world cancer patient data, it significantly outperformed baseline text-embedding approaches, with 90% of top 20 recommendations being relevant matches for enrolled patients compared to only 17% for the baseline.

The system employs custom text classifiers to assess clinical reasonableness of patient-trial pairings, achieving strong performance metrics including AUROC scores of 0.94-0.98 and mean average precision of approximately 0.90. By training entirely on synthetic data while maintaining privacy, MatchMiner-AI provides a shareable, reproducible approach to AI-based clinical trial matching that can be deployed across healthcare institutions without data sharing concerns.

## Method Summary
MatchMiner-AI uses a pipeline that extracts core clinical criteria from both trial eligibility requirements and patient electronic health records. These criteria are embedded into a shared vector space, enabling comparison between patient characteristics and trial requirements. The system employs custom text classification models to evaluate whether patient-trial pairings are clinically reasonable considerations. All models were trained exclusively on synthetic EHR data to avoid privacy risks while maintaining the ability to capture relevant clinical patterns. The system provides top-20 trial recommendations for each patient, with clinical relevance assessed through comparison against actual patient enrollment data and standard care patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieved 90% relevant match rate for enrolled patients in top 20 recommendations (vs 17% baseline)
- Reached 88% relevant match rate for patients on standard care (vs 14% baseline)
- Demonstrated strong classification performance with AUROC scores of 0.94-0.98 and MAP ~0.90

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MatchMiner-AI works by creating a shared vector space where both clinical trial eligibility criteria and patient EHR data can be compared directly. The system extracts discrete clinical features from unstructured text, converts them into numerical embeddings, and uses learned similarity metrics to identify matching patterns. Custom text classifiers then filter and rank these matches based on clinical reasonableness, ensuring that recommendations are not just statistically similar but also clinically appropriate for consideration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation**: Why needed - avoids privacy risks while enabling model training; Quick check - validate synthetic data preserves key clinical distributions
- **Vector embedding of clinical criteria**: Why needed - enables quantitative comparison of unstructured clinical text; Quick check - verify embedding captures clinically meaningful similarities
- **Text classification for clinical reasonableness**: Why needed - ensures matches are clinically appropriate, not just statistically similar; Quick check - confirm classifier accuracy on clinically validated test sets
- **Multi-modal clinical feature extraction**: Why needed - captures diverse data types (diagnoses, treatments, biomarkers); Quick check - validate coverage across different clinical domains
- **Privacy-preserving AI training**: Why needed - enables sharing and reproducibility without exposing patient data; Quick check - verify no patient identifiers remain in synthetic data
- **Clinical trial eligibility parsing**: Why needed - converts complex eligibility criteria into machine-readable format; Quick check - ensure parsing captures all inclusion/exclusion criteria accurately

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Ingestion -> Feature Extraction -> Vector Embedding -> Text Classification -> Ranking & Recommendation

**Critical Path**: Clinical Trial Criteria + Patient EHR Data -> Feature Extraction -> Vector Embedding Comparison -> Clinical Reasonableness Classification -> Ranked Recommendations

**Design Tradeoffs**: Trained on synthetic data for privacy (limits real-world variability) vs. using real data (privacy risks); Custom classifiers for accuracy (requires more training) vs. off-the-shelf embeddings (faster but less precise); Single-institution validation (controlled but limited generalizability) vs. multi-center deployment (more representative but complex).

**Failure Signatures**: Poor matching performance when clinical documentation quality varies significantly; System may miss rare cancer types not well-represented in training data; Text classification errors when eligibility criteria use non-standard terminology.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test system performance on synthetic data with known ground truth to establish baseline accuracy
2. Evaluate classification performance on holdout synthetic dataset with varying complexity levels
3. Run end-to-end matching on small set of real patient records to assess real-world performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic training data may not fully capture real clinical record complexity and variability
- Single-institution evaluation limits generalizability across different healthcare systems
- Focus on breast and lung cancer patients may limit applicability to other cancer types

## Confidence

**High confidence**: System's ability to significantly outperform baseline methods with clear performance metrics (AUROC 0.94-0.98, MAP ~0.90)

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability across different cancer types and healthcare institutions due to single-institution evaluation and limited cancer type scope

**Low confidence**: Long-term real-world deployment effectiveness and user acceptance without extended clinical workflow integration testing

## Next Checks
1. **External Validation**: Test MatchMiner-AI on patient data from multiple independent cancer centers with diverse EHR systems to assess cross-institutional performance and identify institution-specific biases.

2. **Real-Time Clinical Integration**: Deploy the system in active clinical trial matching workflows and measure time-to-match, clinician satisfaction, and impact on trial enrollment rates compared to traditional matching methods.

3. **Comprehensive Cancer Type Coverage**: Evaluate the system's performance across a broader range of cancer types, including rare cancers, to identify any systematic weaknesses in handling diverse clinical criteria and treatment histories.
