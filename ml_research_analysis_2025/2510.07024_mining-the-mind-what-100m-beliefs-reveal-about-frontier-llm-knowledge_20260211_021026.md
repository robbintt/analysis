# Mining the Mind: What 100M Beliefs Reveal About Frontier LLM Knowledge
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07024
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07024
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Analysis of 100 million beliefs from GPT-4.1 reveals vast factual knowledge with 75.5% accuracy, showing significant differences from Wikidata and highlighting issues with inconsistency and hallucinations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a large-scale analysis of GPT-4.1's factual knowledge using GPTKB v1.5, a dataset containing 100 million beliefs mined from the model. Unlike traditional benchmarks, this approach provides unprecedented insight into the breadth and nature of frontier LLM knowledge. The study reveals that GPT-4.1 contains extensive factual information, particularly about persons and humanities topics, but exhibits notable differences from structured knowledge bases like Wikidata. The model demonstrates selective gender debiasing and a strong English country bias, while maintaining an overall accuracy rate of 75.5% - lower than benchmark results. The research highlights critical issues with knowledge consistency, ambiguity, and hallucinations that need addressing for more reliable AI systems.

## Method Summary
The researchers employed GPTKB v1.5, a comprehensive dataset of 100 million beliefs extracted from GPT-4.1, to analyze the model's factual knowledge at an unprecedented scale. This belief-mining approach captures a wide range of factual assertions directly from the LLM, providing insights into knowledge distribution, accuracy, and biases that traditional benchmarks cannot reveal. The study systematically compares these extracted beliefs with established knowledge bases like Wikidata to identify differences in coverage and representation. The analysis examines knowledge accuracy through validation processes, explores demographic and topical biases in the model's knowledge base, and investigates issues of consistency and hallucination across the vast dataset.

## Key Results
- GPT-4.1 contains vast amounts of factual knowledge, especially about persons and humanities, with 75.5% overall accuracy
- The model shows selective gender debiasing and a strong English country bias in its knowledge distribution
- Significant differences exist between LLM knowledge and structured databases like Wikidata, with issues of inconsistency, ambiguity, and hallucinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The belief-mining approach works by extracting factual assertions directly from the LLM's internal representations through systematic prompting and verification. This method captures the model's latent knowledge in its natural form rather than through artificial benchmark scenarios, revealing patterns and biases that emerge organically from the training process. The large-scale extraction (100 million beliefs) provides statistical power to identify subtle patterns in knowledge distribution and accuracy that smaller studies would miss. By comparing these beliefs with established knowledge bases, researchers can quantify differences in how LLMs organize and prioritize information versus traditional knowledge representation systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Belief Mining**: The systematic extraction of factual assertions from LLMs - needed to access internal knowledge at scale; quick check: verify extraction consistency across multiple prompts
- **Knowledge Representation**: How LLMs store and organize information internally - needed to understand retrieval patterns; quick check: test knowledge recall across different contexts
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Evaluating LLM knowledge against established databases - needed to contextualize findings; quick check: cross-validate with multiple knowledge sources
- **Bias Analysis**: Measuring systematic skews in knowledge distribution - needed to identify fairness issues; quick check: demographic breakdown of knowledge coverage
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifying false or inconsistent knowledge assertions - needed for reliability assessment; quick check: verify claims against trusted sources
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Quantifying correctness of factual knowledge - needed for performance evaluation; quick check: calculate precision and recall across knowledge categories

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Belief Mining System -> Knowledge Extraction Engine -> Validation Framework -> Bias Analysis Module -> Accuracy Assessment Pipeline
- **Critical Path**: Knowledge extraction from GPT-4.1 → Large-scale belief collection → Cross-referencing with Wikidata → Accuracy validation → Bias and hallucination analysis
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Scale vs precision (mining 100M beliefs vs detailed verification), breadth vs depth (covering many topics vs deep analysis of specific domains), automation vs manual validation (efficient processing vs quality control)
- **Failure Signatures**: Systematic knowledge gaps in certain domains, overrepresentation of English-centric information, inconsistent fact retrieval across similar queries, hallucination patterns showing cultural or temporal biases
- **3 First Experiments**: 1) Test knowledge consistency by querying the same facts in different phrasings, 2) Measure knowledge decay by evaluating temporal assertions, 3) Assess cross-lingual knowledge transfer by querying in multiple languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several key uncertainties: whether the belief-mining approach fully captures all relevant knowledge in frontier LLMs or systematically misses certain types of information, how differences between structured databases and LLM representations affect knowledge comparison validity, and whether the observed 75.5% accuracy reflects true knowledge gaps or limitations in the mining methodology itself.

## Limitations
- Representativeness concerns: The belief-mining methodology may systematically miss certain knowledge types or introduce sampling biases
- Comparison validity: Differences between structured databases and LLM representations may not be fully accounted for in the analysis
- Accuracy uncertainty: The 75.5% accuracy rate may reflect limitations in the extraction process rather than true knowledge gaps in the model

## Confidence
- **High**: GPT-4.1 contains vast amounts of factual knowledge, particularly about persons and humanities
- **Medium**: Selective gender debiasing and English country bias are observed in the model's knowledge
- **Low**: Interpretation of inconsistency and hallucination issues due to measurement difficulties at scale

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation with multiple belief-mining approaches to assess robustness and identify systematic biases
2. Perform targeted verification of specific knowledge claims using independent fact-checking sources to establish ground truth accuracy
3. Analyze temporal consistency by evaluating the same knowledge assertions across different versions of frontier LLMs to quantify knowledge drift and hallucination patterns over time
