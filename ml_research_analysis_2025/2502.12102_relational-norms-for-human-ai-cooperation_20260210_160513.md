- Framework extends Relational Norms model to analyze human-AI cooperation through four functions: care, transaction, hierarchy, and mating

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding human-AI relationships by extending the Relational Norms model to analyze how cooperative functions apply differently in human-AI interactions. The framework identifies four key relational functions—care, transaction, hierarchy, and mating—and examines how AI systems can fulfill these roles given their distinctive characteristics such as lack of conscious experience and immunity to fatigue. The authors argue that understanding these relational norms is essential for designing ethical AI systems that are trustworthy and beneficial while avoiding potential harms like unrealistic expectations or unhealthy dependencies.

## Method Summary
The authors develop their framework through theoretical analysis and philosophical reasoning, extending existing Relational Norms theory to human-AI interactions. They examine how AI's unique properties—such as the ability to simulate emotions, constant availability, and lack of fatigue—affect its capacity to participate in different types of relationships. The analysis considers both the advantages AI systems may offer in certain relational roles (consistency, reliability) and the potential risks they pose (creating problematic expectations, fostering dependencies). The framework is presented as a conceptual tool for understanding and governing human-AI relationships rather than an empirically validated model.

## Key Results
- AI systems can fulfill certain relational roles more effectively than humans in terms of constant availability and consistency
- Four cooperative functions (care, transaction, hierarchy, mating) apply differently to human-AI relationships compared to human-human relationships
- Understanding relational norms is crucial for designing AI systems that are ethical, trustworthy, and beneficial to human well-being
- Potential harms include unrealistic expectations and unhealthy dependencies that could spill over into human-human relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically applying established relational norms theory to the unique context of human-AI interactions, identifying where AI's distinctive properties create opportunities and challenges for different types of relationships. The mechanism relies on mapping AI's technical capabilities (constant availability, emotional simulation, consistency) onto traditional relationship functions to predict how these interactions might unfold and what ethical considerations arise.

## Foundational Learning
- Relational Norms Theory: A framework for understanding how different types of relationships are governed by distinct rules and expectations
  - Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for analyzing human-AI relationships systematically
  - Quick check: Can identify how care, transaction, hierarchy, and mating functions operate in human-human contexts
- AI Distinctive Properties: Lack of conscious experience, immunity to fatigue, ability to simulate emotions, constant availability
  - Why needed: Explains why AI can fulfill certain relational roles differently than humans
  - Quick check: Compare AI capabilities against human limitations in relationship contexts
- Ethical Design Principles: Guidelines for creating AI systems that are trustworthy and beneficial while avoiding harm
  - Why needed: Translates theoretical understanding into practical AI development guidelines
  - Quick check: Evaluate AI design choices against identified ethical risks and benefits

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Relational Norms Theory -> AI Distinctive Properties -> Ethical Design Principles -> Human-AI Cooperation Framework
- Critical Path: Identify relationship functions → Analyze AI capabilities → Predict relationship dynamics → Design ethical guidelines
- Design Tradeoffs: Balancing AI's advantages (consistency, availability) against risks (unrealistic expectations, dependencies)
- Failure Signatures: Over-reliance on AI for emotional support, confusion about AI's limitations, spillover effects into human relationships
- First Experiments: 1) Survey users about expectations from AI relationships, 2) Test dependency patterns across different AI applications, 3) Measure spillover effects into human-human relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Assumes AI can meaningfully participate in relational functions without conscious experience, which remains philosophically contested
- Doesn't adequately address cultural variations in how relational norms manifest or evolve with AI integration
- Limited empirical evidence for how humans actually form expectations and dependencies around AI systems versus human partners

## Confidence
- AI can fulfill certain relational roles more effectively than humans in terms of constant availability and consistency: High
- AI capabilities might create problematic expectations and dependencies: Medium
- Understanding relational norms is crucial for ethical AI design: High
- Empirical validation of framework predictions: Low

## Next Checks
- Test framework predictions against real-world human-AI relationship data
- Investigate cultural variations in relational norms with AI systems
- Examine long-term psychological effects of AI-human relationships
- Develop empirical methods to measure dependency and spillover effects
