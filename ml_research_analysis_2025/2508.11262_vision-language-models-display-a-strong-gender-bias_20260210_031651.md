## Executive Summary
This study evaluates gender bias in vision-language models by measuring associations between face images and occupation/activity phrases. Using a balanced dataset of 220 face photos and 150 gender-neutral statements across six labor categories, the method computes cosine similarity differences between male and female image sets for each statement, producing association scores with bootstrap confidence intervals. A null model estimates expected bias under no gender structure. All tested models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14, RN50, RN101) exhibited bias significantly above chance levels, with statements like "firefighter" and "CEO" showing stronger male associations while "nurse" and "therapist" showed stronger female associations.

## Method Summary
The method uses pre-trained CLIP encoders to compute gender associations by measuring cosine similarity differences between face images and occupation statements. For each of 150 gender-neutral statements across six labor categories, the system computes mean cosine similarity to 110 male faces and 110 female faces, then calculates the difference. The study uses 220 face photos from the Kaggle Gender Detection dataset and reports bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. A label-swap null model randomly partitions images to establish baseline noise levels, with observed bias ratios above 1.80 indicating significant bias.

## Key Results
- All tested models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14, RN50, RN101) exhibited gender bias ratios of 1.84-2.00
- Statements like "firefighter" and "CEO" showed stronger male associations
- "Nurse" and "therapist" showed stronger female associations
- Category-level analysis revealed female-leaning associations for emotional, cognitive, and technical labor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Contrastive alignment encodes societal priors as geometric clustering in the shared embedding space.
- **Mechanism:** VLMs trained on web-scale data where specific occupations and gendered imagery co-occur frequently (e.g., "CEO" and male images), the contrastive learning objective minimizes the angular distance between these vectors.
- **Core assumption:** The geometric proximity in the embedding space corresponds to semantic or stereotypical association strength derived from training data.
- **Evidence anchors:** Introduction notes models "carry forward... patterns present in large-scale web data." Data Matters Most: Auditing Social Bias... confirms that training data composition is a primary driver of bias in contrastive VLMs.
- **Break condition:** If the model were trained on a perfectly counter-balanced dataset where occupational co-occurrence was independent of gender, the geometric clustering by gender would theoretically dissolve.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Differential cosine similarity acts as a reliable proxy for measuring implicit bias.
- **Mechanism:** By L2-normalizing embeddings, the method reduces the association problem to vector geometry (dot products). The Bias(s) metric calculates the gap between mean similarities ($S_m - S_f$).
- **Core assumption:** Mean cosine similarity across a binary-partitioned image gallery captures systemic bias rather than individual image noise.
- **Evidence anchors:** Methodology 2.3 defines the bias score equation explicitly using dot products on unit vectors. Measuring Social Bias in Vision-Language Models... validates the use of real-face counterfactuals and similarity metrics for bias attribution.
- **Break condition:** If embeddings are not unit-normed, magnitude variations could distort the angular relationship, invalidating the simple dot-product logic.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Label-swap null modeling distinguishes structural bias from random embedding variance.
- **Mechanism:** The paper uses a null model where gender labels are randomly shuffled to compute a "bias baseline" expected by chance.
- **Core assumption:** Randomly partitioning the image gallery destroys the gender-specific structural signal while preserving general image statistics.
- **Evidence anchors:** Results (Table 3) show Observed/Null ratios > 1.80 for all models. Corpus evidence for this specific null method is weak; related papers generally focus on benchmark performance or debiasing techniques rather than null calibration methods.
- **Break condition:** If the face gallery is too small or not diverse enough, the null model might fail to capture the true range of random variance, leading to false positives.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Contrastive Learning Objective (CLIP-style)
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how image-text pairs are pulled together and non-pairs pushed apart explains why gendered clusters form around occupational text.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model learn to classify images directly, or to align image and text vectors in a shared space?

- **Concept:** Unit-Norm Vectors & Cosine Similarity
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's math relies entirely on vectors having a magnitude of 1, making "similarity" purely a function of the angle between vectors.
  - **Quick check question:** If a vector has a magnitude of 2, can you still calculate its cosine similarity with a simple dot product?

- **Concept:** Bootstrap Resampling
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses this to generate confidence intervals (CIs), asserting that the bias is not a fluke.
  - **Quick check question:** Why resample with replacement from the image gallery rather than just collecting more images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Face Gallery + Text Dataset -> Dual-stream encoder (ViT/ResNet + Transformer) -> L2-normalized embeddings -> Similarity Matrices -> Bias Score -> Bootstrap CIs + Null Model

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocessing images (crop/resize) to match encoder requirements
  2. Generating text embeddings using neutral templates to minimize prompt engineering variance
  3. Aggregating statement-level scores into category-level means

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Binary Gender: The study acknowledges a limitation to "perceived binary gender" for simplicity and statistical power, sacrificing nuance for clear signal detection
  - Template Averaging: Reduces sensitivity to specific phrasing but may dilute specific semantic edges of occupational terms

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Null Ratio ≈ 1: If Observed/Null ratio drops to ~1, the pipeline is detecting only noise
  - Confidence Interval Straddles 0: Indicates no statistically significant gender association for that category
  - Template Sensitivity: If changing "A person..." to "Someone..." flips the bias sign, the measurement is unstable

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Null Run): Run the label-swap null model on your specific encoder to establish the baseline noise floor before testing real data
  2. Architecture Comparison: Compare a CNN (RN50) vs. a Transformer (ViT-B/32) on the same dataset to verify the paper's finding that transformers exhibit slightly higher bias magnitudes
  3. Category Stability: Test if the "Emotional Labor" category consistently leans female across different random seeds of the bootstrap resample to validate robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do gender bias patterns manifest across non-binary gender identities and intersectional demographic dimensions (e.g., race, age, disability) in vision-language embedding spaces?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state: "Although our main experiments use a binary gender partition, the method extends to other demographic dimensions when balanced and ethically sourced probe sets are available."
- **Why unresolved:** The study deliberately restricts analysis to perceived binary gender due to dataset constraints, leaving other demographic dimensions unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of the same bias measurement framework to datasets with non-binary gender labels and intersectional demographic annotations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the observed bias differences between transformer-based (ViT) and convolutional (ResNet) architectures stem from architectural inductive biases, training data interactions, or embedding space geometry?
- **Basis in paper:** Results show ViT models exhibit higher bias ratios (1.95-2.00) than ResNet models (1.84-1.85), but the paper does not investigate the mechanistic causes of this difference.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper reports architectural differences but does not include ablation studies or analyses isolating architectural factors from pretraining data effects.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments comparing architectures trained on identical datasets, or probing analyses examining embedding space structure differences.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent do the measured associations reflect direct replication of training corpus statistics versus amplification or emergence through contrastive learning?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note that learned associations "align with real-world occupational gender imbalances" but do not disentangle whether models merely reflect versus amplify societal biases.
- **Why unresolved:** The methodology measures bias magnitudes relative to a null model but does not compare against ground-truth training data statistics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic comparison between model association scores and occupational gender ratios in pretraining corpora (e.g., LAION, CommonCrawl).

## Limitations

- Binary gender framing limits applicability to non-binary or nuanced gender identities
- Unknown exact stimulus set (150 statements inferred from examples, not fully specified)
- Limited face gallery diversity (Kaggle dataset may not represent global demographics)

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Models exhibit statistically significant gender bias above null levels (Observed/Null ratios 1.84-2.00)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific statement-level associations (firefighter/CEO male-leaning; nurse/therapist female-leaning) based on example data
- **Low confidence**: Category-level interpretations (emotional labor female-leaning) due to potential aggregation artifacts

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the label-swap null model with your specific encoder to verify the baseline noise floor matches the reported ~0.19-0.21 mean absolute bias
2. Test statement sensitivity by systematically varying neutral templates ("A person performing {x}" vs alternatives) to confirm measurement stability
3. Compare binary vs multi-category gender approaches on a subset to quantify information loss from binary simplification
