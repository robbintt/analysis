# Knowledge Distillation and Dataset Distillation of Large Language Models: Emerging Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14772
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14772
- Reference count: 33
- This survey comprehensively examines Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD) as complementary approaches for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities and linguistic diversity.

## Executive Summary
This survey examines Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD) as complementary methods for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities and linguistic diversity. KD transfers knowledge from large teacher models to smaller students through output alignment and intermediate representation matching, while DD synthesizes compact training datasets that retain essential information. The integration of these methods addresses critical challenges in model scalability, computational efficiency, and data sustainability. Key applications span healthcare (clinical decision support, medical summarization), education (automated assessment, real-time feedback), and bioinformatics (protein representation, drug discovery). Despite substantial progress, open challenges remain in preserving emergent reasoning abilities, adapting to evolving models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation protocols.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD) for LLM compression. KD involves training a smaller student model using a combination of hard ground-truth labels and soft labels from a larger teacher model, typically through a weighted loss function combining cross-entropy and KL divergence. The temperature parameter controls the softness of the probability distribution, revealing inter-class relationships. Dataset Distillation synthesizes compact training datasets by optimizing synthetic samples to align with the training dynamics of the full dataset through gradient matching. The survey categorizes various KD methodologies including logit matching, hidden state alignment, and rationale-based approaches, while examining DD techniques ranging from gradient matching to trajectory matching.

## Key Results
- KD and DD serve complementary roles in LLM compression, with KD transferring teacher knowledge and DD reducing data requirements
- Applications span critical domains including healthcare (clinical decision support, medical summarization), education (automated assessment, real-time feedback), and bioinformatics (protein representation, drug discovery)
- Open challenges include preserving emergent reasoning abilities, adapting to evolving models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation protocols
- Integration of KD and DD principles offers theoretical pathways toward sustainable, resource-efficient LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dark Knowledge Regularization via Soft Labels
If a student model is trained on the softened probability distributions (soft labels) of a teacher rather than hard ground-truth labels, it may inherit the teacher's generalization patterns and uncertainty estimates. The teacher's output logits, adjusted by a temperature parameter, reveal inter-class relationships (e.g., distinguishing a "cat" from a "dog" vs. a "truck"). This "dark knowledge" acts as a regularizer, smoothing the student's learning landscape and reducing variance. The core assumption is that the teacher model has successfully encoded robust, transferable relationships between data classes that the student is capable of modeling. Break condition: If the temperature parameter τ is set too high, the distribution becomes uniform and uninformative; if too low, it resembles hard labels and loses the benefit.

### Mechanism 2: Rationale-Based Knowledge Transfer
Transferring the intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) of a teacher to a student, rather than just input-output pairs, appears to enhance the student's reasoning capabilities and interpretability. By training the student to maximize the joint probability of the rationale and the answer P(r, y|x), the student is forced to internalize the causal path or logic chain (Chain-of-Thought) leading to the answer, rather than learning surface-level correlations. The core assumption is that the teacher's generated rationales are high-quality, accurate, and consistent with the ground truth. Break condition: If the teacher produces hallucinated or flawed reasoning chains, the student will amplify these errors.

### Mechanism 3: Dataset Distillation via Gradient Matching
It is possible to condense a massive dataset into a much smaller synthetic set by optimizing the synthetic samples to align with the training dynamics of the full dataset. The synthetic data is iteratively updated to minimize the distance between the gradients it induces on the model and the gradients induced by the real data (∇θtL(Ds) ≈ ∇θtL(Dr)). This ensures the model learns similar parameter updates using only the synthetic subset. The core assumption is that the essential information of the full dataset can be compressed into a lower-dimensional representation or subset without losing critical decision boundaries. Break condition: If the synthetic dataset is too small or the optimization overfits to specific gradient steps, the model may fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**
  - Why needed here: This is the primary loss function used to measure the difference between the teacher's soft probability distribution and the student's distribution.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why minimizing KL divergence effectively forces the student model to respect the ranking of incorrect classes provided by the teacher?

- **Temperature Scaling (τ)**
  - Why needed here: Temperature controls the "softness" of the probability distribution. A higher temperature reveals more information about the similarity between negative classes.
  - Quick check question: If the temperature τ → ∞, what happens to the probability distribution, and how does that affect the distillation signal?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Modern KD for LLMs often focuses on transferring reasoning abilities (Rationale-Based KD) rather than just classification accuracy.
  - Quick check question: How does training on the sequence of reasoning steps differ mathematically from training solely on the final token prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Teacher Model (LLM) -> Distillation Interface (Logits/Hidden States/Rationales) -> Distillation Loss (Weighted sum of CE and KL) -> Student Model (smaller LLM) -> Dataset Distiller (Optional, for DD)
- **Critical path:** The design of the loss function (balancing ground truth vs. teacher guidance) and the data pipeline (real vs. synthetic/distilled). Section 2.1.1 emphasizes balancing α in the loss equation.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  * Black-box vs. White-box: White-box allows access to internal states/attention (richer transfer), while black-box (API) only allows output/logit distillation.
  * Capacity Gap: If the student model is too small relative to the teacher, it cannot mimic the teacher's complexity (Section 3.7). Intermediate "Teacher Assistants" might be needed.
  * Computational Cost: Dataset Distillation (DD) is computationally expensive upfront to synthesize data but saves costs later during student training (Section 4.1).
- **Failure signatures:**
  * Regression in Reasoning: Student gets the answer right but for the wrong reasons (failing to capture rationale).
  * Hallucination Propagation: Student inherits or amplifies the teacher's factual errors (Section 7.1.7).
  * Semantic Drift (DD): Synthetic data becomes unrealistic or loses linguistic diversity (Section 4.2).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Establishment: Train a student model using standard Hard Labels vs. a student trained with Soft Labels (KD) on a benchmark like GLUE. Measure performance retention relative to the teacher.
  2. Rationale Impact: Compare a student trained on Input-Output pairs only vs. a student trained on Input-Rationale-Output (Rationale-Based KD) on a reasoning task (e.g., GSM8K).
  3. Dataset Efficiency: Implement a simple gradient-matching dataset distillation algorithm. Train a student on the distilled dataset (e.g., 1% of data) and compare its convergence speed and accuracy against a student trained on the full dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can incremental Knowledge Distillation (KD) effectively integrate newly emergent abilities (e.g., long-form reasoning) into an existing student model without reprocessing the original training set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 states: "A pressing practical research question is how to develop incremental KD that effectively integrates newly emergent abilities... into an existing student model without reprocessing the original training set."
- Why unresolved: Teacher models are frequently updated via fine-tuning or RLHF, making repeated full distillation cycles computationally prohibitive.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where a student trained on a 2024 teacher is updated using only 2025 data, measuring retention on benchmarks like MMLU (old knowledge) and adaptation on BIG-Bench Lite tasks (new capabilities).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can learning objectives be designed to collectively maximize efficiency, fairness, and predictive performance in distillation without degenerating into trivial solutions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 states: "A key open question is how to set learning objectives that collectively maximize efficiency, fairness, and predictive performance without degenerating into insignificant solutions."
- Why unresolved: Distillation losses currently optimize for aggregate performance or compression, often ignoring fairness constraints or amplifying biases, particularly for minority groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of multi-objective optimization strategies that successfully balance parameter compression against group-wise error gaps, validated on benchmarks measuring demographic parity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What alignment metrics can best quantify the fidelity of transferred reasoning steps when teacher and student architectures diverge significantly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 asks: "First, what alignment metrics best quantify fidelity of transferred reasoning steps when teacher and student architectures diverge...?"
- Why unresolved: Traditional metrics like logit matching fail when inductive biases differ (e.g., Transformers vs. non-autoregressive models), and students may lack the structural capacity to absorb teacher patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed metric that correlates strongly with downstream reasoning performance (e.g., on GSM8K) for heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, independent of architectural similarity.

## Limitations

- The integration mechanisms between KD and DD remain largely theoretical with concrete implementation pathways not established
- Evaluation protocols for KD effectiveness vary significantly across studies, making comparative assessment difficult
- The survey acknowledges but cannot fully address the "emergent property" problem regarding whether compressed models truly retain reasoning capabilities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The fundamental mechanics of KD (soft labels, KL divergence, temperature scaling) and their mathematical formulations are well-established and consistently reported across the literature
- **Medium Confidence:** The survey's categorization of KD/DD challenges and applications across domains (healthcare, education, bioinformatics) reflects the current research landscape but may overemphasize early-stage work
- **Low Confidence:** The proposed future directions for integrating KD and DD, while theoretically sound, lack empirical validation in the survey itself

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative KD Performance Validation:** Implement the baseline KD experiment comparing student models trained with hard labels versus soft labels on a standard benchmark (e.g., GLUE). Measure whether students achieve the claimed 95% teacher performance threshold and analyze the relationship between capacity gap and performance retention.

2. **Synthetic Dataset Quality Assessment:** Generate a distilled dataset using gradient matching on a subset of GLUE data. Train students on both the full dataset and the distilled dataset, measuring convergence speed, final accuracy, and out-of-distribution generalization to validate whether essential information is preserved.

3. **Reasoning Capability Transfer Experiment:** Design a controlled experiment comparing students trained on input-output pairs versus students trained on input-rationale-output sequences on a reasoning benchmark like GSM8K. Quantify whether rationale-based KD produces measurable improvements in logical reasoning versus pattern matching.
