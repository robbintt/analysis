# Training Deep Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23501
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RGA KANs outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets by several orders of magnitude on nine PDE benchmarks while remaining stable where others diverge.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the instability and poor convergence of deep Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in physics-informed learning, particularly in solving partial differential equations. The authors propose two key contributions: a basis-agnostic Glorot-like initialization scheme for KANs that improves stability and accuracy, and a Residual-Gated Adaptive KAN (RGA KAN) architecture inspired by PirateNets that mitigates training divergence in deep networks. Through extensive experiments on nine forward PDE benchmarks, RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets—often by several orders of magnitude—while remaining stable where others diverge. Ablation studies confirm that the proposed initialization and adaptive training components are essential for achieving these gains. Overall, the work establishes a robust, scalable framework for deep KANs in physics-informed machine learning.

## Method Summary
The method combines a variance-preserving Glorot-like initialization scheme for KANs with a Residual-Gated Adaptive (RGA) architecture. The initialization derives conditions to maintain activation variance across layers based on basis function moments, preventing exploding or vanishing gradients. The RGA architecture uses adaptive skip connections governed by trainable gates, allowing the network to dynamically modulate its effective depth during training. The approach employs an adaptive training pipeline including RBA, RAD, Causal Training, and LRA, along with physics-informed least-squares initialization for output layers when initial conditions exist.

## Key Results
- RGA KANs achieve 1-3 orders of magnitude lower L2 error than cPIKANs and PirateNets across nine PDE benchmarks
- The Glorot-like initialization significantly improves stability and accuracy compared to default KAN initialization
- RGA KANs successfully train deep networks (up to 12 layers) where cPIKANs diverge, particularly on challenging Allen-Cahn and Burgers' equations
- Ablation studies confirm both the initialization and RGA architecture are essential for the observed improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Variance-Preserving Initialization
- **Claim:** A basis-agnostic Glorot-like initialization scheme preserves activation variance across layers, preventing exploding or vanishing gradients in deep Chebyshev-based Physics-Informed KANs.
- **Mechanism:** The standard initialization for Chebyshev KANs is ad-hoc. The authors derive a variance-preserving rule that accounts for the moments of specific basis functions and layer dimensions, ensuring stable signal-to-noise ratio during training.
- **Core assumption:** Inputs are i.i.d. samples with zero mean and unit variance at initialization.
- **Evidence:** Proposed initialization achieves lower training loss and L2 error on function fitting and PDE benchmarks compared to default.

### Mechanism 2: Residual-Gated Adaptive Architecture
- **Claim:** RGA blocks allow dynamic modulation of effective network depth during training, mitigating linear regime divergence typical of deep networks.
- **Mechanism:** Deep KANs suffer from derivative approximations behaving like linear networks at initialization. RGA blocks use adaptive skip connections governed by trainable parameters, allowing the network to start shallow and progressively deepen.
- **Core assumption:** Instability stems from network derivative behavior at initialization, similar to MLP-based PirateNet analysis.
- **Evidence:** RGA KANs reach diffusion equilibrium while cPIKANs stagnate, showing distinct transition to diffusion equilibrium with sharp error drop.

### Mechanism 3: Information Bottleneck Phase Progression
- **Claim:** RGA KANs enable training dynamics to successfully traverse all IB phases (fitting → diffusion → diffusion equilibrium), whereas baseline cPIKANs stagnate in the diffusion phase.
- **Mechanism:** The IB framework posits generalization occurs in diffusion equilibrium phase. RGA KANs, likely due to stabilization from gating and initialization, show distinct transition to diffusion equilibrium, characterized by sharp error drop and structured residuals.
- **Core assumption:** Learning trajectory follows Information Bottleneck phases described for PINNs/PIKANs.
- **Evidence:** Explicit analysis through IB theory shows RGA KANs reach diffusion equilibrium while cPIKANs do not.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation vs. Universal Approximation
  - **Why needed here:** The paper pivots from MLPs (Universal Approximation) to KANs (Kolmogorov-Arnold). You must understand that KANs place learnable activation functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a KAN layer has O(d_H² D L) parameters compared to an MLP's O(d_H² L)?

- **Concept:** Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) Loss Balancing
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes familiarity with composite loss function (L_pde, L_bc, L_ic). The instability addressed often stems from imbalances between these competing residuals.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the "linear regime" derivative approximation make training the PDE residual particularly difficult in deep networks?

- **Concept:** Spectral Bias & Information Bottleneck (IB)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses IB theory to explain why the RGA architecture works. Understanding spectral bias helps contextualize why deep networks need help generalizing to high-frequency PDE components.
  - **Quick check question:** What characterizes the "diffusion equilibrium" phase in training physics-informed networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. BC Embedding: Enforces periodic boundary conditions directly
  2. Sine KAN Layer: Replaces Random Fourier Features; uses sine basis with trainable frequency/phase
  3. Gates (U, V): Two Chebyshev KAN layers that define gating vector for residual connections
  4. RGA Blocks: Core deepening unit using α and β to mix gate outputs with block input
  5. Output Layer: Physics-informed initialization (least squares) to match initial conditions

- **Critical path:** Initialization of gating parameters α and β is most critical hyperparameter. (α, β) = (0, 0) starts effectively shallow; (α, β) = (1, 0) or (1, 1) starts at full depth with stabilization.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Capacity vs. Cost: RGA KANs have 1.5x-2x higher computational overhead per iteration due to basis function evaluation and gating mechanisms
  - Depth vs. Stability: RGA allows depth scaling (up to 12 layers) where cPIKANs diverge, but gains diminish for very deep/wide networks on simple tasks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Divergence: Rapidly increasing Geometric Complexity and oscillating/unstable SNR early in training
  - Stagnation: SNR fails to rise to plateau; network remains in diffusion phase with semi-structured residuals
  - Residual Pattern: Residuals mirroring reference solution (indicating failure to generalize beyond initial condition)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Basis Initialization Check: Replicate small-scale experiment on 2D function fitting task to verify variance stability of proposed Glorot-like init vs default
  2. Depth Scaling Stress Test: Train on Allen-Cahn or Burgers' equation with 8-12 hidden layers. Compare cPIKAN (diverges) vs RGA KAN (converges)
  3. Ablation on Gates: Vary α and β initialization on Helmholtz or Poisson equation to determine if problem benefits from "shallow-to-deep" training (0,0) or "deep-with-stabilization" (1,1)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the RGA KAN architecture be effectively extended to operator learning frameworks?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion identifies extension to operator learning as a "particularly promising direction"
  - **Why unresolved:** Study focused exclusively on solving single PDE instances, not learning mappings between function spaces
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful training of DeepOKAN-like architectures on operator learning benchmarks with comparable stability gains

- **Question:** Does the proposed basis-agnostic initialization scheme improve training dynamics for non-Chebyshev KAN variants, such as B-splines?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion notes initialization's basis-agnostic nature suggests "potential applications to KAN variants using other bases"
  - **Why unresolved:** Empirical validation was restricted to Chebyshev-based and sine-based KANs
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks showing variance preservation and convergence improvements in vanilla (B-spline) or RBF-based KANs

- **Question:** Do the stability benefits of RGA KANs generalize to alternative representations of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, like ActNets?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion suggests testing the architecture using alternative representations such as ActNets or KKANs
  - **Why unresolved:** RGA architecture was developed for specific formulation; compatibility with other structures is unknown
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments demonstrating residual gating mitigates divergence in ActNet or KKAN backbones

## Limitations

- The core claims rest on a specific interpretation of training dynamics via the Information Bottleneck framework, which is not universally accepted in the deep learning community
- The computational overhead (1.5x-2x slower per iteration) and memory requirements for deep RGA KANs may limit practical deployment for large-scale problems
- The reliance on specific adaptive training components makes it difficult to isolate the architectural contribution of RGA blocks versus training procedures

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The improved initialization scheme's variance preservation mechanism is mathematically rigorous and validated across multiple function fitting and PDE benchmarks. The RGA architecture's ability to stabilize training where cPIKANs diverge is consistently demonstrated across nine PDE benchmarks.

**Medium Confidence:** The Information Bottleneck phase analysis explaining why RGA works is compelling but depends on the specific interpretation of IB theory in the PINN context. The claim that RGA KANs reach "diffusion equilibrium" while cPIKANs do not is supported by data but requires deeper theoretical justification.

**Low Confidence:** The relative importance of each adaptive training component (RBA, RAD, Causal Training, LRA) in enabling RGA success is not systematically isolated, making it unclear which components are essential versus beneficial.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Basis Function Validation:** Implement the proposed initialization scheme for a different basis family (e.g., Legendre or wavelet) and verify that the variance preservation mechanism holds. This tests whether the derivation is truly basis-agnostic or specifically tuned to Chebyshev properties.

2. **Component Ablation Study:** Systematically disable each adaptive training component (RBA, RAD, Causal Training, LRA) in the RGA KAN pipeline and measure the impact on convergence for 2-3 representative PDEs. This would clarify which components are essential for the architecture to work versus which are beneficial but not critical.

3. **Transfer to Time-Dependent Multi-Physics Problems:** Apply the RGA KAN framework to a coupled system of PDEs (e.g., Navier-Stokes with heat transfer or fluid-structure interaction) to test whether the stability gains transfer beyond single-equation problems. This would validate the framework's robustness for practical engineering applications.
