- Primary result: Proposes framework to evaluate LLM sensitivity to Chinese island constraints in topic constructions

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an experimental framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on Chinese topic constructions, focusing on their sensitivity to island constraints. Drawing inspiration from Tian et al. (2024), the study aims to assess whether LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMA can process Mandarin topic structures in ways consistent with human grammatical judgments. The experimental design involves acceptability judgment tasks and continuation tasks using materials that replicate human judgment experiments. While no experiments have been conducted yet, the proposal suggests that larger, instruction-tuned models may demonstrate human-like syntactic competence, whereas smaller models might show weaker alignment with linguistic constraints.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology involves testing LLMs using factorial experimental designs that cross Topicalization (present/absent) with Island Context (present/absent) to detect interaction effects indicative of island constraint sensitivity. The study plans to use acceptability judgment tasks where models rate sentences on a 7-point Likert scale, as well as continuation tasks where models complete topicalized sentence fragments. Materials will be adapted from Tian et al.'s (2024) human experiments, testing both gapped and gapless topic constructions across different island types (relative clause and adjunct islands). The target models include GPT-4, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and LLaMA 3.2, with anticipated performance differences based on model scale and instruction-tuning.

## Key Results
- Proposes factorial experimental design to test LLM sensitivity to Chinese island constraints
- Anticipates larger, instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) will show better alignment with human judgments than smaller models like LLaMA
- Highlights methodological challenges including prompt sensitivity and distinguishing syntactic from semantic errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Island constraint sensitivity can serve as a diagnostic for whether LLMs have internalized movement-based syntactic representations versus surface pattern matching.
- Mechanism: Factorial experimental design crosses Topicalization (present/absent) × Island Context (present/absent). An interaction effect—where acceptability drops more sharply when topicalization occurs within an island than in non-island contexts—indicates sensitivity to syntactic constraints rather than general degradation effects.
- Core assumption: LLMs that have acquired human-like syntactic competence will show the same Topicalization × Island interaction pattern that Tian et al. (2024) observed in native Mandarin speakers (e.g., ~6.8 vs ~1.1 acceptability ratings for grammatical vs. island-violating sentences).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Both gapped and gapless Chinese topic constructions are derived by syntactic movement, contra earlier base-generation accounts.
- Mechanism: Assumption: Movement leaves traces subject to island constraints; base-generation does not. If gapless topics (traditionally thought to be base-generated) still show island sensitivity, this supports uniform movement analysis.
- Core assumption: Island effects are a reliable signature of syntactic movement operations across construction types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model scale and instruction-tuning correlate with alignment to human syntactic judgments on rare or subtle constructions.
- Mechanism: Assumption: Larger models trained on more diverse corpora with instruction-following fine-tuning better approximate human grammatical intuition, particularly for low-frequency syntactic phenomena like island violations.
- Core assumption: Scale and instruction-tuning causally improve implicit acquisition of syntactic constraints, not just surface fluency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Topic-prominent languages**: Mandarin places topic (discourse-old information) sentence-initially, with comment following. Understanding this typological difference from subject-prominent languages (English) is prerequisite for grasping why Chinese permits constructions like "Shuǐguo, wǒ xǐhuān píngguo" ("Fruit, I like apples") that would be ungrammatical in English.
  - Quick check: In "Shuǐguo, wǒ bù xǐhuān __" ("Fruit, I don't like __"), what is the structural relationship between the topic and the gap position?

- **Island constraints (Ross, 1967)**: Islands are syntactic domains from which extraction is blocked (e.g., relative clauses, adjunct clauses). The entire experimental design tests whether Chinese topics obey these constraints, which would indicate movement-derived structure.
  - Quick check: Why is *"The banana which I believe [the claim that John ate __]*" unacceptable in English? What syntactic domain blocks extraction here?

- **Acceptability judgment tasks**: The proposed methodology relies on eliciting grammaticality ratings (1-7 scale) from LLMs, mirroring human psycholinguistic experiments. Understanding factorial design and interaction effects is essential for interpreting whether models show true island sensitivity.
  - Quick check: In a 2×2 design crossing Topicalization and Island, what pattern of results would indicate a true island constraint effect versus a general acceptability degradation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Experimental materials → Acceptability judgment prompts → LLM outputs → Rating extraction → Statistical analysis → Interaction effect computation
- **Critical path**: 1. Construct/adapt sentence materials from Tian et al.'s published items (ensure coverage of complex NP islands, adjunct islands) → 2. Design prompts for acceptability ratings (critical: control for prompt framing effects) → 3. Run multiple trials per condition per model (address response variability) → 4. Extract ratings, compute interaction effects, compare to human judgments → 5. Analyze continuations for grammatical repair strategies
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prompt sensitivity vs. standardization (open-ended prompts may yield more naturalistic responses but introduce variability; highly structured prompts may constrain model behavior artificially); Binary grammaticality vs. gradient acceptability (LLMs may struggle with fine-grained 7-point scales; consider alternative elicitation methods); Distinguishing syntactic vs. semantic errors (model rejections could reflect semantic plausibility rather than syntactic constraint)
- **Failure signatures**: Models produce consistent ratings across all conditions (no differentiation) → suggests lack of syntactic constraint acquisition; Models reject island-violating sentences but also reject grammatical controls → indicates overly conservative judgment threshold; High variance across trials within same model/condition → prompts may be under-specified; Continuations produce valid but structurally divergent completions → requires manual annotation
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline acceptability judgment: Present 20 sentences (5 per condition in 2×2 design) to each model with standardized prompt; extract numeric ratings; compute interaction effect size. Compare to Tian et al.'s human baseline (~5.7 point differential for gapped topics). 2. Prompt robustness check: Re-run acceptability task with 3 prompt variants (direct rating, comparison to reference sentence, explanation-then-rating) to assess sensitivity to framing. 3. Continuation task pilot: Provide sentence fragments with topicalization + island configuration; code whether model completions (a) respect constraint, (b) use resumptive pronoun repair, or (c) produce island violation. Quantify repair strategy distribution across models.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do LLMs exhibit knowledge of Chinese topic constructions and their island (in)sensitivities akin to human speakers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "This raises the question: Do LLMs exhibit knowledge of Chinese topic constructions and their island (in)sensitivities akin to human speakers?" (Page 2)
- Why unresolved: No experiments have been conducted yet; this is the central question the proposed study aims to answer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing LLM acceptability judgments on island-violating vs. non-violating topic constructions against human judgment data from Tian et al. (2024).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do all varieties of gapless topic constructions uniformly show island sensitivity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "It remains an open question whether all varieties of gapless topics uniformly show island sensitivity. It's possible that some pragmatically licensed dangling topics behave differently." (Page 5)
- Why unresolved: Tian et al. (2024) focused only on part–whole/genus–species relationships; other semantic/pragmatic contexts remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending acceptability judgment experiments to include cause-effect topics, anaphorically-linked topics, and other gapless subtypes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can researchers reliably distinguish between syntactic and semantic errors in LLM outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Listed as a key challenge: "the need to distinguish between syntactic and semantic errors in model outputs." (Page 7)
- Why unresolved: LLMs lack explicit grammar modules, and outputs may reflect surface pattern matching rather than true syntactic competence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing targeted diagnostic tasks that isolate syntactic violations from semantic implausibility.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Do larger models exhibit implicit knowledge of rare syntactic patterns or simply interpolate from seen examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Examining the role of model size... could shed light on whether larger models exhibit implicit knowledge of rare syntactic patterns or simply interpolate from seen examples." (Page 7)
- Why unresolved: Current evaluations cannot distinguish generalization from memorization or surface-level pattern completion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing model performance on novel, carefully controlled minimal pairs with varying training data exposure.

## Limitations
- No empirical experiments have been conducted yet; all hypotheses remain untested predictions
- Prompt sensitivity presents major uncertainty—LLM responses may vary dramatically based on prompt formulation
- Distinguishing genuine syntactic constraint sensitivity from semantic plausibility judgments remains methodologically challenging

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework (island constraints as diagnostic for syntactic competence, factorial design methodology) is well-established in linguistics and psycholinguistics
- **Medium confidence**: The hypothesis that larger, instruction-tuned models will better approximate human judgments—supported by general trends in LLM research but not specifically tested for Chinese syntactic phenomena
- **Low confidence**: Specific quantitative predictions about model performance (e.g., exact ratings or interaction effect sizes) and the assumption that models will reliably produce numerical acceptability ratings when prompted

## Next Checks
1. **Pilot test prompt sensitivity**: Run acceptability judgment tasks with three prompt variants (direct rating, comparison-based, explanation-then-rating) on 5-10 sentences to identify which framing yields most consistent responses across models
2. **Construct human baseline replication**: Independently verify Tian et al.'s (2024) human judgment data with a small sample (n=10-15) using identical materials to ensure reproducibility of the island constraint effects before comparing to LLM outputs
3. **Semantic control validation**: Include semantically anomalous but syntactically well-formed sentences in pilot materials to test whether models can distinguish genuine syntactic violations from semantic implausibility
