# Balanced Training Data Augmentation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09485
- Reference count: 28
- This paper addresses ABSA challenges in social media contexts through balanced data augmentation using LLMs with reinforcement learning quality control.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the persistent challenges in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) when dealing with social media content, where short texts, limited training data, and unbalanced label distributions significantly impair model performance. The authors propose a balanced training data augmentation approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, creating a more balanced dataset for training ABSA models. To ensure the quality of augmented data, they implement a reinforcement learning approach with a reward function that evaluates sentiment consistency and topic relevance. Experimental results on four English benchmark datasets demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance compared to strong baselines and most existing studies, with particular improvements in F1 scores.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach addresses ABSA challenges through a two-phase process: first, using an LLM to generate synthetic training data to balance underrepresented sentiment classes; second, applying reinforcement learning with a reward function that assesses sentiment consistency and topic relevance to filter and refine the augmented data. This creates a more balanced training distribution while maintaining high-quality annotations. The method specifically targets the common issues in social media ABSA where short texts and limited data lead to poor model generalization, particularly for minority sentiment classes.

## Key Results
- Superior performance over strong baselines and most existing studies on four English benchmark datasets (LAP14, REST14, REST15, REST16)
- Significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores, with particular gains in F1 score
- Demonstrates the value of quality augmented data and balanced label distributions in improving ABSA performance
- Effective addressing of challenges posed by short texts and limited training data in social media contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing the fundamental data imbalance problem in ABSA through synthetic data generation. LLMs can understand context and generate diverse examples that capture nuanced sentiment expressions, while the reinforcement learning component ensures that generated examples maintain semantic consistency with their intended aspects and sentiment labels. The balanced sampling strategy directly addresses the class imbalance issue that typically degrades model performance on minority classes, leading to more robust and generalizable ABSA models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Why needed - to extract fine-grained sentiment at the aspect level rather than document level; Quick check - can identify sentiment toward specific features in product reviews
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Data Augmentation**: Why needed - to generate diverse, contextually appropriate synthetic examples; Quick check - can produce realistic text that maintains aspect-sentiment relationships
- **Reinforcement Learning for Quality Control**: Why needed - to filter low-quality or inconsistent augmented data; Quick check - reward function evaluates sentiment consistency and topic relevance
- **Class Imbalance in Machine Learning**: Why needed - imbalanced datasets cause models to bias toward majority classes; Quick check - minority class performance metrics improve significantly
- **Benchmark Datasets for ABSA**: Why needed - standardized evaluation across research studies; Quick check - LAP14, REST14, REST15, REST16 are widely used in ABSA research

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM Data Generation -> Reinforcement Learning Quality Control -> Balanced Training Dataset -> ABSA Model Training -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
The critical path follows the data augmentation pipeline: LLM generates synthetic examples → RL reward function filters and refines examples → balanced dataset created → ABSA model trained on balanced data → evaluation on benchmark datasets. Each stage must complete successfully for the next to proceed.

Design Tradeoffs:
The approach trades computational cost (LLM generation + RL training) for improved model performance and generalization. Using automated reward functions for quality control avoids human annotation costs but may miss subtle quality issues. The focus on English benchmarks limits immediate applicability to other languages but provides strong evidence within the target domain.

Failure Signatures:
Poor performance may indicate: LLM generating off-topic or sentiment-inconsistent examples; reward function inadequately capturing quality dimensions; insufficient diversity in generated data; or the ABSA model architecture being incompatible with augmented data patterns.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Generate synthetic data for minority classes only and measure impact on class-specific F1 scores
2. Vary the reward function weights for sentiment consistency versus topic relevance to find optimal balance
3. Test with different ABSA model architectures (transformer-based vs traditional) to assess architecture compatibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow focus on English-language datasets limits generalizability to other languages and domains
- Computational cost of LLM-based augmentation and reinforcement learning not addressed
- Lack of human evaluation to validate automated quality control mechanisms
- Exact ABSA model architecture and hyperparameters not fully specified
- Effectiveness in extremely low-resource scenarios not explicitly tested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Experimental results showing performance improvements on the four benchmark datasets are well-supported and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about superior performance over "most existing studies" are based on limited baseline comparisons and may not hold across all ABSA research
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability claims to other domains, languages, or extreme low-resource scenarios lack supporting evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments on non-English datasets (e.g., multilingual ABSA datasets) and cross-lingual transfer tasks to assess language generalization
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of balanced sampling versus LLM augmentation quality, and test with different ABSA model architectures
3. Execute human evaluation studies on a sample of augmented data to validate the automated quality control mechanisms and assess real-world applicability
