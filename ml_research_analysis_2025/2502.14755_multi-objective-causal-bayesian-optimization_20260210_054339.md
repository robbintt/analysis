# Multi-Objective Causal Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.14755
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14755
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** Introduces MO-CBO framework reducing search space to polynomial size via graph-theoretic POMIS characterization.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces multi-objective causal Bayesian optimization (MO-CBO) as a new class of optimization problems that extend causal Bayesian optimization to settings with multiple target variables. The method leverages known causal structures to identify Pareto-optimal intervention strategies. The key contribution is a theoretical framework that characterizes which intervention sets are potentially optimal, allowing the search space to be reduced from exponential to polynomial size. An algorithm called CAUSAL PARETO SELECT is proposed that balances exploration across local optimization problems using relative hypervolume improvement.

## Method Summary
The method reduces the search space to possibly Pareto-optimal minimal intervention sets (POMIS) via interventional borders, then decomposes the problem into independent local multi-objective optimization tasks. Each local problem uses Gaussian process surrogates and DGEMO-style diversity-constrained batch selection. The algorithm balances exploration across local problems using relative hypervolume improvement (RHVI), selecting intervention sets that maximize the ratio of hypervolume improvement to current front hypervolume. The final Pareto front aggregates non-dominated solutions across all local problems.

## Key Results
- Theoretical reduction of search space from exponential to polynomial size via POMIS characterization
- CAUSAL PARETO SELECT identifies more diverse and cost-effective solutions than non-causal MOBO baselines
- Method particularly effective in settings with unobserved confounders where traditional approaches fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The search space of intervention sets can be provably reduced to a minimal subset without losing optimal solutions.
- Mechanism: The paper defines "possibly Pareto-optimal minimal intervention sets" (POMIS) via graph-theoretic criteria—specifically, the interventional border of the minimal unobserved confounders' territory. Theorem 4.8 establishes that Xs is a POMIS if and only if IB(G_{Xs}, Y) = Xs. This leverages do-calculus rules to identify when intervening on one set is provably no better than intervening on another.
- Core assumption: The causal graph structure ⟨G, Y, X, C⟩ is known and correct; structural equations F and exogenous distributions P(U) may be unknown.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "reduces the search space to possibly Pareto-optimal minimal intervention sets"
  - [Section 4.1]: Theorem 4.8 and Proposition 4.10 prove P^c_f(P(X)) = P^c_f(O_{G,Y})
  - [corpus]: Related work on CBO with unknown graphs (arxiv 2503.19554) suggests graph misspecification is a known failure mode—not addressed here.
- Break condition: If the graph topology is misspecified or edges are missing, the POMIS characterization may exclude truly optimal intervention sets.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Any MO-CBO problem decomposes into a collection of standard multi-objective optimization problems (local MO-CBO problems), one per intervention set.
- Mechanism: Proposition 3.4 proves that the causal Pareto front is contained within the union of local Pareto fronts across all intervention sets in S. Each local problem optimizes over values xs ∈ D(Xs) for a fixed set Xs, which is a conventional MOBO task solvable with existing methods (e.g., DGEMO).
- Core assumption: Intervention sets are discrete and enumerable; objectives μ_i(Xs, ·) are expensive-to-evaluate black-boxes but amenable to GP surrogate modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "decomposes the problem into local optimization tasks"
  - [Section 3.1]: Definition 3.3 and Proposition 3.4 formalize the decomposition
  - [corpus]: Multi-fidelity BO with causal priors (arxiv 2602.00788) suggests decomposition strategies generalize, but fidelity trade-offs are orthogonal to this work.
- Break condition: If the number of treatment variables |X| is large, even the reduced set O_{G,Y} may be exponential, making full enumeration impractical.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Relative hypervolume improvement (RHVI) enables balanced, efficient exploration across competing local problems with different scales.
- Mechanism: RHVI normalizes the hypervolume improvement of a candidate batch by the current hypervolume of each local Pareto front (Equation 5). The algorithm selects the batch with maximum RHVI across all local problems (Equation 6), ensuring no single local problem monopolizes samples while still prioritizing promising regions.
- Core assumption: Hypervolume is a meaningful proxy for Pareto-front quality across all objectives; GP posteriors provide reliable uncertainty estimates for computing HVI.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "uses relative hypervolume improvement to balance exploration across tasks"
  - [Section 4.2]: Equation (5) and Equation (6) define RHVI and batch selection
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus comparison of RHVI vs. alternative acquisition strategies; evidence is primarily internal to this paper.
- Break condition: If surrogate models are poorly calibrated (e.g., under high noise or heteroscedasticity), RHVI may misallocate samples toward overconfident local problems.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and do-calculus**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework assumes interventions are modeled as do(Xs = xs), replacing structural equations and modifying the graph. Understanding the difference between observational and interventional distributions is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given a graph X → Y, explain why P(Y|do(X=x)) ≠ P(Y|X=x) when unobserved confounders exist.

- Concept: **Pareto optimality and hypervolume indicator**
  - Why needed here: The method seeks Pareto-optimal trade-offs across multiple objectives and uses hypervolume as the acquisition metric. Without this, the notion of "improvement" in multi-objective space is ambiguous.
  - Quick check question: For two objectives to minimize, sketch a Pareto front and show how adding a point increases hypervolume relative to a reference point.

- Concept: **Gaussian Process surrogates for Bayesian optimization**
  - Why needed here: CAUSAL PARETO SELECT uses independent GPs to model each objective μ_i per local problem. Understanding GP posterior mean/variance is necessary to interpret acquisition function behavior.
  - Quick check question: How does a GP's posterior variance change as more observations are added near a query point?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph analyzer -> POMIS enumeration -> Initialize GPs -> Iterative loop (select batch via RHVI, intervene, update GP, update local fronts) -> Aggregate global Pareto front
- Critical path: Graph input → POMIS enumeration → initialize GPs with prior data → iterative loop (select batch via RHVI, intervene, update GP, update local Pareto fronts) → aggregate global Pareto front
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Independent vs. multi-task GPs: Paper assumes independent outcomes; multi-task GPs could share information across intervention sets but increase complexity.
  - Batch size vs. iteration count: Larger batches improve parallelism but reduce granularity of RHVI-based steering.
  - Reduced set O_{G,Y} vs. full P(X): Reduction saves samples but relies entirely on correct graph structure.
- Failure signatures:
  - RHVI consistently favors one local problem → surrogate miscalibration or highly imbalanced objective scales
  - Final front has poor coverage (high IGD) → insufficient exploration of diversity regions (δ_k constraint may be too tight)
  - Causal Pareto front misses ground-truth points → graph misspecification or POMIS computation error
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate POMIS reduction: On SYNTHETIC-1 (no confounders), confirm O_{G,Y}={{X1,X2}} and that MOBO on full X recovers same front but with more samples.
  2. Test unobserved confounder case: On SYNTHETIC-2, verify that baseline MOBO fails to reach causal Pareto front (Figure 6) while MO-CBO succeeds—trace which intervention sets in O_{G,Y} yield optimal points.
  3. Ablate RHVI: Replace RHVI with random selection of local problems; measure degradation in convergence speed (GD/IGD curves) to isolate the contribution of balanced exploration.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can multi-task Gaussian processes improve surrogate modeling efficiency by capturing shared information across treatment variables?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The Conclusion states that the current surrogate model assumes independent outcomes, which "may limit efficiency since it overlooks shared endogenous confounders," and suggests multi-task GPs as a solution.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation fits independent Gaussian processes for each objective, failing to leverage potential correlations or shared structures between treatment variables that could accelerate convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons demonstrating that multi-task surrogates achieve higher hypervolume improvements with fewer interventions than the current independent GP approach in graphs with known shared confounders.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Dynamic CBO be adapted to handle time-varying causal models within the multi-objective framework?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The Conclusion identifies the adaptation of existing CBO variants, specifically Dynamic CBO, to the multi-objective case as a direction for future research to handle "time-dynamic causal models."
- Why unresolved: The proposed MO-CBO methodology assumes a static structural causal model and graph topology, lacking mechanisms to update beliefs or intervention sets as the underlying causal system evolves over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the MO-CBO algorithm incorporating time-indexed variables and experimental validation on simulated or real-world datasets where causal mechanisms drift over time.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the decomposition into local problems mitigate the computational intractability of hypervolume calculation in high-dimensional objective spaces?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] The paper relies heavily on hypervolume improvement (Eq. 5) for acquisition. While the method reduces the search space of intervention sets, hypervolume calculation itself scales exponentially with the number of objectives $m$, a limitation not addressed in the experiments which use only $m=2$.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "local" optimization structure allows for approximations or decompositions of the hypervolume that remain tractable as the number of target variables increases significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical benchmarks measuring computational overhead and optimization quality as the number of target variables scales beyond three.

## Limitations

- Method performance critically depends on correctness of causal graph structure; no mechanism for handling graph misspecification
- Number of intervention sets in O_{G,Y} can still be exponential in number of treatment variables, limiting scalability
- No empirical validation of method's performance on problems with more than two target variables

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework for POMIS characterization and decomposition into local MO-CBO problems are well-established and proven
- **Medium confidence**: RHVI-based exploration strategy is effective, but performance relative to alternative acquisition strategies not thoroughly validated
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results demonstrate advantage over non-causal baselines, but limited to specific cases without extensive sensitivity analysis

## Next Checks

1. **Graph misspecification test**: Systematically perturb the causal graph structure and measure degradation in final Pareto front quality to quantify robustness to structural errors
2. **Scalability evaluation**: Test the algorithm on larger causal graphs (10+ treatment variables) to empirically measure how the O_{G,Y} reduction impacts computational feasibility
3. **RHVI ablation study**: Compare RHVI against uniform sampling of local problems and other multi-armed bandit acquisition strategies to isolate the contribution of balanced exploration
