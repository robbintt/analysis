# Improving Social Determinants of Health Documentation in French EHRs Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03433
- Reference count: 40
- French-language Flan-T5-Large model extracts 13 SDoH categories from clinical notes, identifying 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH versus 2.8% using ICD-10 codes

## Executive Summary
This study developed a French-language large language model to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) from clinical notes in electronic health records. The Flan-T5-Large model was trained on manually annotated social history sections from a French university hospital and evaluated across four datasets. The approach achieved strong performance for well-documented SDoH categories, dramatically improving detection compared to ICD-10 coding alone. The work addresses the critical gap in SDoH documentation in French EHR systems, where structured codes capture only a small fraction of relevant information.

## Method Summary
The researchers trained a Flan-T5-Large model on manually annotated social history sections from a French university hospital. The model was designed to extract 13 SDoH categories including living conditions, marital status, employment, education, housing, and lifestyle factors like tobacco and alcohol use. Training data consisted of social history sections from clinical notes, with annotations covering 13 predefined SDoH categories. The model was evaluated on four datasets, including two publicly released, using standard NLP metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. Performance was compared against ICD-10 coded data as a baseline.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1 scores above 0.80 for well-documented categories: living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol
- Identified 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH compared to only 2.8% using structured ICD-10 codes
- Lower performance for categories with limited data or variable expressions: employment status (F1: 0.62), housing (F1: 0.45), education (F1: 0.71)
- Strong performance for tobacco and alcohol extraction (F1: 0.91 and 0.83 respectively) despite variable documentation patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model leverages transformer-based architecture trained on domain-specific French clinical text to identify SDoH mentions. The approach works by learning contextual patterns in social history sections where SDoH information is typically documented. Performance is higher for categories with consistent documentation patterns and sufficient training examples, while categories with sparse data or variable expression patterns show reduced accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Social determinants of health (SDoH): Non-medical factors influencing health outcomes; needed to understand what categories to extract and why they matter clinically
- French clinical terminology: Domain-specific vocabulary and expression patterns; needed for accurate tokenization and entity recognition in French EHRs
- Social history section structure: Typical organization and content patterns in clinical notes; needed to identify relevant text segments for SDoH extraction
- ICD-10 coding limitations: Structured coding systems often miss nuanced clinical information; needed to demonstrate improvement over existing approaches
- NLP evaluation metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score; needed to quantitatively assess model performance across different SDoH categories

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input text -> Tokenizer (Flan-T5) -> Transformer layers -> Classification head -> 13 SDoH category outputs

Critical Path:
Text preprocessing -> Tokenization -> Feature extraction through transformer layers -> Classification decision -> Post-processing to structured output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Used pre-trained Flan-T5-Large rather than training from scratch to leverage existing language understanding
- Focused on social history sections rather than full clinical notes to reduce complexity and improve initial performance
- Limited to 13 SDoH categories to maintain manageable annotation burden and ensure sufficient training data per category

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on categories with limited training examples (<100 instances)
- Struggles with ambiguous expressions that could map to multiple SDoH categories
- English-centric tokenization errors for French medical terminology
- Inconsistent performance across different clinical note formats and writing styles

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate model performance on social history sections from different hospitals to assess generalizability
2. Compare performance of French Flan-T5 against English SDoH extraction models fine-tuned on French data
3. Test model on full clinical notes rather than just social history sections to identify domain adaptation needs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Model performance not evaluated on full clinical notes, limiting assessment of real-world applicability
- Annotation inconsistencies, particularly for housing and employment status, may affect model reliability
- English-centric tokenization introduces potential bias for French medical terminology
- Limited training data for certain SDoH categories restricts comprehensive documentation capability

## Confidence
High confidence in performance for well-documented categories (living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, alcohol) with F1 scores above 0.80. Medium confidence in performance for categories with sparse or variable data (employment status, housing, education) due to lower F1 scores and higher variability. The dramatic improvement over ICD-10 codes (95.8% vs 2.8%) is well-supported, but clinical impact remains speculative without outcome data.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model performance on full clinical notes and non-social history sections to assess generalizability
2. Conduct systematic error analysis focusing on French medical terminology and tokenization issues
3. Validate model outputs against external, independently annotated datasets to confirm robustness across different clinical contexts
