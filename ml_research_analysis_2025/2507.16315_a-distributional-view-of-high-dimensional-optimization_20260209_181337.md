# A Distributional View of High Dimensional Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.16315
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16315
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes Random Function Descent (RFD), a first-order optimization method with automatically determined step sizes for high-dimensional isotropic Gaussian random functions, and proves predictable optimization progress in the infinite-dimensional limit.

## Executive Summary
This thesis develops a novel theoretical framework for understanding first-order optimization in high dimensions by treating the objective function as a realization of a Gaussian random function. The key insight is that in high dimensions, the concentration of measure phenomenon causes the optimization trajectory to become deterministic and predictable, converging to a system of deterministic equations. The work introduces Random Function Descent (RFD), an algorithm that automatically determines optimal step sizes by minimizing a conditional expectation (stochastic Taylor approximation) under the Gaussian process prior. The analysis leverages isotropy to reduce the optimization of a high-dimensional step vector to a one-dimensional problem, yielding scale-invariant updates that naturally interpolate between gradient clipping and warmup schedules.

## Method Summary
The method treats the unknown objective as a Gaussian Random Function (GRF) and proposes Random Function Descent (RFD), which computes step sizes by minimizing the conditional expectation of the cost function given current function value and gradient. The step size calculation depends only on the gradient norm, current cost, and kernel parameters (variance and length scale), reducing to a 1D optimization problem. The algorithm is scale-invariant and automatically adapts step sizes throughout training. For practical implementation, kernel parameters are estimated from mini-batch losses using weighted least squares regression, and the algorithm iterates by computing gradients, calculating the optimal step size, and updating parameters using normalized gradient descent.

## Key Results
- Proves that optimization trajectories on isotropic random functions in high dimensions converge to deterministic limits governed by a system of deterministic equations.
- Introduces Random Function Descent (RFD) with automatically determined step sizes that are optimal on average for risk-neutral optimizers.
- Shows that RFD is provably invariant to additive shifts and positive scalings of the objective, addressing a common limitation of classical gradient descent.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Concentration of Measure in High Dimensions
In high dimensions, the optimization trajectory of first-order methods on isotropic random functions becomes deterministic and predictable due to the concentration of measure phenomenon. As dimension $N \to \infty$, random quantities like function values and gradients along the optimization path converge in probability to deterministic limits governed by a system of deterministic equations. This assumes the objective is a realization of an isotropic Gaussian random function with scaled covariance.

### Mechanism 2: Isotropy-Induced Simplicity and Scale Invariance
Assuming (non-stationary) isotropy for the random objective function drastically simplifies the structure of optimal first-order steps and makes the algorithm scale-invariant. Isotropy forces the conditional expectation to depend only on scalar quantities (step norm, current cost, gradient norm), reducing the optimization of a high-dimensional step vector to a one-dimensional problem over the step size. This yields Random Function Descent (RFD) which is provably invariant to additive shifts and positive scalings of the objective.

### Mechanism 3: Stochastic Taylor Approximation for Step-Size Prescription
The optimal step size for a risk-neutral optimizer can be derived by minimizing the conditional expectation of the cost, which acts as a stochastic Taylor approximation naturally incorporating a trust region. Instead of minimizing a deterministic upper bound, RFD minimizes the first-order stochastic Taylor approximation $E[f(x-d) | f(x), \nabla f(x)]$, yielding an explicit, data-dependent step size that interpolates between constant initial plateau and asymptotic constant learning rate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Random Functions (GRFs) / Gaussian Processes (GPs)**: The entire theoretical framework models the unknown objective as a realization of a GRF. All probabilistic predictions are derived from multivariate Gaussian distributions. *Quick check*: Given a GP prior $f \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu, k)$ and noiseless observations $(X_i, f(X_i))$, what is the posterior mean $\mu_*(x)$ and variance $k_*(x, x)$ at a new point $x_*$?

- **Isotropy and Stationarity in Random Functions**: The tractability of the RFD analysis hinges on the isotropy assumption. Understanding the distinction between stationary (invariant to translations) and non-stationary isotropic (invariant to rotations) is crucial for selecting appropriate covariance kernels. *Quick check*: State the definition of a stationary isotropic covariance kernel $C(x, y)$. What does Schoenberg's theorem say about the form of a stationary isotropic kernel on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that is valid in all dimensions $d$?

- **Concentration of Measure**: The central result of predictable progress is a concentration result. As dimension increases, the random optimization trajectory concentrates around a deterministic path, meaning the variance vanishes. *Quick check*: Explain intuitively why the norm of a gradient $\nabla f_N(x)$ of an isotropic GRF $f_N$ in dimension $N$ converges to a constant $\sqrt{-C'(0)}$ as $N \to \infty$, even though the function value $f_N(x)$ itself concentrates to the mean.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Probabilistic Model (Gaussian Process prior) -> Optimization Algorithm (RFD) -> Analysis Framework (Theorems characterizing behavior)
- **Critical path**:
  1. Model Specification: Choose an isotropic covariance kernel family and estimate parameters from initial evaluations
  2. Online Optimization: Observe $f(x_n)$ and $\nabla f(x_n)$, compute gradient-cost quotient
  3. Step-Size Calculation: Plug parameters into kernel-specific formula for $\eta^*$
  4. Iterate: Update $x_{n+1}$ and repeat

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Theoretical rigor vs. Practicality: Strong assumptions (isotropy, Gaussianity) may not hold for real-world objectives
  - Risk-neutrality vs. Robustness: Standard RFD is risk-neutral; Conservative RFD extension available for sensitive applications
  - Computational Cost: RFD has $O(nd)$ cost vs $O(n^3d^3)$ for classical BO, making it scalable but potentially less sample-efficient

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Step sizes too large/unstable: Likely violation of isotropy assumption; consider geometric anisotropy estimation
  - Stagnation at non-critical points: May occur with noisy gradients or in highly non-convex landscapes; try Conservative RFD
  - Poor fit of covariance model: Kernel family may be mismatched to true objective regularity; validate with non-parametric estimation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce predictable progress: Implement RFD on synthetic isotropic GRF in high dimension and verify trajectories coincide
  2. RFD on standard test function: Apply to high-dimensional non-convex benchmark and compare against tuned SGD/Adam
  3. Test Conservative RFD: Implement with high confidence level and compare trajectory and step sizes to risk-neutral RFD

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the predictable progress theorem be proven without the strict positive definiteness assumption on the covariance of $(f_N, \nabla f_N)$, using generalized matrix inverses or perturbation arguments? The existing proof relies on invertibility of limiting covariance matrices, and a direct generalization would require robust theory for non-invertible covariance kernels.

### Open Question 2
Does predictable progress hold for non-Gaussian random functions with finite moments and weaker dependence structures like uncorrelated directional derivatives? The current proof uses Gaussian structure to ensure independence and applicability of standard limit theorems, which may not generalize to non-Gaussian cases.

### Open Question 3
How can the theory be extended to analyze practical stochastic optimization algorithms like Adam with component-wise adaptive learning rates? Adam's update rules involve element-wise operations that introduce strong dependence on dimension $N$, breaking the continuity in dimensionless information required by the main theorem.

## Limitations
- Assumes objective is a realization of an isotropic Gaussian random function, which is difficult to verify and likely violated in practice
- Strong structural assumptions required for theoretical results limit applicability to real-world optimization problems
- Variance estimation procedure requires collecting multiple mini-batch losses, which may be impractical for expensive function evaluations
- Theoretical analysis focuses on infinite-dimensional limit, while practical applications operate in finite dimensions where concentration effects may be weaker

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Mathematical derivations for RFD step sizes and scale invariance property
- **Medium confidence**: Practical value of RFD for step-size automation and stochastic Taylor approximation framework
- **Low confidence**: Predictable progress result for general isotropic GRFs and its applicability to non-synthetic objectives

## Next Checks

2. Validate the Conservative RFD extension: Implement with high confidence level (γ = 0.95) and measure trade-off between robustness and convergence speed
3. Check the variance estimation procedure: Apply WLS regression method to real neural network training task and monitor estimated kernel parameters over training
