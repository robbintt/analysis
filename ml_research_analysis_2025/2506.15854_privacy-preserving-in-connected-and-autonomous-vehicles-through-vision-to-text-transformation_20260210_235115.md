# Privacy-Preserving in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Through Vision to Text Transformation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.15854
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15854
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** RL-VLM framework transforms CAV imagery to text with superior privacy preservation and semantic utility

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses privacy concerns in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by proposing a hierarchical feedback-based RL-VLM framework that transforms visual data into textual descriptions. The method leverages vision-language models, reinforcement learning, and retrieval-augmented generation to iteratively refine descriptions while minimizing exposure of sensitive visual content. The approach achieves strong privacy preservation as measured by SSIM, PSNR, and SRRA metrics on face datasets, while maintaining semantic richness necessary for intelligent transportation systems tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a hierarchical feedback-based RL-VLM framework that iteratively transforms images into privacy-preserving textual descriptions. The process begins with a Vision-Language Model generating initial text from captured images, followed by a PPO-based RL agent that selects prompts from hierarchical lists across three iterations. Each iteration incorporates RAG-based external feedback to validate semantic-privacy alignment. The composite reward function balances semantic similarity (SBERT-based) against visual reconstruction dissimilarity (VAE-based), with external validation scores augmenting the policy learning objective.

## Key Results
- RL-VLM framework outperforms baseline approaches in reducing visual similarity between original and reconstructed images on CFP-FP and AgeDB-30 datasets
- Text quality evaluations show superior semantic richness and lexical diversity compared to baseline models
- Ablation studies demonstrate that RAG feedback significantly improves both privacy preservation and semantic utility
- The approach provides a scalable, adaptive solution for privacy-aware visual data handling in intelligent transportation systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: VLM-Based Privacy Transformation
- **Claim:** Transforming images to text reduces visual privacy leakage while preserving semantic information necessary for traffic monitoring tasks.
- **Mechanism:** A Vision-Language Model generates textual descriptions from captured images using privacy-sensitive supervision. The VLM is fine-tuned with privacy-annotated captions, penalizing outputs that expose PII descriptors. Object extraction identifies scene elements (vehicles, conditions), while transformer attention mechanisms encode visual-linguistic representations that emphasize scene semantics over identity details.
- **Core assumption:** Textual descriptions contain sufficient information for downstream ITS tasks (violation detection, safety assessment) without revealing reconstructable visual identity cues.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states the method "transforms images into textual descriptions using an innovative method while the main scene details are preserved and protects privacy"; section describes leveraging VLM techniques to generate descriptive text that captures necessary information without revealing actual visual content.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical RL Refinement
- **Claim:** Hierarchical reinforcement learning with feedback iteratively improves text quality and privacy preservation beyond single-pass captioning.
- **Mechanism:** PPO-based RL agent selects prompts from hierarchical lists (A→B→C) across three iterations. Each state encodes current text embedding plus privacy score. Actions select prompts; rewards combine SBERT semantic similarity (α weight) with VAE-based reconstruction dissimilarity (β weight). The composite reward R't = Rt + λ·F(st, at) incorporates external RAG feedback, creating dual optimization pressure for semantic richness and privacy.
- **Core assumption:** Iterative refinement with structured feedback converges to descriptions that maximize semantic utility while minimizing visual reconstructability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "A hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text, enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy"; section states the model incorporates an iterative reinforcement-learning cycle with external knowledge feedback which progressively refines privacy-aware text.

### Mechanism 3: RAG-Based External Validation
- **Claim:** RAG-based external feedback corrects RL policy drift and validates semantic-privacy alignment through knowledge retrieval.
- **Mechanism:** RAG operates in parallel with RL, using Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to retrieve contextually relevant documents. The feedback function F(st, at) computes validation scores comparing generated text against retrieved knowledge. This augments the PPO objective: L(θ) = E[rt(θ)At + λ·F(st, at)], where λ balances policy learning against corrective feedback. RAG provides contextual correction without retraining.
- **Core assumption:** External knowledge base contains sufficient domain context to validate whether descriptions expose privacy-sensitive details or miss critical scene information.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract indicates the framework "integrates vision-language models, reinforcement learning, and retrieval-augmented generation to iteratively refine descriptive text"; section explains RAG offers advantages over PPO by dynamically retrieving the most relevant prompts which ensures contextual accuracy without the need for retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core RL algorithm controlling prompt selection. Requires understanding of policy gradients, clipping, and trust region optimization.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why PPO's clipping parameter ε=0.2 prevents destructive policy updates while allowing meaningful learning?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Model Architecture (Transformer attention, cross-modal embeddings)**
  - **Why needed here:** VLM generates text from images. Understanding token embeddings, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and cross-modal alignment is essential for debugging text quality.
  - **Quick check question:** How does scaled dot-product attention compute token importance, and why does the 1/√dk scaling matter?

- **Concept: Semantic Similarity Metrics (SBERT embeddings, cosine similarity)**
  - **Why needed here:** Reward function depends on SBERT-based similarity scores between generated text and ground truth. Understanding sentence embeddings is critical for reward shaping.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would SBERT embeddings outperform token-level BLEU scores for measuring semantic alignment in privacy-preserving descriptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** AIE Camera Input → VLM (Text Generation) → RL Agent (PPO Prompt Selection) → SBERT Encoder → Reward Computation ← RAG Module (MIPS Retrieval) ← Feedback Loop → Hierarchical Prompt Lists (A/B/C) → Refined Text Output

- **Critical path:** VLM text quality → RL prompt selection accuracy → RAG feedback relevance → Iterative convergence. If VLM generates poor initial descriptions, downstream refinement amplifies errors.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - α vs β weights: Higher α improves semantics but may sacrifice privacy; higher β strengthens privacy but risks generic descriptions
  - λ feedback coefficient: High λ accelerates correction but may override learned policy; low λ risks slow convergence
  - Iteration count (set to 3): More iterations increase refinement but add latency—unsuitable for real-time edge deployment
  - DP noise scale σ: Higher noise strengthens formal privacy (lower ε) but degrades BLEU/text quality (Table 5 shows σ=0.3 drops BLEU to 0.756)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - SSIM > 0.90 on reconstructed images → text leaks visual information
  - Semantic similarity < 0.60 → descriptions too generic for ITS utility
  - Unstable At advantage estimates → PPO hyperparameters need tuning (learning rate, clip range)
  - RAG retrieving irrelevant documents → knowledge base incomplete or embedding space misaligned

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run VLM-only (no RL, no RAG) on CFP-FP subset; measure SSIM/PSNR between original and text-to-image reconstructions. Establishes privacy leakage upper bound.
  2. **Ablation on feedback:** Compare full model vs. RL-VLM without RAG on AgeDB-30. Isolate contribution of external feedback using SRRA and unique word count metrics.
  3. **Hyperparameter sweep:** Vary α/β reward weights (α ∈ [0.3, 0.7], β ∈ [0.3, 0.7]) with fixed λ=0.5. Plot privacy-quality Pareto frontier to identify operational sweet spot for deployment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Dynamic prompt generation:** The authors explicitly state in the Conclusion: "For future work, we propose exploring dynamic prompt generation, where the prompt list is adaptively updated at each iteration based on context or feedback." The current framework relies on a static, predefined hierarchical list of prompts, which limits the model's flexibility and personalization capabilities.

- **Real-time processing compatibility:** While the paper targets "AI-Equipped cameras" and "Roadside units" for traffic monitoring, the proposed method requires multiple iterations of VLM processing, RL refinement, and RAG retrieval. The experimental section provides no latency benchmarks or time-complexity analysis to demonstrate compatibility with real-time ITS requirements.

- **Generalization to complex traffic scenes:** The study relies exclusively on face verification datasets (CFP-FP and AgeDB-30) for validation, but the introduction emphasizes the complexity of CAV environments (e.g., vehicle interiors, multiple passengers, external traffic). It is unclear if the SSIM and PSNR improvements hold when the model must describe complex, crowded scenes where "sensitive content" is less isolated than a single face.

## Limitations

- **Unspecified VLM architecture:** The paper does not specify which VLM backbone is used, making exact reproduction impossible and leaving fundamental text generation quality uncertain.

- **Undefined prompt lists and knowledge base:** The content of hierarchical prompt lists (A/B/C) and RAG knowledge base documents remain unspecified, blocking validation of the external feedback mechanism.

- **Privacy metric assumptions:** The privacy metrics assume text-to-image reconstruction as the primary attack vector, but real-world privacy threats may include language model inference attacks on generated text descriptions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The conceptual framework of transforming images to text for privacy preservation in CAVs is sound and well-supported by related work
- **Medium confidence:** The hierarchical RL-VLM architecture and RAG feedback integration appear technically feasible, though direct evidence for this specific combination is limited
- **Low confidence:** Exact implementation details including VLM architecture, prompt list content, and optimal hyperparameter settings cannot be verified without additional specifications

## Next Checks

1. **Reconstruction vulnerability test:** Generate text descriptions from CFP-FP images using the proposed method, then reconstruct images using text-to-image models. Measure SSIM/PSNR to empirically verify that text leakage remains below the 0.90 threshold.

2. **Semantic utility preservation:** Evaluate whether RL-VLM-generated descriptions achieve sufficient semantic similarity (≥0.73) for downstream ITS tasks by testing on a violation detection benchmark using only the textual descriptions.

3. **RAG feedback contribution isolation:** Conduct an ablation study comparing full RL-VLM with RAG against a version without external feedback on AgeDB-30, measuring both privacy metrics and unique word count to quantify RAG's impact on the privacy-semantic tradeoff.
