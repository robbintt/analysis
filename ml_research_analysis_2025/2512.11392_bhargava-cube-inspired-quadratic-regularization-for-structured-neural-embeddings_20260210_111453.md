# Bhargava Cube--Inspired Quadratic Regularization for Structured Neural Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11392
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11392
- Reference count: 32
- Achieves 99.46% MNIST classification accuracy with interpretable 3D algebraic embeddings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BCMEM, which incorporates discriminant-based quadratic constraints from Bhargava cube theory into neural representation learning. The method maps inputs to a 3-dimensional latent space and applies a differentiable loss based on algebraic relationships to guide models toward mathematically structured representations. Evaluated on MNIST, BCMEM achieves 99.46% accuracy while producing interpretable embeddings that naturally cluster by digit class and satisfy learned quadratic constraints.

## Method Summary
BCMEM combines standard classification with an auxiliary quadratic regularization loss. The encoder maps 784-dim inputs to a 3-dim latent space where three parameterized quadratic forms Q₁, Q₂, Q₃ are evaluated. The auxiliary loss computes deviations from Bhargava-type discriminant identities across these forms. The total loss is L_total = L_task + λL_quad, where L_task is cross-entropy and L_quad enforces algebraic consistency. The entire framework is differentiable and compatible with standard gradient-based optimization.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.46% MNIST classification accuracy
- Produces interpretable 3D embeddings with natural class clustering
- Ablation study shows 99.15% → 99.46% improvement when quadratic regularization is added
- Embeddings satisfy learned quadratic constraints as verified by visualization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Discriminant-based quadratic constraints yield better generalization than unconstrained embeddings.
- **Mechanism:** L_quad computes deviations from Bhargava-type discriminant identities, forcing latent codes near algebraic varieties satisfying higher-order polynomial constraints.
- **Core assumption:** Discriminant relation disc(Q₁ ∘ Q₂) ≈ disc(Q₁)·disc(Q₂)·disc(Q₃)² provides useful inductive bias for image classification.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Ablation shows 99.15% → 99.46% improvement when L_quad is added
  - "Minimizing L_quad constrains latent codes to lie near an algebraic variety defined by discriminant identities"
- **Break condition:** If λ is too large, model prioritizes algebraic consistency over task performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Low-dimensional (3D) constrained embeddings produce interpretable class separation without explicit geometric supervision.
- **Mechanism:** Compact bottleneck forces semantically similar inputs to cluster in regions satisfying shared algebraic invariants.
- **Core assumption:** MNIST digit classes share underlying quadratic relationships that align with Bhargava-type constraints.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Visualization shows clean digit class separation in 3D space
  - "producing interpretable 3D embeddings that naturally cluster by digit class"
- **Break condition:** On datasets without inherent algebraic structure, regularization may impose irrelevant constraints.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Differentiable composition of parameterized quadratic forms enables end-to-end gradient-based integration.
- **Mechanism:** Since discriminants are polynomial invariants and composition preserves differentiability, gradients flow through L_quad to both encoder and quadratic form parameters.
- **Core assumption:** Composition operator and discriminant function can be implemented differentiably without numerical instability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "L_quad is smooth in all parameters and in θ...the entire loss is compatible with gradient-based optimization"
  - Standard AdamW optimizer successfully trains the model
- **Break condition:** Near-zero discriminant values may cause gradient instability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Quadratic Forms and Discriminants**
  - **Why needed here:** The regularization framework depends on understanding Q(z) = αz² + βz₁z₂ + ... and how disc(Q) captures algebraic invariants.
  - **Quick check question:** Given Q(z₁, z₂) = z₁² + 3z₁z₂ + 2z₂², compute its discriminant.

- **Concept: Gauss Composition of Binary Quadratic Forms**
  - **Why needed here:** The Bhargava cube generalizes Gauss composition; the loss enforces disc(Q₁ ∘ Q₂) = disc(Q₁)·disc(Q₂)·disc(Q₃)².
  - **Quick check question:** What does the composition operation ∘ combine—coefficients, discriminants, or the forms themselves as functions?

- **Concept: Regularization as Inductive Bias**
  - **Why needed here:** L_total = L_task + λL_quad balances task accuracy against algebraic consistency; understanding this tradeoff is essential for hyperparameter selection.
  - **Quick check question:** If validation loss increases while training loss decreases, what should you adjust—λ, architecture, or learning rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Encoder: 784 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 3 (Linear + SiLU + BatchNorm + Dropout 0.1)
  - Latent bottleneck: 3D space where quadratic forms Q₁, Q₂, Q₃ are evaluated
  - Classifier: 3 → 512 → 512 → 512 → 128 → 64 → 10 (same activation pattern)
  - Auxiliary module: Parameterized (Aₖ, bₖ, cₖ) for k∈{1,2,3}, discriminant computation, composition operator

- **Critical path:**
  1. Flatten 28×28 image to 784-dim vector
  2. Pass through 5-layer encoder to obtain z ∈ ℝ³
  3. Compute Qₖ(z) for each coordinate direction
  4. Evaluate discriminants and composition to compute L_quad
  5. Forward z through classifier for L_task (cross-entropy)
  6. Backpropagate L_total = L_task + λL_quad

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 3D bottleneck: Highly interpretable but may limit capacity for complex datasets
  - λ selection: Too high sacrifices accuracy; too low loses algebraic structure
  - Assumption: Number-theoretic priors generalize beyond MNIST remains untested

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy stuck near random baseline: Check λ magnitude, gradient flow through discriminant computations
  - Embeddings collapse to single point: L_quad may be dominating; reduce λ
  - Training instability: Discriminant values near zero causing gradient explosion; add numerical stabilization
  - No class clustering in 3D viz: Quadratic form parameters may not be learning; verify auxiliary loss is connected

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline comparison:** Train identical architecture with λ=0 vs. λ>0. Verify 99.15% → 99.46% improvement reproduces. Plot 3D embeddings for both.
  2. **λ sensitivity sweep:** Test λ ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0} with 3 seeds each. Identify where accuracy peaks and where it degrades.
  3. **Cross-dataset probe:** Apply to Fashion-MNIST with identical hyperparameters. Check if accuracy drops significantly or embeddings lose structure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does BCMEM's algebraic regularization provide meaningful benefits on complex, real-world datasets beyond MNIST?
- Can the Bhargava-inspired constraints scale beyond 3-dimensional latent spaces?
- What is the computational overhead of the quadratic regularization term during training and inference?
- Does the learned quadratic structure encode meaningful algebraic invariants, or does it function as generic regularization?

## Limitations
- Only validated on MNIST, a relatively simple benchmark dataset
- No theoretical justification for why Bhargava cube constraints should improve image classification
- Modest absolute improvement (99.15% → 99.46%) raises questions about practical value
- Claims about "natural clustering" emerging from class-agnostic constraints lack rigorous validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Differentiability of L_quad and its integration with standard neural training is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical improvement on MNIST is demonstrated but may not generalize
- **Low confidence**: Theoretical justification for why Bhargava cube constraints benefit image classification remains absent

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset generalization test**: Apply BCMEM to Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and synthetic quadratic surfaces. Compare accuracy drops and embedding interpretability across datasets.
2. **Mathematical consistency verification**: Implement automated checks during training to verify learned quadratic forms satisfy disc(Q₁ ∘ Q₂) ≈ disc(Q₁)·disc(Q₂)·disc(Q₃)². Plot these relationships over training epochs.
3. **Robustness to initialization and λ**: Conduct systematic sweeps across initialization seeds and λ values on MNIST, measuring both accuracy variance and embedding consistency. Identify stability region where performance and algebraic structure are maintained.
