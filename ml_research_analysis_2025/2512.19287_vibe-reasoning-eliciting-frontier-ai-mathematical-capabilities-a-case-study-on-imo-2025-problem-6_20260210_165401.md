## Executive Summary
Vibe Reasoning is a human-AI collaborative framework that solves complex mathematical problems by leveraging AI's latent knowledge through lightweight meta-prompts. For IMO 2025 Problem 6, autonomous AI systems failed to find solutions, but Vibe Reasoning achieved both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous proof by combining GPT-5's exploratory strengths with Gemini 3 Pro's proof capabilities. The approach uses Socratic meta-prompts (generic guidance like "verify with code"), agentic grounding (Python execution for verification and file-based memory), and model orchestration (task-model matching). Through iterative refinement, human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to transferable meta-prompts, while AI autonomously discovered patterns and proof strategies. The methodology addresses AI's limitations in self-evaluation and context management, demonstrating that minimal human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This ongoing work aims to automate framework components while preserving solution quality.

## Method Summary
Vibe Reasoning employs four pillars: AI as primary reasoner, Socratic meta-prompts (generic directives like "verify with code"), agentic grounding (Python execution and file memory), and model orchestration (GPT-5 for exploration, Gemini 3 Pro for proof). Phase 1 uses GPT-5 to enumerate exact minima for n≤9 via backtracking, verifies with code, focuses on perfect squares, detects residue block pattern, and computes M(2025)=2112. Phase 2 switches to Gemini 3 Pro for lower-bound proof construction using Fooling Sets and Erdős-Szekeres theorem (|LIS|+|LDS|≥2√n). The framework's success hinges on generic prompts triggering latent AI knowledge, code execution catching hallucinations, and complementary model strengths overcoming individual limitations.

## Key Results
- Correct answer (2112) and rigorous proof obtained for IMO 2025 Problem 6 where autonomous AI failed
- Generic meta-prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to transferable guidance patterns
- Model orchestration combined GPT-5's exploration with Gemini 3 Pro's proof capabilities
- Agentic grounding via Python verification and file memory prevented context loss and hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Meta-Cognitive Triggering via Socratic Prompts
Generic, domain-agnostic prompts activate latent AI capabilities that autonomous prompting fails to elicit. Human provides when/what/how signals (e.g., "verify with code," "focus on special cases") without revealing solutions. AI independently deploys its stored knowledge (Erdős-Szekeres, Fooling Sets) once triggered. Core assumption: frontier models already possess relevant knowledge but lack reliable self-evaluation to know when/how to apply it. Evidence: same model produces confident wrong answer (4048) autonomously, then catches error when prompted "check with code" — discovers correct answer (2112).

### Mechanism 2: Agentic Grounding Breaks Verification Blindness
External code execution compensates for AI's unreliable self-evaluation by providing independent verification. Python execution tests conjectures against ground truth; file-based memory maintains context across sessions. Together they catch hallucinations AI cannot self-detect. Core assumption: AI shares blind spots between reasoning and verification when both remain internal. Evidence: file reference counts show successful trace had ~106 file references vs. minimal in failed traces; code verification caught enumeration bugs before pattern-fitting.

### Mechanism 3: Model Orchestration via Complementary Strengths
Task-model matching overcomes individual model limitations that block single-model solutions. GPT-5 excels at exploration/pattern discovery but fails at rigorous proof; Gemini 3 Pro excels at proof but fails at exploration. Orchestration routes phases to appropriate models. Core assumption: model capabilities are genuinely complementary, not merely different in degree. Evidence: GPT-5 shows strong pattern exploration, weak rigorous proof; Gemini 3 Pro shows weak construction discovery, strong systematic proof.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fooling Set / Cross-Free Set framework (Communication Complexity)**: Core proof technique—cells where no rectangle covers two cells without intersecting a hole; establishes lower bound via |S|. Quick check: Given a permutation on 4×4 grid, can you identify a fooling set of size 5?

- **Erdős-Szekeres theorem (LIS/LDS relationship)**: Provides the 2√n bound via |LIS|·|LDS| ≥ n → |LIS|+|LDS| ≥ 2√n, critical for the lower bound proof. Quick check: What is the minimum |LIS|+|LDS| guaranteed for any permutation of length 9?

- **Permutation-based problem formalization**: Reduces grid covering to: given permutation π, minimize rectangles covering all cells except holes at (i, π(i)). Quick check: For n=3 with permutation (2,3,1), where are the three holes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Human → Socratic Meta-Prompts → AI Primary Reasoner (GPT-5/Gemini) → Agentic Grounding (Python Executor, File Memory) → Model Orchestration Layer

- **Critical path**: 1) Enumeration with code verification (catch early errors) 2) Pattern discovery on curated subset (e.g., perfect squares) 3) Model switch before proof phase 4) Verification of proof construction on random instances

- **Design tradeoffs**: Generic vs. problem-specific prompts (generic transferable but require more iterations; specific faster but not reusable); Single vs. multi-model (orchestration adds coordination overhead but overcomes specialization gaps); Exploration-rigor balance (premature proof wastes computation; delayed proof loses momentum)

- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident wrong answer with detailed but invalid justification (Section 3.1.1: "4048" formula); Circular proof attempts cycling through variations without meta-pivot (Section 4.4: guard cells → quadrant coloring → parity augmentation); Context loss across sessions without file memory (Section 4.1); 100% verification failure rate on proof constructions (Figure 11)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline failure replication: Prompt model to solve IMO P6 autonomously; document error type 2) Ablation on grounding: Same problem with vs. without Python execution; measure hallucination detection rate 3) Model swap test: Run full exploration in Model A, then hand off to Model B for proof; compare to single-model completion rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization beyond combinatorial optimization**: Can Vibe Reasoning generalize to mathematical domains beyond combinatorial optimization? The authors state they are "conducting broader evaluations on additional challenging problems to validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness" but present only a single combinatorial case study.

- **Automation of Socratic meta-prompts**: Can the "Socratic meta-prompts" be automated to remove the need for human intervention? The authors ask, "Can these human judgments be automated?" and list "reducing human intervention" as a primary objective, but the current framework depends on human meta-cognition to decide when to pivot or verify.

- **Accessibility to non-experts**: Can the methodology succeed with users who lack high-level mathematical training? The conclusion aims to make Vibe Reasoning accessible to "collaborators without high-level mathematical training" by codifying prompts into templates, but it's unclear whether the authors' expertise was truly generic or relied on implicit expert intuition.

## Limitations

- The specific frontier models (GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro) referenced are described as having particular capabilities not yet publicly accessible, creating reproducibility barriers.

- Corpus evidence supporting specific mechanisms (Socratic meta-prompts, model orchestration strategy, agentic grounding) is limited to the single case study presented.

- The framework's success may depend on human expertise that's difficult to codify, with only one problem instance demonstrating the approach.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The existence of the problem (IMO 2025 Problem 6), the mathematical techniques employed (Fooling Sets, Erdős-Szekeres theorem), and the general framework structure (human-AI collaboration, code grounding, model orchestration) are well-established concepts with solid theoretical foundations.

- **Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanism by which Socratic meta-prompts trigger latent AI knowledge is plausible and supported by the documented case where "verify with code" prompted error detection, but broader empirical validation is needed.

- **Low Confidence**: The specific complementary capabilities of GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro as described, and the generalizability of the Vibe Reasoning framework beyond this single problem instance, remain unproven without access to the actual models and additional case studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Meta-Prompts**: Replicate the IMO 2025 Problem 6 solution using the same models but with problem-specific hints instead of generic Socratic prompts. Measure differences in iteration count, hallucination rate, and solution quality to quantify the transfer benefit claimed.

2. **Model Capability Mapping**: Systematically characterize the exploration vs. proof capabilities across multiple available frontier models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro) using a battery of mathematical reasoning tasks. This would validate whether the claimed complementary strengths are model-specific or general phenomena.

3. **Framework Automation Test**: Implement the proposed automation of framework components (automated meta-prompt selection, dynamic model routing) and evaluate performance on a diverse set of Olympiad-level problems. Compare against the human-guided baseline to assess whether automation preserves the solution quality while reducing human intervention.
