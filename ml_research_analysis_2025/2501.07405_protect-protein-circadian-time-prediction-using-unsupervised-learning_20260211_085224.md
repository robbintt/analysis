# PROTECT: Protein circadian time prediction using unsupervised learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07405
- Reference count: 40
- PROTECT achieves >80% nAUC for circadian phase prediction across mouse, human, and Ostreococcus tauri proteomic datasets.

## Executive Summary
PROTECT is an unsupervised deep learning framework for predicting circadian phases from proteomic data without requiring time labels or prior knowledge of rhythmic proteins. The method employs a two-stage greedy layer-wise pre-training followed by fine-tuning with a specialized loss function that aligns protein expression with circadian patterns. When evaluated on labeled datasets, PROTECT achieved over 80% normalized area under the curve for phase prediction across multiple species. Applied to unlabeled human proteomic data from postmortem brain regions and urine samples, the method identified circadian disruptions between Alzheimer's disease and control subjects, revealing differences in rhythmic protein profiles and potential drug targets.

## Method Summary
PROTECT uses a two-stage approach: first, greedy layer-wise pre-training with stacked autoencoders to initialize network weights in an unsupervised manner; second, fine-tuning a deep neural network using a specialized loss function that minimizes the error between observed protein expression and that predicted by cosine functions parameterized by the network's phase outputs. The model handles small sample sizes and high dimensionality typical of proteomic datasets by learning compact representations before joint optimization of sample phases and protein rhythmicity parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieved >80% nAUC for phase prediction on labeled datasets across mouse, human, and Ostreococcus tauri data
- Successfully identified circadian disruptions between Alzheimer's disease and control subjects in unlabeled human proteomic datasets
- Revealed differences in rhythmic protein profiles between brain regions and urine samples, identifying potential drug targets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PROTECT addresses the challenge of inferring circadian phases from unlabeled proteomic data by leveraging the assumption that protein expression follows periodic patterns. The greedy pre-training stage learns efficient data representations that capture underlying temporal structure without requiring time labels. The fine-tuning stage then optimizes these representations to predict phases that best explain the observed protein expression patterns through a cosine-based model. The specialized loss function guides this optimization by measuring the reconstruction error between actual and cosine-predicted expression levels, allowing the model to jointly learn sample phases and protein rhythmicity parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- **Circadian Rhythms in Proteomics**
  - Why needed here: The entire model is built around the assumption that protein expression levels oscillate in a ~24-hour cycle
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a protein's expression level changing over a 24-hour period translates into the terms "amplitude," "mesor," and "acrophase" used in the model's cosine function?

- **Greedy Layer-wise Pre-training**
  - Why needed here: This is the first stage of the PROTECT model, crucial for handling small sample sizes and high dimensionality
  - Quick check question: Why would training a deep neural network one layer at a time with autoencoders be more effective for a small, high-dimensional dataset than training the entire network end-to-end from random initialization?

- **Unsupervised Learning & Phase Ambiguity**
  - Why needed here: The core challenge PROTECT solves is inferring time from data without time labels, introducing phase ambiguity
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts a sample's phase as 90 degrees (6 hours) but the ground truth is 270 degrees (18 hours), is this a complete failure? Why or why not, considering the nature of circadian cycles?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input Layer -> Greedy Pre-training Stage -> Initial Phase Decoder -> Cosine Parameterizer -> Fine-tuning Stage -> Loss Function -> Outlier Detection Module
- **Critical path**: 1. Data-in -> Pre-train AEs: Sequentially train autoencoders to compress data and get a 2D embedding. 2. 2D Embedding -> Initial Phase: Compute the angle from the 2D embedding for each sample. 3. Initial Phase -> Protein Params: Fit cosine curves to all proteins to get their initial rhythmic parameters. 4. Fine-tune DNN: Train the full DNN to predict phases that minimize the error of reconstructing protein expression via the cosine model.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The unsupervised approach allows working on unlabeled data but loses absolute phase anchors; the two-stage approach is robust for small data but more complex than end-to-end alternatives.
- **Failure signatures**: Random-like phase predictions, non-convergence in fine-tuning, all samples predicted to same phase, inability to handle ultradian rhythms.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce Labeled Data Baseline: Run PROTECT on mouse liver dataset (PXD003818) with known time labels. 2. Ablation of Pre-training: Train without greedy pre-training on labeled dataset. 3. Proteomic Rhythmicity Analysis: Apply to new unlabeled proteomic dataset and identify rhythmic proteins.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the postmortem interval (PMI) quantitatively impact the accuracy of circadian phase predictions in proteomic data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state, "In our study, we did not address the impact of the postmortem interval (PMI)... future work should investigate the effect of PMI on predicted times."
- Why unresolved: While the study assumed minimal impact for samples with PMI < 10 hours, the model does not currently account for protein degradation or time-dependent changes that occur between death and sample collection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of prediction error rates across datasets with varying, recorded PMIs, or the integration of a PMI-correction factor into the model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can imputation strategies be integrated into PROTECT to retain valuable rhythmic information currently lost due to missing values?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper lists the "exclusion of proteins with missing values" as a limitation, noting that this "may lead to the exclusion of valuable data."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation removes any protein with missing values to ensure model stability, potentially biasing the identification of rhythmic proteins in sparse datasets like urine.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating that a modified PROTECT pipeline using advanced imputation techniques can identify novel rhythmic proteins without inflating false positives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How dependent is the model's phase alignment on the specific choice of the reference protein (EHD1) used for anchoring peak times?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note, "In the future, with more studies on proteins’ peak times, we can use some known proteins as the target protein," implying the current reliance on EHD1 is a provisional choice.
- Why unresolved: The model currently sets EHD1's peak to zero to align phases; it is unclear if this protein is universally optimal or if its rhythmicity varies significantly across different disease states or tissues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing phase prediction stability when swapping EHD1 for other constitutively rhythmic proteins as the reference anchor.

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the assumption that protein expression follows stable cosine-like patterns
- Unsupervised nature means phases are relative rather than absolute time points, requiring external validation
- Pre-training approach may not generalize well to larger, more diverse proteomic datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical implementation and mathematical framework for greedy pre-training and cosine-based phase prediction
- Medium confidence in the biological validity of phase predictions on unlabeled datasets
- Low confidence in the model's ability to handle proteins with ultradian rhythms (periods <24 hours) without parameter adjustment

## Next Checks
1. Test PROTECT on proteomic data from tissues with known arrhythmic protein expression to quantify false positive rates in phase prediction.

2. Apply the model to a publicly available time-series proteomic dataset with known circadian disruption (e.g., sleep deprivation studies) and compare predicted disruptions against established biomarkers.

3. Conduct ablation studies removing the pre-training stage on multiple dataset sizes to precisely quantify its contribution to performance across different sample-to-feature ratios.
