# Efficient Edge LLMs Deployment via HessianAware Quantization and CPU GPU Collaborative
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.07329
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07329
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Joint 8-bit quantization with CPU-GPU collaborative inference reduces GPU memory usage by ~60% and improves latency while maintaining near full-precision accuracy on MoE models.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the deployment of large language models (LLMs), specifically Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, on resource-constrained edge devices. The authors identify two main challenges: severe quantization accuracy loss due to activation outliers and inefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules under limited memory. Their solution combines Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) with CPU-GPU collaborative inference, enabling joint 8-bit quantization of activations and weights while mitigating outlier impact. Experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves near full-precision accuracy on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, while reducing GPU memory usage by approximately 60% and significantly improving inference latency.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach introduces a two-level optimization strategy: adaptive activation smoothing and Hessian-based weight quantization. This enables joint 8-bit quantization of activations and weights, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, an expert-level collaborative offloading and caching mechanism is implemented to balance latency and throughput by leveraging heterogeneous computing resources. The framework was tested on models like OPT and Mixtral-8×7B, demonstrating significant improvements in both memory efficiency and inference speed while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision models.

## Key Results
- Joint 8-bit quantization achieves near full-precision accuracy on Wikitext2 and C4 datasets
- GPU memory usage reduced by approximately 60% compared to baseline
- Significant improvement in inference latency through CPU-GPU collaborative offloading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) approach works by leveraging second-order gradient information to prioritize which weights and activations are most critical to quantization accuracy. By using Hessian matrices, the method identifies parameters with high curvature (sensitivity) and preserves their precision while aggressively quantizing less sensitive parameters. This selective quantization approach minimizes accuracy loss that typically occurs with aggressive quantization.

The CPU-GPU collaborative inference mechanism works by intelligently partitioning the MoE computation between heterogeneous processors based on real-time load and memory constraints. The expert-level offloading strategy ensures that computationally intensive expert computations are distributed optimally between CPU and GPU, while caching mechanisms reduce redundant data transfers. This collaborative approach effectively overcomes the memory limitations of edge devices while maintaining throughput.

## Foundational Learning
**Hessian-based sensitivity analysis**: Measures how sensitive model parameters are to quantization noise by computing second-order derivatives. Needed to identify which weights and activations can be aggressively quantized without significant accuracy loss. Quick check: Verify that high-Hessian parameters correlate with higher importance in downstream tasks.

**Adaptive activation smoothing**: Techniques to mitigate outlier values in activation distributions that cause quantization errors. Needed because extreme activation values can disproportionately affect quantization accuracy. Quick check: Measure activation range reduction before and after smoothing.

**Expert-level collaborative offloading**: Strategy to partition MoE computations across heterogeneous processors based on computational characteristics and resource availability. Needed to overcome memory constraints while maintaining throughput. Quick check: Validate that expert distribution matches computational characteristics of each processor.

**Joint quantization of weights and activations**: Simultaneous 8-bit quantization of both model parameters and intermediate activations. Needed to maximize memory savings while maintaining model accuracy. Quick check: Compare memory savings and accuracy against separate quantization approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input -> Preprocessor -> Hessian-Aware Quantizer -> CPU-GPU Partitioner -> Expert Offloader -> Cache Manager -> Output

**Critical path**: Model input → Hessian-aware quantization → Expert partitioning → CPU/GPU execution → Result aggregation → Output

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework balances aggressive memory savings through quantization against potential accuracy degradation, while the collaborative offloading trades off increased complexity and coordination overhead for improved resource utilization and reduced memory pressure.

**Failure signatures**: Significant accuracy degradation when Hessian sensitivity analysis fails to correctly identify critical parameters; performance bottlenecks when CPU-GPU partitioning is suboptimal; memory overflows when caching strategies are inadequate for the workload.

**First experiments**:
1. Benchmark quantization accuracy across different Hessian threshold values to find optimal sensitivity cutoff
2. Profile memory usage and latency with various CPU-GPU partitioning ratios
3. Test caching effectiveness by measuring hit rates across different expert access patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of Hessian-based quantization approach across diverse LLM architectures beyond tested OPT and Mixtral-8×7B models remains unverified
- CPU-GPU collaborative inference strategy may face scalability challenges with different hardware configurations and MoE models with varying expert-to-token ratios
- The claim of "near full-precision accuracy" requires broader validation across multiple model families and tasks

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The characterization of core deployment challenges (activation outliers and memory limitations) is well-established and accurately described.

**Medium confidence**: The reported 60% memory reduction and improved latency metrics are supported by experiments but may be sensitive to specific hardware configurations and workload characteristics.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of achieving near full-precision accuracy with 8-bit quantization is substantiated for the tested models but requires broader validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the HAQ framework across a diverse set of LLM architectures (dense transformers, different MoE configurations) and benchmark tasks to verify generalizability of the quantization approach.
2. Evaluate the CPU-GPU collaborative inference strategy on edge devices with varying hardware specifications (different CPU-GPU performance ratios, memory capacities) to assess robustness.
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (Hessian-aware quantization vs. collaborative inference) to the overall performance gains.
