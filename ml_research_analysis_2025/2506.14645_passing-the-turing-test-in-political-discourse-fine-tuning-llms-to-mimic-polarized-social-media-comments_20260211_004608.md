# Passing the Turing Test in Political Discourse: Fine-Tuning LLMs to Mimic Polarized Social Media Comments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14645
- Reference count: 7
- Fine-tuned LLaMA-2 7B achieved BLEU 32.4, perplexity 30.2, and 78.9% sentiment alignment on political Reddit data

## Executive Summary
This study fine-tunes LLaMA-2 7B using LoRA on Reddit comment-reply pairs from politically polarized communities to generate ideologically aligned responses. The fine-tuned model significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in fluency (BLEU 32.4), coherence (perplexity 30.2), and ideological alignment (sentiment alignment 78.9%). Human evaluators rated the fine-tuned, prompted model as more credible than actual human responses, and found its outputs often indistinguishable from human-written comments. These results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively mimic and amplify partisan discourse, raising concerns about their use in manipulation campaigns and the need for better detection and governance frameworks.

## Method Summary
The researchers collected 16,000+ comment-reply pairs from 16 political subreddits using PRAW, preprocessed to remove duplicates, links, and moderation artifacts. They fine-tuned LLaMA-2 Chat 7B with 4-bit NF4 quantization and LoRA adapters, training only 1.13% of parameters (39,976,960) on the conversational data. The model was evaluated across four configurations: raw model, prompted model, fine-tuned model, and fine-tuned with prompting. Human evaluators assessed credibility, provocativeness, and indistinguishability from human responses.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned model with prompting (AI-4) achieved BLEU score of 32.4, outperforming all other configurations
- Sentiment alignment reached 78.9%, indicating strong ideological consistency with training data
- Human evaluators rated AI-4 as more credible than human responses and often indistinguishable from human-written comments
- Prompting alone significantly increased perceived provocativeness (4.03 rating) even without parameter updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Low-Rank Adaptation for Ideological Style Transfer
LoRA fine-tuning enables efficient acquisition of community-specific rhetorical patterns without modifying base model weights. Trainable low-rank matrices injected into transformer layers capture discourse patterns from comment-reply pairs while freezing original parameters. Only ~1.13% of parameters require training, assuming ideological style is linearly decomposable and can be captured in low-rank updates without degrading base capabilities.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Prompting as Rhetorical Amplifier
Structured prompts alone significantly increase perceived provocativeness and credibility, even without parameter updates. Metadata-rich prompts (subreddit name, post title, persona instruction) activate relevant latent knowledge in the base model, guiding generation toward context-appropriate rhetorical strategies. This works because base LLMs have internalized patterns of persuasive/political discourse from pre-training data.

### Mechanism 3: Conversational Structure Preservation for Contextual Coherence
Training on comment-reply pairs enables contextually appropriate, thread-aware responses. Source-target pairing preserves conversational turn-taking dynamics, teaching the model to respond directly to prior claims rather than generate topical but non-sequitur content. This assumes reply appropriateness depends on immediate conversational context, not just topic keywords.

## Foundational Learning

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed: This is the core technique enabling efficient fine-tuning; you cannot reproduce or extend this work without understanding how rank decomposition works.
  - Quick check: Given a weight matrix W of dimension d×k, can you sketch how LoRA represents ΔW as BA where B and A have lower rank r?

- **Perplexity as Fluency Metric**
  - Why needed: The paper uses perplexity to argue for improved coherence; you need to understand what this metric actually measures to interpret results critically.
  - Quick check: If a model achieves perplexity of 30.2, what does this imply about its average token prediction confidence?

- **BLEU Score Limitations**
  - Why needed: BLEU measures n-gram overlap, not semantic equivalence or ideological alignment—high BLEU doesn't prove the model "understands" the discourse.
  - Quick check: Why might a response with high BLEU score still be rhetorically inappropriate or factually wrong?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Reddit API (PRAW) → Preprocessing → Comment-Reply Pairs → LoRA Adapter → LLaMA-2 7B (frozen) + NF4 Quantization → Fine-Tuned Model → Context Prompts (optional) → Response Generation

- Critical path:
  1. Data quality filtering (remove bots, spam, low-engagement threads)—garbage in, garbage out
  2. LoRA rank selection—too low loses pattern fidelity; too high increases compute
  3. Prompt template design—directly impacts AI-2 vs. AI-4 performance gaps

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 4-bit quantization (NF4) reduces memory but may lose nuance in ideological expression
  - 512-token context window truncates longer threads; conversational context may be incomplete
  - 2-3 epochs balance training time vs. overfitting risk to specific subreddit styles

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucination: Model generates confident but false claims—indicates overfitting to rhetorical patterns without factual grounding
  - Bias amplification: Responses become more extreme than training data—suggests optimization objective lacks moderation constraints
  - Generic responses despite fine-tuning: LoRA rank too low or learning rate insufficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce AI-1 through AI-4 configurations on a held-out test set to validate reported metrics; check for variance across random seeds.
  2. Ablate LoRA rank (e.g., r=4, 8, 16, 32) to find minimum viable rank for ideological alignment; plot BLEU/perplexity vs. rank.
  3. Test cross-subreddit generalization: fine-tune on right-leaning subreddits only, evaluate on left-leaning test data to measure style transfer vs. overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can adversarial fine-tuning techniques be optimized to reduce ideological overfitting while maintaining linguistic fluency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly calls for "investigat[ing] adversarial fine-tuning techniques aimed at reducing ideological overfitting."
- Why unresolved: The study demonstrates that current fine-tuning methods lead to "bias reinforcement" and "radicalized replies," but it does not test methods to curb this behavior without degrading the model's newly acquired rhetorical skills.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that a specific adversarial training method lowers sentiment extremity scores (bias) without significantly increasing perplexity or lowering BLEU scores compared to the standard fine-tuned model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can hybrid detection systems combining linguistic analysis with metadata effectively identify fine-tuned political bots that pass the Turing Test?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose exploring "hybrid detection systems combining linguistic cues with metadata" as a necessary future step.
- Why unresolved: The fine-tuned model (AI-4) was rated more credible than humans by evaluators, proving that text-based detection alone is failing; the efficacy of integrating non-textual data remains untested in this context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that metadata features (e.g., response latency, network structure) improve the classification accuracy of AI-generated political comments over purely text-based detectors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the model's tendencies toward hallucination and overconfidence degrade its persuasiveness in dynamic, multi-turn interactions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.3 notes the model produces "hallucinated or inaccurate information" and displays "excessive confidence," while Section 2 states evaluations often ignore "dynamics of real-world interaction."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on single-turn evaluations (human annotation of isolated comments), leaving the impact of factual errors on long-term credibility in a live thread unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A follow-up study simulating multi-turn conversations where human interlocutors challenge the model's facts, measuring if/when the "hallucination" behavior causes a measurable drop in credibility or engagement scores.

## Limitations

- Methodology lacks experimental controls for human evaluation, making the "Turing test" claim questionable without proper blinding procedures or statistical significance testing
- Conflicting hyperparameter specifications between pages create significant reproduction uncertainty and prevent faithful replication
- No evaluation of factual accuracy or misinformation potential despite the model's demonstrated ideological alignment and persuasive capabilities

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in technical feasibility of LoRA for ideological style transfer, supported by established parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature
- **Medium confidence** in fluency and coherence metrics (BLEU 32.4, perplexity 30.2) as surface-level linguistic indicators
- **Low confidence** in broader societal implications without empirical validation of real-world deployment scenarios, detection robustness, or governance framework effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. Replicate human evaluation component with proper experimental controls: recruit independent evaluators blind to model origins, use randomized presentation order, and apply statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to determine if perceived indistinguishability is significant rather than anecdotal.

2. Conduct cross-validation experiments varying LoRA rank from r=4 to r=32 to identify minimum rank achieving 90% of maximum ideological alignment, establishing efficiency frontier and testing linear decomposability assumption.

3. Implement misinformation detection pipeline to automatically flag hallucinated claims, fabricated statistics, or logically inconsistent arguments in model outputs, then quantify frequency and severity of such failures across different political orientations.
