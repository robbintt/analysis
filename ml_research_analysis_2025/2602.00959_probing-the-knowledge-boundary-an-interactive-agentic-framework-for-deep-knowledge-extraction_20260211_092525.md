# Probing the Knowledge Boundary: An Interactive Agentic Framework for Deep Knowledge Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.00959
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00959
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy, with larger models extracting significantly more knowledge (recall increases from 27.3% to 39.0% across model sizes).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an interactive agentic framework for probing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. The approach uses adaptive exploration strategies to systematically extract knowledge, combined with a three-stage processing pipeline (vector filtering, LLM adjudication, domain auditing) to ensure quality. Experiments across four stages reveal that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy, larger models extract significantly more knowledge, and domain-specific fine-tuning improves initial accuracy but causes rapid degradation in sustained recall.

## Method Summary
The framework implements four exploration strategies (Sequential, Reflective, Recursive Taxonomy, Multi-Perspective) to probe black-box LLMs across three domains from the ICML taxonomy. A three-stage knowledge processor filters raw outputs through vector similarity filtering, LLM adjudication for ambiguous pairs, and domain relevance auditing using Bloom's Taxonomy criteria. The system tracks saturation using growth rate, efficiency, and novel count metrics, stopping when predefined thresholds are met or after 15 turns.

## Key Results
- Recursive taxonomy strategy yields 6.0× higher knowledge extraction than baseline sequential probing
- Clear knowledge scaling law: recall increases from 27.3% to 39.0% across model sizes
- Domain-specific fine-tuning improves Pass@1 accuracy but causes 3.7× faster degradation in sustained recall

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Decomposition
Hierarchical decomposition (Recursive Taxonomy) breaks model "output inertia" better than sequential prompting. Flat prompting causes models to resort to high-probability "comfort zones." By recursively breaking a topic into sub-fields and then mining leaf nodes, the system forces the model to access long-tail parametric memory rather than repeating dominant concepts. Core assumption: The model possesses latent knowledge structured hierarchically that it will not voluntarily express without specific structural constraints. Break condition: If the target model hallucinates invalid or non-existent sub-trees during induction, the leaf-node mining will yield high volumes of hallucinated noise.

### Mechanism 2: Three-Stage Hybrid Pipeline
A three-stage hybrid pipeline is required to distinguish semantic equivalence from factual validity. Vector filtering removes exact duplicates efficiently. An LLM-judge resolves ambiguous semantic overlaps that vectors miss. Finally, domain auditing filters "meta-statements" and generic fluff, ensuring only "knowledge atoms" remain. Core assumption: LLMs can serve as reliable judges for semantic similarity and domain relevance when guided by strict rubrics. Break condition: If the embedding model has low granularity for the domain, vector filtering may aggressively merge distinct concepts.

### Mechanism 3: Pass@1-versus-Pass@k Trade-off
Domain-specific fine-tuning optimizes for Pass@1 (initial accuracy) at the expense of Pass@k (sustained recall). Specialized RL sharpens the probability density on a narrow "high-confidence zone," yielding higher accuracy on the first turn but causing rapid degradation in subsequent turns. Core assumption: The observed accuracy degradation is a result of distribution sharpening rather than model capacity loss. Break condition: If the extraction domain is extremely narrow and strictly aligned with the specialization, the recall penalty may be negligible.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bloom's Taxonomy (Knowledge Atom Definition)**
  - Why needed: The framework relies on classifying output as Factual, Conceptual, or Procedural to filter "fluff" (invalid content)
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between a "meta-statement" (e.g., "Deep learning is useful") and a "procedural knowledge atom" (e.g., "Backpropagation calculates gradients via the chain rule")?

- **Concept: Saturation Detection (Stopping Criteria)**
  - Why needed: Infinite extraction is costly; the system must define when the knowledge boundary is approximated
  - Quick check: If the "Growth Rate" ($g_t$) drops below 1% but "Efficiency" ($e_t$) is high, should the system stop? (Answer: Yes, based on the paper's disjunction of stopping conditions)

- **Concept: Pareto Frontier (Strategy Optimization)**
  - Why needed: Used to compare strategies based on the trade-off between "Cumulative Token Cost" and "Yield Ratio"
  - Quick check: Why is Taxonomy-L5W5 considered dominant despite higher token costs than Multi-Profile?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Agentic Driver -> Target LLM (Black-box) -> Knowledge Processor (Vector DB -> LLM Judge -> Domain Auditor) -> State Manager
- **Critical path:** The Recursive Taxonomy pipeline is the primary production path: Induction (generate W sub-fields) -> Expansion (recursively expand nodes to depth D_max) -> Mining (deploy leaf-miners to extract raw bullets) -> Processing (filter through 3-stage pipeline) -> Check (evaluate saturation; repeat or terminate)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Structure vs. Cost (Taxonomy-L5W5 maximizes yield but incurs high token costs); Judge Model (hybrid 0.70–0.92 threshold routes ambiguous pairs to heavy LLM); Resolution (fast embedding model vs. cost-prohibitive heavy LLM for all checks)
- **Failure signatures:** Orbiting (Sequential probing returns semantic variations of same facts); Hallucination Cascade (Taxonomy generates invalid sub-fields); Premature Saturation (stopping criteria triggered too aggressively)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run Sequential vs. Taxonomy-L2W2 on Deep Learning for 5 turns; verify Sequential plateaus while Taxonomy grows yield
  2. Threshold Sensitivity: Vary strict dedup threshold (0.90 vs 0.95); measure rate of "false positive" merges
  3. Saturation Calibration: Run extraction to 20 turns on small model; verify if 1% growth criterion correlates with knowledge exhaustion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness critically depends on domain auditor quality and taxonomy induction robustness
- Saturation detection criteria are heuristic thresholds that may not generalize across domains
- Experimental validation limited to three ICML taxonomy domains

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Knowledge scaling law across model sizes (27.3% to 39.0% recall); recursive taxonomy effectiveness (6.0× yield); Pass@1/k trade-off with 3.7× degradation rate
- **Medium Confidence:** Three-stage pipeline effectiveness (relies on LLM judge performance); architectural influence on recall (lacks controlled ablation studies)
- **Low Confidence:** Universal applicability of Bloom's Taxonomy across all domains (assumed but not empirically tested)

## Next Checks
1. Hallucination Cascade Test: Run Recursive Taxonomy on a known hallucinatory model and measure invalid sub-fields generated
2. Cross-Domain Generalization: Apply framework to non-ML domain and compare saturation detection effectiveness
3. Judge Model Ablation: Replace DeepSeek-V3.1 judge with human evaluators for 100 ambiguous pairs and measure accuracy differences
