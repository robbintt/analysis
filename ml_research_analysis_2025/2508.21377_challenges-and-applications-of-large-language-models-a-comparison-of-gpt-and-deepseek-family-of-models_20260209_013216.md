# Challenges and Applications of Large Language Models: A Comparison of GPT and DeepSeek family of models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.21377
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21377
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** GPT-4o leads in safety and long-context performance via RLHF; DeepSeek excels in cost-efficiency and customization using MoE and open weights

## Executive Summary
This survey compares GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3-0324 across 16 key LLM challenges, highlighting trade-offs between closed-source polish and open-source efficiency. GPT-4o leads in safety, alignment, and long-context performance via RLHF and robust filtering, while DeepSeek excels in cost-efficiency, customization, and logic-heavy tasks using MoE and open weights. Both address outdated knowledge via retrieval, but GPT-4o offers more seamless integration. DeepSeek's openness supports reproducibility and experimentation, whereas GPT-4o's API ensures consistent, safe deployment. The choice depends on use case: GPT-4o for high-stakes, user-facing applications; DeepSeek for cost-sensitive, customizable, or logic-intensive scenarios. The comparison underscores a dual-track AI progress—closed models set benchmarks; open models democratize innovation.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comparative survey evaluating GPT-4o (May 2024) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 across 16 LLM challenges in design, behavioral, and evaluation categories. It synthesizes findings from third-party benchmarks and illustrative API/web interface tests, citing metrics like hallucination rates, safety pass rates, tokens/sec, and TTFT. The survey uses sample prompts illustrated in Figures 3-7 and references benchmarks including Vectara HHEM 2.1, AIME, LiveCodeBench, USMLE, and Polish Infectious Diseases Exam. However, the paper does not provide primary experimental data, instead relying on cited benchmarks and qualitative comparisons.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves lower hallucination rates (1.5%) compared to DeepSeek (3.9%) due to deeper alignment and self-regulation behaviors
- DeepSeek demonstrates superior cost-efficiency, trained on 14.8T tokens using 2.788 million H800 GPU hours (approximately $5–6M) versus GPT-4o's estimated $100M
- DeepSeek shows steep performance drops after ~20K tokens while GPT-4o maintains coherence across its 128K context window without truncation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** RLHF-based alignment reduces hallucinations and improves safety for user-facing applications.
- **Mechanism:** Human annotators label safe/unsafe responses → reward model learns preferences → PPO fine-tunes policy to maximize reward. This shapes model behavior toward refusal of harmful prompts and calibrated uncertainty.
- **Core assumption:** Human preferences can be consistently encoded into a reward signal that generalizes to unseen prompts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "GPT-4o leads in safety, alignment, and long-context performance via RLHF and robust filtering"
  - [section III.H] "GPT-4o achieves lower hallucination due to deeper alignment, tool integration and self regulation behaviors... hallucination rate of 1.5% vs DeepSeek's 3.9%"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper on jailbreak attacks confirms GPT models "undergone extensive evaluation" for alignment robustness
- **Break condition:** If reward model is mis-specified or adversarial prompts exploit distributional gaps, RLHF degrades into reward hacking rather than genuine safety.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture achieves comparable performance at fraction of training cost by activating only specialized sub-networks per token.
- **Mechanism:** Each token routes to a subset of experts (~37B of 671B parameters). Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) compresses KV states; FP8 precision reduces memory; Multi-Token Prediction enables speculative decoding.
- **Core assumption:** Task-relevant knowledge can be factorized across specialized experts without catastrophic interference.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "DeepSeek excels in cost-efficiency, customization, and logic-heavy tasks using MoE and open weights"
  - [section II.C] "Trained on 14.8T tokens using 2.788 million H800 GPU hours (approximately $5–6M), DeepSeek is cost-efficient compared to GPT-4o (approximately $100M)"
  - [corpus] Corpus signals show related work on DeepSeek benchmarking but limited independent cost verification
- **Break condition:** If routing collapses (experts not utilized evenly) or task requires broad knowledge integration across experts, efficiency gains may not translate to quality.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Long-context reliability depends on architectural attention mechanisms, not just stated context window size.
- **Mechanism:** GPT-4o uses undisclosed architectural tuning to maintain "lost in the middle" performance; DeepSeek's MLA compresses KV states but shows steep degradation beyond ~20K tokens.
- **Core assumption:** Attention patterns can be trained/optimized to weight mid-context information appropriately.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "GPT-4o leads in safety, alignment, and long-context performance"
  - [section III.F] "DeepSeek shows steep performance drops after ~20K tokens... frequent failures at ~56K tokens" while "GPT-4o maintains coherence... without truncation"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence on long-context mechanisms specifically
- **Break condition:** If attention mechanism has intrinsic position bias or KV cache management fails, declared context length becomes misleading specification.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
  - Why needed here: Central to understanding why GPT-4o achieves better safety/alignment than instruction-tuned only models.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RLHF might produce different behavior than supervised fine-tuning alone?

- **Concept: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing**
  - Why needed here: Core to DeepSeek's efficiency claims; affects inference latency and specialization.
  - Quick check question: What happens if an MoE router consistently selects the same subset of experts?

- **Concept: Context window vs. effective context utilization**
  - Why needed here: Paper reveals stated context length (128K) does not guarantee uniform performance across that window.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with 128K context window fail to retrieve information from the middle of a 50K token input?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - GPT-4o: Dense Transformer → RLHF alignment → Content filtering API → Versioned endpoint
  - DeepSeek: Sparse MoE (671B/37B active) → MLA attention → FP8 precision → GRPO alignment → Open weights (MIT license)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Determine safety/alignment requirements (user-facing vs. internal)
  2. Assess context length needs (verify effective range, not just spec)
  3. Evaluate customization requirements (fine-tuning, on-premise deployment)
  4. Calculate total cost of ownership (API fees vs. infrastructure + ML engineering)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Safety vs. flexibility: GPT-4o provides robust guardrails; DeepSeek requires downstream safety implementation
  - Consistency vs. reproducibility: API provides stable UX but silent updates; open weights enable exact reproduction but require infrastructure
  - Cost predictability: API pricing is transparent per-token; self-hosted costs vary with utilization and optimization

- **Failure signatures:**
  - GPT-4o: Over-refusal on edge-case prompts; knowledge cutoff when tools disabled
  - DeepSeek: Hallucination spikes on open-domain facts without RAG; prompt brittleness with informal phrasing; context retrieval failure beyond ~20K tokens

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run identical long-context retrieval task (30K+ tokens, query mid-document) on both models; measure accuracy degradation curve.
  2. Test adversarial prompts from safety benchmarks; compare refusal rates and failure modes.
  3. Benchmark inference latency under load; compare GPT-4o API p50/p99 vs. self-hosted DeepSeek on target hardware.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the architectural efficiency of open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models be successfully merged with the advanced alignment techniques (RLHF) of closed-source models to create "safe-by-design" efficient systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V.C predicts a "convergence of techniques" where MoE is adopted by closed models and RLHF by open models, potentially leading to "new hybrid models."
- **Why unresolved:** Current models occupy distinct "dual-track" paths (efficiency vs. polish), and combining sparse architectures with dense alignment pipelines remains technically complex.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The release of an open-weights MoE model that achieves DeepSeek-level cost efficiency while matching GPT-4o's safety refusal benchmarks (e.g., low harmful content rates).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does a system-level routing architecture—combining a "highly aligned general model" core with specialized open models—outperform a single generalist model in both cost and accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V.C hypothesizes a future strategy of using "a combination of models" where a router picks the best expert (e.g., coding vs. general) rather than relying on one monolithic system.
- **Why unresolved:** This approach requires complex orchestration and routing logic that has not yet been standardized or widely benchmarked against single-model performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks demonstrating that a routed system (e.g., GPT-4o + DeepSeek-Specialized) outperforms GPT-4o alone on domain-specific tasks while maintaining lower overall inference costs.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How effective are dynamic "LLM-as-a-judge" frameworks compared to static benchmarks for continuous, real-time safety and capability monitoring?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V.C suggests "evaluation-as-a-service" or "LLM as a judge" might be the "next big thing" to replace static leaderboards which suffer from saturation and data leakage.
- **Why unresolved:** Static benchmarks are brittle (Section III.K) and fail to capture real-world reliability or safety drift over time.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal studies showing that dynamic evaluator scores correlate more strongly with real-world deployment failure rates (e.g., hallucinations in production) than scores on static datasets like MMLU.

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on third-party benchmark citations rather than providing primary experimental data
- Illustrative prompt examples in Figures 3-7 are described but not fully reproduced in text, making independent verification difficult
- Cost comparisons appear to be based on public estimates rather than direct measurements under comparable workloads
- Behavioral observations are presented without confidence intervals or statistical significance testing

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The architectural descriptions of both models (GPT-4o's RLHF-based alignment pipeline and DeepSeek's MoE implementation with MLA) are technically sound and align with published technical reports. The general tradeoff characterization between closed-source safety/polish versus open-source efficiency/customization represents a well-established pattern in LLM development.
- **Medium confidence:** The specific quantitative comparisons (hallucination rates of 1.5% vs 3.9%, cost estimates of $100M vs $5-6M) are cited from benchmarks, but the exact experimental conditions, dataset composition, and measurement protocols are not detailed in the survey itself. These figures should be treated as indicative rather than definitive without accessing the original benchmark methodologies.
- **Low confidence:** The comparative behavioral observations (refusal patterns, context window effectiveness beyond 20K tokens) are presented as observed differences but lack systematic experimental design documentation. The paper describes these as survey findings but doesn't establish whether these differences are statistically significant or consistently reproducible across different prompt variants.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce the core behavioral comparison** using the partial prompt descriptions from Figures 3-7, testing both models with identical parameters (temperature=0, no system prompt) to verify the reported refusal patterns and output characteristics.
2. **Verify long-context performance claims** by running a controlled experiment with progressively longer documents (5K, 20K, 50K, 100K tokens) containing queries positioned at different locations, measuring retrieval accuracy and coherence degradation.
3. **Assess cost-efficiency claims empirically** by measuring actual token generation costs and inference latency for both models under comparable workloads, documenting any discrepancies between reported estimates and observed performance.
