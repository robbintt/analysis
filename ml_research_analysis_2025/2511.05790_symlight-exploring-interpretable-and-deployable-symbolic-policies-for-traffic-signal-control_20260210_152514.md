# SymLight: Exploring Interpretable and Deployable Symbolic Policies for Traffic Signal Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05790
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05790
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: SymLight achieves lower average travel times and higher throughput than DRL-based, practical, and symbolic-regression-adapted methods on six real-world datasets while producing interpretable, deployable policies.

## Executive Summary
SymLight introduces a symbolic priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for interpretable and deployable traffic signal control (TSC) policies. The method represents TSC policies as symbolic priority functions that take lane-level traffic features as input and output phase priorities, enabling direct optimization of system-level objectives. A concise yet expressive priority function representation mitigates action space combinatorial explosion, while a probabilistic structural rollout strategy leverages patterns from high-quality functions. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SymLight outperforms diverse baselines including DRL-based, practical, and symbolic-regression-adapted methods.

## Method Summary
SymLight uses MCTS to search for symbolic priority functions that map traffic features to phase priorities. The policy is encoded as a linear token list representing a breadth-first traversal of an expression tree, with operators (+, -, ×, min, max) and variables (traffic features). The search space is constrained by a maximum of 6 operators and validated using an arity equation. Instead of random rollout, SymLight employs a Probabilistic Structural Rollout (PSR) strategy that samples tokens based on frequency patterns from the top-10 best functions found so far. The reward is the reciprocal of average travel time obtained by evaluating the function in CityFlow simulator, with adaptive normalization to maintain stable Q-values.

## Key Results
- SymLight outperforms DRL-based methods (MPLight, CoLight), practical methods (FRAP, SCATS), and symbolic-regression-adapted methods (GPLight+, π-Light) across six real-world datasets
- Achieves lower average travel times and higher throughput than all baseline methods
- Produces interpretable, human-understandable symbolic policies deployable on resource-constrained edge devices with minimal computational overhead
- Demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization performance compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Symbolic Policy Representation for Combinatorial Action Space Mitigation
- Claim: A concise linear token list representation of priority functions bounds the MCTS action space, avoiding combinatorial explosion while preserving expressiveness.
- Mechanism: The policy is encoded as a breadth-first traversal of an expression tree using a list of operators and variables. Each token has an arity (operators > 0, variables = 0). Valid functions are those where the sum of arities plus one equals the list length. This linear structure directly limits the number of actions at each MCTS node to a fixed set of operators and variables, making the search tractable.
- Core assumption: A simple, flexible representation without strict syntactic rules can still effectively encode complex traffic signal control policies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...concise yet expressive priority function representation mitigates action space combinatorial explosion..."
  - [section 3.2]: "In this work, we propose a simple yet effective representation of the priority function using a linear data structure... We define an arity attribute for each token... an expression tree can be uniquely constructed."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support for this specific token-list mechanism; related works (GPLight+, DRSQ, π-Light) use tree-based or polynomial representations but face inflexibility or reliance on homogeneous settings.
- Break condition: If the defined operator/variable set is insufficient to capture necessary traffic dynamics, the search will fail to find high-performing policies.

### Mechanism 2: Probabilistic Structural Rollout (PSR) for Guided Search
- Claim: Replacing random MCTS rollout with a structure-aware strategy that samples from patterns in high-quality historical solutions improves search efficiency.
- Mechanism: A PSR table is maintained, counting parent-child token pairs from the expression trees of the top-k best priority functions found so far. During rollout, the next token is sampled based on a conditional probability distribution derived from this table, with a smoothing factor (alpha) to maintain exploration. This biases the search toward promising structures.
- Core assumption: Structural patterns from good solutions are predictive of performance in new candidate solutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...probabilistic structural rollout strategy leverages patterns from high-quality functions."
  - [section 3.3.6]: "The core idea of PSR is to replace uninformed random rollout with a structure-aware, experience-guided sampling process... achieved by maintaining a PSR table... constructed incrementally based on the historically k-best priority functions."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing direct corpus evidence for this specific PSR mechanism.
- Break condition: If the initial solutions are poor or misleading, the PSR table will reinforce bad structures, causing the search to get stuck in a local optimum.

### Mechanism 3: Direct Optimization of System-Level Objectives
- Claim: Using the global objective (e.g., minimize average travel time) directly as the MCTS reward avoids the train-test misalignment common in DRL methods that use surrogate rewards.
- Mechanism: The reward for a terminal MCTS node (a complete priority function) is the reciprocal of the average travel time obtained when that policy is executed in a traffic simulator. An adaptive reward shaping mechanism normalizes this by the best reward seen so far, keeping Q-values stable.
- Core assumption: The system-level objective is directly optimizable via this search process without needing dense, local surrogate rewards.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...enabling direct optimization of system-level objectives."
  - [section 1]: "SymLight allows global, system-level objectives to be directly used as the reward signal during training, thereby avoiding common reward-objective mismatches..."
  - [section 3.3.3]: "SymLight directly employs its global and ultimate objective as the reward. For a terminal node in MCTS, the reciprocal of the average travel time obtained from its priority function will serve as the node's reward."
  - [corpus]: This is a key differentiator from many DRL methods (CoLight, MPLight) which often optimize local metrics (queue length, pressure).
- Break condition: If the simulation evaluation is too noisy or the objective is too sparse, the reward signal may be insufficient to guide MCTS effectively.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Why needed here: The core algorithm used to search the discrete space of symbolic expressions. You must understand the four steps (selection, expansion, rollout, backpropagation) and the UCT formula to follow the SymLight method.
- Quick check question: In the selection step, which node does MCTS choose to expand, and what principle (exploration vs. exploitation) does the UCT formula balance?

### Concept: Symbolic Regression / Expression Trees
- Why needed here: The policy is not a neural network but a mathematical function represented as a tree of operators and variables. Understanding how a list of tokens maps to a tree (via breadth-first traversal and arity) is critical.
- Quick check question: Given the token list [×, +, A, B, C] and arities (×:2, +:2, A:0, B:0, C:0), draw the expression tree.

### Concept: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) as an MDP
- Why needed here: To frame the problem correctly. You need to know the standard definition of state (traffic features), action (phase selection), and reward in this domain to appreciate SymLight's approach.
- Quick check question: Why is optimizing for a local reward (e.g., queue length at one intersection) potentially misaligned with the system-level goal of minimizing city-wide average travel time?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
1. **Priority Function Representation Module**: Defines the search space. Encodes a policy as a linear token list, validates it, and converts it to an executable mathematical function.
2. **MCTS Search Engine**: Explores the space. Performs selection (using UCT), expansion (adding tokens), rollout (using PSR to build a complete function), and backpropagation (updating Q-values). It interfaces with a traffic simulator to evaluate complete functions.

### Critical path:
1. **MCTS Selection & Expansion**: A partial token list is created.
2. **PSR-guided Rollout**: This partial list is completed into a full, valid priority function using the probabilistic model from past good solutions.
3. **Simulation & Reward**: The completed function is evaluated in the CityFlow simulator for the full episode duration, and the reciprocal of average travel time becomes the reward.

### Design tradeoffs:
The maximum operator limit (e.g., 6) keeps policies simple and deployable but may restrict them from modeling very complex traffic dynamics. The choice of operators (+, -, ×, min, max) is also a constraint.

### Failure signatures:
- **Search Stagnation**: If the PSR table is initialized with poor solutions or α is too low, the rollout will lack diversity and the search will converge to a suboptimal policy. Symptoms include a plateau in the reward curve.
- **Deployability Issues**: If the evolved function is overly complex or contains problematic operations (e.g., unprotected division causing errors), it will fail on edge hardware.

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Baseline Reproduction**: Re-run the main experiment (Table 1) on one dataset (e.g., Hangzhou1). Implement the token list representation and the standard MCTS loop with random rollout. Compare its performance to the reported SymLight results.
2. **Ablation of PSR**: On the same dataset, implement the Probabilistic Structural Rollout (PSR). Compare the convergence speed and final performance against the random rollout version from experiment 1.
3. **Cross-Scenario Generalization**: Train a policy on Hangzhou1 and evaluate it directly on Hangzhou2 (which has a different road layout). Compare its performance to a policy trained from scratch on Hangzhou2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the restricted operator set (+, -, ×, min, max) effectively capture complex, conditional control logic required for advanced scenarios like transit signal priority?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper limits the symbolic functions to basic mathematical operators (Section 3.1), but complex real-world scenarios often require discrete "if-then" logic that simple arithmetic expressions cannot easily represent.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on standard traffic flow optimization and do not evaluate scenarios requiring distinct behavioral modes or conditional exceptions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance analysis on datasets including emergency vehicles or buses, compared against methods supporting conditional branching (e.g., Genetic Programming or LLM-based agents).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational cost of the MCTS search strategy scale compared to evolutionary algorithms like GPLight+ when optimizing for city-wide networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes the "combinatorial explosion" of the action space (Section 3.2) and uses MCTS to mitigate it, but does not provide a comparative analysis of wall-clock training time or sample efficiency against the genetic programming baselines.
- Why unresolved: While the result is deployable, the search process may be prohibitively expensive for larger search spaces or more complex feature sets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of convergence rates and total simulation steps required for SymLight versus GPLight+ to reach optimal performance on the larger datasets (e.g., Manhattan).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust are the derived symbolic policies to sensor noise or partial feature failure in real-world deployment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework relies on eight specific traffic features (Section 3.1.2) obtained from sensors. While the paper tests generalization to unseen traffic flows (Appendix A.2), it assumes perfect observation of input features.
- Why unresolved: Real-world sensors often fail or provide noisy data; the sensitivity of the concise symbolic expressions to errors in input variables (e.g., miscounted waiting vehicles) is not quantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Stress tests evaluating policy performance when input features are stochastic or systematically missing.

## Limitations
- The PSR mechanism's precise implementation details remain unclear, particularly how the "parent" node is defined in the expression tree context
- The method's reliance on the initial population of high-quality solutions creates a chicken-and-egg problem that isn't fully addressed
- The computational overhead of simulating complete episodes for each MCTS rollout evaluation could become prohibitive in larger networks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core claim that symbolic representations enable interpretability and deployability is well-supported by the token list representation and the CityFlow evaluation results
- **Medium confidence**: The MCTS framework with standard components (UCT, expansion, backpropagation) is established, though the specific integration with symbolic expression trees is novel
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical results showing SymLight outperforming diverse baselines (DRL, practical, symbolic-regression) are convincing across six datasets, though exact baseline implementations remain unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation verification**: Replicate the PSR mechanism with clarified parent-child definitions on a single dataset to verify it improves convergence speed over random rollout
2. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Train a policy on one city's road network and evaluate directly on another city's network with different topology to test true generalizability claims
3. **Edge device deployment**: Deploy the discovered symbolic policies on actual resource-constrained hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to validate the claimed low computational overhead and real-time feasibility
