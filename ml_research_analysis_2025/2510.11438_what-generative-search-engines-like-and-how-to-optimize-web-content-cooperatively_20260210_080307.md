# What Generative Search Engines Like and How to Optimize Web Content Cooperatively

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11438
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11438
- Reference count: 36
- AutoGEO achieves 35.99% average improvement in GEO metrics while maintaining generative engine utility

## Executive Summary
AutoGEO introduces a systematic framework for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) that automatically extracts preference rules from generative engines and uses them to optimize web content. The framework employs LLMs to analyze document pairs with visibility differences, extracting meaningful preference rules that are then applied through prompt-based API or reinforcement learning-based Mini models. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in visibility metrics while preserving content quality and semantic integrity.

## Method Summary
AutoGEO works by first extracting preference rules through contrastive analysis of document pairs with maximum visibility differences. An LLM pipeline (Explainer, Extractor, Merger, Filter) generates a rule set from these pairs. The rules are then deployed via two approaches: AutoGEO API, which embeds rules into prompts for strong LLMs to rewrite documents, and AutoGEO Mini, a compact model trained via reinforcement learning using a composite reward function balancing visibility, rule adherence, and semantic fidelity.

## Key Results
- AutoGEO achieves an average 35.99% improvement in GEO metrics across GEO-Bench, Researchy-GEO, and E-commerce datasets
- AutoGEO API achieves significantly higher visibility scores (e.g., 43.76 Overall on Researchy-GEO) compared to baselines
- AutoGEO Mini offers substantial cost efficiency at ~0.0071x the cost of AutoGEO API while maintaining competitive performance
- Rule adherence is shown to be crucial for optimization success through ablation studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Contrastive analysis of document pairs reveals explicit, actionable preference rules that generative engines implicitly follow. The system selects pairs with maximum visibility difference and uses an LLM to articulate why one was preferred over the other. These explanations are distilled into a rule set.

### Mechanism 2
Embedding extracted preference rules directly into LLM context windows aligns content rewriting with GE preferences. The rule set is injected into system prompts as "Quality Guidelines" that the LLM uses to rewrite target documents.

### Mechanism 3
A compact model can be optimized via reinforcement learning using a composite reward function. The model is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization with rewards balancing visibility lift, rule adherence, and semantic consistency with original text.

## Foundational Learning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Understanding that generative engines first retrieve documents and then generate answers is crucial for distinguishing visibility (citation frequency) from relevance.

**Contrastive Learning/Pairwise Comparison:** The core rule extraction mechanism relies on comparing winning (cited) and losing (uncited) documents to isolate features causing preference.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL) Rewards:** AutoGEO Mini relies on designing a reward function where the model learns from score signals rather than ground-truth text.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Explainer (LLM) -> Extractor (LLM) -> Merger (LLM) -> Filter -> Rule Set

**Critical path:**
1. Query GE, get responses, calculate visibility for candidate docs
2. Identify document pairs with maximum visibility gap
3. Run 4-stage LLM pipeline to generate rule set
4. Insert rules into AutoGEO API prompt OR use for AutoGEO Mini training

**Design tradeoffs:** API vs Mini offers plug-and-play deployment with higher peak performance but costs ~140x more than Mini, which requires initial training but is more cost-effective.

**Failure signatures:**
- Semantic Drift: Model produces high-visibility text contradicting original source
- Generic Rules: Extractor produces tautologies that fail to improve visibility
- Over-fitting to Engine: Rules too specific to simulated GE and fail to transfer

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Extract rules from small subset and manually inspect for logical soundness
2. Train AutoGEO Mini using synthetic dataset from API teacher to verify learning of structure
3. Run GRPO training with only Outcome reward vs. Outcome + Rule to check rule component's impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Extending to agentic search engines:** The framework needs adaptation for multi-step planning and reasoning in agentic search, as current metrics don't capture citation performance across multi-step reasoning trajectories.

**Ecosystem-level impact:** Widespread adoption of cooperative GEO strategies by multiple content providers may lead to an "arms race" that eventually degrades generative engine utility.

**Faithfulness of extracted rules:** It's unclear whether LLM-extracted preference rules are faithful causal explanations of the engine's decision-making or merely post-hoc rationalizations correlating with visibility.

## Limitations

The contrastive rule extraction mechanism assumes the Explainer LLM can accurately reverse-engineer GE decision boundaries, introducing uncertainty about whether rules reflect actual preferences or model hallucinations. The semantic reward calculation relies on metrics that may not fully capture factual accuracy and content integrity. The cost-effectiveness claims for AutoGEO Mini assume stable API pricing and don't account for computational overhead of training and maintenance.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core experimental results showing 35.99% average improvement and superior visibility metrics are well-documented with specific numbers and ablation studies.

**Medium Confidence:** Rule transferability across domains and engines is demonstrated but not tested on completely unseen GEs or radically different content types.

**Low Confidence:** Absolute cost-effectiveness claims for AutoGEO Mini assume stable pricing and don't account for training overhead.

## Next Checks

1. **Rule Extraction Validation:** Test Explainer LLM accuracy by comparing extracted rules against known GE preference patterns in controlled experiments.

2. **Semantic Reward Robustness:** Conduct adversarial testing where AutoGEO Mini handles documents with subtle factual inaccuracies to verify semantic reward prevents hallucination.

3. **Long-term Stability:** Monitor AutoGEO-optimized content over extended periods to assess whether visibility gains persist as GE algorithms evolve.
