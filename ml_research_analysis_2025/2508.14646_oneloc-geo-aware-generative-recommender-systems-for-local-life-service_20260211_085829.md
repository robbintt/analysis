# OneLoc: Geo-Around Generative Recommender Systems for Local Life Service

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.14646
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Key result**: 21.016% improvement in GMV and 17.891% in order numbers for local life service recommendation at scale

## Executive Summary
OneLoc is an end-to-end generative recommendation model specifically designed for local life service scenarios. The model uniquely integrates geographic information through geo-aware semantic IDs, geo-aware self-attention, and neighbor-aware prompts, enabling a balance between user interests and real-time location. By employing reinforcement learning with both geographic and gross merchandise value (GMV) rewards, OneLoc optimizes for business objectives while adapting to the user's immediate context. The system is deployed in Kuaishou's local life service, serving 400 million daily active users, and demonstrates significant improvements over traditional and generative baselines.

## Method Summary
OneLoc introduces a novel generative framework for local life service recommendation by incorporating geographic context at multiple levels. The model uses geo-aware semantic IDs to encode location information, geo-aware self-attention to capture spatial dependencies, and neighbor-aware prompts to integrate nearby business features. A reinforcement learning approach optimizes both geographic relevance and business outcomes (GMV). This design enables the system to dynamically adjust recommendations based on the user's real-time location and surrounding options, improving both user satisfaction and business metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves 21.016% improvement in gross merchandise value (GMV) in online deployment
- Increases order numbers by 17.891% in real-world use
- Outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in offline and online experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OneLoc's effectiveness stems from its multi-faceted integration of geographic information, which traditional models often overlook. By encoding location context through semantic IDs, the model can capture nuanced spatial relationships. Geo-aware self-attention allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different geographic factors, while neighbor-aware prompts ensure that nearby business features are considered in real time. The use of reinforcement learning aligns the model's optimization with business objectives (GMV) and geographic relevance, making it adaptable to the rapidly changing context of local life services. This holistic approach addresses the unique challenges of location-based recommendations, such as the need for real-time adaptation and the integration of heterogeneous geographic signals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Geo-aware semantic IDs**: Encode location information into the model's representation space, enabling nuanced spatial reasoning. *Why needed*: Traditional models lack fine-grained geographic context. *Quick check*: Verify that location-based embeddings improve recommendation relevance.
- **Geo-aware self-attention**: Allows the model to dynamically weigh geographic factors when processing user and item features. *Why needed*: Spatial relationships are not uniformly important across contexts. *Quick check*: Assess attention weights for different geographic distances.
- **Neighbor-aware prompts**: Integrate features of nearby businesses to reflect real-time local options. *Why needed*: User preferences are influenced by immediate surroundings. *Quick check*: Confirm that nearby business features enhance recommendation diversity.
- **Reinforcement learning with geographic and GMV rewards**: Aligns model optimization with both user satisfaction and business outcomes. *Why needed*: Static metrics do not capture dynamic business goals. *Quick check*: Evaluate changes in GMV and order numbers after RL fine-tuning.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User features → Geo-aware semantic IDs → Geo-aware self-attention → Neighbor-aware prompts → Generative recommendation → Reinforcement learning (geographic & GMV rewards)
- **Critical path**: User features → Geo-aware semantic IDs → Geo-aware self-attention → Generative recommendation → Business metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balances model complexity (multiple geo-aware modules) with real-time inference requirements; uses reinforcement learning for dynamic adaptation but at the cost of training stability.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance in sparse geographic regions; overemphasis on nearby options may reduce diversity; reinforcement learning instability if reward signals are noisy.
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Compare recommendation quality with and without geo-aware semantic IDs on a local service dataset.
  2. Evaluate the impact of neighbor-aware prompts by toggling nearby business feature integration.
  3. Test reinforcement learning with only geographic reward versus both geographic and GMV rewards.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of independent replication and open-source code/data limits verification of results.
- Specific contribution of each geo-aware component is not clearly isolated via ablation studies.
- Model's generalizability to other domains or regions is uncertain due to reliance on proprietary datasets.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: General architecture and reported trends are sound and well-motivated.
- **Medium confidence**: Improvements in GMV and order numbers are impressive but based on a single deployment.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about individual component impacts lack detailed ablation evidence.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the model on a public local service dataset to verify performance gains.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating each geo-aware component to quantify their individual contributions.
3. Test the model's robustness across diverse geographic regions and service types to assess generalizability.
