## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Iterative Hessian Mixing (IHM), a novel algorithm for differentially private ordinary least squares regression. IHM builds on Gaussian sketching techniques and iterative Hessian sketching to provide strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. Theoretical analysis shows IHM achieves near-optimal error bounds that decay exponentially with iterations, outperforming prior methods like AdaSSP and linear mixing in most regimes. Empirical evaluation across 33 datasets demonstrates IHM consistently matches or improves upon state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of privacy levels and problem settings, even when theoretical assumptions are violated. The method uses simple, globally-set hyperparameters and requires no data-dependent tuning. IHM represents a significant advance in private regression, combining the benefits of Gaussian sketching with the accuracy improvements of iterative methods.

## Method Summary
IHM is a differentially private ordinary least squares regression algorithm that iteratively updates parameters using a sketched Hessian approximation and a noisy, clipped gradient. The algorithm uses Gaussian sketches to approximate the Hessian while maintaining privacy, with noise calibrated based on a private estimate of the minimum eigenvalue. At each iteration, IHM samples Gaussian sketching matrices, computes a sketched Hessian, and updates parameters using both the sketched Hessian and a gradient term that's clipped and privatized. The method requires only globally-set hyperparameters (sketch size, number of iterations) and no data-dependent tuning, making it simple to implement and deploy.

## Key Results
- IHM achieves near-optimal error bounds that decay exponentially with iterations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like AdaSSP and linear mixing
- Theoretical analysis shows error bounds that depend polynomially on the condition number but only logarithmically on other parameters
- Empirical evaluation on 33 datasets shows IHM consistently matches or improves upon baselines across all privacy levels, particularly excelling when residuals are small or the design matrix is well-conditioned

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Geometric Error Contraction via Iterative Sketching
If the sketch size $k$ and eigenvalue conditions are met, the excess empirical risk decays geometrically (exponentially) with the number of iterations $T$. The algorithm approximates the Newton update by inverting a sketched Hessian ($\frac{1}{k}\tilde{X}_t^\top\tilde{X}_t$) rather than the full Hessian. This mimics the non-private *Iterative Hessian Sketch* (IHS), creating a recursion where the error shrinks by a factor related to the sketch accuracy at each step. If the sketch size $k$ is too small or the condition number $\kappa_X$ is too high, the geometric contraction fails, and error may accumulate rather than decay.

### Mechanism 2: Privacy-Utility Decoupling via Hessian-Only Sketching
Applying the sketch only to the design matrix $X$ (and not the response $Y$) in the Hessian term improves utility compared to sketching the joint matrix $(X,Y)$, provided $X$ is well-conditioned. Previous methods (Linear Mixing) sketched the concatenated matrix $[X, Y]$, making noise scales dependent on the minimum eigenvalue of the joint matrix $\lambda_{XY}^{min}$. IHM uses the sketch only for the Hessian term, linking the noise scale to $\lambda_{min}(X^\top X)$, which is often larger and more stable than the joint eigenvalue. If $\lambda_{min}(X^\top X)$ is very small (ill-conditioned design), the inversion becomes unstable, and the separate gradient noise term ($\sigma$) may dominate, negating the benefit of separating $X$ and $Y$.

### Mechanism 3: Bounded Sensitivity via Residual Clipping
Clipping the residuals ($Y - X\hat{\theta}_t$) ensures the sensitivity of the gradient term remains bounded, allowing the Gaussian mechanism to guarantee privacy without excessive noise. The gradient calculation uses $\text{clip}_C(Y - X\hat{\theta}_t)$. Without this, changing one data point could arbitrarily shift the gradient if the residual is unbounded. Clipping caps this shift (sensitivity), allowing a fixed $\sigma$ to privatize the gradient. If $C$ is set too low, the clipped residuals become poor approximations of the true gradient, causing the optimizer to converge to a biased, suboptimal solution.

## Foundational Learning

- **Differential Privacy (DP) Composition**: IHM is an iterative algorithm. Understanding how privacy loss accumulates over $T$ iterations is critical to realizing why the noise parameter $\gamma$ must scale with $\sqrt{T}$. Quick check: If you double the number of iterations $T$, how does the total privacy budget $\epsilon$ change if you keep the noise $\sigma$ constant?

- **Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma / Random Projections**: The core "sketching" operation relies on random Gaussian matrices preserving pairwise distances (or norms) of the data vectors with high probability. This justifies why $\frac{1}{k}S^\top S \approx I$. Quick check: Why does multiplying by a random Gaussian matrix preserve the spectral properties of the original matrix $X$?

- **Condition Number & Ridge Regression**: The error bounds depend heavily on $\lambda_{min}$. If $\lambda_{min} \to 0$, the matrix is ill-conditioned. Understanding Ridge Regression helps explain why the regularization term ($+\eta I$) is added to the Hessian to ensure invertibility. Quick check: In the update rule, what acts as the implicit regularization term to prevent division by zero when inverting the sketched Hessian?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Ingest -> Privacy Calibration Unit -> Sketching Engine -> Optimization Loop -> Output
- **Critical path**: The matrix multiplication $S_t X$ (Line 5) and the inversion of the sketched Hessian $(\tilde{X}_t^\top \tilde{X}_t)^{-1}$ (Line 7). The system must efficiently handle these $k \times n$ and $d \times d$ operations.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sketch Size ($k$): Larger $k$ improves approximation accuracy (lower error) but increases compute cost (larger matrix multiply)
  - Iterations ($T$): More iterations reduce the "algorithmic error" (geometric decay) but increase the "privacy error" (noise accumulation)
  - Clipping Threshold ($C$): Must be large enough to avoid bias but small enough to keep sensitivity manageable
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Exploding Gradients/NaNs: Often occurs if the sketched Hessian is singular (check $\lambda_{min}$ and $k$ relative to $d$)
  - Non-decreasing Error: If the noise term dominates the signal (likely if $\epsilon$ is very small or $T$ is too large)
  - High Bias: If clipping thresholds are too aggressive, the model fits the clipped residuals rather than true values
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Eigenvalue Sweep: Generate synthetic data with varying condition numbers (fixed $n, d$). Plot final MSE vs. $\lambda_{min}$ to verify the theoretical eigenvalue dependency
  2. Iteration Calibration: Run IHM with varying $T \in \{1, \dots, 10\}$ on a fixed dataset. Plot MSE vs. $T$ to visualize the "U-curve" where geometric decay meets noise accumulation
  3. Baselines Comparison: Compare IHM against AdaSSP and Linear Mixing on a "low residual" dataset (e.g., Solar) vs. a "high residual" dataset (e.g., Pol) to verify where IHM gains are largest

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the linear dependence on the number of iterations $T$ in the privacy bound be eliminated or reduced to improve the accuracy-privacy trade-off? The current theoretical analysis implies the noise scale $\gamma_{hess}$ increases with $\sqrt{T}$, which potentially limits the utility gains from running more iterations. A modified privacy analysis or algorithmic variant where the noise variance does not scale with $T$, or a lower bound proof demonstrating this dependence is unavoidable, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the Iterative Hessian Mixing framework be extended to a private Newton Sketch algorithm applicable to general convex loss functions? The current method is derived specifically for the quadratic loss of Ordinary Least Squares (DP-OLS) and relies on properties specific to linear regression. A theoretical derivation of utility and privacy guarantees for IHM applied to non-quadratic convex objectives (e.g., logistic regression) and empirical validation on classification tasks would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can structured random projections replace Gaussian sketches in this framework to improve computational efficiency without degrading privacy guarantees? Gaussian sketches are computationally expensive ($O(ndk)$), whereas structured projections (e.g., SRHT) are faster, but their specific privacy and convergence properties within the IHM iterative loop remain unanalyzed. A proof that a fast structured sketch (like the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform) satisfies the required differential privacy constraints and maintains the geometric convergence rate of IHM would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis assumes idealized conditions where the Hessian sketch provides perfect approximation and gradient noise is negligible, which may break down for ill-conditioned datasets or extreme privacy budgets
- The clipping threshold C is set to CY, but this may not be optimal across all datasets, and the theoretical justification for omitting the regularization term -η²θ̂_t is unclear
- The CalibrateMixingNoise algorithm requires solving an optimization problem from Lev et al. 2025 involving the φ(α; k, γ) function not fully specified in this paper

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The geometric error contraction mechanism is well-supported by the theoretical analysis and aligns with established results in iterative Hessian sketching
- **Medium Confidence**: The privacy-utility decoupling claim is supported by the error bound analysis and empirical results, but the practical benefit depends heavily on the conditioning of the specific dataset
- **Medium Confidence**: The bounded sensitivity claim follows standard DP-SGD principles, but the optimal clipping threshold selection is not theoretically justified

## Next Checks
1. **Condition Number Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the condition number of synthetic datasets to empirically verify the theoretical bounds on the relationship between λ_min and final MSE
2. **Hyperparameter Robustness**: Test IHM with varying T values (1, 2, 3, 4) on datasets where ∥θ*∥ is small vs. large to validate the recommendation to reduce T in low-residual regimes
3. **Sketch Size Calibration**: Experiment with different k multipliers (beyond the fixed 6) to determine if the theoretical bound k = 6·max{d, log(4T/ϱ)} is overly conservative or requires dataset-specific tuning
