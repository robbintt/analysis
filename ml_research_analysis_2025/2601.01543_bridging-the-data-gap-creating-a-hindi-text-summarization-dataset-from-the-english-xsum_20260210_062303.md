# Bridging the Data Gap: Creating a Hindi Text Summarization Dataset from the English XSUM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01543
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Automated framework creates high-quality Hindi text summarization dataset from English XSUM using translation validation metrics

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical shortage of high-quality Hindi text summarization datasets by proposing an automated, cost-effective framework that translates the English XSUM dataset. The approach combines forward and back-translation with semantic similarity validation using metrics like BERTScore, COMET, and TER. Large Language Models are selectively deployed for curation to maintain contextual relevance while controlling costs. The resulting dataset offers a diverse, multi-thematic resource that preserves the complexity of the original XSUM corpus while enabling Hindi NLP development.

## Method Summary
The framework translates English XSUM articles to Hindi through a tiered system: S1 uses standard machine translation with LibreTranslate, S2 employs paraphrasing-based retranslation (later deprecated due to high variability), and S3 applies one-shot LLM translation for difficult cases. Quality filtering relies on TER and BERTScore thresholds applied to backtranslations, with low-scoring outputs routed to human annotation via doccano. The pipeline preserves document-summary relationships through ROUGE score comparison, and final datasets are published to HuggingFace. The methodology aims to democratize NLP in underserved languages through scalable, automated approaches.

## Key Results
- BERTScore values achieved: 0.898 for documents, 0.940 for summaries
- Translation quality validated using COMET and selective LLM curation
- Dataset provides diverse, multi-thematic resource mirroring XSUM complexity
- Evaluation metrics demonstrate high fidelity and semantic coherence
- Scalable methodology enables NLP development in low-resource languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Backtranslation combined with semantic similarity metrics provides a proxy quality signal for translations when no ground-truth reference exists. English text is translated to Hindi (forward), then Hindi back to English. The backtranslated text is compared to the original using BERTScore, COMET, and TER. High semantic similarity (BERTScore >0.85, COMET >0.4) suggests the intermediate Hindi preserved meaning. Core assumption: Good backtranslation correlation implies good forward translation quality—this may fail for paraphrase-prone content or asymmetric language pairs.

### Mechanism 2
Tiered translation with metric-based filtering reduces LLM usage costs while maintaining output quality. S1 (standard MT like LibreTranslate) processes all content first. Low-quality outputs (high TER, low BERTScore) are flagged for S3 (one-shot LLM translation). S2 (paraphrasing-based) showed high variability and was deprioritized. Core assumption: The TER and BERTScore thresholds correctly identify translation failures that LLMs would fix.

### Mechanism 3
Cross-lingual semantic structure (document-summary relationship) can be preserved through careful translation pipelines. ROUGE scores between Hindi documents and Hindi summaries are compared to original English pairs. Similar F1-scores indicate the summarization task difficulty is maintained. Core assumption: ROUGE correlation across languages implies task equivalence—cultural/language-specific summarization patterns may differ.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Abstractive vs. Extractive Summarization**
  - Why needed here: XSUM is explicitly abstractive (single-sentence summaries not copied from source), which makes translation harder than extractive tasks where sentence boundaries are preserved.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why backtranslation validation is more reliable for extractive than abstractive summarization datasets?

- Concept: **Translation Evaluation Metrics (BERTScore, COMET, TER, BLEU)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on metric thresholds to automate quality filtering; misunderstanding what each metric captures leads to incorrect filtering decisions.
  - Quick check question: Which metric would best catch a translation that is grammatically correct but factually wrong?

- Concept: **Hallucination in LLM Translation**
  - Why needed here: One-shot LLM translation (S3) risks generating fluent but unfaithful content; this is noted but not deeply quantified.
  - Quick check question: How would you detect hallucination in a translated summary when you don't speak the target language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Preprocessing: Text normalization, JSON formatting, newline/space handling
  - S1 System: Forward translation (LibreTranslate) → backtranslation → NLP error correction → metric evaluation
  - S2 System: Paraphrasing → retranslation → evaluation (deprecated due to variability)
  - S3 System: One-shot LLM translation → evaluation
  - Filtering Gate: TER + BERTScore threshold determines if content needs S3 or proceeds to human review
  - Human Annotation: doccano UI for final curation

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess XSUM article → JSON format
  2. Run S1 forward + back translation
  3. Calculate TER, BERTScore, COMET on backtranslation vs. original
  4. If TER high / BERTScore low: route to S3 LLM translation
  5. If still flagged: route to human annotation in doccano
  6. Publish filtered dataset to HuggingFace

- Design tradeoffs:
  - S1 (free/cheap) vs. S3 (expensive but higher quality on difficult cases)
  - Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop (paper claims significant reduction in human annotation needs)
  - Metric strictness: tighter thresholds improve quality but increase costs

- Failure signatures:
  - Negative COMET scores (seen in S2: -0.194 minimum) indicate semantic inversion
  - TER > 100 (S2 max: 859) indicates near-complete rewrite needed
  - BLEU = 0.0 (seen in S1/S2 minimums) indicates no n-gram overlap

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate S1 pipeline on 10 XSUM articles; verify BERTScore > 0.85 on backtranslation.
  2. Inject deliberate translation errors (word deletion, entity swap) and observe which metrics detect them.
  3. Compare S1 vs. S3 on a held-out domain (e.g., sports vs. politics articles) to measure domain sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effectively does the proposed framework scale to low-resource languages with morphological structures significantly different from Hindi (e.g., agglutinative or tonal languages)? Basis in paper: Section 1.10.2 outlines the adaptability of the framework as a key future goal, noting that while the metrics are language-agnostic, the specific implementation has only been validated for Hindi. Why unresolved: The current study validates the methodology exclusively on Hindi (Indo-Aryan); its efficacy across diverse linguistic families remains theoretical. What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the pipeline to a non-Indo-Aryan low-resource language with comparable or superior metric performance relative to standard translation baselines.

### Open Question 2
Can TER and BERTScore thresholds effectively filter out "hallucinations" in one-shot LLM translations without discarding valid abstractive summaries? Basis in paper: Section 1.6.6 identifies "potential model hallucinating" as a drawback of the LLM approach, and Section 1.9 proposes using TER and BERTScore to filter articles to reduce costs. Why unresolved: The paper establishes a correlation between high scores and reference similarity, but does not quantify the false-negative rate where valid creative summaries might be filtered alongside hallucinations. What evidence would resolve it: A human annotation study comparing the rate of factual inconsistencies in the filtered dataset versus the raw LLM output.

### Open Question 3
Does high performance on backtranslation metrics (e.g., COMET, BERTScore) reliably guarantee cultural relevance and naturalness in the forward Hindi translation? Basis in paper: Section 1.6.3 states that "a good backtranslation does not necessarily equate to a good forward translation," yet the evaluation relies heavily on these backtranslation metrics to assert quality. Why unresolved: The authors claim the dataset provides "culturally relevant" translations, but validating solely by reconstructing the English source may miss awkward phrasing or cultural mismatches in the Hindi target. What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis between the automated backtranslation scores and human evaluations of fluency and cultural appropriateness for the Hindi text.

## Limitations
- Lack of explicit threshold values for TER and BERTScore filtering makes reproducibility difficult
- S3 LLM translation system specifics (model name, prompts, API configuration) are not detailed
- Validation approach assumes backtranslation quality correlates with forward translation quality, which may not hold for abstractive summarization
- Dataset size unclear - only 25 articles mentioned in preprocessing despite full XSUM corpus reference

## Confidence
- High confidence in fundamental methodology (translation + backtranslation + metric filtering)
- Medium confidence in automated quality thresholds and filtering criteria
- Low confidence in specific implementation details of LLM translation system and exact performance characteristics across different content domains

## Next Checks
1. Implement the S1 pipeline on a small sample (10-20 articles) and verify that the reported BERTScore values (0.898 for documents, 0.940 for summaries) are achievable with the described tools and configuration.

2. Test the backtranslation correlation hypothesis by deliberately introducing controlled translation errors and measuring which metrics (BERTScore, COMET, TER, BLEU) most reliably detect semantic drift versus surface-level differences.

3. Compare ROUGE scores between English and Hindi document-summary pairs across multiple content domains to validate that the summarization task difficulty and structure are preserved through the translation pipeline.
