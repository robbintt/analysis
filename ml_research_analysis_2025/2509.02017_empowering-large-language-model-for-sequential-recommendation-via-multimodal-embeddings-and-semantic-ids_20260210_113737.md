# Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.02017
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02017
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MME-SID achieves 9.93%, 4.42%, and 8.12% improvements in nDCG@5 on Beauty, Toys & Games, and Sports & Outdoors Amazon datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two critical challenges in LLM-based sequential recommendation: embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when using semantic IDs. The authors propose MME-SID, a framework that integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate these issues. The core method involves a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which preserves intra-modal distance information and captures inter-modal correlations.

## Method Summary
The MME-SID framework addresses embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting in LLM-based sequential recommendation through a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE). The architecture employs maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, preserving intra-modal distance information while capturing inter-modal correlations. The model is initialized with trained multimodal code embeddings and fine-tuned using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. This approach effectively integrates multimodal embeddings with quantized embeddings to overcome the limitations of traditional embedding methods in LLM-based recommendation systems.

## Key Results
- MME-SID achieves 9.93% improvement in nDCG@5 on Beauty dataset compared to best baseline
- 4.42% improvement in nDCG@5 on Toys & Games dataset
- 8.12% improvement in nDCG@5 on Sports & Outdoors dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing two fundamental problems in LLM-based sequential recommendation. First, embedding collapse occurs when pre-trained collaborative embeddings are incorporated, causing loss of semantic information. Second, catastrophic forgetting happens when using semantic IDs, where the model forgets previously learned quantized embeddings. MME-SID resolves these issues through multimodal residual quantization that preserves both intra-modal distances and inter-modal correlations. The MM-RQ-VAE architecture uses maximum mean discrepancy loss to maintain reconstruction quality while contrastive learning aligns different modalities effectively.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Embedding Collapse** - Why needed: Prevents loss of semantic information when incorporating pre-trained embeddings. Quick check: Monitor embedding distances during training to ensure semantic relationships are preserved.

2. **Catastrophic Forgetting** - Why needed: Ensures quantized embeddings retain learned information when fine-tuning. Quick check: Test model performance on previously seen items after fine-tuning to verify knowledge retention.

3. **Maximum Mean Discrepancy** - Why needed: Provides effective reconstruction loss that preserves distributional properties. Quick check: Compare reconstruction quality using MMD versus traditional L2 loss on multimodal data.

4. **Contrastive Learning** - Why needed: Aligns different modalities while preserving their unique characteristics. Quick check: Evaluate cross-modal retrieval performance to verify alignment quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Embeddings -> MM-RQ-VAE -> LoRA Fine-tuning -> LLM Output

**Critical Path**: The core processing path involves multimodal input embeddings flowing through the MM-RQ-VAE for quantization and reconstruction, then being fused with LoRA adapters before reaching the LLM for final recommendation generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades increased computational complexity for improved embedding quality and reduced forgetting. The multimodal approach requires more training resources but provides better semantic preservation compared to single-modality methods.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include over-regularization causing loss of fine-grained details, modality imbalance leading to dominant embedding types, and gradient vanishing during LoRA fine-tuning if learning rates are not properly tuned.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test embedding collapse by comparing pre-trained embeddings with MM-RQ-VAE outputs on semantic similarity tasks
2. Validate catastrophic forgetting by measuring performance degradation on quantized embeddings after fine-tuning
3. Evaluate multimodal alignment by testing cross-modal retrieval accuracy before and after contrastive learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to three Amazon datasets, potentially limiting generalizability to other recommendation domains
- Computational overhead and scalability concerns not fully addressed for practical deployment
- No detailed analysis of model complexity, training time, or inference latency compared to baseline methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental results demonstrating performance improvements are well-documented and statistically significant across multiple datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical justification for addressing embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting is sound, but long-term stability requires further validation
- **Medium confidence**: Architectural innovations are technically sound, but their relative contribution needs more systematic ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of multimodal embeddings versus quantized embeddings
2. Evaluate framework performance on additional datasets beyond Amazon product recommendations to assess generalizability
3. Analyze computational efficiency and scalability requirements for real-world deployment scenarios
