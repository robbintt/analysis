# Proof of Time: A Benchmark for Evaluating Scientific Idea Judgments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07606
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07606
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces PoT, a time-partitioned benchmark enabling verifiable evaluation of scientific idea judgments using pre-cutoff evidence and post-cutoff outcomes

## Executive Summary
PoT introduces a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework for evaluating models' scientific idea judgments by linking pre-cutoff evidence to post-cutoff outcomes like citations, awards, and research trajectories. It uses an offline sandbox to freeze evidence at a cutoff time, requiring models to forecast future signals, enabling scalable evaluation without exhaustive expert annotation. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four domains, tool-using agents show large gains on evidence-intensive tasks (e.g., Faculty, Citations) but smaller improvements on structured prediction tasks (e.g., Awards, SOTA). Higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, though benefits vary by model family and task type.

## Method Summary
PoT constructs a time-partitioned benchmark where models must forecast post-cutoff outcomes (citations, awards, faculty trajectories, SOTA rankings) using only frozen pre-cutoff evidence snapshots. The evaluation runs in an offline Docker sandbox with restricted tools (bash, Python, text editor) and no network access. Three solver configurations are tested: zero-shot generation, agentic ReAct loops, and agentic+structured prompts, with message limits of 15/30/50. Post-cutoff outcomes provide ground truth for exact-match accuracy scoring. The benchmark covers 30,000+ instances across four domains using OpenReview paper metadata, Google Scholar citations, benchmark leaderboards, and author disambiguation heuristics.

## Key Results
- Tool-using agents show large gains on evidence-intensive tasks (e.g., Faculty accuracy rising from near-zero to ~2/3 with tools enabled)
- Higher message budgets improve accuracy for most models, with Claude showing steepest gains while GPT plateaus earlier
- Structured prompts help some model families (Claude) but may over-constrain others (GPT)
- Post-cutoff evaluation can materially shift model rankings compared to pre-cutoff evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal partitioning enables contamination-resistant evaluation by constraining models to pre-cutoff evidence while scoring against post-cutoff outcomes.
- Mechanism: The benchmark freezes evidence snapshot E≤t0 in an offline sandbox, requires models to predict y at t1>t0, and scores predictions only after ground truth arrives.
- Core assumption: Training data contamination is temporally bounded; models cannot infer post-cutoff outcomes from patterns in pre-cutoff evidence alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives"
  - [section 3.1] "Each PoT instance is defined by a tuple (E≤t0, q, yt1)... crucially, PoT separates frozen evidence... from post-cutoff outcomes"
- Break condition: If models' training data includes post-cutoff outcomes or if pre-cutoff evidence strongly correlates with future outcomes through memorized patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tool-using agents improve performance on evidence-intensive tasks by enabling iterative retrieval and verification within the frozen snapshot.
- Mechanism: Agents operate in a sandboxed Docker environment with bash, Python, and text editor access. They can explore mounted artifacts, compute features, and justify decisions through multi-step ReAct loops.
- Core assumption: The frozen evidence contains sufficient signal for the task; agent overhead translates into more effective evidence utilization rather than wasted computation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "tool-using agents show large gains on evidence-intensive tasks (e.g., Faculty, Citations) but smaller improvements on structured prediction tasks (e.g., Awards, SOTA)"
  - [section 5.2] "Faculty shows the largest improvement, with agentic accuracy rising from near-zero in zero-shot to roughly two-thirds when tools are enabled"
- Break condition: If tasks require reasoning beyond available evidence or if agents cannot formulate effective retrieval strategies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Test-time compute scaling via message limits improves accuracy by extending evidence-gathering and verification capacity.
- Mechanism: Increasing message limits (15→30→50) allows more agent-environment interactions. Successful runs follow a "retrieve-verify-commit" pattern.
- Core assumption: Additional interactions translate into productive exploration rather than looping or redundant steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "across most models, increasing the budget yields large improvements... Claude models show the steepest gains"
  - [section 6.3] "incomplete runs are primarily characterized by looping/thrashing and budget exhaustion"
- Break condition: When agents enter retrieval loops or fail to converge, additional message budget increases token costs without accuracy gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Benchmark data contamination (BDC)
  - Why needed here: PoT's core motivation is evaluating models without contamination from training data exposure to post-cutoff outcomes.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why static benchmarks become unreliable as training corpora expand?

- Concept: ReAct agent loop
  - Why needed here: PoT's agentic evaluation uses single-agent ReAct loops; understanding reasoning-acting interleaving is essential for interpreting trace diagnostics.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a ReAct loop from a single-pass generation?

- Concept: Time-indexed forecasting
  - Why needed here: PoT tasks are inherently temporal—citations, awards, SOTA trajectories—all require predicting future states from historical evidence.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model's performance differ on pre-cutoff vs. post-cutoff evaluation splits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection layer -> Sandbox execution layer -> Task instantiation layer -> Evaluation layer

- Critical path:
  1. Collect t0 snapshot → construct sandbox manifests
  2. Run solvers (zero-shot or agentic) under message limits
  3. Collect t1 snapshot → derive ground-truth labels
  4. Score predictions; analyze traces for failure modes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Offline sandbox prevents leakage but reduces realism vs. deployed assistants with live web access
  - Bucketed outputs (e.g., citation ranges) reduce sensitivity to minor fluctuations but lose granularity
  - Structured prompts help some model families (Claude) but may over-constrain others (GPT)

- Failure signatures:
  - Retrieval/tooling failures (36.3% of wrong answers): agent retrieves broadly relevant materials but misattributes to target instance
  - Looping/thrashing (36.5% of incomplete runs): repeated retrieval cycles without convergence
  - Reasoning errors (37.7% of wrong answers): commits based on partial evidence without verification

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run zero-shot vs. agentic comparison on Faculty task at message limit 50 to verify evidence-intensive task gains.
  2. Ablate structured prompt on Claude vs. GPT models to confirm family-dependent prompt effects.
  3. Compare pre-cutoff vs. post-cutoff Awards accuracy for a single model to quantify potential contamination effects.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why does test-time compute scaling effectiveness vary so dramatically across model families (Claude showing steepest gains, GPT plateauing earlier)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1 notes "Claude models show the steepest gains... Gemini models show strong initial performance but more moderate marginal gains. GPT models improve with budget but tend to plateau earlier."
- Why unresolved: The paper quantifies the differences but does not investigate underlying causes (e.g., architecture, training data, or inference-time reasoning strategies).
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying model components, or analysis of interaction traces to identify where different models stall.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive are PoT rankings to the choice of cutoff time (t₀) and prediction horizon (t₁)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section: "Labels depend on the choice of cutoff t₀ and horizon t₁... different horizons or collection pipelines may yield different difficulty profiles."
- Why unresolved: Only one cutoff/horizon configuration is evaluated; generalization to other temporal partitions is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-running benchmarks with multiple cutoff dates and horizons, comparing resulting model rankings and error patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would agent performance change if live web retrieval were permitted instead of offline-only sandbox access?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section: "The offline sandbox intentionally removes live web access... This improves experimental control but departs from how researchers and deployed assistants typically operate."
- Why unresolved: All experiments use frozen offline evidence; the delta from live retrieval remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation comparing offline vs. online retrieval on the same tasks, measuring both accuracy gains and contamination risk.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What prompt structures reliably improve performance for each model family, given that structured prompting is not universally beneficial?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3: "Structured prompts are not universally beneficial... prompt policies are not a universal 'agent upgrade' and model-specific prompt tuning can matter."
- Why unresolved: Only one structured prompt variant is tested; the design space of model-specific prompts remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic prompt ablations across models, identifying which constraints help or hurt each family.

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on domain-specific heuristics (author disambiguation, award tier mapping) that may not generalize
- Offline sandbox design reduces realism compared to deployed assistants with web access
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on accuracy metrics without examining calibration or precision-recall tradeoffs

## Confidence
- Confidence in claims about contamination resistance: Medium
- Confidence in task-specific performance gains: High
- Confidence in scaling trends with message budget: Medium

## Next Checks
1. **Pre-cutoff vs. post-cutoff contamination test**: Run the same model configurations on identical task instances evaluated at t0 versus t1 to quantify any performance differences that might indicate contamination effects.

2. **Prompt structure ablation with model tuning**: Test structured prompts on additional model families (Llama, Mistral) and with prompt-tuned variants to determine whether the observed Claude/GPT difference reflects architectural or training differences.

3. **Open sandbox feasibility**: Implement a networked sandbox variant to assess whether allowing web access improves performance on tasks where frozen evidence proves insufficient, helping characterize the tradeoff between contamination risk and task coverage.
