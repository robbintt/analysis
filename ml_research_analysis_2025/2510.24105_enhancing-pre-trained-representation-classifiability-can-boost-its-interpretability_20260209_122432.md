# Enhancing Pre-trained Representation Classifiability can Boost its Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24105
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24105
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pre-trained visual representations can simultaneously achieve high interpretability and classifiability, with a positive correlation between these metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the relationship between interpretability and classifiability of pre-trained visual representations, challenging the conventional wisdom that these qualities trade off against each other. The authors introduce the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS), which quantifies interpretability by measuring semantic information loss during interpretation using accuracy retention rate as the metric. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and architectures, they discover a positive correlation: representations with higher classifiability also provide more interpretable semantics. This finding enables two applications - improving classifiability through interpretability maximization during fine-tuning, and providing interpretable predictions with higher accuracy than interpretability-oriented methods alone.

## Method Summary
The method centers on the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS), which evaluates how much task-relevant semantic information is preserved when projecting representations to concept spaces. For a given representation and dataset, IIS computes the area under the curve of accuracy retention rate (ARR) across multiple sparsity levels. ARR measures the ratio of classification accuracy when using sparse concept activations versus the original representation. The paper tests four concept library types (visual: Prototype, Cluster, End2End; textual: GPT-3 + CLIP) and demonstrates a positive correlation between IIS and classification accuracy across ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, and Swin architectures. The bidirectional improvement is validated by fine-tuning with a simplified IIS objective that uses learnable projection matrices, showing both improved accuracy and interpretability.

## Key Results
- A positive correlation exists between representation classifiability and interpretability across multiple architectures and datasets
- Fine-tuning with interpretability maximization improves both IIS and classification accuracy (e.g., ResNet-50: 75.66%→77.36%)
- The mutual promoting relationship enables interpretable predictions with higher accuracy than existing interpretability-oriented methods
- IIS provides a quantitative metric for evaluating representation interpretability based on information preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information-Loss-Based Interpretability Quantification
The IIS metric quantifies interpretability by measuring task-relevant semantic preservation when projecting representations to human-understandable concept spaces. By projecting representations into concept spaces, applying sparsification to select interpretable concepts, then measuring accuracy retention rate across multiple sparsity levels, the IIS captures how much interpretable semantics survive the interpretation process. Higher IIS indicates more task-relevant semantics were preserved.

### Mechanism 2: Positive Correlation Between Classifiability and Interpretability
Representations that organize task-relevant semantics more effectively for classification also exhibit higher interpretability. As representations improve at classification tasks, they structure the same semantics that are most amenable to human-interpretable concept mapping. This empirical observation contradicts the assumed trade-off and holds across different architectures and concept library types.

### Mechanism 3: Bidirectional Improvement via Interpretability Maximization
Fine-tuning representations to maximize IIS also improves their classification accuracy, demonstrating a mutually promoting relationship. The simplified IIS objective regularizes representations by encouraging task-relevant semantics to be reconstructable from sparse concept spaces, acting as beneficial constraint during fine-tuning that reduces complexity while preserving discriminative information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)**: IIS builds on CBM principles - projecting representations to human-interpretable concepts for prediction. Understanding CBMs clarifies why sparsification and concept libraries matter. Quick check: Can you explain why CBMs trade some accuracy for interpretability, and how IIS differs in its approach?

- **Representation Spaces and Projections**: IIS involves projecting from representation space (RD) to concept space (RM). Without understanding linear projections and their information-preserving properties, the ARR mechanism will be unclear. Quick check: What happens to discriminative information when you project a high-dimensional representation into a lower-dimensional concept space?

- **Sparsity in Interpretability**: Human cognitive limits require sparse interpretations. The paper's sparsification mechanism controls how many concepts contribute, directly affecting both interpretability and ARR. Quick check: Why might sparser interpretations have lower accuracy retention, and what does the sparsity-ARR curve tell us about representation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dataset → Concept Library Builder → Projection Layer → Sparsification Module → Interpretation Classifier → IIS Calculator → Fine-tuning Module

- **Critical path**:
  1. Freeze pre-trained backbone f
  2. Build or load concept library C for target dataset
  3. For each sparsity level s:
     - Project representations: xC = C⊤x
     - Sparsify: xC,s = gs(xC)
     - Train interpretation classifier gcls
     - Compute ARR = Acc(interpretation) / Acc(original)
  4. Integrate ARR over sparsity range to obtain IIS

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Concept library size vs. coverage: More concepts capture more semantics but increase computation
  - Sparsity granularity vs. IIS precision: More levels give smoother curves but increase training time
  - Simplified IIS for fine-tuning: Using learned Cl speeds optimization but may not perfectly align with original IIS

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Flat sparsity-ARR curve: Concept library fails to capture task-relevant semantics
  - IIS decreases with accuracy: Architecture mismatch or concept library inappropriate for model type
  - Simplified IIS optimization doesn't improve original IIS: Cl learning diverges from true concepts

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate IIS on single model family: Compute IIS for ResNet-18/34/50/101/152 on ImageNet with text concepts
  2. Ablate concept library type: Compare IIS using Prototype, Cluster, End2End, and Text concepts
  3. Test fine-tuning with simplified IIS: Fine-tune ResNet-50 on ImageNet with s=0.1, M=200

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Theoretical Mechanism**: The authors plan to provide theoretical analysis of the interpretability-classifiability relationship, as current investigations of the underlying mechanism leading to this relationship have not been conducted.

2. **IIS Refinement**: The paper aims to take more factors (e.g., trustworthiness, structural entropy of representations) to refine IIS, as the current definition relies primarily on accuracy retention rates and sparsity.

3. **Vision-Language Foundation Models**: The authors seek to develop an interpretable training paradigm for vision-language foundation models, extending the IIS framework beyond standard image classification backbones.

## Limitations

- The positive correlation between classifiability and interpretability is not strictly consistent across all model architectures, varying significantly between model families.
- IIS relies heavily on the quality and relevance of concept libraries, with the assumption that at least one captures task-relevant semantics remaining unverified.
- During fine-tuning, simplified IIS uses learned projection matrices instead of fixed concept vectors, with theoretical equivalence unproven.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The IIS metric itself is well-defined and reproducible; basic positive correlation holds within model families on standard datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mutual promotion relationship is empirically supported but relies on simplified IIS approximation; bidirectional improvement claims are novel but not yet theoretically grounded.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability across fundamentally different architectures and tasks remains uncertain; assumption that concept-based interpretations capture "true" interpretability needs further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Transfer Test**: Compute IIS for ViT and Swin architectures on the same datasets as ResNet to quantify correlation strength across architectures.

2. **Concept Library Ablation**: Systematically degrade concept library quality and measure IIS stability to determine minimum viable concept library size.

3. **Simplified vs. Original IIS Divergence**: During fine-tuning, periodically compute both simplified and original IIS to track divergence over training epochs.
