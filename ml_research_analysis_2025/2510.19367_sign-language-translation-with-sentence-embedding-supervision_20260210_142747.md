# Sign Language Translation with Sentence Embedding Supervision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19367
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Sign2(sem+text) achieves BLEU 24.0 on PHOENIX-2014T and 12.20 on How2Sign, setting new state-of-the-art for gloss-free SLT

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of sign language translation without gloss annotations by replacing manual glosses with sentence embeddings as intermediate supervision. The proposed sign2(sem+text) method learns to predict semantic embeddings (extracted from sBERT) from sign videos, then generates text using these embeddings. Experiments on PHOENIX-2014T and How2Sign datasets show significant improvements over previous gloss-free methods, closing the performance gap with gloss-dependent systems. The multitask approach that combines semantic and text generation supervision consistently outperforms pipeline-only training.

## Method Summary
The approach uses pretrained sentence embeddings as supervision targets instead of manual glosses. Two architectures are proposed: sign2sem2text (pipeline) and sign2(sem+text) (multitask). The sign2sem module predicts 384-dim semantic vectors from video features using a transformer encoder. These predictions are used to train sem2text, which can be either a lightweight SLTr model or a pretrained mBART decoder. The multitask variant applies MSE loss between predicted and target semantic vectors alongside the text generation loss. Training involves three phases: pretraining sign2sem on semantic prediction, pretraining sem2text on Wikipedia reconstruction, and end-to-end fine-tuning on SLT data.

## Key Results
- sign2(sem+text) achieves BLEU 24.0 on PHOENIX-2014T and 12.20 on How2Sign
- Significantly outperforms previous gloss-free methods (BLEU 10.41/7.85 vs 12.20/12.34 on How2Sign)
- Multitask learning with SEM supervision consistently outperforms pipeline approach at 95% confidence
- mBART-based sem2text provides substantial improvements over training from scratch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Embedding as Intermediate Supervision
Sentence embeddings substitute for manual glosses by providing dense semantic targets during training. The model learns to predict sBERT embeddings from sign videos, capturing meaning without requiring discrete gloss annotations. This works because sBERT embeddings encode semantic information sufficient to guide sign-to-text mapping.

### Mechanism 2: Multitask Learning Combines Semantic and Generative Supervision
Joint optimization of SEM prediction and text generation losses outperforms pipeline training. The SEM loss provides early-layer gradient signal while text loss ensures fluent generation. This regularization helps the model learn better visual representations without sacrificing text quality.

### Mechanism 3: Pretrained Text Decoder Provides Strong Generative Prior
Initializing sem2text with mBART-25 substantially improves performance over training from scratch. The pretrained multilingual language model provides strong text generation capabilities learned from massive text corpora, bypassing the need to learn language modeling from limited SLT data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Sequence-to-Sequence Translation with Attention**: The entire SLT task is framed as seq2seq (video frames → text tokens) using transformer architectures. Why needed: Understanding attention mechanisms is essential for grasping how the decoder focuses on relevant video features during generation.
- **Sentence Embeddings (sBERT/Siamese Networks)**: Pretrained sentence embeddings serve as supervision targets. Why needed: Understanding how these embeddings capture semantic meaning is crucial for grasping the core innovation. Quick check: How does a Siamese network learn to produce similar embeddings for semantically similar sentences?
- **Multitask Learning and Auxiliary Losses**: The approach combines semantic prediction loss with text generation loss. Why needed: Understanding gradient flow from multiple objectives is critical for grasping how intermediate supervision works. Quick check: What happens if two auxiliary losses have gradients pointing in opposite directions for the same parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: sign2sem (video → SEM) → sem2text (SEM → text)
- **Critical path**: 1) Extract frame features using EfficientNet with pooling + BatchNorm + ReLU, 2) sign2sem predicts 384-dim SEM vectors from sBERT targets using MSE loss, 3) sem2text reconstructs text from SEM vectors (pretrained on Wikipedia), 4) Combine modules and fine-tune end-to-end with Le + Lo
- **Design tradeoffs**: SLTr is lighter and trained from scratch vs mBART leverages massive pretraining; pipeline is simpler vs multitask adds intermediate supervision complexity; monolingual vs multilingual embeddings show no significant difference
- **Failure signatures**: Training doesn't converge (check SEM dimension alignment), BLEU stuck below baseline (verify BPE vocabulary matches), reconstruction quality poor (check sem2text upper bound), long sentences degrade (check tokenization limits)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce sem2text reconstruction baseline on Wikipedia + PHOENIX text, target BLEU ~30-31, 2) Ablate multitask vs pipeline on PHOENIX, expect ~3-4 BLEU difference, 3) Visualize SEM space alignment using t-SNE to check if sign2sem outputs cluster meaningfully

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Visual feature extraction details are underspecified (EfficientNet variant and pooling strategy not specified)
- Monolingual vs multilingual embedding comparison may be confounded by domain mismatch between datasets
- Effectiveness in low-resource language scenarios remains unvalidated

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Experimental results with proper bootstrap confidence intervals showing BLEU/chrF/BLEURT scores on PHOENIX-2014T and How2Sign

**Medium Confidence**: Mechanistic explanations for why SEM supervision works, though evidence is primarily correlational

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability claims about closing the gloss-free vs gloss-dependent gap and multilingual applicability based on limited dataset testing

## Next Checks

1. **Feature Extraction Ablation**: Systematically vary EfficientNet variant and pooling strategy to quantify impact on final BLEU scores

2. **Cross-Domain SEM Transfer**: Train SEM models on weather data (PHOENIX) and test transfer to instructional content (How2Sign), or vice versa

3. **Low-Resource Language Simulation**: Simulate low-resource conditions by reducing monolingual text availability for pretraining sentence embeddings, then measure degradation in SLT performance
