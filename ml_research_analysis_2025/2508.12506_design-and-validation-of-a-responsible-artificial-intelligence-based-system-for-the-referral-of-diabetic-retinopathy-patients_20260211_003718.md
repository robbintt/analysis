# Design and Validation of a Responsible Artificial Intelligence-based System for the Referral of Diabetic Retinopathy Patients

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12506
- Reference count: 40
- This study developed RAIS-DR, a Responsible AI system for diabetic retinopathy screening that outperformed FDA-approved EyeArt system with 5-12% higher F1 scores and 6-19% higher accuracy in external validation.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening in low-resource settings by developing RAIS-DR, a Responsible AI system integrating ethical principles throughout the AI lifecycle. The system uses retinal fundus photographs and includes preprocessing, quality assessment, and specialized classification models. Validation on a local dataset of 1,046 patients showed RAIS-DR outperformed the FDA-approved EyeArt system with improvements in F1 scores (5-12%), accuracy (6-19%), and specificity (10-20%). Fairness metrics indicated equitable performance across demographic subgroups, confirming the system's potential to reduce healthcare disparities while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

## Method Summary
RAIS-DR employs a multi-stage pipeline: background removal via MP-UNet, quality assessment with MQ-MobileNet, anatomical detection using MA-Faster R-CNN, and classification through three specialized EfficientNet V2-s models (M1 for referral, M2/M3 for DR grading). The system was trained on public datasets (EyePACS, IDRiD, MESSIDOR II) and validated on a local Mexican dataset of 1,046 patients. Input images are 512×512 with transfer learning from ImageNet. The pipeline filters low-quality images before classification and maps ICO 5-class grades to binary referral decisions per Mexican clinical guidelines.

## Key Results
- RAIS-DR achieved 96% accuracy vs EyeArt's 77% on RDR patient classification
- F1 scores improved by 5-12% across referral and grading tasks
- Fairness metrics showed equitable performance: Disparate Impact 0.984-1.031 and Equal Opportunity Difference near zero across demographic subgroups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A quality-gated multi-model pipeline may improve DR classification robustness by filtering low-quality inputs before diagnostic inference. Background removal (MP-UNet) → quality assessment (MQ-MobileNet) → anatomical detection (MA-Faster R-CNN) → classification (M1/M2/M3-EfficientNet). Low-quality images trigger retake prompts rather than forced classification, reducing spurious predictions.

### Mechanism 2
Integrating fairness metrics as explicit evaluation criteria may produce more equitable performance across demographic subgroups. Disparate Impact (DI) and Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) computed across sex, projection type, laterality, and age. DI values 0.984–1.031 and EOD values near zero suggest balanced treatment. GradCAM visualization provides explainability for error analysis.

### Mechanism 3
External validation on geographically distinct local data reveals performance differences not visible in public dataset testing. Training on EyePACS, IDRiD, MESSIDOR II; retrospective validation on 1,046 Mexican patients from 3 primary care facilities (unseen by both RAIS-DR and EyeArt). Head-to-head comparison against FDA-approved EyeArt system.

## Foundational Learning

- **Disparate Impact (DI) and Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)**: Why needed here: These quantify whether referral rates differ across subgroups; DI near 1.0 and EOD near 0 indicate equitable treatment. Quick check: If DI = 0.6 for male vs female patients, what does this suggest about the model's referral behavior?
- **Transfer learning with domain-specific preprocessing**: Why needed here: Models use ImageNet pre-trained EfficientNet V2-s adapted to 512×512 retinal images with background removal and aspect ratio preservation. Quick check: Why would naive 224×224 resizing introduce geometric distortions in circular fundus images?
- **Multi-class to binary referral mapping**: Why needed here: ICO 5-class grades (R0–R4) are mapped to binary decisions per Mexican clinical guidelines: RDR = R3+R4; ACR = R3+R4+R6. Quick check: How does including ungradable images (R6) in ACR change the clinical workflow compared to RDR-only screening?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: MP (UNet) → MQ (MobileNet) → MA (Faster R-CNN) → M1 (EfficientNet V2-s) → M2/M3 (EfficientNet V2-s)
- **Critical path**: RFP input → MP background removal → MQ quality check → (if fail, MD retake decision) → MA anatomical validation → M1 referral → (if positive) M2/M3 grading
- **Design tradeoffs**: 512×512 vs 224×224 input: Higher resolution preserves lesions but increases inference time (~2s total on CPU). Multiple specialized models vs single multi-class: Enables clinician-interpretable outputs but adds pipeline complexity. Specificity vs sensitivity: RAIS-DR prioritizes specificity/PPV; EyeArt shows higher sensitivity but more false positives
- **Failure signatures**: LASER scarring triggers false positives (highlighted in GradCAM). Cataracts and media opacities reduce image quality scores. Non-DR diseases (glaucoma, AMD) are not detected—model explicitly limited to DR
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run inference pipeline on 10 sample images from EyePACS; verify all 6 models execute and output shapes match specifications. 2) Compute DI and EOD on a held-out test set stratified by metadata; establish baseline fairness before any fine-tuning. 3) Generate GradCAM visualizations on false positive cases to identify systematic attention to spurious features (e.g., LASER scars, background artifacts)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can the system's sensitivity be improved to reduce false negatives without compromising the achieved gains in specificity and accuracy?**: There is often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in binary classification; optimizing one can degrade the other. Validation results showing a reduction in false negatives (higher sensitivity) while maintaining a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and specificity comparable to or better than the current RAIS-DR baseline would resolve this.
- **How does the presence of comorbid retinal conditions, such as glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration, affect the model's classification confidence and accuracy?**: The system was trained and validated primarily for Diabetic Retinopathy grading, potentially learning features specific to DR that might be confused with or masked by other pathologies. A validation study using datasets labeled with multiple comorbidities to measure the false positive/negative rates specifically for images containing non-DR retinal diseases would resolve this.
- **Do the current statistical fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Equal Opportunity Difference) correlate with equitable long-term health outcomes for patients across different demographic subgroups?**: Algorithmic fairness metrics provide a snapshot of model performance but do not account for post-prediction systemic issues (e.g., access to specialists) that influence actual patient health. A longitudinal clinical study analyzing the referral-to-treatment success rates and final visual acuity outcomes across the identified subgroups (sex, age, etc.) would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Local validation dataset is relatively small (n=797 gradable patients), particularly for rare referable cases (54 RDR vs 743 NRDR)
- Model explicitly excludes non-DR pathologies like glaucoma and AMD, limiting clinical applicability
- Key hyperparameters for training (learning rate, batch size, epochs) are not specified, hindering exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: External validation methodology and performance metrics (F1 scores, accuracy improvements of 6-19%, specificity gains of 10-20%)
- **Medium confidence**: Fairness claims (DI 0.984-1.031, EOD near zero) - metrics are reported but enforcement mechanisms are unclear
- **Medium confidence**: Responsible AI framework integration - described systematically but practical implementation details are limited

## Next Checks
1. Compute confidence intervals for key metrics (F1, sensitivity, specificity) using bootstrapping on the validation set to quantify uncertainty, particularly for the small RDR subgroup
2. Test RAIS-DR on images from additional clinical sites not represented in the validation set to confirm generalization across different camera systems and patient populations
3. Deploy the system in a controlled clinical setting to measure actual screening throughput, retake rates, and clinician acceptance, comparing against the reported offline validation performance
