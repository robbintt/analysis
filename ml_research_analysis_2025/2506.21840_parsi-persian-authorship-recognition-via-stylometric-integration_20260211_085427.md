core_contribution: This paper introduces PARSI, a Persian authorship attribution framework
  that integrates transformer-based language models with stylometric, semantic, and
  metrical features. The approach processes each verse through a RoBERTa encoder and
  combines the output with 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
  measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter.

# PARSI: Persian Authorship Recognition via Stylometric Integration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.21840
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21840
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: 71% baseline accuracy, 97% high-confidence accuracy at 0.9 threshold for Persian poetry authorship attribution

## Executive Summary
PARSI introduces a Persian authorship attribution framework that integrates transformer-based language models with stylometric, semantic, and metrical features. The approach processes each verse through a RoBERTa encoder and combines the output with 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. The model achieves 71% accuracy using weighted voting and reaches 97% accuracy at a 0.9 confidence threshold, though with reduced coverage. Experiments on 647,653 verses from 67 classical poets demonstrate the effectiveness of combining deep contextual representations with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution in Persian poetry.

## Method Summary
The PARSI framework processes Persian poetry through a multi-stage pipeline that combines deep learning with traditional stylometric analysis. Each verse undergoes RoBERTa encoding for contextual understanding, while parallel feature extraction captures semantic relationships via Word2Vec embeddings and stylistic patterns through seven stylometric measures including average word length and punctuation usage. The system also incorporates categorical encodings for poetic form and meter, creating a comprehensive feature set. A weighted voting mechanism aggregates these diverse inputs to produce authorship predictions, with confidence thresholds enabling trade-offs between accuracy and coverage.

## Key Results
- Achieves 71% baseline accuracy across all confidence levels
- Reaches 97% accuracy at 0.9 confidence threshold (reduced coverage)
- Tested on 647,653 verses from 67 classical Persian poets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of multiple feature types captures both surface-level stylistic patterns and deep semantic relationships in Persian poetry. RoBERTa provides contextual understanding of verse meaning and structure, while stylometric features encode author-specific writing habits that remain consistent across works. The inclusion of poetic form and meter as categorical features leverages domain-specific knowledge that distinguishes classical Persian poetry from other literary traditions.

## Foundational Learning

**RoBERTa transformer architecture**: Why needed - Provides deep contextual understanding of Persian verse structure and meaning; Quick check - Verify model can distinguish semantically similar but syntactically different verses

**Stylometric feature extraction**: Why needed - Captures consistent authorial writing patterns across different works; Quick check - Confirm feature distributions vary significantly between authors

**Word2Vec semantic embeddings**: Why needed - Encodes semantic relationships between words in Persian vocabulary; Quick check - Ensure embeddings capture poetic terminology and classical language usage

**Weighted voting mechanism**: Why needed - Combines multiple prediction sources with confidence calibration; Quick check - Validate that higher weights improve prediction accuracy

**Poetic form and meter encoding**: Why needed - Leverages domain-specific knowledge unique to Persian classical poetry; Quick check - Confirm that form/meter features improve classification of known poet works

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Verse text -> RoBERTa encoder -> Stylometric extractor -> Word2Vec processor -> Form/Meter encoder -> Feature aggregator -> Weighted voting -> Authorship prediction

**Critical path**: The RoBERTa encoding combined with stylometric features forms the critical path, as these provide the strongest predictive signals for authorship attribution.

**Design tradeoffs**: The system trades computational complexity for accuracy by integrating multiple feature types, requiring careful weighting to balance contributions from each source.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on modern Persian text, degraded accuracy with fewer training samples per author, and potential overfitting to classical poetic conventions.

**First experiments**: 
1. Test baseline RoBERTa-only performance against integrated feature approach
2. Evaluate feature importance through ablation studies
3. Measure accuracy degradation when confidence threshold is lowered

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to 67 classical Persian poets, restricting generalizability
- Focus on classical poetry limits applicability to modern Persian text
- Performance variability between baseline (71%) and high-confidence (97%) results

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Transformer-based approach with RoBERTa integration | Medium |
| Stylometric and semantic feature integration effectiveness | Medium |
| High-confidence threshold results (97% at 0.9) | Medium |
| Generalizability to other Persian text domains | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on a larger, more diverse corpus of Persian authors, including modern texts and non-poetic content
2. Evaluate cross-linguistic transferability by testing the integrated feature approach on other languages with rich literary traditions
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each feature type (stylometric, semantic, metrical) to overall accuracy
