# Computable universal online learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18352
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18352
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Shows computable universal online learning is possible for RER (recursively enumerably representable) hypothesis classes, but impossible for some classes with uncomputable functions.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the computability constraints on universal online learning, focusing on when a computer program can implement a universal online learner for a given hypothesis class. The authors establish that universal online learning is possible for classes where all functions are computable (RER classes) but becomes impossible when the class contains non-computable functions. The work provides a precise characterization of the boundary between computable and non-computable universal online learning for both realizable and agnostic settings.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze computable universal online learning through constructions using the Weighted Majority Algorithm with doubling tricks for agnostic learning, and computable learner enumeration strategies for realizable learning. They examine hypothesis classes H as sets of total functions from natural numbers to {0,1}, distinguishing between RER (recursively enumerably representable) and DR (decidably representable) classes. The theoretical framework proves that realizable computable universal online learning is equivalent to being contained in an RER class for total learners, while showing a separation between realizable and agnostic cases for non-RER classes.

## Key Results
- Realizable computable universal online learning is equivalent to being contained in an RER class for total learners
- There exists a separation between realizable and agnostic computable universal online learning for non-RER classes
- The class of computable functions is decidable but not RER, showing the strictness of the RER/DR hierarchy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theoretical proofs rely on diagonalization arguments against universal learners. For realizable learning, the construction enumerates all computable learners and diagonalizes against each one sequentially. For agnostic learning, the RER property allows constructing a universal learner that can handle any sequence, while non-RER classes enable building "evil sequences" that force mistakes on all computable learners. The Weighted Majority Algorithm with doubling trick provides a concrete mechanism for implementing agnostic learners when the class structure permits.

## Foundational Learning
- **Computable functions**: Functions that can be computed by a Turing machine. Why needed: The core question is whether universal online learners can be implemented as computer programs. Quick check: Can the function be evaluated by a finite algorithm?
- **Recursively Enumerably Representable (RER) classes**: Classes where the set of Gödel numbers of functions in H is recursively enumerable. Why needed: RER property enables systematic enumeration of hypothesis class members. Quick check: Is there an algorithm that lists all function indices in the class?
- **Online learning framework**: Learning from sequential data where predictions are made before seeing true labels. Why needed: The paper studies universal learners in the online setting. Quick check: Does the learner make predictions without seeing future data?
- **Universal learners**: Learners that can learn any target function from a hypothesis class. Why needed: The paper characterizes when such learners can be implemented computably. Quick check: Can the learner succeed on all possible target functions in the class?
- **Diagonalization arguments**: Proof technique that constructs objects that differ from all members of a list. Why needed: Used to show limitations of computable universal learners. Quick check: Does the construction produce something that avoids all computable learners' predictions?
- **Mistake bounds**: The number of incorrect predictions made by a learner. Why needed: Central to analyzing online learning performance. Quick check: Is the bound finite for realizable sequences or sublinear for agnostic learning?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Hypothesis class H -> Universal learner construction -> Mistake analysis -> Computability check

**Critical path**: The key insight is that RER property enables computable enumeration of hypothesis class members, which is necessary for constructing universal learners. The critical path is: verify RER property → construct enumeration strategy → build universal learner → prove mistake bounds.

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper prioritizes theoretical completeness over practical implementation. The use of abstract hypothesis classes and diagonalization arguments provides clean characterizations but makes concrete implementation challenging. The choice between proper and improper learning also affects computability - improper learners have more flexibility but may require more complex constructions.

**Failure signatures**: A computable learner will fail (make infinitely many mistakes or not halt) on certain sequences when the hypothesis class contains non-computable functions. The "evil sequence" construction specifically targets each computable learner to force disagreements on infinitely many predictions.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Verify the RER property for a simple computable hypothesis class (e.g., finite automata) by implementing the enumeration algorithm
2. Test the universal learner construction on a known RER class with both realizable and non-realizable sequences
3. Implement the "evil sequence" construction to demonstrate failure of computable learners on non-RER classes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open problems: characterizing realizable computable universal online learning for arbitrary (partial) learners beyond total learners, characterizing computable online learning with uniform mistake bounds, and determining whether broader properties than RER preserve the equivalence between computable realizable and agnostic learning.

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses on binary classification with total functions, limiting applicability to other learning settings
- The constructive proofs provide theoretical existence but not necessarily efficient implementations
- The distinction between partial and total learners is not fully resolved for the general characterization

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High - The proofs follow standard computability theory techniques
- Practical implementation feasibility: Medium - Constructions are abstract and depend on specific enumerations
- Generalization to other settings: Low - Results are specific to binary online learning with total functions

## Next Checks
1. Implement the hypothesis class enumeration for a simple RER class and verify the enumeration property
2. Construct and test the "evil sequence" for a specific non-RER class to demonstrate computable learner failure
3. Evaluate whether the RER/DR hierarchy strictness holds for a concrete example hypothesis class
