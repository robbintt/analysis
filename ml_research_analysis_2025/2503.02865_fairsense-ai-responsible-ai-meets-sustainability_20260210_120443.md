- Primary result: Multimodal framework detecting bias in text/images while mapping AI risks to MIT/NIST frameworks

## Executive Summary
FairSense-AI is a multimodal framework that detects and mitigates bias in both text and images using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The platform provides bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations while integrating AI risk assessment aligned with MIT and NIST frameworks. It employs energy-efficient techniques like model pruning and mixed-precision computation to reduce environmental impact. Through case studies, FairSense-AI demonstrates effectiveness in identifying subtle biases and supporting responsible AI deployment.

## Method Summary
FairSense-AI analyzes text and images for bias using LLM/VLM semantic analysis, computes a composite bias score via weighted sum of text, image, and contextual factors, and maps detected biases to structured risk frameworks through semantic similarity search using FAISS indexes. The system employs energy-efficient inference via pruning and mixed-precision computation while tracking carbon emissions with CodeCarbon. The platform is available as a Python package with API functions for bias analysis and risk assessment.

## Key Results
- Effective detection of subtle forms of prejudice and stereotyping in multimodal content
- Integration of bias scores with structured risk-mitigation mapping using MIT/NIST frameworks
- Significant energy efficiency gains through model pruning and mixed-precision computation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multimodal Bias Detection via LLM/VLM Semantic Analysis
FairSense-AI identifies bias in text and images by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. Text inputs are preprocessed and analyzed for biased language patterns; images undergo OCR text extraction and VLM-based captioning, then both modalities are scored for stereotypes, exclusionary framing, or disparaging tone. The system computes a composite bias score using: **B(x) = α·T(x) + β·I(x) + γ·C(x)**, where T(x) is text bias, I(x) is image bias, and C(x) is contextual bias from multimodal interpretation. Core assumption: LLMs and VLMs can reliably surface subtle prejudice patterns that reflect societal stereotypes embedded in training corpora.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Risk Retrieval via Dual-Index Matching
FairSense-AI maps detected content-level biases to structured risk frameworks through semantic similarity search. A Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) generates embeddings for project descriptions or bias-flagged content. Two FAISS indexes retrieve (1) top-5 similar risks from the MIT AI Risk Repository and (2) corresponding mitigation strategies from NIST AI RMF, producing a tabular risk-mitigation report. Core assumption: Semantic vector similarity correlates with actual risk relevance for user scenarios.

### Mechanism 3: Energy-Efficient Inference via Pruning and Mixed-Precision
Model optimization techniques reduce computational load and carbon emissions during bias detection without critically degrading accuracy. Pruning removes low-magnitude weights; mixed-precision computation (e.g., FP16) reduces floating-point operations. CodeCarbon tracks energy consumption during inference to quantify environmental impact. Core assumption: Optimization preserves sufficient model capacity to detect nuanced biases; efficiency gains do not materially harm detection quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Cross-Modal Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: FairSense-AI's image bias detection depends on VLMs generating captions and extracting semantic meaning from visual content.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a VLM aligns image features with textual embeddings, and what failure modes arise when visual stereotypes lack explicit textual labels?

- **Concept: Semantic Similarity Search with FAISS**
  - Why needed here: The risk assessment module uses FAISS indexes to match user inputs with MIT/NIST framework entries via vector similarity.
  - Quick check question: What distance metric does FAISS use by default for inner-product indexes, and how might domain-specific vocabulary gaps affect retrieval quality?

- **Concept: Model Pruning and Quantization Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: FairSense-AI claims sustainability gains through pruning and mixed-precision; understanding these techniques is essential for evaluating accuracy-efficiency balance.
  - Quick check question: If pruning removes 30% of weights from a bias detection model, which types of subtle or intersectional biases are most likely to be missed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data Preprocessing -> Model Analysis Layer -> Bias Scoring Engine -> Explanation/Highlighting Module -> Recommendation Generator -> Risk Assessment Module -> Output
  (Sustainability Layer runs parallel)

- **Critical path:**
  Input (text/image) → Preprocessing → Model Analysis → Bias Scoring → Explanation Generation → Risk Retrieval (MIT + NIST) → Recommendation Synthesis → Output (scores, highlights, mitigations)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Embedding model choice: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim, fast) vs. larger models (768-dim, more nuanced but slower)
  - Bias score weights (α, β, γ): Domain-specific tuning required; default weights may underweight contextual interactions
  - Pruning level: Higher compression reduces energy but risks accuracy loss on subtle/intersectional biases (paper claims "significant" reduction but does not quantify accuracy degradation)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High false positive rate: Benign cultural references or domain-specific jargon flagged as biased
  - Low recall on intersectional bias: Fixed-weight formula may not capture interactions between gender, race, and context
  - Irrelevant risk retrieval: Semantic search returns tangential MIT/NIST entries due to vocabulary mismatch
  - Inconsistent multimodal scores: T(x) and I(x) may conflict when text and image convey opposite signals

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run `analyze_text_for_bias()` on a labeled bias corpus (e.g., BEADS or StereoSet referenced in paper) and compute precision/recall against ground truth labels to baseline detection accuracy.
  2. Test image bias detection on the ViLBIAS benchmark (cited in references); compare flagging rates with OCR enabled vs. disabled to isolate text-in-image contribution.
  3. Profile energy consumption using CodeCarbon across inference batches; compare baseline model vs. pruned/quantized variant to quantify claimed efficiency gains and check for accuracy drift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can FairSense-AI be extended to effectively detect intersectional biases arising from combinations of attributes (e.g., race and gender)?
- Basis in paper: Section 7 states that "intersectional biases... is an area FairSense-AI could expand into by looking at context more granularly."
- Why unresolved: Current capabilities focus on general bias detection, whereas intersectionality requires analyzing unique forms of prejudice that emerge only when multiple attributes overlap.
- Evidence: Successful detection of nuanced stereotypes in a benchmark dataset specifically labeled for intersectional discrimination.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methodology should be used to calibrate the weights (α, β, γ) in the bias scoring function to ensure accurate severity assessment?
- Basis in paper: Equation (1) defines the total bias score B(x) as a weighted sum, but Section 3.2 does not specify if these weights are static constants, learnable parameters, or domain-dependent.
- Why unresolved: Without a defined calibration mechanism, the "severity" of bias is subjective to the chosen weights, potentially skewing results between text and image modalities.
- Evidence: A sensitivity analysis correlating the weighted scores against human expert evaluations of bias severity across diverse multimodal datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the AI Risk Management module accurately distinguish and retrieve mitigation strategies for misinformation distinct from content bias?
- Basis in paper: Section 7 outlines plans to "expand the tool's ability to handle queries about AI risks like misinformation or disinformation."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation links MIT risks to NIST guidelines, but distinguishing factuality issues (misinformation) from representational issues (bias) within the same semantic retrieval pipeline remains an unproven capability.
- Evidence: Retrieval accuracy metrics (e.g., Recall@5) when the system is queried with input text containing subtle misinformation versus socially biased language.

## Limitations
- Core detection performance depends on unspecified LLM/VLM versions and parameter choices for the bias scoring formula
- Paper reports "significant" energy reductions through pruning but does not quantify accuracy trade-offs
- Semantic risk retrieval assumes vocabulary alignment between user inputs and framework documents, which may not hold for domain-specific or ambiguous descriptions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The multimodal architecture combining LLMs and VLMs for bias detection is technically sound and aligns with established capabilities in both NLP and computer vision communities. The integration of MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI RMF for structured risk assessment follows standard semantic search practices.
- **Medium confidence**: The energy efficiency claims are plausible given known benefits of pruning and mixed-precision computation, but lack empirical validation specific to bias detection workloads. The dual-index retrieval approach is methodologically valid but unproven for the specific domain of bias-related risk assessment.
- **Low confidence**: Without specifying exact model versions, hyperparameter values, or quantitative accuracy benchmarks, the actual detection capability and reliability of the system remain uncertain. The claimed sustainability benefits cannot be independently verified.

## Next Checks
1. Run the `analyze_text_for_bias()` function on the BEADS benchmark (referenced in related work) and compute precision/recall against ground truth bias labels to establish baseline detection accuracy.
2. Test image bias detection on the ViLBIAS benchmark to measure performance with and without OCR extraction, isolating the contribution of text-in-image analysis.
3. Profile energy consumption using CodeCarbon across multiple inference batches, comparing baseline vs. pruned/quantized models to quantify actual efficiency gains and verify that accuracy remains acceptable for bias detection tasks.
