# StutterFuse: Mitigating Modality Collapse in Stuttering Detection with Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning and Gated Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13632
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13632
- Reference count: 30
- Achieves 0.65 weighted F1 on SEP-28k dataset with cross-lingual generalization

## Executive Summary
StutterFuse addresses the challenge of detecting overlapping disfluencies in stuttering speech by introducing a retrieval-augmented classifier that organizes embeddings using Jaccard-weighted metric learning. The system overcomes the "Echo Chamber" effect seen in naive retrieval approaches by fusing acoustic features with retrieved neighbor information through gated cross-attention. On the SEP-28k dataset, it achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.65 and demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-lingual generalization to German stuttering data, matching supervised performance without requiring in-domain training data.

## Method Summary
The framework combines metric learning with retrieval-augmented classification to handle multi-label stuttering detection. It uses a Jaccard-weighted SetCon objective to organize embeddings by label similarity, then fuses acoustic and retrieved neighbor information via gated cross-attention. The retrieval mechanism is trained with Jaccard-weighted contrastive loss to preserve label overlap information, while the fusion module gates information from both acoustic features and retrieved neighbors based on their relevance. This design addresses the challenge of overlapping disfluencies where multiple types can co-occur in a single utterance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.65 weighted F1-score on SEP-28k dataset
- Demonstrates zero-shot cross-lingual generalization to German stuttering data
- Matches supervised performance without requiring in-domain training data
- Overcomes "Echo Chamber" effect in retrieval-augmented approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by addressing the modality collapse problem in stuttering detection through careful design of the embedding space and information fusion. The Jaccard-weighted metric learning ensures that embeddings capture not just presence/absence of disfluencies but their overlapping patterns. The gated fusion mechanism dynamically weights information from acoustic features and retrieved neighbors, preventing the retrieval module from overwhelming the classifier with potentially noisy neighbor information. This balanced approach maintains precision while improving recall.

## Foundational Learning

**Metric Learning with Jaccard Weighting**: Organizes embeddings based on label similarity using Jaccard overlap, needed because stuttering often involves overlapping disfluencies. Quick check: Verify embeddings of utterances with similar disfluency patterns are closer in the embedding space.

**Retrieval-Augmented Classification**: Uses retrieved neighbor embeddings as additional context for classification, needed because stuttering patterns can be rare and benefit from similar examples. Quick check: Ensure retrieval quality doesn't degrade classification accuracy.

**Gated Cross-Attention Fusion**: Dynamically weights information from multiple sources, needed to prevent retrieval module from overwhelming acoustic features. Quick check: Verify gating mechanism correctly identifies relevant information sources.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Audio Features -> Jaccard-Weighted SetCon -> Retrieval Module -> Gated Fusion -> Classification

**Critical Path**: Audio features are processed through the metric learning module, retrieved neighbors are found and processed through the same metric space, then both streams are fused via gated attention for final classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational complexity (due to retrieval during inference) for improved detection of rare and overlapping disfluencies. The Jaccard weighting adds complexity but is essential for handling overlapping labels.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when retrieval quality is poor, particularly for rare disfluency types. The system may struggle with speakers whose stuttering patterns differ significantly from the training distribution.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify Jaccard-weighted embeddings correctly cluster utterances with similar disfluency patterns
2. Test retrieval quality by examining neighbor relevance for diverse stuttering patterns
3. Validate gated fusion by comparing performance with and without gating mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small validation dataset (52 instances across 5 speakers) raises concerns about statistical robustness
- Limited ablation studies make it difficult to quantify individual component contributions
- Computational overhead of real-time retrieval during inference remains unquantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical feasibility of retrieval-augmented architecture and mathematical soundness of Jaccard-weighted SetCon objective
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority over baseline models on SEP-28k dataset, pending more comprehensive ablation analysis
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-lingual generalization claims, requiring validation on larger multilingual datasets
- **Low confidence**: Real-world deployment viability without addressing computational efficiency and retrieval quality dependencies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies isolating contributions of Jaccard-weighted SetCon, gated fusion, and retrieval augmentation on SEP-28k dataset
2. Evaluate cross-lingual generalization on larger multilingual stuttering datasets with statistical significance testing across multiple language pairs
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and retrieval quality impact through controlled experiments varying neighbor set sizes and retrieval strategies
