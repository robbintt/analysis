# TOGGLE: Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression for Edge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16855
- Reference count: 40
- TOGGLE achieves up to 3.3× reduction in computational cost and 68.8% model size reduction while preserving formal guarantees for coherence, long-range dependencies, contextual consistency, and factual accuracy.

## Executive Summary
TOGGLE introduces a formal-methods-driven framework for joint quantization-pruning of large language models (LLMs) that guarantees preservation of linguistic properties via Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By encoding coherence, long-range dependencies, contextual consistency, and factual accuracy as STL specifications, TOGGLE uses STL-guided Bayesian optimization to navigate the search space of compression configurations. The method systematically compresses diverse LLMs (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B) while maintaining formal robustness guarantees, achieving significant reductions in FLOPs and model size without retraining.

## Method Summary
TOGGLE integrates formal methods into LLM compression by encoding linguistic properties as STL specifications and using STL-guided Bayesian optimization to navigate the joint quantization-pruning space. The framework applies STL robustness metrics to evaluate preservation of coherence, long-range dependencies, contextual consistency, and factual accuracy across candidate compression configurations. A GP-based Bayesian optimizer (BoTorch) explores the discrete search space of quantization bits (2–16) and pruning rates (0–0.5), selecting per-layer configurations that satisfy all STL constraints (robustness ≥ 0) while minimizing FLOPs. The process iterates for 200 steps, filtering feasible configurations and selecting those with the lowest cost for three operating modes (Strict≈99%, Optimal≈95%, Relaxed≈85% AvgPP).

## Key Results
- Up to 3.3× reduction in computational cost (FLOPs) for compressed models.
- Up to 68.8% reduction in model size across tested LLMs.
- Preservation of linguistic properties with AvgPP targets: Strict (≈99%), Optimal (≈95%), Relaxed (≈85%).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TOGGLE's core mechanism is the integration of formal STL specifications with Bayesian optimization for LLM compression. STL allows precise encoding of linguistic properties as temporal logic constraints, enabling rigorous verification of preservation during compression. The robustness metric quantifies how well compressed models satisfy these constraints, guiding the optimizer toward configurations that balance efficiency gains with formal guarantees. This approach avoids the brittleness of heuristic pruning and quantization by ensuring that all compressed models meet verifiable linguistic criteria.

## Foundational Learning
- **Signal Temporal Logic (STL)**: A formal specification language for real-valued signals over time, used here to encode linguistic properties. Why needed: STL enables rigorous, quantifiable constraints on model behavior during compression. Quick check: Verify STL robustness signs (positive=satisfied) on baseline models using RTAMT.
- **STL Robustness**: A scalar metric indicating how well a signal satisfies an STL specification; positive values mean satisfaction. Why needed: Provides the objective for guiding compression toward configurations that preserve linguistic properties. Quick check: Confirm robustness thresholds (ρth=0) are met for all φi on baselines.
- **Bayesian Optimization (BO)**: A sample-efficient global optimization method using a probabilistic surrogate model (GP) to guide search. Why needed: Efficiently explores the high-dimensional, discrete compression space while respecting STL constraints. Quick check: Ensure BO converges to feasible configs within 200 iterations.
- **Expected Improvement under Constraints (EI)**: A BO acquisition function that maximizes improvement while respecting constraint satisfaction. Why needed: Balances exploration and exploitation under STL robustness constraints. Quick check: Monitor acquisition function values for constraint handling.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: GPT-2 → DeepSeek-V2 7B (MoE) → LLaMA 3 8B → Mistral 7B
- **Critical Path**: STL specification → Robustness evaluation → Bayesian optimization → Configuration selection → Compression application
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Strict STL thresholds maximize property preservation but may limit compression; relaxed thresholds enable greater efficiency at the cost of AvgPP.
- **Failure Signatures**: No feasible configs after 200 BO iterations; FLOPs estimates mismatch; AvgPP not aligning with operating mode targets.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Implement and verify STL specifications (φ1–φ4) with RTAMT on baseline models.
  2. Run a small-scale BO with synthetic data to test surrogate model and acquisition function.
  3. Compress a single layer of GPT-2 and verify FLOPs estimation and robustness evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- GP kernel and BoTorch acquisition hyperparameters are not disclosed, making the BO search path non-reproducible.
- Evaluation dataset specifics (sample count, prompt construction) are absent, preventing exact constraint evaluation.
- STL predicate thresholds and robustness signs require baseline verification for correct constraint specification.
- Component granularity for DeepSeek-V2 MoE and Mistral architectures is unspecified.

## Confidence
- FLOPs and size reduction claims: Medium
- Operating-mode targets and AvgPP: High
- Preservation of linguistic properties: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify baseline STL robustness values and predicate threshold sensitivity to ensure constraints are correctly specified.
2. Cross-check FLOPs estimation formula against baseline model statistics and reported reductions.
3. Test BO convergence and feasibility filtering with multiple random seeds to assess optimization stability.
