core_contribution: This paper introduces latent debate, a framework for interpreting
  LLM thinking processes by modeling implicit internal arguments within a single model
  during inference. Unlike explicit multi-agent debates, latent debate captures hidden
  supporting and attacking signals from internal states (e.g., hidden layers) and
  aggregates them using a symbolic argumentation framework to approximate the model's

# Latent Debate: A Surrogate Framework for Interpreting LLM Thinking

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.01909
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01909
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Key outcome**: Latent debate achieves up to 97% consistency with LLM predictions and detects hallucinations with AUROC up to 0.93

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces latent debate, a framework for interpreting LLM thinking processes by modeling implicit internal arguments within a single model during inference. Unlike explicit multi-agent debates, latent debate captures hidden supporting and attacking signals from internal states (e.g., hidden layers) and aggregates them using a symbolic argumentation framework to approximate the model's decision-making. The authors instantiate this framework symbolically on True/False prediction tasks, demonstrating that latent debate achieves up to 97% consistency with original LLM predictions, serving as a faithful surrogate model. Furthermore, latent debate features enable hallucination detection, achieving AUROC scores up to 0.93, with analysis showing that high internal debate, particularly in middle layers, strongly correlates with hallucinations.

## Method Summary
The latent debate framework extracts hidden states from all layers of an LLM during inference on True/False prediction tasks. These hidden states are projected through the unembedding matrix to obtain True/False probabilities, which serve as initial argument strengths. A Qualitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) is constructed with linear intra-layer connections and inter-layer connections from rightmost nodes. Gradual semantics propagate these strengths through the network, where tokens support or attack each other based on their evolving polarities. Token weights are computed using cross-encoder similarity. For hallucination detection, five features (NumAtk, AvgInit, AvgFin, VarInit, VarFin) are extracted per layer region and fed into an XGBoost classifier.

## Key Results
- Latent debate achieves up to 97% consistency with original LLM predictions on True/False tasks
- The framework detects hallucinations with AUROC scores up to 0.93
- Analysis reveals high internal debate in middle layers strongly correlates with hallucinations
- The approach serves as a faithful surrogate model for understanding LLM decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Latent debate works by treating the LLM's hidden states as implicit arguments that can support or attack each other during inference. By constructing a symbolic argumentation framework over these states, the method captures the model's internal reasoning process that isn't explicitly visible in the final output. The gradual semantics propagation allows for nuanced strength values rather than binary support/attack relationships, better approximating the continuous nature of neural representations. The correlation between high debate variance in middle layers and hallucinations suggests that internal uncertainty manifests as conflicting arguments during processing, which the framework can detect and quantify.

## Foundational Learning
- **Qualitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF)**: A symbolic framework for modeling arguments and their support/attack relationships. Needed to provide the mathematical structure for aggregating hidden state representations. Quick check: Verify that the QBAF construction creates the expected linear intra-layer and rightmost inter-layer connections.
- **Gradual semantics**: A method for assigning continuous strength values to arguments rather than binary support/attack. Needed to capture the nuanced relationships between hidden states. Quick check: Confirm that strength values propagate correctly through the QBAF using the tanh-based gradual semantics formula.
- **Unembedding matrix projection**: Using the transpose of the embedding matrix to project hidden states back to vocabulary space. Needed to extract token-level probabilities from hidden representations. Quick check: Validate that projecting hidden states yields meaningful True/False probability distributions.
- **Token weighting via cross-encoder**: Computing importance scores for tokens based on semantic similarity. Needed to weight different tokens differently in the argumentation framework. Quick check: Ensure token weights reflect semantic importance by comparing weighted vs unweighted debate features.
- **SHAP feature importance**: A method for interpreting model predictions by quantifying feature contributions. Needed to identify which debate features correlate with hallucinations. Quick check: Verify SHAP values correctly identify high-variance middle-layer features as important predictors.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Hidden states -> Unembedding projection -> QBAF construction -> Gradual semantics propagation -> Final polarity extraction -> Consistency measurement

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is hidden state extraction → unembedding projection → QBAF construction → gradual semantics propagation. Any error in these steps will prevent the framework from functioning.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for interpretability by using symbolic argumentation over neural states. Alternative approaches might use direct neural probing or attention analysis, but these wouldn't provide the structured reasoning visualization that QBAF offers.

**Failure Signatures**: Low consistency (<80%) indicates incorrect prompt formatting or wrong token positions. Unexpected polarity flips during propagation suggest incorrect initial strength normalization or edge assignment. Poor hallucination detection performance indicates incorrect feature extraction or layer region definitions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test prompt template variations on common claim dataset to identify optimal formatting
2. Compare debate features with and without token weighting to validate importance scoring
3. Manually verify QBAF polarity propagation on simple synthetic examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the latent debate framework be generalized to open-ended generation tasks or multi-class classification, rather than being restricted to binary True/False prediction? The current argument interpreter relies on projecting hidden states onto a binary vocabulary, limiting empirical validation to binary outcomes.

**Open Question 2**: Can the latent debate framework be utilized to actively intervene in and correct the model's reasoning process to reduce hallucinations, rather than solely serving as a passive detection mechanism? The authors explicitly state improving model capabilities is not their purpose.

**Open Question 3**: What is the causal mechanism driving the correlation between high "internal debate" in middle layers and hallucinations? The paper observes correlation but doesn't establish causality between debate variance and hallucination occurrence.

## Limitations
- The framework is currently limited to binary True/False prediction tasks, requiring new methods for multi-class or open-ended generation
- Performance claims depend on unspecified experimental details including exact prompt templates and ground truth labeling methods
- The causal relationship between internal debate and hallucinations remains unproven, showing only correlation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The conceptual framework of using hidden states to model internal debate through symbolic argumentation is sound and reproducible. The general methodology of projecting hidden states through unembedding matrices to obtain True/False probabilities is clearly specified.

**Medium Confidence**: The consistency score of up to 97% is plausible given the described methodology, but cannot be verified without the exact prompt template and distractor generation process. The five debate features are clearly defined, but their effectiveness depends on correct implementation.

**Low Confidence**: The hallucination detection AUROC scores up to 0.93 and the specific finding that middle layers show highest debate during hallucinations cannot be independently validated without knowing the ground truth labeling method and exact layer region definitions.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Template Verification**: Implement and test multiple prompt variations (with/without auxiliary tokens, different formatting) on a small common claim dataset to identify which template yields the expected consistency patterns described in the paper.

2. **Distractor Generation Validation**: Create a controlled experiment using TriviaQA where distractor answers are generated from the same passage using different question-answering strategies, then measure how this affects the consistency scores and debate patterns.

3. **Ground Truth Labeling Audit**: For a subset of samples from TruthfulQA, manually annotate which responses are hallucinations versus correct, then compare this to the model's feature-based classification to verify the AUROC scores and confirm that high debate in middle layers correlates with actual hallucinations.
