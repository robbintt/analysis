# Towards Decentralized and Sustainable Foundation Model Training with the Edge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01803
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Edge devices can train foundation models 1.5-4× more energy-efficiently than cloud GPUs, and when accounting for both embodied and operational carbon, offloading computation to edge devices can reduce total carbon emissions by 3.5-8× compared to cloud-based training.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using distributed edge devices to train foundation models in a decentralized and sustainable manner. The authors present a three-step argument: (1) edge devices are more energy-efficient than cloud GPUs due to specialized AI hardware, (2) edge devices have high embodied carbon but low utilization, and (3) better utilization of edge devices enables offloading computation from the cloud, reducing overall carbon footprint. Experimental results show that training with edge devices can be 1.5-4× more energy-efficient than cloud GPUs, and when accounting for both embodied and operational carbon, offloading computation to edge devices can reduce total carbon emissions by 3.5-8× compared to cloud-based training. The authors identify key challenges including distributed training methods for edge, training orchestration, energy monitoring, security/privacy, and user incentives that need to be addressed to realize this vision.

## Method Summary
The paper trains OPT series language models (125m to 66b) on the MMLU dataset to compare energy efficiency between edge devices and cloud GPUs. Single-device training uses 100 steps with batch size 16 and sequence length 512. Distributed edge training employs the DT-FM method with data and pipeline parallelism. Communication is constrained to 10MB/s symmetric bandwidth with 0.5W WiFi power. The analysis compares against an idealized DAG-based distributed training method.

## Key Results
- Edge devices can train ML models with 1.5–4× lower energy consumption than cloud GPUs
- Offloading compute from cloud to edge yields 4–8× net carbon reduction when matching equivalent FLOPS
- Better utilization of already-owned edge devices amortizes their high embodied carbon footprint

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Edge devices can train ML models with 1.5–4× lower energy consumption than cloud GPUs.
- Mechanism: Edge hardware is optimized for power and thermal constraints (battery life, passive cooling), yielding 15–20× lower power draw. Despite 2–10× longer training times, the product (power × time) favors edge for total energy.
- Core assumption: Training workloads can be effectively distributed across heterogeneous edge devices without excessive communication overhead negating energy gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "edge devices can be 1.5-4x more energy-efficient for training compared to cloud GPUs"
  - [Page 3, Table 1] Smartphone (10W, 3510s, 9.75Wh) vs Cloud GPU (220W, 250s, 15.28Wh) for OPT-125m
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—neighbor papers focus on edge inference or decentralized fine-tuning (DeCAF), not pre-training energy efficiency.
- Break condition: If communication energy dominates (e.g., high-frequency gradient synchronization across slow WAN links), net energy advantage erodes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Better utilizing already-owned edge devices amortizes their high embodied carbon footprint.
- Mechanism: Embodied carbon (manufacturing, transport) dominates edge device lifecycle (>80% for smartphones). Since this cost is sunk regardless of usage, increasing operational utilization spreads embodied carbon across more useful compute-work.
- Core assumption: Devices are idle for significant periods (≥75%) and can be recruited without shortening hardware lifespan substantially.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 3, §4.2] "edge devices often stay idle... at least 75% of the time"; embodied carbon is >80% of total footprint for mobile
  - [Page 4, Fig. 4] Single-device carbon breakdown showing embodied dominance
  - [corpus] Junkyard Computing (Switzer et al.) corroborates embodied carbon amortization via device repurposing, though for discarded phones.
- Break condition: If additional compute load accelerates device replacement cycles (e.g., battery degradation, thermal wear), embodied amortization benefit diminishes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Offloading compute from cloud to edge yields 4–8× net carbon reduction when matching equivalent FLOPS.
- Mechanism: Replace a cloud GPU's full carbon (embodied + operational) with the marginal operational carbon of N edge devices whose baseline carbon is already incurred. Edge devices' higher energy efficiency and idle availability make this net-positive.
- Core assumption: Edge devices can be recruited during charging windows to avoid battery drain, and coordination overhead is manageable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 4, Fig. 5] 3-year carbon: H100 GPU (7 tCO₂e) vs 15 laptops or 69 smartphones with 4–8× reduction
  - [Page 5, §4.2] Offloading calculation accounting for communication carbon
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration—neighbor papers don't quantify cloud-to-edge carbon offloading at scale.
- Break condition: If grid carbon intensity at edge locations is significantly higher than cloud datacenter regions, operational carbon advantage may reverse.

## Foundational Learning

- **Embodied vs. Operational Carbon**
  - Why needed here: The paper's sustainability argument hinges on treating embodied carbon as sunk and optimizing operational carbon. Misunderstanding this leads to incorrect conclusions about net impact.
  - Quick check question: If a smartphone's total 3-year carbon is 60 kgCO₂e and embodied is 50 kgCO₂e, what's the marginal carbon cost of doubling its compute usage?

- **Distributed Training Parallelism (Data, Pipeline, Tensor)**
  - Why needed here: Foundation models exceed single-device memory; understanding how model and data are sharded across devices is essential for designing edge-compatible training methods.
  - Quick check question: For a 1.3B parameter model that doesn't fit on one phone, which parallelism strategy minimizes communication over slow WiFi?

- **Thermal Throttling in Edge SoCs**
  - Why needed here: Sustained training loads trigger hardware-imposed slowdowns, affecting both throughput and energy efficiency—critical for scheduling decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why might a 10-minute training burst be more energy-efficient than a 60-minute continuous run on a passively cooled laptop?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Edge layer: Smartphones, laptops with NPUs/GPUs; run local training shards
  - Orchestration layer: Scheduler for device selection, workload partitioning, checkpointing; may be hierarchical (local aggregators → global coordinator)
  - Communication layer: WAN for control messages; local aggregation where possible to reduce cross-device traffic
  - Monitoring layer: Energy/carbon tracking per device (power APIs, grid carbon intensity)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Device recruitment (idle detection, charging status, thermal headroom)
  2. Workload partitioning (model sharding + data parallelism assignment)
  3. Training execution with periodic gradient synchronization
  4. Fault recovery (checkpoint/restore on device dropout)
  5. Carbon accounting per training run

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous aggregation: Synchronous converges faster but stalls on stragglers; asynchronous tolerates heterogeneity but may hurt accuracy
  - Centralized vs. decentralized orchestration: Centralized simpler but scales poorly; decentralized robust but complex
  - Checkpoint frequency: Frequent checkpoints reduce lost work but add I/O overhead and storage costs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Straggler-induced stalls: One slow device blocks synchronous updates
  - Thermal throttling cascade: Devices overheat, slow down, miss deadlines, trigger reassignments
  - Communication bottleneck: Gradient sync latency dominates compute time
  - Device churn mid-epoch: Frequent joins/leaves cause repeated recovery cycles

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Single-device energy profiling: Train OPT-125m on laptop, phone, and cloud GPU; measure power, time, and total energy to validate 1.5–4× efficiency claim under controlled conditions.
  2. Small-scale distributed training: Run DT-FM or similar method across 4–8 edge devices with synthetic network constraints (10 Mbps, 50 ms RTT); measure throughput degradation vs. idealized baseline.
  3. Carbon-aware scheduling simulation: Using historical device availability traces and regional grid carbon intensity, simulate a 24-hour training job and compare carbon footprint of naive vs. carbon-aware device selection policies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can distributed training methods be designed to optimize both speed and carbon footprint by flattening communication-related energy costs as the system scales across heterogeneous edge devices?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "The key challenge is to design distributed training methods that optimize both speed and carbon footprint by flattening communication-related energy costs as the system scales."
- Why unresolved: Existing compression techniques are often limited to fine-tuning due to accuracy concerns, and communication overhead compounds inefficiently in wide-area networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A hybrid parallelism strategy that maintains pre-training accuracy while demonstrating a sub-linear increase in energy consumption per device as the network size grows.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the Pareto-optimal strategies for achieving seamless fault tolerance with minimal overhead in dense, communication-bound edge training workloads?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Achieving seamless fault tolerance with minimal overhead requires identifying Pareto-optimal strategies suited for dense, communication-bound edge training workloads."
- Why unresolved: Traditional methods like replication increase carbon costs, while recomputation risks slowdowns, and edge devices are uniquely susceptible to thermal throttling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A scheduling mechanism that minimizes recovery latency and energy waste during device dropouts without triggering thermal-induced performance degradation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cross-platform energy monitoring solutions be designed to be lightweight, accurate, and holistic across diverse edge hardware components?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The key challenge is to create cross-platform solutions that remain lightweight, accurate, and holistic across diverse edge devices."
- Why unresolved: Current software-based tools offer only coarse-grained measurements, risking misattribution of energy use, while hardware tools are specific to GPUs and neglect edge-specific SoCs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified energy model capable of inferring fine-grained consumption for memory and networking components on edge devices, validated against physical power measurements.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can incentive structures align user participation with low-carbon energy windows without degrading device responsiveness or charging efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the challenge "lies in enabling preemptible, seamless training... informed by user activity and energy conditions" and suggests rewarding users for aligning with low-carbon windows.
- Why unresolved: Training adds compute load that can degrade user experience and charging efficiency, and current systems lack robust mechanisms to encourage carbon-aware participation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A system demonstration showing effective preemption during user activity and measurable carbon reduction through user participation during cleaner energy hours.

## Limitations

- Energy measurement fidelity: Single-device power readings may be affected by background processes and battery management systems not fully controlled in the experimental setup.
- Distributed training scalability: The paper extrapolates single-device energy savings to distributed settings using DT-FM, but this method's behavior under heterogeneous edge constraints is not empirically validated at scale.
- Carbon intensity assumptions: Grid carbon intensity values used for edge vs. cloud regions are not explicitly sourced or validated.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The theoretical basis for edge devices being more energy-efficient than cloud GPUs due to hardware specialization and thermal constraints.
- Medium confidence: The carbon reduction claims when accounting for both embodied and operational carbon, given the sensitivity to grid intensity assumptions.
- Low confidence: The scalability and practical feasibility of the proposed distributed training approach under real-world network and thermal constraints.

## Next Checks

1. **Hardware power profiling**: Conduct controlled power measurements on target edge devices (smartphone, laptop) during training runs with background processes disabled to validate the energy efficiency gap.
2. **Small-scale distributed trial**: Implement DT-FM or a similar method across 4-8 edge devices with realistic network constraints (e.g., 10 Mbps, 50 ms RTT) and measure throughput degradation vs. idealized conditions.
3. **Carbon-aware scheduling simulation**: Using historical device availability traces and regional grid carbon intensity data, simulate a 24-hour training job and compare the carbon footprint of naive vs. carbon-aware device selection policies.
