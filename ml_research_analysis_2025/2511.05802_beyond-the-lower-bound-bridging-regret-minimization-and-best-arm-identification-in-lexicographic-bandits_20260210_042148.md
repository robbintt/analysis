# Beyond the Lower Bound: Bridging Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification in Lexicographic Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05802
- Authors: Bo Xue; Yuanyu Wan; Zhichao Lu; Qingfu Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces LexElim-Out and LexElim-In algorithms for lexicographic bandits that bridge regret minimization and best arm identification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of balancing regret minimization and best arm identification in lexicographic multi-objective bandit problems. The authors propose two novel algorithms - LexElim-Out for sequential layer-by-layer elimination and LexElim-In for simultaneous cross-objective elimination. These methods achieve regret bounds comparable to single-objective approaches while providing anytime performance guarantees, effectively bridging two traditionally separate problem formulations in multi-armed bandits.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces LexElim-Out, which eliminates arms sequentially according to objective priorities, achieving regret bounds of O(Λᵢ(λ)√(Kt)) for each objective i. LexElim-In leverages cross-objective information simultaneously to accelerate the elimination process, surpassing known lower bounds for single-objective bandits. Both algorithms incorporate the trade-off parameter λ to balance exploration and exploitation across multiple objectives, with theoretical analysis establishing minimax regret bounds that match single-objective results up to a factor dependent on λ.

## Key Results
- LexElim-Out achieves regret bounds comparable to single-objective methods through sequential layer-by-layer elimination
- LexElim-In leverages cross-objective information simultaneously to surpass known lower bounds for single-objective bandits
- Both methods provide anytime performance guarantees with minimax regret bounds of O(Λᵢ(λ)√(Kt)) for each objective i

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by exploiting the hierarchical structure of lexicographic preferences. LexElim-Out systematically eliminates suboptimal arms layer by layer according to objective priorities, maintaining exploration in earlier layers while exploiting information from later layers. LexElim-In takes a more aggressive approach by simultaneously using cross-objective correlations to accelerate elimination, effectively trading some exploration for faster convergence. The trade-off parameter λ controls the balance between these competing objectives, with the algorithms adapting their elimination strategies based on the observed correlations between objectives.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-objective bandit theory**: Understanding the fundamental differences between single-objective and multi-objective bandit problems, including the concept of Pareto optimality and trade-off surfaces. This is needed to properly frame the lexicographic bandit problem and understand why traditional approaches fail. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between Pareto optimality and lexicographic optimality?

**Regret minimization framework**: Knowledge of how regret is defined and bounded in bandit problems, including the relationship between exploration, exploitation, and sample complexity. This is essential for understanding the theoretical guarantees provided by the algorithms. Quick check: What is the relationship between regret bounds and sample complexity in multi-armed bandits?

**Lower bound analysis**: Understanding techniques for establishing fundamental limits on algorithm performance, including information-theoretic arguments and the use of packing arguments. This is needed to properly contextualize the claimed improvements over existing methods. Quick check: How do you establish lower bounds for multi-objective bandit problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: LexElim-Out: Objective prioritization -> Sequential elimination -> Regret tracking; LexElim-In: Cross-objective correlation detection -> Simultaneous elimination -> Accelerated convergence

**Critical path**: The most critical sequence is: objective value estimation -> correlation analysis -> elimination decision -> regret update. Any failure in the correlation analysis step can lead to incorrect eliminations and degraded performance.

**Design tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between exploration completeness (ensuring all potentially optimal arms are considered) and elimination speed (quickly removing clearly suboptimal arms). LexElim-Out favors completeness while LexElim-In favors speed through aggressive cross-objective exploitation.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance typically manifests as either excessive arm retention (slow elimination) or premature elimination of potentially optimal arms. These failures often stem from inaccurate correlation estimates or inappropriate choice of the trade-off parameter λ.

**3 first experiments**: 
1. Test algorithms on a simple two-objective problem with known optimal arms to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate performance sensitivity to different λ values on a synthetic problem with controllable correlation structure
3. Compare elimination speed against baseline methods on problems with varying degrees of objective correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific monotonicity conditions on the trade-off parameter that may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Empirical validation is limited to synthetic experiments without real-world datasets or complex benchmark environments
- The exact relationship between the trade-off parameter λ and performance degradation needs clarification

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithms on real-world multi-objective optimization problems with varying correlation structures between objectives
2. Conduct extensive sensitivity analysis on the trade-off parameter λ across different problem configurations
3. Validate theoretical regret bounds against additional baselines including state-of-the-art multi-objective bandit algorithms
