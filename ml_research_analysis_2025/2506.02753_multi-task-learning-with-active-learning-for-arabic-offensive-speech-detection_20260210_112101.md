# Multi-task Learning with Active Learning for Arabic Offensive Speech Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.02753
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02753
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 85.42% macro F1-score on OSACT2022 dataset with 10 active learning samples per batch

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework with active learning to detect offensive, violent, and vulgar speech in Arabic social media text. By jointly training on auxiliary tasks and using uncertainty sampling, the model improves detection accuracy while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Weighted emoji handling is introduced to capture additional semantic cues from social media content. Experiments on the OSACT2022 dataset show that the approach achieves a state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 85.42%, outperforming existing methods with significantly fewer fine-tuning samples.

## Method Summary
The approach uses AraBERT-TwitterV2 as a shared encoder with three parallel task-specific heads for offensive, violent, and vulgar speech detection. Active learning employs entropy-based uncertainty sampling to select the most informative samples (10 per batch) for fine-tuning. Weighted emoji handling assigns higher weights to emojis commonly associated with offensive content. The MTL framework uses BCEWithLogitsLoss with dynamic task weighting, where the offensive task weight adapts based on per-task performance. The model is trained using AdamW optimizer (learning rate 2e-5) with early stopping on the primary offensive task.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85.42% macro F1-score on OSACT2022 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
- Requires only 10 samples per batch through active learning versus full dataset training
- Weighted emoji handling consistently improves performance across all configurations
- Dynamic MTL weighting with equal uncertainty sampling provides optimal results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Joint training on related tasks improves detection accuracy by leveraging shared representations
- **Mechanism:** Hard parameter sharing where AraBERT-TwitterV2 encoder learns common semantic/syntactic features across all three tasks while task-specific layers handle individual classification
- **Core assumption:** The three tasks share underlying semantic patterns—content that is violent or vulgar often co-occurs with or signals offensive content
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "By jointly training on two auxiliary tasks, violent and vulgar speech, the model leverages shared representations to improve the detection accuracy of the offensive speech."
  - [Section 3.3]: "A batch of multi-labeled samples, each annotated for offensive, violent, and vulgar content, is fed into the AraBERT-TwitterV2 encoder to generate contextual embeddings"
  - [corpus]: Related work demonstrates MTL effectiveness for Arabic offensive speech

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Entropy-based uncertainty sampling reduces labeled data requirements by prioritizing samples where the model is least confident
- **Mechanism:** Compute entropy H(x) = −Σ P(y|x) log P(y|x) for each task's predictions and select top-k highest-entropy samples for fine-tuning
- **Core assumption:** Samples near decision boundaries provide more informative gradients than confidently classified samples
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an active learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques"
  - [Table 7]: MTL with Dynamic weighting + Equal uncertainty achieves 85.42% with only 10 selected samples per batch
  - [corpus]: U-GIFT paper demonstrates uncertainty-guided approaches for toxic speech

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Weighted emoji handling captures semantic cues that improve offensive speech detection
- **Mechanism:** Assign higher weights to a predefined list of emojis associated with offensive content during embedding/tokenization
- **Core assumption:** Emojis carry semantic meaning relevant to offensiveness that is complementary to text signals
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "We also introduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues."
  - [Table 3]: STL with weighted emojis achieves 85.13% vs. 83.89% without emojis using all samples
  - [Section 4.2]: "The inclusion of emojis consistently leads to performance improvements... the most substantial improvements are obtained with weighted emojis"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Task Learning (Hard Parameter Sharing)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core architecture choice for leveraging shared representations across related tasks
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why sharing lower layers while keeping task-specific output layers might help when tasks share some but not all features?

- **Concept: Entropy as Uncertainty Measure**
  - **Why needed here:** Drives the active learning component by quantifying prediction uncertainty
  - **Quick check question:** Given a binary classifier outputting [0.48, 0.52] vs. [0.05, 0.95], which sample has higher entropy and why would active learning prioritize it?

- **Concept: Task Weighting in MTL Loss Functions**
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for balancing primary vs. auxiliary task contributions in the loss function
  - **Quick check question:** Why might dynamic weighting outperform static weighting when tasks have different convergence rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessing → Emoji weighting → Encoder → [Uncertainty sampling loop] → MTL forward pass → Loss weighting → Backprop → Repeat until convergence
- **Critical path:** Preprocessing → Emoji weighting → Encoder → [Uncertainty sampling loop] → MTL forward pass → Loss weighting → Backprop → Repeat until convergence
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 10 samples/batch with optimal settings achieves best results; more samples don't always help
  - Equal uncertainty + Dynamic MTL weighting (85.42%) outperforms other uncertainty schemes
  - 0.70 offensive / 0.15 violent / 0.15 vulgar works best; over-weighting primary task degrades performance
  - Weighted emojis outperform both exclusion and uniform inclusion
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Sarcasm/implicit offense: Model fails on jokes with offensive punchlines
  - Cultural references: Misclassifies tweets with context-dependent phrases
  - Reply context: Standalone tweets that require conversation context for proper labeling
  - Emoji ambiguity: Emojis used in non-offensive contexts triggering false positives
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. STL baseline with emoji ablation: Train single-task offensive detector with no emojis / uniform emojis / weighted emojis
  2. MTL loss weighting sweep: Fix uncertainty sampling to equal, test equal/static/dynamic task weighting
  3. Sample efficiency curve: Vary selected samples (10, 20, 30, 40) with best MTL+uncertainty configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the proposed MTL-Active Learning framework maintain its performance efficiency when applied to diverse Arabic dialects or multilingual benchmarks outside the OSACT2022 dataset?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "the generalizability of the model needs to be validated by applying it to other Arabic offensive language datasets or multilingual benchmarks."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study restricted validation to a single dataset (OSACT2022), leaving the model's robustness against different dialectal variations and annotation schemas unproven.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluating the framework on alternative datasets (e.g., L-HSAB, ArCybC) and reporting macro F1-scores to compare against current state-of-the-art baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the framework be augmented to better detect implicit offensiveness, such as sarcasm, humor, or culturally nuanced references?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that "several challenges remain," specifically citing "difficulty in understanding implicit sarcasm, cultural references, and contextually nuanced language" in the conclusion.
- **Why unresolved:** The error analysis revealed that the AraBERT-based model frequently fails to grasp intent in jokes or culturally specific references without explicit offensive terms.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integrating auxiliary tasks related to emotion or sarcasm detection, or using knowledge graphs for cultural entities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the Multi-task Learning architecture be adapted to handle hierarchical label dependencies, specifically to include hate speech detection?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper excludes hate speech detection from the MTL framework because the dataset labels hate speech only if a tweet is offensive, violating task independence assumptions.
- **Why unresolved:** The current MTL implementation assumes tasks are independent, forcing the exclusion of the hate speech dimension despite its relevance to online toxicity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Developing a hierarchical multi-task loss function or cascaded architecture that conditions hate speech on offensive speech output.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does incorporating conversational context significantly reduce the error rate for context-dependent misclassifications?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The results section identifies that misclassifications often occur because many tweets are "written as replies" and "full intent... can only be understood within the larger conversation thread."
- **Why unresolved:** The input preprocessing treats each tweet as a standalone unit, stripping away conversational cues necessary to disambiguate terms.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Modifying the input pipeline to include thread history and conducting an ablation study.

## Limitations
- Extreme class imbalance (132 vulgar, 60 violent samples) may prevent auxiliary tasks from contributing meaningful signal
- Emoji weighting mechanism lacks transparency due to undisclosed offensive emoji list and weights
- Dynamic weighting implementation ambiguity (per epoch vs. per batch) affects reproducibility
- Model struggles with sarcasm, cultural references, and context-dependent language

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** General framework of MTL + active learning + emoji weighting is sound and reproducible
- **Medium confidence:** Relative performance gains of different configurations are reported but cannot be independently verified
- **Low confidence:** Claims about specific superiority of weighted emojis over uniform inclusion or exclusion cannot be validated

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study with controlled emoji lists:** Create multiple emoji weighting schemes and measure their independent impact on performance
2. **Auxiliary task F1 monitoring:** Track F1 scores for all three tasks per epoch during MTL training
3. **Uncertainty calibration analysis:** Compare entropy distributions of correctly vs. incorrectly classified samples in the active learning pool
