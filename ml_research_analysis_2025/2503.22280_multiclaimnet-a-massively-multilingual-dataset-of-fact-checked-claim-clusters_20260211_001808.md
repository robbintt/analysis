# MultiClaimNet: A Massively Multilingual Dataset of Fact-Checked Claim Clusters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22280
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22280
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: MultiClaimNet introduces three multilingual claim cluster datasets enabling automated fact-checking with 85.3K claims in 78 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MultiClaimNet, a collection of three multilingual claim cluster datasets designed to improve efficiency in automated fact-checking pipelines. The datasets contain 85.3K claims across 78 languages, automatically constructed using approximate nearest neighbor retrieval and large language model annotation. The authors evaluate various clustering approaches and sentence embedding models, finding that Agglomerative clustering with smaller multilingual embedding models performs best, achieving V-Measures up to 0.969 on smaller datasets.

## Method Summary
The method constructs claim clusters through a pipeline: first, HNSW retrieves approximate nearest neighbors for each claim in embedding space; second, three LLMs (GPT-4, Phi-3 14B, Falcon 40B) annotate claim pairs with unanimous voting for "similar" pairs; third, transitive linking forms sub-clusters from annotated pairs; finally, inter-cluster merging combines sub-clusters using top-20 nearest neighbors filtered by cosine similarity > 0.75 and re-annotation. The datasets are evaluated using various clustering algorithms (HDBSCAN, OPTICS, Agglomerative, Birch, Affinity Propagation) with multiple sentence embedding models (ranging from 305M to 9B parameters) on metrics including V-Measure, ARI, AMI, Homogeneity, Completeness, and Purity.

## Key Results
- Agglomerative clustering with smaller multilingual embedding models (<1B parameters) achieved the highest performance, with V-Measures up to 0.969
- Larger embedding models (7B-9B parameters) underperformed compared to smaller models on clustering metrics
- HDBSCAN and OPTICS required UMAP dimensionality reduction (8 dimensions) and performed worse than Agglomerative on large datasets
- Unanimous LLM annotation achieved higher precision but excluded valid pairs missed by single models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transitive linking of similar claim pairs produces coherent claim clusters without exhaustive pairwise comparison
- Mechanism: Claim-matching datasets provide annotated pairs (A~B). By assuming bidirectional similarity and chaining links (A~B and B~C → {A,B,C} in same cluster), clusters emerge from sparse pairwise labels rather than full N×N annotation
- Core assumption: Similarity is transitive for claims discussing the same underlying fact
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Claim clusters are formed automatically from claim-matching pairs with limited manual intervention"; [section 3] "If two claims are labeled as similar, we assume the similarity is bidirectional; therefore, they belong to the same cluster"
- Break condition: If claims A~B and B~C discuss different aspects of B, transitivity fails and clusters merge incorrectly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) retrieval followed by LLM consensus annotation yields scalable similar-pair identification
- Mechanism: HNSW retrieves the nearest neighbor per claim in embedding space (~162K pairs). Three LLMs annotate each pair; only unanimous "similar" labels are retained, reducing noise
- Core assumption: Nearest neighbors in sentence-embedding space are likely to be semantically similar claims; LLM consensus approximates human judgment
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "retrieval of approximate nearest neighbors to form candidate claim pairs and an automated annotation of claim similarity using large language models"; [section 3.2.1] "We used only the claim pairs that were unanimously annotated as similar by all three selected LLMs rather than relying on the majority label"
- Break condition: Low LLM inter-annotator agreement (drops to 41–69% in inter-cluster merging per Section 3.2.2) indicates the mechanism degrades on harder pairs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Smaller multilingual sentence embedding models (<1B parameters) outperform larger LLM-based embeddings for claim clustering when paired with Agglomerative clustering
- Mechanism: Sentence transformers encode claims into dense vectors; Agglomerative clustering builds hierarchical trees by iteratively merging closest pairs. Smaller models (e.g., gte-multilingual-base, 305M params) achieve V-Measure up to 0.969 on smaller datasets
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity in embedding space correlates with factual similarity for clustering purposes
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Experiments with various clustering approaches and sentence embedding models show that Agglomerative clustering and smaller multilingual embedding models perform best, achieving V-Measures up to 0.969"; [section 5.2] "smaller models (< 1B parameters) achieved the highest scores compared to the larger models"
- Break condition: Agglomerative clustering shows 4–7.5× higher variance in cluster counts across embedding models vs. HDBSCAN (Table 6), indicating sensitivity to representation choice

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) for ANN search
  - Why needed here: Core retrieval mechanism for generating candidate similar pairs without O(N²) comparison
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why HNSW trades approximate results for logarithmic query time vs. exact k-NN?

- Concept: Sentence Transformers / Multilingual Embeddings
  - Why needed here: Claims in 86 languages must be represented in a shared semantic space for similarity comparison
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a sentence transformer's [CLS] pooling vs. mean pooling for semantic similarity?

- Concept: Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative) and Distance Thresholds
  - Why needed here: Baseline clustering method that performed best on large datasets; requires understanding linkage criteria (ward vs. average) and distance thresholds
  - Quick check question: How does setting a distance threshold of 1.0 (Table 9) affect when clusters stop merging in Agglomerative clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Source Layer -> Candidate Generation -> Annotation Layer -> Cluster Construction -> Evaluation Layer
- Critical path: ANN retrieval quality → LLM annotation precision → cluster coherence. If retrieval misses true neighbors or LLMs disagree, clusters fragment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. Recall: Unanimous LLM agreement increases precision but excludes valid pairs missed by one model
  - Scalability vs. Quality: Agglomerative clustering performs best but has O(N²) memory; HDBSCAN scales but degrades on large datasets (Table 4)
  - Embedding model size vs. performance: Larger models (7B–9B) underperform smaller multilingual models on clustering metrics
- Failure signatures:
  - Sub-clusters: Retrieving only 1 neighbor per claim causes cluster fragmentation (Section 3.2.1)
  - Wrong merges: Claims discussing multiple facts create false links (Section 7 Limitations)
  - Entity mismatch: Same entity with different references (e.g., "AstraZeneca" vs. "anti-covid vaccination") causes split clusters (Table 7)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline on ClaimCheck: Load Bge-m3 embeddings, run Agglomerative clustering with distance_threshold=1.0, linkage='ward'; expect V-Measure ~0.956
  2. Ablate LLM annotators: Compare unanimous 3-LLM agreement vs. majority vote vs. single-LLM on a 5K claim sample; measure annotation agreement rate and downstream cluster quality
  3. Scale test: Run HDBSCAN vs. Agglomerative on MultiClaim (85K claims) with 8-dim UMAP reduction; compare runtime, memory, and V-Measure to identify scalability ceiling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can clustering algorithms be optimized for the iterative integration of new claims into existing clusters to support real-time fact-checking pipelines?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors list "Iterative claim clustering" as a key application, stating approaches should be explored to represent "real-world scenarios of integration of new claims, where it can be merged into an existing cluster or form a new cluster"
  - **Why unresolved:** The baseline experiments in this study were conducted on static datasets, whereas operational fact-checking requires dynamic, incremental updates without re-clustering the entire database
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A study evaluating the latency and accuracy (e.g., V-Measure stability) of streaming or incremental clustering algorithms applied to time-series claim data

- **Question:** Can robust clustering solutions be developed that remain effective regardless of the specific sentence embedding model or dataset scale used?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In Section 5.2, the authors conclude that "developing more robust clustering solutions, independent of the number of data instances and sentence representations, is essential for future research"
  - **Why unresolved:** The study found that Agglomerative clustering is highly sensitive to the choice of sentence embedding, showing a 4-7.5 fold increase in standard deviation compared to HDBSCAN, and performance varies significantly between the small and large datasets
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A framework or algorithm that demonstrates low variance in performance metrics (such as ARI or V-Measure) when tested across the diverse set of embedding models listed in Table 3 and across different dataset sizes

- **Question:** Does incorporating multimodal context (e.g., associated images or videos) reduce the rate of false positive links in claim clustering?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify a limitation in "Reliance on textual content alone for annotation," noting it "may result in false positives when other media associated with a claim refer to different incidents"
  - **Why unresolved:** The current dataset construction and annotation methodology rely exclusively on textual similarity, ignoring the visual context often critical to misinformation (e.g., a generic video reused with a false text caption)
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of MultiClaimNet that includes visual features and an experimental comparison of text-only vs. multimodal clustering performance to see if false positives decrease

## Limitations

- The claim transitivity assumption lacks direct validation - no experiments test whether claims linked through intermediate pairs truly discuss the same underlying facts
- LLM annotation mechanism shows concerning performance degradation with inter-annotator agreement dropping to 41-69% for inter-cluster merging pairs
- Scalability ceiling remains unclear - while Agglomerative clustering achieves best performance, it has O(N²) memory complexity not tested on datasets larger than 85K claims

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** ANN retrieval followed by LLM consensus works for initial similar-pair identification (well-specified procedure with clear results)
- **Medium confidence:** Smaller multilingual embedding models outperform larger LLM-based embeddings for clustering (supported by results but limited external validation)
- **Low confidence:** Transitive linking produces coherent claim clusters (mechanism described but not empirically validated for transitivity assumption)

## Next Checks

1. Test transitivity assumption by sampling 100 claim triples (A~B, B~C) and having human annotators judge whether A and C discuss the same underlying fact
2. Measure LLM annotation consistency across different prompt templates and claim formatting to identify sensitivity to presentation
3. Benchmark clustering performance on synthetic datasets with known cluster structures to isolate embedding quality from clustering algorithm effects
