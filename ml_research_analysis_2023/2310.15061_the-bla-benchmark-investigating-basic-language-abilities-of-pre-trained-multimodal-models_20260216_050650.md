# The BLA Benchmark: Investigating Basic Language Abilities of Pre-Trained Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.15061
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15061
- **Reference count**: 21
- **Primary result**: Pre-trained multimodal models struggle significantly with basic linguistic constructions that preschool children can master

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the BLA (Basic Language Abilities) benchmark to evaluate pre-trained multimodal models on fundamental language comprehension tasks. The benchmark focuses on three linguistic constructions—active-passive voice, coordination, and relative clauses—that are typically mastered by preschool children. Using Visual Genome annotations, the authors construct a dataset of image-sentence pairs for each construction, with two true and two false sentences per image. The study evaluates several state-of-the-art models (CLIP, ViLBERT, LXMERT, BLIP2, OpenFlamingo) across zero-shot, fine-tuning, and in-context learning settings, revealing significant performance gaps between models and human capabilities.

## Method Summary
The BLA benchmark is constructed using Visual Genome images and their annotated captions. For each of the three linguistic constructions (active-passive voice, coordination, relative clauses), the authors create templates and filters to generate four sentences per image: two true sentences and two false sentences. The false sentences are constructed by replacing key words while maintaining the same construction type. Models are evaluated in three settings: zero-shot (no task-specific training), fine-tuning (discriminative models only), and in-context learning (generative models only). Performance is measured using accuracy and precision metrics for distinguishing true from false sentences.

## Key Results
- All tested models (CLIP, ViLBERT, LXMERT, BLIP2, OpenFlamingo) perform significantly worse than humans on BLA tasks
- BLIP2, a generative model, outperforms other models across all settings, particularly in in-context learning
- Models show inconsistent predictions, often labeling all four sentences the same way, suggesting entity grounding failures
- BLA-specific learning helps models, but the improvement is modest and varies across construction types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BLA tasks are difficult for multimodal models because they require precise grounding of entities and predicates, which the models fail to achieve consistently.
- Mechanism: Models often misidentify entities in images, leading to inconsistent predictions where all four sentences (two true, two false) are labeled the same.
- Core assumption: Entity identification and grounding are the primary bottleneck, not overall image-text matching ability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Despite the impressive performance achieved by pre-trained language-and-vision models in downstream tasks, it remains an open question whether this reflects a proper understanding of image-text interaction."
  - [section] "Error Analysis: For each model except CLIP, we consider all the cases where all four sentences are assigned the same predicted label... These patterns reveal that models are very often inconsistent with their predictions."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on similar multimodal benchmarks but does not directly address entity grounding failures.
- Break condition: If models achieve near-human performance on entity identification tasks (e.g., object detection with high accuracy), this mechanism would no longer explain the failure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BLA-specific learning helps models by exposing them to the same linguistic construction in multiple visual contexts, allowing them to learn the structural properties of the construction.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning or in-context learning with construction-specific samples enables models to adjust their representations to better capture the semantic relationships required for each construction.
- Core assumption: The models have sufficient capacity to learn these relationships from a relatively small number of examples (400 samples per task).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our experiments, in particular, show that most of the tested models only marginally benefit when fine-tuned or prompted with construction-specific samples."
  - [section] "BLA-specific learning generally helps... the generative BLIP2 is shown to improve on all three datasets, which confirms the effectiveness of the in-learning setup."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss similar multimodal learning approaches but not specific to construction-specific learning.
- Break condition: If models require significantly more data than 400 samples to show improvement, or if the improvement is not consistent across different linguistic constructions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generative models like BLIP2 outperform discriminative models on BLA tasks because their training objectives include image-grounded text generation, which requires a deeper understanding of entity-predicate relationships.
- Mechanism: The text generation objective forces the model to produce descriptions that accurately reflect the visual content, leading to better entity and predicate grounding.
- Core assumption: The text generation objective is more effective than image-text matching for learning the fine-grained understanding required by BLA tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Yet, the generative BLIP2 shows promising trends, especially in an in-context learning setting."
  - [section] "BLIP2 is the best-performing model... It is worth mentioning that, looking at the relative improvement in precision obtained by various models over the zero-shot setting (Table 3), BLIP2 exhibits a fairly high improvement on all tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus includes related work on generative models but does not specifically compare generative vs discriminative models on BLA-like tasks.
- Break condition: If discriminative models with modified training objectives (e.g., including text generation) achieve similar or better performance than BLIP2 on BLA tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entity recognition and grounding in multimodal contexts
  - Why needed here: BLA tasks require precise identification of entities (people, objects) in images and their relationships to predicates in text.
  - Quick check question: Can the model correctly identify and locate all entities mentioned in a sentence within the corresponding image with high accuracy?

- Concept: Syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling
  - Why needed here: Understanding the structure of sentences (e.g., active vs passive voice, coordination, relative clauses) is crucial for determining truth values.
  - Quick check question: Given a sentence, can the model accurately identify the subject, object, and predicate, and their syntactic relationships?

- Concept: Compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks
  - Why needed here: BLA tasks require combining information from different parts of a sentence (e.g., both conjuncts in coordination) and relating them to the image.
  - Quick check question: Can the model correctly evaluate whether all components of a complex sentence (e.g., coordination) are satisfied by the image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image encoder (ViT/B/32 for CLIP, frozen encoders for BLIP2/OpenFlamingo) -> text encoder (separate for CLIP, integrated for others) -> multimodal fusion layers (co-attention for ViLBERT/LXMERT, cross-attention for BLIP2/OpenFlamingo) -> task-specific heads (ITM classification for ViLBERT/LXMERT, ranking for CLIP, text generation for BLIP2/OpenFlamingo)
- Critical path: Image and text encoding → multimodal fusion → task-specific output (classification, ranking, or generation)
- Design tradeoffs: Generative models require more computational resources and training data but can provide more nuanced outputs; discriminative models are more efficient but may lack the fine-grained understanding needed for BLA tasks
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent predictions where all four sentences are labeled the same, poor performance on tasks requiring entity identification, failure to generalize from construction-specific learning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate model performance on a simplified version of BLA tasks focusing only on entity identification in images
  2. Test the impact of increasing the amount of construction-specific training data on model performance
  3. Compare the performance of modified discriminative models with text generation objectives to the original BLIP2 model on BLA tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do larger pre-trained multimodal models like GPT-4V perform on the BLA benchmark compared to the smaller models tested in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that current models lag far behind human performance and suggests that larger models might perform better, but does not test this.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested relatively small models (ViT-B/32 for CLIP, 3B versions for OpenFlamingo) and did not explore the performance of larger state-of-the-art models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the same BLA benchmark with larger multimodal models like GPT-4V or Gemini would show whether scaling improves basic language comprehension abilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of verb argument structure do models struggle with most in the active-passive construction task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that models struggle with understanding verbs and verb arguments, and notes particularly poor performance on active-passive voice.
- Why unresolved: The error analysis shows models are inconsistent in predictions but doesn't pinpoint which specific linguistic features (e.g., agent-patient roles, syntactic transformations) cause the most difficulty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis categorizing mistakes by linguistic feature (e.g., agent/patient confusion, tense agreement, syntactic structure) would identify the most problematic aspects.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can BLA-specific learning generalize to other linguistic constructions beyond the three tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found cross-task learning was only effective for BLIP2 between coordination and relative clauses, suggesting some shared underlying abilities.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to three constructions and showed mixed results for cross-task generalization, leaving open whether the learned abilities transfer to other constructions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing BLA-specific learning across a broader range of linguistic constructions (e.g., questions, negation, quantifiers) would reveal the extent of generalization.

## Limitations
- BLA benchmark focuses on only three specific linguistic constructions, which may not represent the full range of basic language abilities
- Dataset construction relies heavily on Visual Genome annotations, potentially introducing biases toward certain image types and relationships
- Error analysis reveals model inconsistencies but doesn't pinpoint the specific linguistic features causing the most difficulty

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The observation that generative models (BLIP2) outperform discriminative models on BLA tasks, particularly in in-context learning settings
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that entity grounding and predicate identification are the primary bottlenecks for multimodal models on BLA tasks
- **Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of BLA-specific learning (fine-tuning or in-context learning) in improving model performance

## Next Checks
1. **Entity Recognition Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments isolating entity recognition performance by evaluating models on object detection and attribute recognition tasks using the same Visual Genome images, to determine if entity identification is indeed the primary bottleneck.
2. **Construction Generalization Test**: Extend the BLA benchmark to include additional basic linguistic constructions (e.g., quantifiers, negation) and evaluate whether the observed model limitations persist across a broader range of language abilities.
3. **Data Efficiency Analysis**: Systematically vary the amount of construction-specific training data (from 50 to 1000 samples) to determine the data requirements for meaningful improvement and assess whether the current 400-sample threshold is optimal.
