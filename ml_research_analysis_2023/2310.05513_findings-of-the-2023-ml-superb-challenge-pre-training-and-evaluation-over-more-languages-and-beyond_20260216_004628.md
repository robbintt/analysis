# Findings of the 2023 ML-SUPERB Challenge: Pre-Training and Evaluation over More Languages and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.05513
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05513
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Multilingual SSL models generally outperform limited-language-coverage models in ASR tasks, and efficient smaller models can match larger ones.

## Executive Summary
The 2023 ML-SUPERB Challenge expanded multilingual speech recognition to 154 languages by integrating 54 new language corpora, attracting 12 model submissions. The challenge featured three tracks evaluating self-supervised learning models across public and hidden leaderboards, with findings indicating that merely scaling models is not the definitive solution for multilingual speech tasks. The results showed that multilingual SSL models generally outperformed those trained with limited language coverage, but performance varied significantly when applied to conversational speech and singing voices. Smaller models like NWHC2 and CV-HuBERT-base achieved competitive results, suggesting that efficient model design is crucial for multilingual speech representation learning.

## Method Summary
The ML-SUPERB Challenge evaluated self-supervised learning models using frozen SSL models as feature extractors combined with a CTC-based transformer network for downstream tasks. Models were assessed across four tasks (monolingual ASR, multilingual ASR, LID, and multilingual ASR+LID) using both 10-minute and 1-hour training sets. The challenge featured public leaderboards (143 languages, read speech) and hidden leaderboards (54 languages, conversational speech and singing voices). Twelve model submissions were evaluated, expanding the benchmark to 154 languages through the integration of 54 new language corpora.

## Key Results
- Multilingual SSL models generally outperformed models trained with limited language coverage across multilingual ASR tasks
- Smaller models like NWHC2 and CV-HuBERT-base achieved competitive or better results than larger models like MMS-1b
- Performance degraded significantly on conversational speech and singing voices compared to read speech benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual SSL models generally outperform monolingual or limited-language-coverage models in multilingual ASR tasks.
- Mechanism: Joint training on large, diverse multilingual datasets allows SSL models to learn shared acoustic-phonetic units that transfer across languages, improving generalization.
- Core assumption: Phonetic and acoustic features have sufficient cross-linguistic overlap to enable effective transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multilingual SSL models generally outperformed those trained with limited language coverage"
  - [section] "For the 2023 ML-SUPERB challenge, all model submissions underwent pre-training in multilingual data spanning over 50 languages. The leaderboard results clearly indicate that multilingual SSL typically outperforms those trained with a limited language scope"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus shows related papers but no direct multilingual SSL vs. monolingual comparison results.
- Break condition: If languages in the test set have minimal phonetic overlap with training languages, or if language-specific acoustic units are dominant.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Merely scaling model size is not the definitive solution for multilingual speech tasks.
- Mechanism: Performance gains from scaling are plateauing, and efficient smaller models can match or exceed larger ones due to better architecture or pre-training strategies.
- Core assumption: Architectural innovation and pre-training efficiency can compensate for smaller parameter counts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Findings indicate that merely scaling models is not the definitive solution for multilingual speech tasks"
  - [section] "CV-HuBERT-base outperforms MMS-300m and HuBERT-large, even though it utilizes a base architecture. Similarly, NWHC2 slightly outperforms MMS-1b in the 1-hour hidden benchmark, despite its smaller size and computational burden"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors; this claim is specific to the challenge results.
- Break condition: If tasks require capturing extremely complex multilingual patterns only representable by very large models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diverse speech and voice types (e.g., conversational speech, singing) present significant challenges for multilingual speech representation learning.
- Mechanism: Models trained primarily on read speech struggle with acoustic variability introduced by different speaking styles, prosody, and voice types.
- Core assumption: Read speech data does not adequately cover the acoustic variability present in real-world multilingual scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "As per [12], the majority of the public benchmark comprises read speech, while the hidden benchmark includes a substantial set of conversational speech and singing voices. These varied voice styles present significant challenges for the ML-SUPERB tasks"
  - [section] "The performance in the hidden sets is considerably worse than that in the public sets"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors; this is derived from challenge setup and results.
- Break condition: If models are exposed to and trained on diverse speech styles during pre-training, reducing the domain gap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in speech
  - Why needed here: SSL models learn rich speech representations from unlabeled data, enabling effective downstream tasks like ASR without massive labeled datasets.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between supervised and self-supervised speech representation learning?

- Concept: Cross-lingual transfer
  - Why needed here: Understanding how knowledge from high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource languages is key to building effective multilingual models.
  - Quick check question: What factors influence the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer in speech recognition?

- Concept: Model efficiency and MACs
  - Why needed here: The challenge emphasizes that larger models are not always better; understanding computational efficiency (e.g., MACs) is crucial for practical deployment.
  - Quick check question: How do you calculate the MACs of a speech model, and why is it important for real-world applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input waveform -> SSL model (e.g., HuBERT, XLSR, WavLabLM) -> Feature extractor (frozen) -> Downstream model (e.g., CTC-based transformer) -> Output (ASR/LID). Leaderboards: public (143 languages, read speech) and hidden (54 languages, conversational/singing).
- Critical path: Pre-training SSL model -> Fine-tuning downstream model on task data -> Evaluation on public/hidden leaderboards.
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs. efficiency (MACs), pre-training data diversity vs. computational cost, read speech vs. diverse speech types coverage.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on conversational/singing voice if trained only on read speech; overfitting to high-resource languages; inefficiency leading to high MACs without performance gains.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a multilingual SSL model (e.g., XLSR-128) on the public benchmark 10-minute and 1-hour sets to establish baseline performance.
  2. Test the same model on the hidden benchmark to assess robustness to conversational speech and singing voice.
  3. Compare the performance of a smaller efficient model (e.g., NWHC2) against a larger model (e.g., MMS-1b) on the hidden benchmark to validate the scaling tradeoff insight.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different speech/voice types (e.g., conversational vs. read speech, singing voices) impact the performance of multilingual self-supervised models, and what strategies can be developed to improve robustness across these variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that the hidden benchmark includes conversational speech and singing voices, which present significant challenges compared to the read speech in the public benchmark. Performance in the hidden sets is considerably worse, and the authors suggest that studying multilingual representation across different voice types could be a major research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not provide solutions or detailed analysis of how different voice types specifically affect model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing model performance across diverse speech types (read, conversational, singing) and experiments testing targeted adaptations (e.g., data augmentation, specialized pre-training) to improve robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is scaling model size always beneficial for multilingual speech tasks, or are there scenarios where smaller, more efficient models outperform larger ones?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that while scaling models generally improves performance in monolingual tasks, this trend does not hold for multilingual tasks. Smaller models like CV-HuBERT-base and NWHC2 achieved competitive or better results than larger models like MMS-1b in certain benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides examples but does not systematically investigate the conditions under which smaller models might be preferable or the underlying reasons for this phenomenon.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating a range of model sizes across diverse multilingual tasks and datasets, along with analyses of efficiency vs. performance trade-offs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can self-supervised learning models be effectively adapted to low-resource languages, particularly those with limited or no labeled data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of multilingual representation learning and the challenges of applying models to low-resource languages. It mentions the New Language Track, which encourages contributions of low-resource language data, but does not detail specific adaptation strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for low-resource language support but does not explore or evaluate methods for adapting SSL models to these scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing transfer learning, few-shot learning, or unsupervised adaptation techniques on low-resource languages, along with evaluations of their effectiveness compared to standard approaches.

## Limitations
- The specific quantitative results, error rates, and statistical significance measures are not provided, making it difficult to assess the magnitude of performance differences
- Lack of detailed information about training procedures, hyperparameter settings, and data preprocessing steps for the evaluated models
- Qualitative observation that performance is worse on hidden sets lacks detailed analysis of which specific speech types are most problematic

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The expansion of the multilingual benchmark to 154 languages and the general observation that multilingual SSL models tend to outperform limited-language models
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that efficient smaller models can match or exceed larger models and the challenge in handling diverse speech types (conversational speech, singing)
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about the relative performance of specific model architectures or the exact reasons why scaling alone is insufficient without detailed results and analysis

## Next Checks
1. Request detailed benchmark results showing per-language and per-task performance metrics (CER/PER, accuracy) for all submitted models on both public and hidden benchmarks
2. Analyze speech type performance breakdown by examining model performance on different speech types (read speech, conversational speech, singing) separately
3. Investigate model efficiency metrics by collecting detailed information about computational efficiency (MACs, parameters) of compared models and their actual runtime performance
