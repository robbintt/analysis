# SAIE Framework: Support Alone Isn't Enough -- Advancing LLM Training with Adversarial Remarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08107
- Reference count: 3
- Models trained with SAIE consistently outperform those trained with standard fine-tuning techniques across three reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the SAIE (Support Alone Isn't Enough) framework, a novel interactive training approach for large language models (LLMs) that incorporates both supportive and adversarial discussions during training. The framework involves a learner model and a partner model engaging in multi-round discussions, where the partner model provides adaptive remarks based on the learner's responses. The learner's parameters are then updated based on these interactions. Results show that models trained with SAIE consistently outperform those trained with standard fine-tuning techniques across three reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The SAIE framework uses a two-phase training process: a warm-up phase with standard fine-tuning on 10% of the data, followed by a discussion phase on the remaining 90% over 3 epochs with 3 interaction rounds. During the discussion phase, the learner model generates answers and receives adaptive remarks from a partner model (GPT-3.5), which provides constructive feedback for incorrect answers and adversarial remarks for correct ones. The learner then refines its answer based on this feedback and updates its parameters using the gold reference.

## Key Results
- SAIE achieved 18.50% accuracy on GSM8K vs. 14.63% for fine-tuning
- SAIE achieved 84.84% accuracy on CommonsenseQA vs. 80.83% for fine-tuning
- SAIE achieved 49.21% accuracy on MMLU vs. 47.85% for fine-tuning
- SAIE-enhanced models demonstrated superior performance in multi-agent inference scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The SAIE framework improves LLM reasoning by incorporating adversarial feedback during training, which forces the learner model to refine its responses and develop more robust reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: The learner model generates an answer, and the partner model provides a remark based on the accuracy of the learner's response. If the answer is incorrect, the partner provides constructive feedback; if correct, the partner challenges the learner with adversarial remarks. This iterative process helps the learner model develop deeper understanding and adaptability.
- Core assumption: The learner model can effectively incorporate both supportive and adversarial feedback to improve its reasoning capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The learner model receives responses from the partner, and its parameters are then updated based on this remark. That is, the teacher signal dynamically adjusts in response to the evolving model output throughout the training step."
  - [section]: "In the SAIE framework: If A is incorrect, P is prompted to provide a constructive remark, leading L towards more accurate reasoning. If A is correct, P is prompted to challenge L with an adversarial remark."
- Break condition: If the partner model fails to provide meaningful feedback or the learner model cannot effectively incorporate the feedback, the framework's effectiveness may be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The SAIE framework enhances LLM performance by allowing the learner model to refine its responses through multiple rounds of discussion with the partner model.
- Mechanism: The learner model generates an initial answer, receives a remark from the partner model, and refines its answer based on the feedback. This process is repeated for several rounds, allowing the learner model to progressively improve its responses.
- Core assumption: Multiple rounds of discussion and feedback can significantly improve the learner model's reasoning and articulation skills.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This dynamic adjustment process continues throughout the training phase, responding to the evolving outputs of the learner model."
  - [section]: "Following the Partner model's remark, the Learner model (L) refines its answer. This refinement process involves updating L's parameters based on the gold reference provided in the training set."
- Break condition: If the number of discussion rounds is insufficient or the feedback is not sufficiently informative, the framework may not lead to significant improvements in the learner model's performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The SAIE framework improves LLM performance in multi-agent inference scenarios by enhancing the model's ability to engage in productive discussions with other models or humans.
- Mechanism: The learner model, trained with the SAIE framework, can effectively engage in discussions during inference, leveraging the reasoning and articulation skills developed during training to achieve better performance in collaborative scenarios.
- Core assumption: The skills developed during the SAIE training phase can be effectively applied during inference to improve performance in multi-agent discussions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-agent inference scenarios, boosting the models' reasoning abilities at the inference step."
  - [section]: "The structured discussion phase in the SAIE framework, incorporating both supportive and adversarial remarks, is pivotal in developing advanced reasoning and articulation skills in L, particularly valuable during inference scenarios."
- Break condition: If the inference environment does not support interactive discussions or if the partner model is not capable of providing meaningful feedback, the benefits of the SAIE framework may not be fully realized during inference.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Interactive training
  - Why needed here: The SAIE framework relies on interactive training to improve the learner model's reasoning and articulation skills through discussions with the partner model.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the SAIE framework's interactive training process, and how do they contribute to the learner model's development?
- Concept: Adversarial feedback
  - Why needed here: Adversarial feedback is a crucial component of the SAIE framework, as it challenges the learner model to refine its responses and develop more robust reasoning capabilities.
  - Quick check question: How does the SAIE framework use adversarial feedback to improve the learner model's performance, and what are the potential benefits of this approach?
- Concept: Multi-agent inference
  - Why needed here: The SAIE framework aims to improve LLM performance in multi-agent inference scenarios by enhancing the model's ability to engage in productive discussions with other models or humans.
  - Quick check question: How does the SAIE framework's training process prepare the learner model for effective participation in multi-agent inference scenarios, and what are the potential benefits of this approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Learner model -> Partner model -> Discussion phase (multiple rounds) -> Parameter updates
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize learner and partner models
  2. Warm-up phase: Fine-tune the learner model on a subset of the training data
  3. Discussion phase: Engage in multiple rounds of discussion between the learner and partner models
  4. Inference phase: Evaluate the learner model's performance in multi-agent inference scenarios
- Design tradeoffs:
  - The choice of partner model (e.g., GPT-3.5) can significantly impact the effectiveness of the SAIE framework, as the partner model's ability to provide meaningful feedback is crucial.
  - The number of discussion rounds and the balance between supportive and adversarial feedback can influence the learner model's development and performance.
  - The size and complexity of the learner model can affect its ability to incorporate feedback and refine its responses effectively.
- Failure signatures:
  - If the learner model fails to improve its performance despite the SAIE training process, it may indicate issues with the partner model's feedback or the learner model's ability to incorporate the feedback effectively.
  - If the learner model's performance degrades during the discussion phase, it may suggest that the adversarial feedback is too challenging or not well-calibrated to the learner model's current capabilities.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the learner model's performance on a simple reasoning task (e.g., GSM8K) with and without the SAIE training framework to assess the impact of the interactive training process.
  2. Compare the learner model's performance when trained with supportive feedback only versus a mix of supportive and adversarial feedback to determine the effectiveness of the adversarial component.
  3. Assess the learner model's ability to engage in multi-agent inference scenarios by evaluating its performance in collaborative discussions with other models or humans.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the SAIE framework perform across different LLM architectures and scales?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the current results are significant with certain LLMs and need further validation across a wider range of models varying in architecture and scale.
- Why unresolved: The study has not yet tested the SAIE framework on a diverse set of LLM architectures and scales, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various LLM architectures and scales, including smaller and larger models, to assess the adaptability and efficacy of the SAIE framework across different configurations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can bidirectional learning between the learner and partner models enhance the SAIE framework's performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests enhancing the training environment to enable mutual learning and adaptation between the learner and partner models as a promising future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current SAIE framework primarily focuses on the learner model adapting based on the partner model's feedback, without exploring the potential benefits of reciprocal learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a bidirectional learning approach where both the learner and partner models adapt and learn from each other, followed by empirical evaluation to measure any performance improvements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the SAIE framework's performance compare to other interactive training methods in terms of reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces SAIE as a novel interactive training approach and demonstrates its effectiveness, but does not directly compare it to other interactive methods.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on the SAIE framework's performance relative to standard fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, without benchmarking against other interactive training methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting comparative experiments between the SAIE framework and other interactive training methods, such as multi-agent debate or self-refine, to evaluate their relative effectiveness in enhancing reasoning capabilities.

## Limitations

- No statistical significance testing provided to validate performance improvements
- Critical implementation details (exact prompts, hyperparameters) not specified
- Claims about multi-agent inference performance not directly tested

## Confidence

- High confidence: The basic two-phase training structure (warm-up + discussion) is clearly specified and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The conceptual mechanism of adversarial feedback improving reasoning is sound, but empirical validation is limited
- Low confidence: Claims about SAIE's effectiveness in "multi-agent inference scenarios" are not directly tested - the paper only evaluates single-model performance on standard benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical validation**: Re-run experiments with multiple random seeds and report confidence intervals and p-values to determine if observed performance differences are statistically significant

2. **Ablation study**: Test SAIE variants with only supportive feedback, only adversarial feedback, and different numbers of discussion rounds to isolate which components drive performance improvements

3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate SAIE-trained models on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks not seen during training to assess whether improvements transfer beyond the specific benchmarks used in the paper
