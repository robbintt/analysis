# Understanding Real-World AI Planning Domains: A Conceptual Framework

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2307.04701
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04701
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Key outcome:** A conceptual framework to identify and categorize realistic aspects of real-world planning domains for AI planning systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in AI planning: the lack of systematic support for software and knowledge engineers to identify realistic domain characteristics when developing planning systems. Through top-down analysis of existing literature, the authors develop a multi-level hierarchical framework that categorizes planning aspects including objectives, tasks, quantities, determinism, agents, constraints, and qualities. Using sustainable buildings as a running example, the framework provides a common terminology and comprehensive overview that enables better characterization of planning problems and comparison of different AI planning systems. The work has significant potential to improve the design, development, and applicability of AI planning systems in real-world domains.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a top-down exploratory research approach, analyzing 20+ studies on AI planning, real-world domains, and planning system development. They conduct a comprehensive literature review to extract statements about realism in planning domains, focusing on characteristics that capture domain complexity and realistic aspects. The extracted aspects are then categorized based on relevance and refined into a hierarchical structure with main categories and subcategories. The sustainable buildings domain serves as a prominent application example to illustrate the framework's application throughout the paper.

## Key Results
- A multi-level hierarchical framework categorizing planning domain aspects (Objectives, Tasks, Quantities, Determinism, Agents, Constraints, Qualities)
- Clear definitions and examples for each category, providing a common terminology for engineers
- Demonstration of framework application using sustainable buildings domain
- Identification of how non-determinism sources and consequences guide tool selection and risk handling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Top-down hierarchical categorization of realistic planning aspects improves shared understanding among engineers
- **Mechanism:** The paper extracts and organizes 20+ studies into a structured hierarchy, giving each category a clear definition and example. This shared vocabulary reduces ambiguity when specifying domain requirements.
- **Core assumption:** Engineers across roles share enough domain familiarity to benefit from a common terminology
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] framework provides common terminology; [section 4] categorization of Tasks; [corpus] Weak: no explicit evidence of reduced miscommunication
- **Break condition:** If stakeholders have conflicting definitions or the domain has unique aspects not captured in the hierarchy

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Multi-level granularity in the framework enables progressive refinement from high-level goals to low-level constraints
- **Mechanism:** The framework distinguishes between soft/hard goals, qualitative/quantitative goals, and subgoals, allowing engineers to start with coarse requirements and drill down into actionable constraints
- **Core assumption:** Progressive refinement is a natural and efficient path from requirements gathering to domain model encoding
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] comprehensive overview exemplified using sustainable buildings; [section 4.1] classification of goals; [corpus] Weak: no validation of refinement path benefits
- **Break condition:** If domain complexity is too low to benefit from multiple levels, or if requirements are fixed early

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Explicit representation of non-determinism sources and consequences guides tool selection and risk handling
- **Mechanism:** The framework categorizes non-determinism into sources, randomness, and consequences, plus risk vs uncertainty. This helps engineers choose planners that support probabilistic or uncertain domains
- **Core assumption:** Identifying non-determinism characteristics early influences the suitability of planning algorithms and architectures
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.4] categorization of non-determinism; [abstract] impact on design and development; [corpus] Weak: no evidence of improved planner selection
- **Break condition:** If non-determinism is so minimal that classification overhead outweighs benefits, or if planners are chosen for other reasons

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** AI Planning Types and Assumptions
  - Why needed here: Understanding classical vs probabilistic vs HTN planning determines which aspects of the framework are relevant
  - Quick check question: Which planning type assumes deterministic, fully observable environments?

- **Concept:** Domain Knowledge Encoding (Objects, Actions, Tasks)
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on accurate representation of domain elements; poor encoding undermines all benefits
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a complex task from an action in HTN planning?

- **Concept:** Non-determinism vs Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The framework's determinism category is central; confusing the two can lead to incorrect risk handling
  - Quick check question: When is a domain said to have risk rather than uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Requirement Analyzer → Framework Categorizer → Domain Model Builder → Planner Selector → Execution Engine
- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify realistic aspects from stakeholder input
  2. Map aspects to framework categories
  3. Encode domain model respecting category constraints
  4. Select planner matching non-determinism/constraint profile
  5. Validate with sample problems
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Richer categorization increases upfront effort but improves long-term flexibility
  - Including uncertainty support increases planner complexity but better matches real domains
  - Abstract vs pure spatial representation affects reasoning power vs performance
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Missing category coverage → domain model gaps
  - Misclassified non-determinism → planner incompatibility
  - Over-specified constraints → unsolvable problems
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Encode a simple deterministic building lighting control domain using the framework; verify goal satisfaction
  2. Introduce a probabilistic weather effect on solar panel output; test planner selection
  3. Add complex task refinement (meeting room setup) and verify hierarchical planning works

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific metrics or evaluation criteria can be developed to quantitatively assess the realism of planning domains?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that they plan to synthesize metrics that can quantitatively evaluate the realism of planning domains
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper provides a comprehensive conceptual framework categorizing various aspects of planning domains, it does not yet offer concrete quantitative measures to assess the degree of realism
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and validation of a set of quantitative metrics that can measure each aspect of the framework, along with case studies demonstrating their application in real-world domains

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the proposed realistic-aspects framework be empirically validated in diverse real-world application domains beyond sustainable buildings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors mention in the conclusion that they plan to empirically verify and validate the conceptual framework on realistic application domains
- **Why unresolved:** The framework is currently illustrated using the sustainable buildings domain as a running example, but its applicability and effectiveness across other domains (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles) remain untested
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Case studies and experiments applying the framework to multiple diverse domains, comparing outcomes with existing approaches, and gathering feedback from domain experts

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the framework be extended to support the design of service-oriented AI planning systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors mention in the conclusion that they want to explore the framework's usability for the design of service-oriented AI planning systems
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper discusses how the framework can impact the design and development of AI planning systems, it does not provide specific guidance on how to leverage it for service-oriented architectures
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A methodology or toolset that demonstrates how to map the framework's aspects to service-oriented design patterns, along with examples of implemented service-oriented planning systems using the framework

## Limitations
- The framework lacks empirical validation in real-world planning system development, with no evidence that practitioners successfully use it to improve outcomes
- The literature review (20+ studies) may have selection bias, potentially missing important domain characteristics
- The sustainable buildings example represents only one application domain and may not generalize to others with different complexity profiles

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The hierarchical structure of the framework and the clarity of definitions for core categories (Objectives, Tasks, Quantities, Determinism, Agents, Constraints, Qualities)
- **Medium confidence:** The framework's utility in reducing miscommunication among engineers and improving planning system design
- **Low confidence:** Claims about the framework's impact on actual planning system development outcomes and its generalizability across diverse real-world domains

## Next Checks
1. **Stakeholder Validation:** Conduct interviews with knowledge engineers and software developers who have built real-world planning systems to assess whether the framework's categories align with their practical experiences and needs

2. **Cross-Domain Application:** Apply the framework to characterize planning aspects in two additional real-world domains (e.g., healthcare scheduling and autonomous vehicle routing) to test generalizability beyond sustainable buildings

3. **Development Impact Study:** Compare planning system development outcomes (time-to-deployment, model accuracy, stakeholder satisfaction) between teams using the framework versus those using ad-hoc approaches on identical planning problems
