# Can semi-supervised learning use all the data effectively? A lower bound perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.18557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18557
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proves that for 2-GMM models, no SSL algorithm can simultaneously improve upon minimax-optimal statistical error rates of both SL and UL algorithms, yet SSL can still empirically outperform both methods

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether semi-supervised learning (SSL) can simultaneously improve upon the minimax rates of both supervised learning (SL) and unsupervised learning (UL). Through tight lower bound analysis for 2-Gaussian mixture models (2-GMMs), the authors prove that SSL cannot achieve faster minimax rates than both SL and UL+ for these distributions. However, empirical results on real-world data demonstrate that SSL algorithms like SSL-W can still outperform both SL and UL+ methods. The key insight is that while proving performance gains for SSL algorithms is possible, it requires careful tracking of constants and understanding the compatibility between marginal and conditional distributions.

## Method Summary
The paper derives tight lower bounds for 2-GMMs that depend on labeled data size (nl), unlabeled data size (nu), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The theoretical analysis uses Fano's method and packing arguments to establish minimax rates for excess risk and estimation error. The empirical validation implements SSL algorithms including a weighted ensemble (SSL-W) of SL and UL+ estimators, as well as self-training, and compares them to pure SL and UL+ on both synthetic 2-GMM data and real-world datasets from OpenML and MNIST. The experiments systematically vary SNR and data ratios to identify regimes where SSL provides benefits.

## Key Results
- SSL algorithms cannot simultaneously improve minimax rates over both SL and UL+ for 2-GMM models
- SSL-W algorithm empirically outperforms both SL and UL+ in intermediate SNR regimes where neither pure method is optimal
- The compatibility between marginal and conditional distributions determines when SSL provides benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SSL algorithms cannot simultaneously improve minimax rates over both SL and UL+ for 2-GMM models.
- Mechanism: The tight lower bound derived for 2-GMMs depends explicitly on labeled data size (nl), unlabeled data size (nu), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The rate improvement of SSL over SL or UL+ vanishes in certain regimes, meaning SSL cannot beat both simultaneously.
- Core assumption: The 2-GMM family with isotropic spherical components and symmetric means around origin is representative of the fundamental tradeoff between SL and UL+.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "no SSL algorithm can improve upon the minimax-optimal statistical error rates of SL or UL algorithms for these distributions"
  - [section] "our results indicate that it is, in fact, not possible for SSL algorithms to simultaneously achieve faster minimax rates than both SL and UL+"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - most related papers focus on different SSL settings, not the specific 2-GMM regime tradeoff
- Break condition: If the data distribution deviates significantly from the 2-GMM assumption (e.g., non-spherical covariances, more than 2 components, or different SNR regimes), the mechanism may break.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SSL can still outperform both SL and UL+ empirically despite minimax rate limitations.
- Mechanism: The SSL Weighted (SSL-W) algorithm and self-training use both labeled and unlabeled data more effectively than UL+ or SL alone by learning the decision boundary jointly, not just assigning labels after unsupervised learning.
- Core assumption: Learning the decision boundary using both labeled and unlabeled data can yield constant-factor improvements over switching between pure SL and UL+ algorithms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show empirically on real-world data that SSL algorithms can still outperform UL and SL methods"
  - [section] "SSL-W achieves lower error than both SL and UL+ when varying the amount of information about Y|X captured in the labeled and the unlabeled data"
  - [corpus] Moderate corpus support - related works on SSL calibration and selection methods suggest empirical improvements are possible
- Break condition: If the unlabeled data provides little information about the conditional distribution (low SNR), or if labeled data is extremely abundant, the mechanism may not provide significant gains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The compatibility between marginal and conditional distributions determines when SSL helps.
- Mechanism: When the unlabeled data carries moderate information about the labeling (intermediate SNR regime), SSL algorithms can leverage this compatibility to outperform both SL and UL+.
- Core assumption: The SNR and the ratio of unlabeled to labeled data determine the regime where SSL is most beneficial, specifically in intermediate regimes where neither SL nor UL+ alone is optimal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "SSL is most likely to improve over both SL and UL+ in the intermediate regime, where the information captured in the unlabeled data about the labeling Y|X... is moderate"
  - [section] "SSL-W improves more over UL+ for small values of the SNRs, and it improves more over SL for large values of the SNR"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - most related papers do not focus on the intermediate SNR regime
- Break condition: If the data distribution has very high or very low compatibility (extreme SNR), SSL may not provide benefits over pure SL or UL+.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Minimax rates and lower bounds in statistical learning theory
  - Why needed here: The paper derives tight minimax lower bounds for SSL and compares them to SL and UL+ rates to show fundamental limitations
  - Quick check question: What does it mean when a learning algorithm achieves the minimax rate? (Answer: It achieves the best possible worst-case performance over a given function class)

- Concept: Gaussian mixture models and their properties
  - Why needed here: The analysis focuses on 2-GMM distributions with specific structure (isotropic, spherical, symmetric means)
  - Quick check question: In a 2-GMM with identity covariance and uniform mixing, what determines the Bayes error rate? (Answer: The distance between the two means, i.e., the SNR)

- Concept: KL divergence and information theory
  - Why needed here: The proof uses KL divergences between joint and marginal distributions to derive lower bounds via Fano's method
  - Quick check question: Why is KL divergence used in deriving minimax lower bounds? (Answer: It quantifies the distinguishability between distributions, which is key to information-theoretic lower bounds)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Theoretical analysis module -> Empirical validation module -> Switching algorithm module

- Critical path:
  1. Derive lower bounds for SSL excess risk and estimation error
  2. Prove matching upper bounds using switching algorithm
  3. Implement SSL-W and self-training algorithms
  4. Run experiments on synthetic 2-GMM data varying SNR and data ratios
  5. Validate findings on real-world datasets with varying compatibility

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tight theoretical analysis vs. practical algorithm design: The paper sacrifices some generality for tight bounds on a specific distribution family
  - Simplicity vs. performance: SSL-W is remarkably simple but effective; more complex SSL algorithms may not yield better theoretical guarantees
  - Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic data allows controlled variation of SNR, while real data validates practical relevance

- Failure signatures:
  - Theoretical bounds not matching empirical results: Indicates the 2-GMM assumption may not capture all relevant aspects
  - SSL-W not improving over SL/UL+ in intermediate regimes: Suggests the compatibility measure may not capture the true benefit of SSL
  - Self-training failing where SSL-W succeeds: Indicates the pseudolabeling approach may be less robust to certain data characteristics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary SNR in synthetic 2-GMM data with fixed nl=20, nu=2000 to observe SSL-W performance relative to SL and UL+
  2. Fix SNR=0.5 and vary nu/nl ratio in synthetic data to test regime-specific improvements
  3. Apply SSL-W to real-world tabular and image datasets with varying compatibility scores to validate intermediate regime benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can SSL algorithms simultaneously improve upon the minimax rates of both SL and UL for distributions beyond 2-GMMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "it is important to explore in future work, whether there are distributions, also beyond linear models, for which SSL can provably improve upon SL also in small nu regime."
- Why unresolved: The paper only proves tight lower bounds for 2-GMM distributions and does not extend the analysis to other distribution families or non-linear models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proving tight lower bounds for SSL minimax rates for other distribution families beyond 2-GMMs, such as mixtures of more than 2 Gaussians or non-Gaussian distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal weighting scheme for the SSL-W algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "It remains an exciting direction for future work to provide a tight analysis of self-training that can indicate when it outperforms both SL and UL+ simultaneously."
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a simple weighted combination of SL and UL+ estimators with a hyperparameter t chosen using a validation set, but does not provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal weighting scheme.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis that derives the optimal weighting scheme for the SSL-W algorithm, potentially involving the relative information captured by labeled and unlabeled data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the logarithmic factors in the SSL minimax rate lower bounds be removed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "We conjecture that the logarithmic factors are an artifact of the analysis and can be removed."
- Why unresolved: The lower bounds for excess risk in Theorem 1 are stated to be tight only up to logarithmic factors, and the authors do not provide a proof that these factors can indeed be removed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A refined analysis that removes the logarithmic factors from the lower bounds, potentially involving a different proof technique or a more careful application of Fano's method.

## Limitations

- Theoretical analysis is limited to 2-GMMs with specific structure (isotropic, spherical, symmetric means)
- Results may not generalize to non-spherical covariances, multi-component mixtures, or non-linear models
- Empirical validation relies on synthetic data generation and a limited set of real-world datasets

## Confidence

- Theoretical lower bounds for 2-GMMs: High
- Empirical superiority of SSL-W in intermediate SNR regimes: Medium
- Generalizability of results to broader SSL settings: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test SSL-W and self-training on non-spherical GMMs and multi-component mixtures to verify mechanism robustness beyond the theoretical assumptions.

2. Implement and evaluate SSL algorithms on text classification tasks where compatibility between marginal and conditional distributions may differ significantly from image and tabular data.

3. Conduct ablation studies varying the labeled-to-unlabeled ratio systematically across different SNR regimes to quantify the exact conditions under which SSL provides benefits over pure SL or UL+.
