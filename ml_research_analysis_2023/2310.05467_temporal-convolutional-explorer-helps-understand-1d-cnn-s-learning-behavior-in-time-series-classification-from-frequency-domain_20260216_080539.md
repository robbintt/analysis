# Temporal Convolutional Explorer Helps Understand 1D-CNN's Learning Behavior in Time Series Classification from Frequency Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05467
- Reference count: 40
- This paper investigates accuracy degradation in deep 1D-CNNs for time series classification and proposes a regulatory framework to address it.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the accuracy degradation problem observed in deep 1D-CNNs for time series classification tasks. The authors introduce a Temporal Convolutional Explorer (TCE) mechanism that analyzes learning behavior from a frequency domain perspective, revealing that deeper networks tend to shift focus away from low-frequency components toward high-frequency components. Based on this insight, they develop a regulatory framework that selectively bypasses "disturbing convolutions" to rectify this suboptimal learning behavior, achieving improved performance with reduced computational overhead.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main components: First, the Temporal Convolutional Explorer transforms feature maps to the frequency domain using FFT to calculate focus scales and frequency centroids. Second, disturbing convolutions are identified based on negative focus scale changes. Third, a regulatory framework implements a gating mechanism to bypass these disturbing convolutions after an initial training period (α=100 epochs). The approach is evaluated on 128 univariate TSC datasets (UCR archive), 31 multivariate TSC datasets (UEA archive plus HAR dataset from UCI), using backbone architectures including FCN, ResNet, and InceptionTime.

## Key Results
- TCE effectively identifies frequency components emphasized or overlooked by deeper convolutional layers
- The regulatory framework enables state-of-the-art 1D-CNNs to achieve improved accuracy with less memory and computational overhead
- Existing 1D-CNNs equipped with the regulatory framework show better average ranks across accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deeper 1D-CNNs shift focus from low-frequency components to high-frequency components, leading to accuracy degradation.
- Mechanism: As depth increases, convolutional layers progressively activate high-frequency energy, as measured by elevated frequency centroids in feature maps. This shift causes the network to lose its ability to leverage generalizable low-frequency information.
- Core assumption: Low-frequency components carry more generalizable information for time series classification than high-frequency components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our TCE analysis highlights that deeper 1D-CNNs tend to distract the focus from the low-frequency components leading to the accuracy degradation phenomenon"
  - [section 6.4] "the deeper layers exhibit significantly elevated frequency centroids, indicating a more pronounced activation of high-frequency energy"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific frequency-shift mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disturbing convolutions with negative focus scale changes (𝑀𝑙 < 0) are responsible for the loss of low-frequency focus.
- Mechanism: Convolutional layers that reduce the focus scale cause the network to narrow its frequency response range, preventing full exploitation of generalizable low-frequency features.
- Core assumption: The focus scale metric accurately captures the diversity of frequency patterns captured by each convolutional layer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the disturbing convolution is the driving factor" for accuracy degradation
  - [section 6.5] "the accuracy of every network after skipping the blue convolutional block with focus scale reduction consistently surpasses that of bypassing other blocks"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found supporting the specific concept of "disturbing convolution"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The regulatory framework improves performance by selectively bypassing disturbing convolutions identified through TCE analysis.
- Mechanism: By implementing a gating mechanism that skips specified disturbing convolutions, the network can maintain its learning ability for low frequencies while reducing computational overhead.
- Core assumption: Skipping identified disturbing convolutions does not disrupt the overall network architecture or learning process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our regulatory framework enables state-of-the-art 1D-CNNs to get improved performances with less consumption of memory and computational overhead"
  - [section 6.6] "existing 1D-CNNs equipped with our regulatory framework exhibit better average ranks across all indicators (i.e. Accuracy, Params, and FLOPs)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found supporting this specific regulatory framework approach

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Frequency domain analysis using FFT
  - Why needed here: Understanding how 1D-CNNs process time series data requires analyzing frequency components rather than just temporal features
  - Quick check question: What transformation is used to convert time series data from the time domain to the frequency domain?

- Concept: Convolutional neural network depth and feature extraction
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates how deeper networks behave differently from shallower ones in processing time series data
  - Quick check question: How does increasing network depth typically affect feature extraction in standard CNNs?

- Concept: Focus scale and frequency centroid metrics
  - Why needed here: These metrics quantify how convolutional layers capture different frequency ranges and where their focus lies
  - Quick check question: What does a higher frequency centroid indicate about a convolutional layer's focus?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: FFT transformation → FE feature maps → focus scale calculation → frequency centroid analysis → regulatory framework (gating mechanism → selective bypassing of disturbing convolutions)
- Critical path: 1) Transform feature maps to frequency domain 2) Calculate focus scales 3) Identify disturbing convolutions 4) Apply gating mechanism 5) Evaluate performance improvement
- Design tradeoffs: Skipping convolutions reduces computational overhead but may lose some feature extraction capability; early implementation (α = 100) balances training time with performance gains
- Failure signatures: Accuracy degradation in deeper networks, focus scale reduction in specific layers, elevated frequency centroids in deeper layers
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare training/test loss curves of deeper vs shallower ResNet to rule out overfitting
  2. Analyze focus scale changes across convolutional layers to identify disturbing convolutions
  3. Apply regulatory framework and measure accuracy improvement with reduced parameters and FLOPs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different types of frequency components (e.g., periodic vs. non-periodic) affect the accuracy degradation in deep 1D-CNNs for time series classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the impact of low-frequency components (LFCs) and high-frequency components (HFCs) on accuracy degradation but does not distinguish between periodic and non-periodic frequency components.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different types of frequency components affect accuracy degradation in deep 1D-CNNs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of deep 1D-CNNs on time series datasets with varying types of frequency components, including periodic and non-periodic components.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the regulatory framework be applied to other types of deep neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), for time series classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the verification of TCE's insights in alternative network structures (e.g., Graph Neural Networks) is still ongoing.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results on the application of the regulatory framework to other types of deep neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the regulatory framework when applied to RNNs, GNNs, and other types of deep neural networks for time series classification tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the regulatory framework perform on time series datasets with varying lengths and sampling frequencies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not discuss the performance of the regulatory framework on time series datasets with varying lengths and sampling frequencies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results on the performance of the regulatory framework across time series datasets with different characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the regulatory framework on time series datasets with varying lengths and sampling frequencies.

## Limitations

- The claim that deeper 1D-CNNs systematically shift focus from low to high frequencies lacks direct corpus support
- The concept of "disturbing convolutions" appears novel with no existing literature validation
- The regulatory framework's generalizability beyond tested architectures remains uncertain

## Confidence

- High confidence in the methodology for frequency domain analysis using FFT and focus scale metrics
- Medium confidence in the empirical findings showing accuracy degradation in deeper networks
- Low confidence in the causal mechanism linking frequency shift to accuracy degradation without more theoretical grounding

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing accuracy when skipping different types of convolutional layers (not just those with negative focus scale) to verify the specific claim about disturbing convolutions
2. Test the TCE analysis on non-time-series CNNs (e.g., image classification) to determine if frequency shift is unique to time series or a general deep network phenomenon
3. Implement theoretical analysis of gradient flow when bypassing convolutions to verify that the regulatory framework doesn't introduce optimization pathologies
