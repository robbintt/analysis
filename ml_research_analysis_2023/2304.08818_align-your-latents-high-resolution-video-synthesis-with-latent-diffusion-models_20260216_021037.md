# Align your Latents: High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.08818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08818
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves state-of-the-art 389 FVD on real driving videos (512 × 1024)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to extend latent diffusion models (LDMs) to high-resolution video generation by fine-tuning temporal layers that align frames while keeping spatial layers fixed. The approach enables synthesis of long, high-resolution driving scene videos and expressive text-to-video generation with resolutions up to 1280 × 2048. By inserting temporal neural network layers between spatial layers, the method learns to align frames across time without retraining the entire spatial model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both real driving videos and UCF-101 text-to-video benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The method converts a pre-trained image LDM into a video generator by introducing a temporal dimension to the latent space and fine-tuning on encoded image sequences. Spatial layers process frames independently while temporal layers align them across time. The approach leverages compressed latent space for computational efficiency and can be extended to video super-resolution by temporally aligning diffusion model upsamplers. The architecture supports personalized text-to-video generation by transferring temporal layers to DreamBooth fine-tuned LDMs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 389 FVD on real driving videos (512 × 1024), state-of-the-art performance
- Outperforms baselines on UCF-101 text-to-video benchmarks with 33.45 IS
- Demonstrates personalized text-to-video generation via DreamBooth transfer
- Enables high-resolution synthesis up to 1280 × 2048

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal alignment layers enable a pre-trained image LDM to generate temporally coherent video sequences without retraining the entire spatial model.
- Mechanism: The method inserts temporal neural network layers between spatial layers, where spatial layers process frames independently in batch dimension and temporal layers process entire video sequences with a new temporal dimension. These temporal layers learn to align frames while keeping spatial layers fixed.
- Core assumption: Spatial layers already capture high-quality image generation and temporal layers can learn alignment patterns without degrading spatial quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we turn the image generator into a video generator by introducing a temporal dimension to the latent space diffusion model and fine-tuning on encoded image sequences"
  - [section 3.1] "the spatial layers interpret the video as a batch of independent images... while the temporal layers li_φ(z′, c) process entire videos in a new temporal dimension t"
  - [corpus] Weak correlation (FMR 0.599) with Fuse Your Latents, suggesting related but distinct approach
- Break condition: If temporal alignment requires too many parameters or training data, the spatial layers may need fine-tuning, defeating the efficiency purpose.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Latent diffusion models enable computationally efficient high-resolution video synthesis by operating in compressed latent space rather than pixel space.
- Mechanism: An autoencoder compresses video frames into lower-dimensional latent representations, a diffusion model generates these latents, and a decoder reconstructs high-resolution frames. This avoids the computational burden of pixel-space diffusion.
- Core assumption: The autoencoder can maintain high reconstruction fidelity while providing sufficient compression for efficient diffusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) enable high-quality image synthesis while avoiding excessive compute demands by training a diffusion model in a compressed lower-dimensional latent space"
  - [section 3.4] "Our Video LDM leverages a computationally efficient, compressed latent space to perform all video modeling"
  - [corpus] Moderate correlation (FMR 0.518) with LVTINO suggests relevance to video restoration applications
- Break condition: If compression introduces artifacts that diffusion cannot adequately denoise, or if latent space dimensionality is too low for video complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal fine-tuning of super-resolution diffusion models preserves temporal consistency while enabling high-resolution output.
- Mechanism: The method applies the same temporal layer insertion strategy to super-resolution diffusion models, allowing them to operate on low-resolution video frames while maintaining temporal coherence through learned alignment.
- Core assumption: Local super-resolution operations can be temporally aligned without requiring long-term temporal modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Similarly, we temporally align diffusion model upsamplers, turning them into temporally consistent video super resolution models"
  - [section 3.4] "we also temporally align pixel-space and latent DM upsamplers... turning them into temporally consistent video super resolution models"
  - [corpus] Weak correlation (FMR 0.586) with VISION-XL suggests related but distinct approach to video restoration
- Break condition: If temporal alignment layers cannot learn sufficient motion patterns from patch-wise training, or if super-resolution introduces temporal inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching
  - Why needed here: The entire video generation pipeline builds on diffusion models trained with denoising score matching objective
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the denoising score matching objective and the diffusion process in latent space?

- Concept: Latent space representation and autoencoders
  - Why needed here: The efficiency gains come from compressing video frames into latent space using an autoencoder
  - Quick check question: How does the autoencoder's reconstruction quality affect the diffusion model's ability to generate realistic video?

- Concept: Temporal modeling in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Temporal alignment requires understanding how to process sequences across time dimensions
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using 3D convolutions versus temporal attention for video alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input frames -> Encoder -> Spatial layers (fixed) -> Temporal layers (trained) -> Diffusion model -> Decoder -> Output frames
- Critical path: Encode video → Apply spatial layers → Apply temporal layers → Generate latents via diffusion → Decode to frames
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed spatial layers vs. fine-tuning both spatial and temporal (efficiency vs. performance)
  - 3D convolutions vs. temporal attention for alignment (parameter efficiency vs. modeling capacity)
  - Patch-wise upsampling vs. full-frame processing (efficiency vs. quality)
- Failure signatures:
  - Temporal flickering: Temporal alignment layers not learning sufficient motion patterns
  - Low quality: Compression too aggressive or diffusion not converging
  - Memory issues: Batch size too large or resolution too high for available GPU memory
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate short videos with temporal layers disabled (αi_φ=1) to verify baseline image quality
  2. Train temporal layers on simple synthetic video data to verify alignment capability
  3. Apply trained temporal layers to different pre-trained image LDMs to test generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the temporal alignment of diffusion model upsamplers impact the overall computational efficiency and memory requirements of the Video LDM pipeline?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the video upsampler only needs to operate locally, keeping training and computational requirements low.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific details on the computational efficiency and memory usage of the video upsampler compared to other approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the computational cost and memory requirements of the video upsampler, including comparisons to other video upsampling methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well do the temporal layers trained on one Image LDM backbone transfer to other model checkpoints, and what factors influence this transferability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that the temporal layers trained on the Stable Diffusion image LDM backbone can be transferred to a DreamBooth-fine-tuned version of the same model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the generalizability of the temporal layers to different image LDM backbones or investigate the factors that affect their transferability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the transferability of temporal layers to various image LDM backbones and analyzing the factors that influence their performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the current Video LDM approach in terms of generating very long videos, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the approach reaches its limits when it comes to synthesizing very long videos and introduces prediction models for long-term generation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the current approach for generating very long videos or discuss potential solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study of the limitations of the current Video LDM approach for generating very long videos, including an exploration of potential solutions such as improved prediction models or alternative architectures.

## Limitations
- Temporal alignment layers alone may have limited capacity compared to full fine-tuning, as shown by ablation study results
- Generalizability of temporal layers to different image LDM backbones is not well-established
- Current approach has limitations for generating very long videos, requiring additional prediction models

## Confidence
- Medium confidence for the core claim that temporal alignment layers alone can achieve state-of-the-art video synthesis
- Low confidence for the generalizability claim that temporal layers trained on one domain can be successfully transferred to personalized generation via DreamBooth
- High confidence for the computational efficiency claim, as the method demonstrably reduces training requirements

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain transfer validation: Train temporal layers on driving scene data, then apply them to text-to-video generation on different datasets (e.g., WebVid-10M) to verify the claimed domain transferability.

2. Temporal consistency analysis: Conduct frame-by-frame temporal consistency metrics beyond FVD, such as measuring optical flow consistency or temporal smoothness scores, to quantify the flickering artifacts mentioned in failure modes.

3. Ablation of temporal layer architecture: Systematically compare different temporal alignment approaches (3D convolutions vs. temporal attention vs. transformer blocks) while controlling for parameter count to identify the most effective architecture for temporal coherence.
