# BESTMVQA: A Benchmark Evaluation System for Medical Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.07867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07867
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Presents a benchmark evaluation system for Med-VQA that addresses data insufficiency and reproducibility issues through automated dataset generation and model library implementation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BESTMVQA, a comprehensive benchmark evaluation system designed to address critical challenges in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). The system tackles two primary obstacles: data insufficiency and lack of reproducible evaluation. By providing automated tools for dataset generation from clinical data and a model library containing state-of-the-art approaches, BESTMVQA enables researchers to conduct systematic evaluations across multiple Med-VQA benchmarks. Empirical studies on five datasets demonstrate the system's effectiveness in revealing the strengths and weaknesses of different models, with pre-trained approaches like PTUnifier and METER showing superior performance.

## Method Summary
The BESTMVQA system consists of two core components: a data generation tool and a model library. The data generation tool processes self-collected clinical data by extracting medical images and relevant texts, discovering medical concepts through annotation, and using a pre-trained language model to generate high-quality QA pairs. The model library implements 10 state-of-the-art Med-VQA approaches including joint embedding, attention-based, encoder-decoder, and LLM-based models. The system automatically trains and evaluates selected models on benchmark datasets, presenting comprehensive performance reports. Models are trained using AdamW optimizer with preheating steps on dual NVIDIA RTX V100 GPUs, with standard data splits of 70% train, 15% validation, and 15% test.

## Key Results
- Pre-trained models (PTUnifier and METER) generally outperform other models on Med-VQA tasks
- Generative models like MiniGPT-4 perform worse than discriminative models
- The system effectively reveals model applicability across different question types and datasets
- Comprehensive evaluation framework enables systematic comparison of SOTA approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The data generation tool overcomes the data insufficiency problem by automatically constructing new datasets from unstructured clinical data.
- Mechanism: Users upload self-collected clinical data, which is then processed to extract medical images and relevant texts. Medical concepts are discovered and annotated, and a pre-trained language model generates high-quality QA pairs from the medical images, concepts, and diagnosis texts.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained language model can effectively generate medically relevant and accurate QA pairs from the processed clinical data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our system provides a useful tool for users to automatically build Med-VQA datasets, which helps overcoming the data insufficient problem."
  - [section]: "Users first upload self-collected clinical data. Then, medical images and relevant texts are extracted for medical concept discovery... medical images, medical concepts and diagnosis texts are fed into a pre-trained language model for generating high-quality QA pairs."
- Break condition: If the pre-trained language model cannot generate accurate or relevant QA pairs from the clinical data, or if the medical concept discovery and annotation process is flawed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model library and automatic evaluation system address the reproducibility problem by providing a unified experimental setup for evaluating SOTA models.
- Mechanism: A wide spectrum of SOTA models for Med-VQA are implemented in a model library. Users can select a benchmark dataset and any number of models from the library. The system automatically trains and evaluates the selected models, presenting a comprehensive report to the user.
- Core assumption: The implemented models are accurate representations of the SOTA models and the evaluation metrics are appropriate for comparing their performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Users also can conveniently select a wide spectrum of SOTA models from our model library to perform a comprehensive empirical study... our system automatically trains and evaluates the selected models over a benchmark dataset, and reports the comprehensive results for users."
  - [section]: "Our system provides a model library, to avoid duplication of efforts on implementing SOTAs for experimental evaluation. A wide spectrum of SOTAs have been implemented... our system automatically performs extensive experiments to evaluate SOTAs over the benchmark dataset, and presents the final report to the user."
- Break condition: If the implemented models are not accurate representations of the SOTA models, or if the evaluation metrics are not appropriate for comparing their performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system's design allows for comprehensive study of SOTA models and their applicability to Med-VQA, aiding in the development of new techniques and medical practice.
- Mechanism: By providing a unified evaluation system and a wide range of benchmark datasets and SOTA models, the system allows users to systematically compare the performance of different models across various datasets and question types. This enables the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their suitability for different medical scenarios.
- Core assumption: The benchmark datasets are representative of real-world medical scenarios and the question types cover a wide range of medical knowledge and reasoning skills.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "With our system, researchers can comprehensively study SOTA models and their applicability in Med-VQA... Users can also download the experimental reports and the source codes for further practice."
  - [section]: "Based our library, users can conveniently select a benchmark dataset and any number of SOTAs from our model library. Then, our system automatically performs extensive experiments to evaluate SOTAs over the benchmark dataset, and presents the final report to the user."
- Break condition: If the benchmark datasets are not representative of real-world medical scenarios or the question types do not cover a wide range of medical knowledge and reasoning skills.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clinical data upload -> Data preparation -> Model selection -> Automatic training and evaluation -> Comprehensive reporting
- Critical path: Upload clinical data → Data preparation → Model selection → Automatic training and evaluation → Comprehensive reporting
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a pre-trained language model for data generation vs. manual annotation: Tradeoff between scalability and quality control
  - Implementing a wide range of SOTA models vs. focusing on a few key models: Tradeoff between comprehensiveness and depth of analysis
  - Providing automatic evaluation vs. allowing custom evaluation: Tradeoff between convenience and flexibility
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor data quality: Inaccurate or irrelevant QA pairs generated from clinical data
  - Model implementation errors: Incorrect implementation of SOTA models leading to unreliable results
  - Evaluation issues: Inappropriate evaluation metrics or flawed experimental setup leading to misleading conclusions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the data generation tool: Upload a small, well-defined clinical dataset and manually inspect the generated QA pairs for quality and relevance
  2. Test a single SOTA model: Select a simple, well-understood model from the library and run it on a benchmark dataset to verify its implementation and performance
  3. Perform a basic comparative analysis: Select two or three models from the library and compare their performance on a single benchmark dataset to identify potential issues or inconsistencies
