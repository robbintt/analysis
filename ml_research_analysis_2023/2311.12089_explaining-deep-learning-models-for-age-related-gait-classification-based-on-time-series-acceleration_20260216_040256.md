# Explaining Deep Learning Models for Age-related Gait Classification based on time series acceleration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12089
- Authors:
- Reference count: 0
- CNN model achieved 81.4% accuracy and AUC of 0.89

## Executive Summary
This study applies deep learning and explainable AI to classify age-related gait patterns using accelerometer data. Convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units were trained on 1-stride and 8-stride acceleration data to differentiate between adults and older adults. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 81.4% and AUC of 0.89, while the GRU model achieved 84.5% accuracy and AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that vertical and anteroposterior acceleration data around heel contact were most influential in classification, with GRU also capturing stride-to-stride relationships.

## Method Summary
The study collected accelerometer data from 244 subjects (129 adults, 115 older adults) during 3-minute walking tasks. Data was filtered with a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter (10Hz cutoff), normalized, segmented into strides, and interpolated to 128 samples per stride. Two deep learning models were trained: a CNN using single-stride data and a GRU using 8-stride sequences. Bayesian optimization was used for hyperparameter tuning, and SHAP values were computed for model interpretability.

## Key Results
- CNN model achieved 81.4% accuracy and AUC of 0.89 on age classification
- GRU model achieved 84.5% accuracy and AUC of 0.94, outperforming CNN
- SHAP analysis showed vertical and anteroposterior acceleration data around heel contact were most critical for classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GRU model's higher performance stems from its ability to capture temporal dependencies between strides, enabling better differentiation of age-related gait patterns.
- Mechanism: GRU layers learn long-term dependencies in the 8-stride input sequences, allowing the model to recognize patterns that evolve over multiple gait cycles rather than treating each stride independently.
- Core assumption: Stride-to-stride relationships contain discriminative information about age-related changes in gait stability and control.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally"
  - [section] "GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct mention of GRU stride relationships in neighboring papers
- Break Condition: If stride-to-stride variations are primarily noise rather than signal, or if the temporal window is too short to capture meaningful dependencies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CNN model achieves good performance by extracting spatial-temporal features from single-stride data, focusing on gait events around heel contact.
- Mechanism: 1D convolutional filters detect local patterns in acceleration data, particularly around heel contact events, which are critical gait landmarks where age-related differences in deceleration/acceleration patterns are most pronounced.
- Core assumption: Heel contact events contain sufficient discriminative information to separate adults from older adults.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "data around heel contact emerged as most critical"
  - [section] "CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence; PHAR method mentioned in corpus also focuses on post-hoc attributions for time series
- Break Condition: If the gait cycle normalization removes critical temporal information, or if heel contact is not the most discriminative gait event.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Both models rely primarily on vertical and anteroposterior acceleration data rather than mediolateral data because the walking task lacked balance perturbations.
- Mechanism: The controlled walking environment (straight hallway, comfortable speed) did not challenge balance control sufficiently for ML-direction data to contain discriminative age-related patterns.
- Core assumption: Balance control differences between adults and older adults manifest primarily during challenging walking conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions"
  - [section] "the limited contribution of ML direction data to the classification process could be attributed to the simplicity of the task"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus papers discuss balance perturbations in gait analysis
- Break Condition: If the ML direction data actually contains age-related information that the models failed to capture due to architecture limitations.

## Foundational Learning

- SHAP values and interpretability
  - Why needed here: The study explicitly addresses the "black-box" nature of deep learning models and uses SHAP to make model decisions interpretable for clinical applications
  - Quick check question: How do SHAP values ensure fairness and legal compliance in automated decision-making?

- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) architecture
  - Why needed here: GRU is specifically chosen for its ability to learn long-term dependent features across multiple gait cycles
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between GRU and LSTM in terms of gating mechanisms?

- Convolutional Neural Networks for time series
  - Why needed here: CNN is employed for its capacity to extract local spatial-temporal features from single stride data
  - Quick check question: How do 1D convolutional filters differ from 2D filters in processing time series data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: Butterworth filter → normalization → stride detection → interpolation to 128 samples
  - CNN model: 3×Conv1D → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout → Dense → Softmax
  - GRU model: 3×GRU → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout → Dense → Softmax
  - SHAP explanation: Post-hoc attribution generation using coalitional game theory

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing (filtering and normalization)
  2. Stride segmentation and interpolation
  3. Model training with Bayesian optimization
  4. SHAP value computation and visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single stride vs. multiple strides: CNN uses 1 stride (simpler, faster) while GRU uses 8 strides (more context, better performance)
  - Model complexity: GRU has more parameters but achieves better AUC; CNN is simpler but still effective
  - Computational cost: SHAP explanations are computationally expensive but necessary for clinical interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but low validation accuracy
  - Data leakage: Similar subjects appearing in both training and testing sets
  - SHAP instability: Similar input samples producing widely different explanations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline CNN with 1-stride input to establish minimum performance threshold
  2. GRU with 4-stride input to test if fewer strides still capture temporal dependencies
  3. Shuffle input axes to verify models are learning meaningful patterns rather than exploiting data artifacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific kinematic and kinetic factors contribute to the distinct acceleration and deceleration patterns observed between adults and older adults during walking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that aging is associated with changes in kinematic and kinetic factors such as reduced knee extension angle, reduced knee moment, and decreased hip extension, but the study lacks data to examine their specific contributions to acceleration and deceleration patterns.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses accelerometer data which is insufficient to directly measure joint angles and moments, requiring further biomechanical analysis with more sophisticated equipment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct measurements of joint angles, moments, and powers using motion capture systems combined with force plates during walking tasks with both adults and older adults.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the use of different accelerometer brands with varying dynamic ranges and accuracy affect the interpretability and performance of deep learning models in gait classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study acknowledges using three different types of accelerometers and mentions that signal amplitude standardization was used to minimize potential biases, but standardization may remove valuable information.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different sensor specifications might influence the model's learning and interpretation of gait patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis using data from multiple accelerometer brands on the same subjects, examining differences in model performance and SHAP explanations across sensor types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do more challenging real-life walking conditions (e.g., uneven terrain, dual-tasking) influence the contribution of mediolateral acceleration data to age-related gait classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that the simple walking task in a clean hallway may not effectively capture balance-related postural control information, which could explain why ML-direction data played a less significant role than AP and V direction data.
- Why unresolved: The study only examined gait classification under controlled, simple walking conditions without perturbations or complex environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting the same classification analysis using data from walking tasks that include challenging conditions such as uneven terrain, cognitive dual-tasks, or environmental obstacles.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to populations beyond Taiwanese adults and older adults
- Simple walking task may not capture all age-related gait differences, particularly in balance control
- Small sample size (244 subjects) may limit model robustness and generalizability

## Confidence
- High: Model performance metrics (accuracy, AUC, precision, recall) are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium: Interpretability findings are supported by SHAP analysis but may not fully explain model decision-making
- Medium: Generalization claims are reasonable but require validation on diverse populations and walking conditions

## Next Checks
1. Cross-population validation: Test models on gait data from different age groups, cultures, and walking environments to assess generalization
2. Ablation study: Systematically remove or permute features (vertical, AP, ML directions) to quantify each component's contribution to classification
3. Real-time deployment: Evaluate model performance in continuous monitoring scenarios to assess practical utility beyond laboratory conditions
