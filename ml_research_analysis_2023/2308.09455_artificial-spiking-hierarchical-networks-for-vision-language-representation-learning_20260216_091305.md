# Artificial-Spiking Hierarchical Networks for Vision-Language Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.09455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09455
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ASH-Nets achieves competitive results on vision-language tasks by combining ANNs and SNNs for visual feature encoding

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Artificial-Spiking Hierarchical Networks (ASH-Nets) for vision-language representation learning by combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The model uses an ANN-based visual concrete encoder and an SNN-based semantic abstract encoder to leverage the complementary advantages of continuous and discrete latent variables. A contrastive learning method optimizes inputs of similar samples for improved computational efficiency, while a Spiking to Text Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) pre-training method enhances abstract semantic encoding. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance across multiple downstream vision-language tasks.

## Method Summary
ASH-Nets employs a hybrid architecture with ResNet-152 backbone, combining CNN-based visual concrete encoding with SNN-based semantic abstract encoding using LIF neurons with surrogate gradients. The model uses tdBN normalization and a summary ratio (SR) mechanism to redistribute abstract semantic information. Pre-training involves five tasks: ITM, MLM, MVM, ITC (contrastive learning for similar sample optimization), and STUA (text-guided abstract semantic alignment). Training uses 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with batch size 16 for 40 epochs on VG and MSCOCO datasets.

## Key Results
- ASH-Nets achieves competitive performance on VQA, image-text retrieval, NLVR, and visual entailment tasks
- The hybrid ANN-SNN architecture shows advantages over pure ANN approaches in certain benchmarks
- STUA pre-training method contributes to improved abstract semantic encoding capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ASH-Nets leverages the complementary advantages of ANNs and SNNs to enrich visual semantic representations and improve computational efficiency. The model uses an ANN-based visual concrete encoder to process continuous latent variables and an SNN-based semantic abstract encoder to handle discrete latent variables. This hybrid structure allows for flexible and efficient encoding of visual semantics, with SNNs offering sparse, event-driven processing that reduces computational overhead compared to ANNs alone.

### Mechanism 2
ASH-Nets uses a contrastive learning method to optimize the inputs of similar samples, improving computational efficiency and robustness. By reorganizing input images with similar semantics, ASH-Nets can avoid the membrane potential reset caused by a single input sample. This improves learning efficiency and robustness by focusing on hard samples generated from similar sample recombination, which helps speed up model convergence and improve accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
ASH-Nets proposes a Spiking to Text Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) pre-training method to enhance the encoding ability of abstract semantics. STUA uses text features to align multi-modal semantic labels for pre-training tasks. It projects SNN-generated visual features into text embeddings, encouraging the model to improve its learning ability of abstract semantics from text information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning**
  - Why needed here: To optimize the inputs of similar samples and improve the computational efficiency and robustness of the model by focusing on hard samples generated from similar sample recombination
  - Quick check question: How does the contrastive learning method in ASH-Nets differ from traditional contrastive learning approaches in vision-language models?

- **Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
  - Why needed here: To leverage the spatio-temporal properties of SNNs for modeling the common semantics of similar images and the abstract semantics of individual images, leading to improved visual representation learning
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of using SNNs over ANNs for visual semantic encoding in the context of ASH-Nets?

- **Concept: Multi-modal Alignment**
  - Why needed here: To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language modalities by aligning the visual and textual representations learned by the ANN and SNN encoders
  - Quick check question: How does the Spiking to Text Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) method in ASH-Nets contribute to the overall multi-modal alignment of the model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input images and text -> ANN-based visual concrete encoder -> SNN-based semantic abstract encoder -> Summary Ratio (SR) -> Multi-layer Transformer -> Modality fusion and VL feature learning

- **Critical path**: 1. Pre-process input images using ITC to find similar samples 2. Encode visual features using ANN-based visual concrete encoder and SNN-based semantic abstract encoder 3. Redistribute abstract semantic information using Summary Ratio (SR) 4. Fuse visual and textual features using multi-layer transformer 5. Pre-train the model using ITM, MLM, MVM, ITC, and STUA tasks

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using SNNs for semantic abstract encoding vs. using ANNs for both visual and semantic encoding; choosing the optimal number of similar samples for contrastive learning vs. computational efficiency; balancing the trade-off between model complexity and performance in terms of parameter count and training time

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on downstream tasks, indicating ineffective visual semantic encoding or multi-modal alignment; high computational cost or memory usage, suggesting inefficient use of SNNs or large model size; overfitting or underfitting during pre-training, indicating suboptimal hyperparameters or insufficient data

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare the performance of ASH-Nets with and without the SNN-based semantic abstract encoder on a small downstream task to validate the effectiveness of the hybrid ANN-SNN structure 2. Evaluate the impact of varying the number of similar samples used for contrastive learning on the model's performance and computational efficiency 3. Assess the contribution of the Spiking to Text Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) method to the overall multi-modal alignment by comparing the model's performance with and without STUA on a text-based downstream task

## Limitations

- Computational complexity of SNN components may limit scalability to larger datasets or real-time applications
- Reliance on contrastive learning with similar sample retrieval creates potential bottlenecks in memory and computational requirements during pre-training
- Limited ablation studies and empirical validation for key architectural components and pre-training methods

## Confidence

- **Hybrid ANN-SNN architecture benefits**: Medium - evidence is primarily theoretical with limited ablation studies
- **STUA pre-training method effectiveness**: Low - insufficient empirical validation against alternative alignment approaches
- **Contrastive learning contribution**: Medium - paper lacks detailed analysis of how different similarity thresholds affect performance

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Remove the SNN components entirely and compare performance to validate whether the hybrid architecture provides significant advantages over pure ANN approaches for the same parameter budget

2. **Computational efficiency benchmark**: Measure and compare inference latency and energy consumption between ASH-Nets and state-of-the-art vision-language models on identical hardware to quantify the claimed efficiency gains

3. **Robustness testing**: Evaluate model performance under adversarial image perturbations and noisy text inputs to verify the robustness improvements attributed to the contrastive learning approach
