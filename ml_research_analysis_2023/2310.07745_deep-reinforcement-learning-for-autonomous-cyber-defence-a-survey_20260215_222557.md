# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Cyber Defence: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.07745
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07745
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Reviews challenges and potential solutions for applying deep reinforcement learning to autonomous cyber defense

## Executive Summary
This survey examines the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to autonomous cyber defense (ACD), where DRL agents defend networks against cyber-attacks. The paper identifies three core challenges: high-dimensional state spaces, large multi-discrete action spaces, and adversarial learning environments. It provides a comprehensive overview of relevant DRL literature and evaluates existing ACD environments, highlighting their limitations in representing real-world ACD problems. The survey discusses various approaches for scaling DRL to handle these challenges, including state abstraction, action decomposition, and adversarial learning techniques.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review of DRL approaches relevant to autonomous cyber defense, analyzing existing ACD environments and evaluating methodologies for addressing the three core challenges. The survey synthesizes approaches from related domains including high-dimensional state processing, combinatorial action space management, and adversarial game theory. The authors map connections between these techniques and the specific requirements of ACD, identifying gaps in current research and proposing directions for future work. The methodology involves categorizing approaches by their applicability to ACD challenges and assessing their potential for scaling to realistic cyber defense scenarios.

## Key Results
- Existing ACD environments fail to fully capture the complexity of real-world autonomous cyber defense problems
- Graph-based environments and high-dimensional state/action spaces are essential for realistic ACD simulation
- DRL techniques like proto-actions, action decomposition, and curriculum learning can effectively scale to large action spaces
- Adversarial learning methods such as best response and regret minimization can reduce agent exploitability in competitive settings
- The field requires improved evaluation metrics and more representative environments to advance DRL for ACD

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: State Abstraction
- **Claim**: State abstraction reduces the curse of dimensionality by compressing high-dimensional observations into semantically equivalent low-dimensional representations that preserve optimal behavior.
- **Mechanism**: Encoder-decoder architectures like VAEs and deep bisimulation methods (DBC) learn invariant representations that ignore task-irrelevant details, enabling RL agents to focus on essential features.
- **Core assumption**: The compressed representation retains all necessary information for decision-making while eliminating noise.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] identifies high-dimensional state spaces as a core challenge; [section] describes state abstraction's aim to obtain compressed models retaining useful information.
- **Break Condition**: If the encoder fails to preserve critical features, the agent will make suboptimal decisions despite reduced dimensionality.

### Mechanism 2: Action Decomposition
- **Claim**: Action decomposition transforms intractable combinatorial action spaces into manageable multi-agent problems through algebraic formulations or branching architectures.
- **Mechanism**: Approaches like Cascading Reinforcement Learning Agents (CRLA) decompose the action space A into smaller sets U1, U2, ..., UL, where each agent selects from a subset, and actions are algebraically composed to form primitive actions.
- **Core assumption**: The decomposition preserves the original action space's expressiveness while enabling scalable learning.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] explains CRLA's solution for large combinatorial action spaces; [abstract] identifies large combinatorial action spaces as a core challenge.
- **Break Condition**: If algebraic composition fails to capture necessary action dependencies, decomposed agents will converge to suboptimal joint policies.

### Mechanism 3: Best Response Techniques
- **Claim**: Best response techniques limit exploitability in adversarial settings by iteratively computing approximate best responses against opponent policy mixtures.
- **Mechanism**: The Approximate Double Oracle (ADO) algorithm maintains policy populations for both agents, computes exploitability, and augments the policy space with new best responses until exploitability falls below threshold.
- **Core assumption**: Computing approximate best responses against policy mixtures drives both agents toward approximate Nash equilibria.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] describes ADO's two-player zero-sum game formulation; [abstract] identifies minimizing exploitability as a core challenge.
- **Break Condition**: If computing approximate best responses becomes computationally intractable or fails to find meaningful improvements, the algorithm will stall without reaching low-exploitability policies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on MDP foundations to extend to partially observable and multi-agent variants specific to cyber defense
  - Quick check question: What are the four components of an MDP tuple (S, A, R, P)?

- **Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**
  - Why needed here: Cyber defense environments are inherently partially observable, requiring POMDP formulations where agents must scan to gain information
  - Quick check question: How does a POMDP extend an MDP, and what additional components does it introduce?

- **Concept: Adversarial Game Theory**
  - Why needed here: The cyber defense problem is modeled as a two-player adversarial game where Blue and Red agents compete, requiring game-theoretic solution concepts
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Nash equilibrium and a saddle point in zero-sum games?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map**: State encoder (VAE/DBC/GNN) → Action selector (proto-actions/action decomposition) → Policy optimization (PPO/DQN variants) → Exploitability monitor (ADO framework) → Adversarial opponent module for training → Environment interface (network topology simulator)

- **Critical Path**: 
  1. Initialize environment with network topology
  2. Encode high-dimensional observations
  3. Select actions using decomposition or proto-action methods
  4. Update policies with experience replay
  5. Compute exploitability against opponent
  6. Augment policy space if exploitability exceeds threshold

- **Design Tradeoffs**:
  - State abstraction vs. representational power: more compression reduces dimensionality but risks losing critical information
  - Action decomposition granularity: finer decomposition increases scalability but requires more coordination
  - Exploitability computation frequency: more frequent updates improve robustness but increase computational cost

- **Failure Signatures**:
  - State encoder produces blurry or incomplete representations → agent fails to distinguish critical states
  - Action decomposition creates coordination failures → agents select incompatible actions
  - Exploitability computation stalls → agent population stops improving despite available better responses

- **First 3 Experiments**:
  1. Implement Wolpertinger architecture on a simple network penetration testing environment to validate proto-action approach
  2. Apply action decomposition to a discretized continuous control problem to test scalability
  3. Run ADO with a small policy population on Kuhn poker to verify exploitability reduction before scaling to cyber defense scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How exploitable are current approaches for autonomous cyber operations?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for improved evaluation metrics, specifically exploitability, in the context of autonomous cyber operations (ACO). It highlights that solutions that overfit on provided red agents are likely to perform best, and advocates for exploitability being used as a standard evaluation metric.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide specific data or results on the exploitability of current ACO approaches. It only emphasizes the importance of using exploitability as an evaluation metric.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical studies comparing the exploitability of various ACO approaches using exploitability as the primary metric.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Will methodologies developed on environments such as RecSim and Micro-RTS translate well to ACO?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the lack of environments that fully represent the challenges of ACO, and mentions RecSim and Micro-RTS as examples of environments that can benchmark high-dimensional observation and action spaces, respectively.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any empirical evidence or results on the transferability of methodologies from these environments to ACO.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of methodologies developed on RecSim and Micro-RTS when applied to ACO scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can we implement an efficient best response framework for cyber defense?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of scaling adversarial learning approaches to ACO, specifically the need for an efficient best response framework. It mentions the limitations of current best response techniques and the need for more efficient methods.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a concrete solution or framework for implementing an efficient best response for ACO. It only highlights the need for such a framework.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and evaluation of a best response framework specifically designed for ACO, demonstrating improved efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.

## Limitations
- The survey provides theoretical synthesis without novel empirical validation across the full pipeline of state abstraction, action decomposition, and exploitability minimization
- Many specific technique claims (like CRLA's effectiveness or ADO's convergence properties) are supported by references rather than direct demonstration
- The paper identifies gaps in current research but doesn't provide concrete solutions or implementations for bridging these gaps

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Identification of three core challenges (high-dimensional states, large action spaces, adversarial exploitability) - these are well-established problems in the literature
- **Medium confidence**: Survey of existing approaches and their categorization - while comprehensive, some techniques may have been missed or mischaracterized
- **Low confidence**: Specific claims about which approaches will work best in ACD settings - these remain largely theoretical without systematic empirical comparison

## Next Checks
1. Implement a comparative study testing proto-action methods against action decomposition on identical ACD environments to quantify scalability tradeoffs
2. Conduct ablation studies on state abstraction techniques to measure information loss vs. dimensionality reduction in cyber defense contexts
3. Benchmark exploitability computation methods (ADO vs. alternative approaches) on realistic network topologies to assess computational feasibility
