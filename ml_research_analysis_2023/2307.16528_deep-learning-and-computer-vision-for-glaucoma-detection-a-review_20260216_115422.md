## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16528
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16528
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of DL and CV techniques for automated glaucoma diagnosis using fundus, OCT, and visual field images

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews deep learning and computer vision techniques for automated glaucoma diagnosis using multiple imaging modalities. The review provides a taxonomy of methods organized by architectural paradigms including CNNs, autoencoders, attention networks, GANs, and geometric deep learning models. Through benchmarking on public datasets, the survey identifies critical performance gaps in generalizability, uncertainty estimation, and multimodal integration. The work highlights limitations in existing datasets including scale constraints, labeling inconsistencies, and demographic biases. By outlining open research challenges and promising directions, the survey aims to guide both AI researchers and ophthalmologists in advancing glaucoma diagnosis through AI integration.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a systematic literature search across Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar using targeted search terms including "glaucoma," "deep learning," "computer vision," and "medical diagnosis" keywords. The review organized identified methods into a taxonomy based on architectural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoder-based Networks, Attention-based Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Geometric Deep Learning Networks, and Hybrid Networks. Performance benchmarking was conducted on widely-used public datasets including REFUGE, LAG, RIM-ONE, ORIGA, DRISHTI-GS1, ACRIMA, SIGF, HRF, DRIONS-DB, ODIR-5K, JSIEC, RIGA, AGE, AFIO, Rotterdam, and Budapest datasets. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and AUC for glaucoma classification tasks.

## Key Results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The review's systematic literature search methodology ensures comprehensive coverage of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for glaucoma diagnosis.
- Mechanism: By targeting specific scholarly databases, using Boolean operators, and customizing search strings, the review captures relevant studies across the field.
- Core assumption: The search terms and databases selected are sufficient to identify all major developments in the field.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant studies on deep learning and computer vision techniques for glaucoma diagnosis published between 2017 and 2023."
  - [section] "The following scholarly databases were searched: Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. Targeted search terms included 'glaucoma,' 'deep learning,' 'computer vision,' 'machine learning,' 'artificial intelligence,' and 'medical diagnosis' keywords."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus does not directly address the search methodology, but related papers on glaucoma detection were identified, suggesting the search terms are relevant.
- Break condition: If significant advancements in the field are published in venues not covered by the search, or if new relevant search terms emerge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The review's taxonomic organization of methods by architectural paradigms facilitates understanding of the state-of-the-art in deep learning for glaucoma diagnosis.
- Mechanism: By categorizing methods into CNNs, autoencoders, attention networks, GANs, and geometric deep learning models, the review provides a structured overview of the field.
- Core assumption: The chosen categories effectively capture the diversity of approaches in the field.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We provide an updated taxonomy that organizes methods into architectural paradigms..."
  - [section] "We classify these models mainly based on their architectures into Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoder-based Networks, Attention-based Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Geometric Deep Learning Networks, and Hybrid Networks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus does not directly address the taxonomy, but related papers on various deep learning architectures for glaucoma detection were identified, supporting the relevance of the chosen categories.
- Break condition: If new architectural paradigms emerge that are not captured by the current taxonomy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The review's emphasis on benchmarking performance on public datasets reveals important gaps in generalizability, uncertainty estimation, and multimodal integration.
- Mechanism: By evaluating models on widely-used datasets and reporting performance metrics, the review identifies areas where current methods fall short.
- Core assumption: The chosen datasets and metrics are representative of the challenges in real-world glaucoma diagnosis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through rigorous benchmarking on widely-used public datasets, we reveal performance gaps in generalizability, uncertainty estimation, and multimodal integration."
  - [section] "In this section, we present a concise overview of the datasets used in the studies reviewed within this paper, as well as the evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance of trained models in glaucoma diagnosis."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus does not directly address benchmarking, but related papers report performance on various public datasets, suggesting the approach is relevant.
- Break condition: If the chosen datasets do not adequately represent the diversity of real-world data, or if new important metrics emerge.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literature search and selection -> Taxonomic organization of methods -> Performance benchmarking -> Discussion of challenges and future directions

- Critical path: The systematic literature search and selection is the foundation, enabling the taxonomic organization and benchmarking, which in turn inform the discussion of challenges and future directions.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Broad vs. focused search terms
  - Granular vs. coarse-grained taxonomic categories
  - Choice of public datasets for benchmarking
  - Balance between technical depth and accessibility in the discussion

- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete literature coverage due to search term or database limitations
  - Misclassification of methods due to unclear taxonomic boundaries
  - Biased or unrepresentative benchmarking results due to dataset selection
  - Oversimplification or overcomplication of technical concepts in the discussion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Conduct a small-scale literature search using a subset of the defined search terms and databases, and manually review the results to assess coverage and relevance.
  2. Apply the taxonomic categories to a sample of identified papers and check for consistency and completeness of classification.
  3. Select a small set of public datasets and evaluate a few representative models on them, comparing the results to those reported in the literature.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
