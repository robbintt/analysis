# The Word2vec Graph Model for Author Attribution and Genre Detection in Literary Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16972
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Novel Word2vec graph-based feature extraction technique outperforms traditional stylometry and TF-IDF methods in genre detection and matches multilingual BERT performance in author attribution.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel Word2vec graph-based feature extraction technique for literary analysis tasks like author attribution and genre detection. The method represents documents as graphs where nodes are words and edges capture word similarities derived from Word2vec embeddings. Features extracted from the graph structure, along with associated words, form a compact yet effective feature set. Experiments on Bengali and English literary datasets show the approach outperforms traditional stylometry and TF-IDF methods in genre detection and matches multilingual BERT performance in author attribution, while using significantly fewer features. The graph structure also reveals interpretable patterns across different writing styles and genres.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing a Word2vec graph for each document, where nodes represent words and edges are weighted by cosine similarity of Word2vec embeddings. Three types of nodes are defined: core words (most frequent), multi-words (similar to core words), and boundary words (remaining). Features are extracted from the graph structure, including node/edge weights, degrees, and connectivity patterns, along with associated words. These features form a compact representation that captures both context and style of the document. The extracted features are then used for classification and clustering tasks using SVM and k-means algorithms.

## Key Results
- Outperforms traditional stylometry and TF-IDF methods in genre detection tasks
- Matches multilingual BERT performance in author attribution while using significantly fewer features
- Graph structure reveals interpretable patterns across different writing styles and genres

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Word2vec graph captures both context and style by connecting core words with their most similar words in the embedding space.
- Mechanism: Each document is transformed into a graph where nodes are words and edges are weighted by cosine similarity of Word2vec embeddings. This structure encodes semantic relationships and co-occurrence patterns that reflect writing style.
- Core assumption: Words that are semantically similar and co-occur frequently in a document carry stylistic and contextual information useful for classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Word2vec graph based modeling of a document that can rightly capture both context and style of the document"
  - [section] "The words (multi/boundary nodes) related to the most frequent words represent the context of the documents... These are usually personal nouns and verbs that identify the primary characters and the most prevalent actions described in the document"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; assumption based on embedding similarity and frequency patterns
- Break condition: If Word2vec embeddings fail to capture meaningful semantic relationships for a language or domain, or if frequent words do not correlate with stylistic markers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph features (node/edge weights, degrees, connectivity patterns) encode discriminative information for author/genre classification.
- Mechanism: By extracting structural statistics from the Word2vec graph (counts of core/multi/boundary nodes and edges, their weights, degrees, and indices), the method creates a compact feature vector that distinguishes authors or genres based on writing patterns.
- Core assumption: Different authors or genres exhibit distinct graph structural patterns due to their unique word usage and stylistic choices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The graph structure also reveals interpretable patterns across different writing styles and genres"
  - [section] "Different graph embedding methods have been popular recently... However, the distinction between Word2vec graph structures can be interpreted from the count, connectivity of different types of nodes"
  - [corpus] Figure 6 shows avg. values of features like core edges and multi edges differ across domains, supporting structural distinctiveness
- Break condition: If structural features are not discriminative enough across classes, or if graph construction parameters (N, K) are poorly chosen.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining graph structure features with associated word information (graph words) improves classification performance.
- Mechanism: The graph words set (core, multi, and boundary nodes' associated words) is combined with structural features to form a richer representation that includes both syntactic patterns and lexical context.
- Core assumption: Pure structural features miss lexical context; adding associated words recovers some lost information while maintaining compactness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "features extracted from the graph structure, along with associated words, form a compact yet effective feature set"
  - [section] "This feature list is devoid of any actual word-related information... Therefore, we utilize combinations of the core, multi, and boundary nodes associated words set"
  - [corpus] No explicit corpus evidence; performance comparison in Table 5 shows w2v+ outperforms w2v graph alone
- Break condition: If the added word information does not provide additional discriminative power or introduces noise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word2vec embeddings and cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: Core to constructing the Word2vec graph by measuring word similarity for edge weights
  - Quick check question: How is the edge weight between two words in the graph calculated?
- Concept: Graph theory basics (nodes, edges, degree, connectivity)
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how the document is represented as a graph and how features are extracted
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of nodes defined in the Word2vec graph and how are they categorized?
- Concept: Feature extraction from graph structures
  - Why needed here: The method relies on extracting statistical features (counts, weights, degrees) from the graph to form the feature set
  - Quick check question: What types of features are extracted from the Word2vec graph besides node/edge counts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Document preprocessing (tokenization, optional stopword removal)
  2. Word2vec model training on document tokens
  3. Word2vec graph construction (core words, similar words, edge weights)
  4. Feature extraction (structural stats + graph words)
  5. Classification/clustering using extracted features
- Critical path: Document → Word2vec model → Word2vec graph → Features → Classification/Clustering
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Graph complexity vs. feature interpretability (simpler graphs are easier to analyze but may lose nuance)
  - Stopword inclusion vs. feature richness (with stopwords captures more but may add noise)
  - Number of core words (N) and similar words (K) balance context capture and sparsity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor classification performance if Word2vec embeddings do not capture meaningful similarities
  - Overfitting if N and K are too large relative to document size
  - Loss of discriminative power if graph words are not included when lexical context is important
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary N and K to find optimal graph density for a small validation set
  2. Compare classification performance with and without stopwords for a given dataset
  3. Test feature importance ranking to identify most discriminative graph features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of the Word2vec graph model change when using larger corpora with more diverse writing styles and genres?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions evaluating the model on three datasets, but does not explore the impact of dataset size and diversity on performance.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the Word2vec graph model on a limited set of datasets, leaving the question of scalability unanswered.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the performance of the Word2vec graph model on larger, more diverse corpora with varying writing styles and genres.

- Question: How does the Word2vec graph model compare to other graph-based feature extraction techniques, such as DeepWalk or Graph2vec, in terms of performance and interpretability?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions DeepWalk, Graph Convolution Network, and Graph2vec as existing graph embedding methods but does not compare the Word2vec graph model to these techniques.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on introducing the Word2vec graph model and its application to literary analysis tasks, without exploring its relationship to other graph-based methods.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments between the Word2vec graph model and other graph-based feature extraction techniques, evaluating both performance and interpretability.

- Question: Can the Word2vec graph model be extended to handle multi-modal data, such as incorporating images or audio alongside text, for a more comprehensive literary analysis?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on text-based literary analysis and does not explore the potential of incorporating other modalities into the Word2vec graph model.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not address the possibility of extending the Word2vec graph model to handle multi-modal data, leaving the question of its applicability to more complex literary analysis tasks unanswered.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the performance of the Word2vec graph model when incorporating multi-modal data, such as images or audio, alongside text for literary analysis tasks.

## Limitations

- Parameter sensitivity: The method relies on parameters like the number of core words (N) and similar words (K) for graph construction, but specific optimal values are not provided. The performance could be sensitive to these choices.
- Generalizability across languages and domains: While the method shows strong performance on Bengali and English literary datasets, its effectiveness on other languages or non-literary domains is not established.
- Comparison baseline: The comparison is primarily with traditional stylometry, TF-IDF, and multilingual BERT. More recent deep learning approaches are not included, which could provide a more comprehensive performance benchmark.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism by which the Word2vec graph captures semantic relationships and structural features for classification is well-supported by the abstract and methodology description.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretability of graph structures across different writing styles and genres is supported by the abstract and a mention of Figure 6, but more detailed evidence would strengthen this claim.
- **Low Confidence**: The assumption that Word2vec embeddings always capture meaningful semantic relationships for any language or domain is a core but unverified assumption.

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct experiments to determine how the choice of N (number of core words) and K (number of similar words) affects classification performance on a validation set. This will help establish robust parameter ranges.

2. **Cross-Lingual and Cross-Domain Validation**: Test the method on datasets from different languages (e.g., Spanish, Arabic) and non-literary domains (e.g., scientific articles, legal documents) to assess its generalizability.

3. **Benchmark Against Modern Deep Learning Models**: Compare the performance of the Word2vec graph method with transformer-based models (e.g., RoBERTa, SciBERT) fine-tuned on the same datasets to provide a more comprehensive performance benchmark.
