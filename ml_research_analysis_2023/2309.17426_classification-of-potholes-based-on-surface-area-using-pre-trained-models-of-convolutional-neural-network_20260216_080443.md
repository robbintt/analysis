# Classification of Potholes Based on Surface Area Using Pre-Trained Models of Convolutional Neural Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.17426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17426
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MobileNet v2 achieves 98% accuracy for pothole detection and 98.67% for classifying large potholes when images are taken at full waist height

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the effectiveness of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting and classifying potholes in road pavement images. The research compares three CNN architectures - ResNet 50, ResNet 18, and MobileNet v2 - for classifying pavement images into Normal, Small Pothole, and Large Pothole categories. Images were captured at two heights (2 feet and 3.5 feet) using a mobile phone. The MobileNet v2 model demonstrates superior performance with 98% accuracy for pothole detection and 98.67% accuracy for classifying large potholes when images are taken from full waist height, outperforming deeper architectures like ResNet models.

## Method Summary
The study employs transfer learning using three pre-trained CNN models (ResNet50, ResNet18, MobileNet v2) for pothole classification. Images were captured at two heights (2 feet and 3.5 feet) using a mobile phone and categorized as Normal, Small Pothole, or Large Pothole based on surface area relative to tire contact area. The models were fine-tuned for 5 epochs without extensive training from scratch. Three classification tasks were performed: binary pothole detection, area-based pothole classification, and height-based pothole classification. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Key Results
- MobileNet v2 achieves 98% accuracy for pothole detection and 98.67% accuracy for classifying large potholes at full waist height
- Classification accuracy decreases when images are taken at 2 feet height: 87.33% for large potholes, 88.67% for small potholes, and 92% for normal pavement
- MobileNet v2 outperforms ResNet architectures despite having fewer parameters, using depthwise separable convolutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MobileNet v2 outperforms deeper architectures (ResNet 50, ResNet 18) for pothole detection and classification despite having fewer parameters.
- Mechanism: MobileNet v2 uses depthwise separable convolutions, reducing computational complexity while maintaining representational power for pavement image features.
- Core assumption: Depthwise separable convolutions are sufficient to capture the hierarchical features needed for pothole detection in road images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MobileNet v2 has an accuracy of 98% for detecting a pothole" and "MobileNet v2 has an accuracy value of 98.67%, 100% and 98.67%" for the three classification tasks
  - [section] "MobileNet v2, ResNet 18, and ResNet 50 has an image input size of 224 × 224 × 3" and architecture details showing MobileNet v2's 28 deep layers with depthwise and pointwise convolutions
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct comparison of MobileNet vs ResNet performance on similar tasks in the corpus
- Break condition: If pothole features require complex spatial relationships that depthwise separable convolutions cannot capture effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Image height (capture distance) significantly affects classification accuracy for pothole detection.
- Mechanism: Lower capture height (2 feet) provides higher resolution images that improve detection of small potholes but may introduce perspective distortion affecting classification.
- Core assumption: The trade-off between resolution and perspective distortion favors closer capture for small pothole detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The classification of images taken at the height of 2 feet has an accuracy value of 87.33%, 88.67%, and 92% for classifying the large, small, and normal pavement, respectively" vs "classification of the images taken from full of waist (FFW) height has an accuracy value of 98.67%, 98.67%, and 100%"
  - [section] "Images were captured at two heights, 2 feet, and 3.5 feet" and the discussion of pixel area calculation for each height
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus studies on image capture height effects on pothole detection
- Break condition: If perspective distortion at lower heights overwhelms the benefit of higher resolution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models provides effective feature extraction for pothole classification without extensive training.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models on ImageNet have learned general visual features that transfer well to pavement image classification tasks.
- Core assumption: Visual features learned from natural images (ImageNet) are transferable to man-made pavement structures and defects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "There are several pre-trained CNN models which includes Alexnet, Googlenet, Inception v3, Densenet 201, Darknet (19 and 53), Resnet (18,50 and 101), Vgg (16 and 19), Shufflenet, Nasnet (mobile and large), Mobilenet v2, Xception, Inceptionresnet v2, Squeezenet etc."
  - [section] The successful application of ResNet and MobileNet models without training from scratch
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus studies on transfer learning effectiveness for pavement defect detection
- Break condition: If pavement images contain domain-specific features not present in natural image datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks and their basic components (convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on three different CNN architectures, and understanding their structure is essential to interpret the results
  - Quick check question: What is the primary function of a convolutional layer versus a pooling layer in a CNN?

- Concept: Transfer learning and pre-trained models
  - Why needed here: The study uses pre-trained ResNet and MobileNet models, and understanding how transfer learning works is crucial for evaluating the methodology
  - Quick check question: How does using a pre-trained model differ from training a CNN from scratch on the same task?

- Concept: Image classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
  - Why needed here: The results section presents multiple performance metrics, and understanding their differences is important for proper interpretation
  - Quick check question: When would precision be more important than recall for a pothole detection system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Mobile phone camera -> Image preprocessing -> Model inference -> Classification -> Area calculation
- Critical path: Image capture → preprocessing → model inference → classification → area calculation (for height-based tasks)
- Design tradeoffs: MobileNet v2 chosen for speed and mobile deployment vs. deeper models for potential accuracy gains; 2-foot vs 3.5-foot capture height tradeoff between resolution and coverage
- Failure signatures: Low precision indicates false positives (normal pavement classified as pothole); low recall indicates missed detections; inconsistent performance across height conditions suggests perspective-related issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate all three models on the binary pothole detection task to establish baseline performance
  2. Implement the pixel-area calculation method and verify correct classification boundaries for small/large potholes
  3. Compare model performance across both capture heights to quantify the height effect on classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do environmental conditions like rain, lighting, and shadows affect the accuracy of pothole detection models across different CNN architectures?
- How does the choice of camera angle and positioning affect the accuracy of pothole detection and classification?
- How does the computational efficiency of different CNN models impact their suitability for real-time pothole detection on mobile devices?

## Limitations
- Specific image processing techniques for calculating pothole areas are not detailed
- Dataset composition (number of images per class, distribution across capture heights) remains unspecified
- 5-epoch training duration appears minimal for fine-tuning deep networks

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** MobileNet v2 outperforming ResNet architectures for this specific task
- **Medium confidence:** The capture height effect on classification accuracy
- **Low confidence:** Transfer learning effectiveness from ImageNet to pavement images

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies comparing fine-tuned vs. non-pretrained versions of the same CNN architectures to quantify transfer learning benefits
2. Conduct systematic testing across additional capture heights (e.g., 1ft, 2.5ft, 4ft) to better characterize the height-accuracy relationship
3. Perform cross-dataset validation using an independent pothole image dataset to assess model generalizability beyond the original capture conditions
