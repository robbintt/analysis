core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of 3D surface reconstruction
  from multiple images when only a part of the object is captured. The authors propose
  a novel framework, called NeuSD, which combines neural radiance fields for the reconstruction
  of visible parts of the surface with guidance from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model
  to complete the shape in unobserved regions.

# NeuSD: Surface Completion with Multi-View Text-to-Image Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.04654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04654
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: NeuSD improves 3D surface reconstruction completion with 9.4% CLIP similarity increase and 100% user preference in most scenes

## Executive Summary
NeuSD addresses the challenge of 3D surface reconstruction from multiple images when only part of an object is captured. The method combines neural radiance fields for visible parts with guidance from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to complete unobserved regions. By using normal maps instead of color renderings, freezing SDS noise during training, and applying multi-view SDS with a grid of normal maps, NeuSD achieves significant improvements over competing methods on the BlendedMVS dataset.

## Method Summary
NeuSD builds on NeuS by adding diffusion model guidance through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). The key innovation is using normal maps (surface orientations) rather than color renderings for SDS, which provides cleaner geometric information. The method freezes the noise added to the diffusion model input during training for faster convergence, and applies SDS to a grid of normal maps from visible and unobserved viewpoints. This multi-view approach conditions the diffusion model on the visible geometry without fine-tuning, generating consistent guidance for completing the unobserved regions.

## Key Results
- 9.4% increase in CLIP similarity for whole surface completion compared to baseline methods
- 100% user preference in most scenes over competing methods
- Successfully completes unobserved regions while maintaining accurate visible side reconstruction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Normal Maps for Pure Geometric Guidance
Normal maps encode surface orientation information as RGB channels, representing textureless renderings under special lighting. This representation is more directly related to surface geometry than color renderings, which mix geometry with appearance. The method assumes normal maps lie within the generative manifold of the diffusion model and can serve as valid input for SDS.

### Mechanism 2: Frozen SDS Noise for Stable Gradients
By fixing the additive Gaussian noise ϵ in the SDS loss calculation, the gradient becomes dependent only on the timestep rather than on both the timestep and random noise. This reduces variation in the learning signal, leading to faster convergence and improved generation results. The fixed noise maintains the property that the shifted data point belongs to the training distribution of the denoising U-net.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-View SDS for Consistent Completion
The method combines one normal map from the unobserved viewpoint with several normal maps from recent visible viewpoints into a 2×2 grid. This grid is processed by the diffusion model conditioned on a prompt like "renders of the same object from different viewpoints". The diffusion model produces outputs that share stylistic and geometric similarities across the grid views, providing consistent guidance for completing the unobserved regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit surface representations**: NeuSD builds on NeuS, which uses neural implicit surfaces based on signed distance functions to represent geometry. Quick check: What is the difference between a density field in NeRF and a signed distance function in NeuS?

- **Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and diffusion models**: SDS is the mechanism that propagates gradients from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to guide 3D surface reconstruction. Quick check: How does SDS use the denoising model's output to guide the 3D representation during training?

- **Multi-view stereo and surface reconstruction from sparse views**: The method operates in a setting where only part of the object is captured from limited viewpoints, requiring completion of unobserved regions. Quick check: What challenges arise when reconstructing surfaces from viewpoints that only capture part of an object?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NeuS MLP -> Normal map renderer -> Stable Diffusion 2.1 -> Multi-view SDS grid assembler -> Loss functions
- **Critical path**: 1) Sample a viewpoint (visible or unobserved) 2) Render normal map from that viewpoint 3) For visible views: compute NeuS loss 4) For unobserved views: assemble multi-view grid, compute SDS loss using normal maps 5) Backpropagate combined loss to update NeuS MLP parameters
- **Design tradeoffs**: Normal maps vs color renderings (cleaner geometry but may lose appearance cues), frozen noise vs varying noise (stable gradients but reduced exploration), multi-view vs single-view SDS (better consistency but higher computational cost)
- **Failure signatures**: Visible side reconstruction degrades (weight balancing issue), unobserved side produces artifacts (poor prompt or insufficient conditioning), slow convergence (SDS weight or timestep range issue)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement basic NeuS training on visible views only 2) Add color-based SDS guidance for unobserved views 3) Replace color renderings with normal maps in SDS

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can the computation time of NeuSD be significantly reduced while maintaining or improving the quality of 3D surface reconstruction?**: The paper acknowledges high computation times compared to single forward pass methods but does not provide specific solutions.

- **How can NeuSD be extended to handle scenes containing multiple objects?**: The authors mention wanting to extend the framework to complete scenes with multiple objects but only address single object reconstruction.

- **How does the choice of textual prompt affect the quality of the 3D surface reconstruction in NeuSD?**: The paper notes that prompt quality affects results but does not provide a systematic study of prompt impact.

## Limitations

- **Normal Map Representation Constraint**: Relies on normal maps as sufficient geometric representations, potentially missing valuable appearance cues that could disambiguate completions of unobserved regions.
- **Manual Viewpoint Selection**: Requires manual selection of visible and guidance viewpoints, limiting scalability and introducing potential evaluation bias.
- **Computational Overhead**: Multi-view SDS requires storing and processing multiple normal maps across iterations, increasing memory requirements and computational cost.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Using normal maps instead of color renderings in SDS, and freezing SDS noise during training
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of Multi-View SDS for improving completion quality
- **Medium Confidence**: CLIP similarity improvements as quality metric

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Noise Freezing**: Conduct controlled experiment varying noise freezing strength to validate the claimed mechanism behind faster convergence.

2. **Generalization Test**: Apply the method to objects with complex materials (transparent, reflective, or with fine texture details) to evaluate whether normal maps provide sufficient guidance in these cases.

3. **Automatic Viewpoint Selection**: Implement and evaluate an automatic method for selecting visible and guidance viewpoints based on reconstruction uncertainty or coverage metrics.
