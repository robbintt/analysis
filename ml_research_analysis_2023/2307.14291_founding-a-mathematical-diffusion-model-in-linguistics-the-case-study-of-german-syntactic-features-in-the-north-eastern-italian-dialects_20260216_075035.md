# Founding a mathematical diffusion model in linguistics. The case study of German syntactic features in the North-Eastern Italian dialects

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.14291
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14291
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: A mathematical diffusion-convection model accurately represents the geographic spread of German syntactic features in North-Eastern Italian dialects

## Executive Summary
This study develops a mathematical diffusion model for linguistic features, using German syntactic structures in North-Eastern Italian dialects as a case study. The approach involves creating an interactive map using Geographic Data Science tools, then introducing a smooth two-dimensional surface representing the local fraction of territory using a given German language feature. This surface is obtained through piecewise cubic curvature-minimizing interpolation of discrete survey data. The study demonstrates that this surface can be interpreted as a diffusion-convection phenomenon, governed by the same equation used in physics. Two different diffusivity assumptions yield solutions that fit the data well, providing convincing pictures of diffusion-convection. Importantly, the study shows that the Schmidt 'waves' model, known in linguistics, is among the solutions of the diffusion equation. This finding suggests that combining Schmidt 'waves' with a 'tidal linguistic flooding' model can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events, though numerical techniques are required for implementation.

## Method Summary
The study constructs a smooth two-dimensional g-index surface using Clough-Tocher piecewise cubic curvature-minimizing interpolation of discrete survey data on German syntactic features. From this surface, contour lines and gradient fields are derived to define linguistic feature flux. The g-index surface is then interpreted as a solution to the diffusion-convection equation, with two different diffusivity assumptions tested (constant and distance-dependent). Analytical solutions of the 1D diffusion equation with and without convection terms are fitted to averaged g-index profiles along gradient paths to evaluate goodness of fit using reduced chi-square.

## Key Results
- The g-index surface derived from survey data can be interpreted as a diffusion-convection phenomenon governed by the same equation used in physics
- Two different diffusivity assumptions yield solutions that fit the data well, providing convincing pictures of diffusion-convection
- The Schmidt 'waves' model, known in linguistics, is among the solutions of the diffusion equation
- Combining Schmidt 'waves' with a 'tidal linguistic flooding' model can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The diffusion-convection equation from physics can accurately model linguistic feature spread.
- Mechanism: The g-index surface, derived from discrete survey data using piecewise cubic curvature-minimizing interpolation, represents the fraction of territory using a German syntactic feature. This surface is treated as a solution to the diffusion-convection equation, allowing the model to capture both the spread and internal dynamics of linguistic change.
- Core assumption: The movement and adoption of linguistic features can be approximated by physical diffusion and convection processes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This surface G is thought of as the value at the present time of a function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions... subjected in a very natural way to the same equation used in physics."
  - [section]: "Following various diffusion theories in physics, one would introduce a function η(x, y; G), to be called diffusivity... then one would introduce a local directional flux of linguistic feature as ⃗Φ = − η ⃗∇G."
- Break condition: If linguistic adoption is driven primarily by non-spatial factors (e.g., social networks, policy) not captured by physical diffusion/convection models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Schmidt 'waves' are valid solutions to the diffusion equation and can explain localized pockets of linguistic retention.
- Mechanism: By introducing a coordinate-dependent diffusivity (η(r) = ˚η a / r), the diffusion equation admits solutions that represent expanding circular waves of linguistic change originating from point sources. These can be superimposed with tidal-type diffusion to model complex diffusion patterns.
- Core assumption: Linguistic innovations can spread from discrete origin points in a wave-like pattern, similar to physical diffusion from a point source.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Very importantly, it is shown that the linguistic diffusion model known to linguists as Schmidt 'waves' can be counted among the solutions of the diffusion equation."
  - [section]: "With the diffusivity depending on the coordinates only, eq. 30 is linear, so that linear combinations of its solutions are themselves solutions. Of course this is true in particular for linear combinations of tidal-type and Schmidt solutions."
- Break condition: If linguistic waves do not expand uniformly or if diffusivity cannot be reasonably approximated as inversely proportional to distance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The gradient field of the g-index surface provides a direct measure of linguistic feature flux.
- Mechanism: The gradient of the g-index surface (∇G) indicates the direction and magnitude of maximum change in feature adoption. Combined with the diffusivity, this yields a flux vector field (⃗Φ = − η ⃗∇G) that quantifies the rate and direction of linguistic change across the territory.
- Core assumption: The rate of change in linguistic feature adoption is proportional to the gradient of the feature's geographic distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Then, contour lines and corresponding gradient lines on the g index surface will be introduced, indeed a gradient field, the latter to be used to define a linguistic features flux."
  - [section]: "Getting back to figs. 2 to 5, one sees a major strip of territory where the gradient field is not null... it will be referred to as a gradient front of linguistic diffusion."
- Break condition: If the relationship between geographic proximity and feature adoption is not linear or monotonic.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion equation and its solutions (e.g., error function complement).
  - Why needed here: The diffusion equation is the mathematical foundation for modeling how linguistic features spread across geographic space over time.
  - Quick check question: Can you write the one-dimensional diffusion equation and identify what each term represents?

- Concept: Gradient fields and directional derivatives.
  - Why needed here: The gradient of the g-index surface provides the direction and magnitude of maximum change, which is essential for defining the flux of linguistic features.
  - Quick check question: How is the gradient of a scalar field related to the steepest ascent direction?

- Concept: Piecewise cubic curvature-minimizing interpolation.
  - Why needed here: This interpolation method is used to create a smooth, continuous g-index surface from discrete survey data, which is necessary for applying differential equation models.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using a curvature-minimizing interpolant over a simple linear interpolation for geographic data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data (survey data) -> Interpolation (Clough-Tocher) -> Surface Analysis (contour, gradient) -> Modeling (diffusion equation) -> Visualization (interactive map)
- Critical path: Data → Interpolation → Surface Analysis → Model Fitting → Time Evolution → Visualization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpolation method: Higher-order interpolation (cubic) provides smoother surfaces but may overfit sparse data
  - Dimensionality: 1D projection simplifies analysis but loses some geographic detail
  - Diffusivity assumptions: Constant diffusivity is simpler but may not capture local variations in receptivity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor model fit (high chi-square): Indicates the diffusion model does not accurately represent the data
  - Negative or >1 g-index values: Suggests issues with the interpolation or boundary conditions
  - Unstable numerical solutions: May indicate inappropriate diffusivity functions or time steps
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate interpolation: Compare g-index surface values at survey points to original data; ensure continuity and reasonable extrapolation
  2. Test gradient field: Verify that gradient vectors are orthogonal to contour lines and point in the direction of increasing g-index
  3. Fit linear vs. erfc solutions: For a single feature, fit both the linear and error function complement solutions to the data and compare reduced chi-squares to determine the better model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal diffusivity function η for modeling linguistic diffusion-convection phenomena, and how does it vary across different linguistic features and geographic regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the introduction of a contextual diffusivity concept and shows that with two different assumptions about diffusivity, solutions of the diffusion equation fit well with the data. However, it also mentions that finding the appropriate diffusivity function based on historical, local cultural, and geographical grounds would require advanced numerical techniques.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents two different diffusivity assumptions that yield convincing pictures of diffusion-convection, but it does not determine which is optimal or how diffusivity might vary across different linguistic features and geographic regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive data covering 100% of localities, including areas south of Rovigo to include the whole of Emilia-Romagna, combined with advanced numerical modeling techniques, could provide insights into the optimal diffusivity function and its variations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do Schmidt's 'waves' and the 'tidal linguistic flooding' model interact to reproduce the complexities of real linguistic diffusion events?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that Schmidt's 'waves' model can be counted among the solutions of the diffusion equation and suggests that combining Schmidt 'waves' with a 'tidal linguistic flooding' model can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that combining these models is theoretically possible, it does not provide empirical evidence or detailed simulations showing how they interact in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed numerical simulations and empirical studies comparing the predictions of combined Schmidt's 'waves' and 'tidal linguistic flooding' models with actual linguistic diffusion data across various regions and time periods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the historical and social factors that most significantly influence the receptivity (η) of linguistic features in different geographic areas?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that diffusivity could be influenced by parameters such as the rate of inter-linguistic contacts, the area of a specific locality, and a related receptance connected to environmental, social, political, and ideological factors.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the concept of contextual diffusivity but does not delve into the specific historical and social factors that influence receptivity or how these factors vary across different regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Historical research documenting linguistic contacts, social mobility, political changes, and cultural attitudes towards linguistic innovation, combined with quantitative analysis of their correlation with observed diffusion patterns.

## Limitations
- The assumption that linguistic diffusion can be accurately modeled using physical diffusion-convection equations may oversimplify the complex social and cultural factors involved
- The choice of diffusivity function (constant vs. distance-dependent) significantly affects the solution type, but there's limited empirical justification for either choice in linguistic contexts
- The model treats space as the primary dimension of diffusion, potentially underrepresenting social network effects and other non-spatial factors that influence linguistic change

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mathematical derivation of solutions to the diffusion equation and the technical implementation of the interpolation and gradient calculations
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretation of g-index surfaces as representing linguistic feature diffusion, given that the mathematical framework is sound but the linguistic assumptions require further validation
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of this specific diffusion model to other linguistic phenomena beyond German syntactic features in Italian dialects

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-validation with independent data**: Apply the same modeling approach to a different set of linguistic features or to data from a different geographic region to test model generalizability
2. **Sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the diffusivity function parameters and initial conditions to quantify their impact on solution stability and goodness of fit
3. **Comparison with alternative models**: Test the diffusion-convection model against agent-based social network models of linguistic change to determine which better captures the underlying mechanisms of feature adoption
