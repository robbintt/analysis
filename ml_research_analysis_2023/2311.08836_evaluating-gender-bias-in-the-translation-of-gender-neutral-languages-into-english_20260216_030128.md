# Evaluating Gender Bias in the Translation of Gender-Neutral Languages into English

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08836

- One-line primary result: Introduces GATE X-E benchmark and demonstrates GPT-3.5 Turbo achieves 97-99% accuracy on gender-neutral rewriting for pronoun-only instances

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GATE X-E, a benchmark for evaluating gender bias in machine translation from gender-neutral languages (Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian) into English. The dataset contains 1250-1850 human-translated sentence pairs with feminine, masculine, and neutral gender variants. The authors propose a monolingual rewriting approach using GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate gender-neutral alternatives, achieving high accuracy (97-99%) on the pronoun-only subset. They also demonstrate a rule-based method to generate gendered alternatives from the neutral rewrites.

## Method Summary
The authors filter the GATE X-E dataset to extract pronoun-only instances where gender markings are limited to pronouns. They use GPT-3.5 Turbo (both zero-shot and few-shot) to generate gender-neutral rewrites by systematically replacing gendered pronouns with neutral alternatives. A rule-based algorithm then converts these neutral rewrites into masculine and feminine variants by mapping pronouns according to their grammatical categories. The approach is evaluated using accuracy, BLEU, and WER metrics against human reference translations.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5 Turbo achieves 97-99% accuracy on pronoun-only uniform-gender problems
- Rule-based conversion successfully generates gendered alternatives from neutral rewrites
- Filtering creates 627-857 pronoun-only instances per language pair for evaluation
- Error analysis reveals common failure modes including unrelated text modifications and ambiguous pronoun references

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
GPT-3.5 Turbo accurately generates gender-neutral rewrites for pronoun-only uniform-gender problems using a monolingual prompt without source access. The model leverages its understanding of English pronoun categories and gender neutrality to perform systematic replacements while maintaining sentence structure. This works when the source language is truly gender-neutral in pronouns, the target contains only gendered pronouns without gendered nouns, and external gender context is limited.

### Mechanism 2
A rule-based algorithm converts gender-neutral rewrites into accurate masculine and feminine alternatives by leveraging the unique mapping properties of English pronouns. The algorithm uses the pronoun-only uniform-gender rewrite as a template, then systematically replaces each pronoun with its masculine or feminine counterpart from the same pronoun category. This works when the gender-neutral rewrite is accurate and the original translation can disambiguate possessive pronoun forms.

### Mechanism 3
Filtering the GATE X-E dataset removes instances with gendered nouns to create a clean evaluation set for the monolingual rewriting approach. By excluding sentences with gendered nouns in either source or target, the remaining instances guarantee that all gender markings in the target are AGMEs (Arbitrarily Gender-Marked Entities) that can be rewritten. This works when the filtering process correctly identifies all instances with gendered nouns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gender-neutral pronouns and their English pronoun categories**: Understanding the systematic relationships between gendered and gender-neutral pronouns is essential for both the GPT-based rewriting and the rule-based conversion. *Quick check*: What are the five categories of English pronouns, and what are the feminine, masculine, and neutral forms in each category?

- **AGME (Arbitrarily Gender-Marked Entity) identification**: Recognizing when a gender-marked individual in the target is not gender-marked in the source is crucial for determining when rewriting is appropriate. *Quick check*: What distinguishes an AGME from a person whose gender is marked in the source language?

- **Coreference resolution basics**: Understanding when multiple pronouns refer to the same individual is necessary for handling non-uniform gender problems. *Quick check*: How would you determine if "she gave him her umbrella" contains one or two AGMEs under the uniform gender assumption?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GATE X-E dataset -> GPT-3.5 Turbo model -> Rule-based conversion module -> Evaluation metrics -> Error analysis pipeline

- **Critical path**: 1) Filter GATE X-E for pronoun-only instances, 2) Generate gender-neutral rewrites using GPT-3.5 Turbo, 3) Apply rule-based algorithm to create masculine/feminine alternatives, 4) Evaluate using reference translations and calculate metrics, 5) Analyze errors and refine approach

- **Design tradeoffs**: Monolingual vs. source-aware rewriting (simpler but cannot handle gendered nouns), GPT-3.5 Turbo vs. rule-based neutral rewriting (better handling of ambiguous pronouns but may introduce unrelated modifications), few-shot vs. zero-shot prompting (better performance but requires maintaining example sets)

- **Failure signatures**: High WER with low BLEU (grammatical errors or unrelated modifications), low accuracy with high BLEU (fluent but incorrect gender variants), 'None' responses from GPT (model thinks no rewriting is needed when AGMEs are present)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Compare zero-shot vs. few-shot performance on Turkish pronoun-only instances, 2) Test rule-based conversion algorithm on manually verified gender-neutral rewrites, 3) Analyze error patterns in few-shot setting to identify areas for prompt refinement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How does performance vary across different domains?** The paper mentions GATE X-E features natural sentences with a wide range of domains, but does not provide detailed analysis of GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance across these domains.

- **Can the rule-based approach handle more complex linguistic phenomena?** The paper discusses the rule-based method for generating gendered alternatives but notes it is limited to handling pronouns and simple verb adjustments, without addressing more complex phenomena like gender agreement in adjectives.

- **How does accuracy change with gendered nouns in source translated to pronouns?** The paper mentions instances where gendered nouns in the source are translated into pronouns in English are excluded from testing, but does not provide performance metrics for these specific cases.

## Limitations

- The monolingual approach cannot handle instances with gendered nouns in either source or target language
- The approach assumes uniform gender assignments across all pronouns in a sentence
- Performance on non-pronoun-only instances and more complex gender-rewriting problems remains untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The accuracy results (97-99%) for pronoun-only uniform-gender problems using GPT-3.5 Turbo are well-supported by experimental evidence.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the monolingual approach cannot handle non-uniform gender problems is theoretically sound but needs empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of these results to broader translation scenarios involving gendered nouns or non-uniform gender assignments remains largely untested.

## Next Checks

1. Test the approach on non-uniform gender instances by manually constructing cases where different pronouns refer to different individuals with varying gender assignments.

2. Evaluate performance on gendered noun instances by applying the GPT-3.5 Turbo approach to sentences containing gendered nouns to quantify accuracy drop.

3. Replicate the few-shot prompt performance by contacting authors for exact examples and conducting controlled experiments comparing zero-shot vs. few-shot performance across all four language pairs.
