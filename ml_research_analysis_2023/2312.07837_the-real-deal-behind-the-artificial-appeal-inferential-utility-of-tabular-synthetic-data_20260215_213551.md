# The Real Deal Behind the Artificial Appeal: Inferential Utility of Tabular Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.07837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07837
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Naive inference from synthetic data leads to high false-positive rates due to underestimated standard errors, particularly for deep generative models.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the inferential utility of synthetic data generated by different methods, comparing statistical approaches (Synthpop, Bayesian Network) with deep learning models (CTGAN, TVAE). Through a simulation study, the authors find that while synthetic data can produce unbiased estimates, standard statistical inference leads to severe underestimation of uncertainty. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for deep generative models and worsens as sample size increases, resulting in inflated type I error rates. The paper highlights the need for developing specialized statistical inference tools for synthetic data analysis.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study with 200 runs for each sample size (N = 50, 160, 500, 1600, 5000). They generate a toy dataset with five variables (age, disease stage, biomarker, therapy, death) from a known ground truth distribution. Four generative models are trained on this original data: Synthpop, Bayesian Network, CTGAN, and TVAE. Synthetic data is generated and statistical estimators (mean age and logistic regression coefficients) are applied. The authors assess bias, empirical standard error, convergence rates, and type I error rates, comparing naive standard errors with a correction factor from Raab et al. (2016).

## Key Results
- Synthetic data can produce unbiased estimates, but naive standard errors underestimate true uncertainty
- Deep generative models (CTGAN, TVAE) show progressive underestimation of standard errors as sample size grows
- Type I error rates are inflated (up to 100% for deep models at N=5000) when using naive inference
- The Raab et al. (2016) correction factor is insufficient for deep generative models due to regularization bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Standard model-based standard errors underestimate true uncertainty in synthetic data.
- Mechanism: Synthetic data generation adds extra variability because estimates are based on a predictive model, not directly on observed data. This extra uncertainty is not captured by naive SE formulas that assume direct observation.
- Core assumption: The generative model is unbiased or at least its bias does not dominate the error structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This is due to underestimation of the true SE, which worsens with larger sample sizes, particularly for deep generative models."
  - [section] "Standard statistical analysis assumes that the bias converges faster than the SE with the latter diminishing at a rate of 1/√N."
- Break condition: If the generative model is severely biased or misspecified, underestimation of SE will be compounded by systematic estimation error.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deep generative models (CTGAN, TVAE) suffer from slower convergence of SE estimates than 1/√N, leading to progressive underestimation of uncertainty as sample size grows.
- Mechanism: Regularization bias in data-adaptive (DL) techniques is optimized for prediction error, not for unbiased estimation. This bias diminishes slower than 1/√N, causing excess variability that naive SE formulas cannot capture.
- Core assumption: Convergence rates follow power laws and can be empirically estimated from simulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This is due to underestimation of the true SE, which worsens with larger sample sizes, particularly for deep generative models."
  - [section] "By contrast, the SEs produced by the more data-adaptive DL approaches converge much slower (i.e. aSE << 0.5), except for the logistic regression coefficients..."
- Break condition: If a generative model happens to produce estimates whose SE converges at 1/√N, the progressive underestimation problem disappears.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The simple multiplicative correction factor for SE (Raab et al., 2016) is insufficient for deep generative models because it does not account for regularization bias.
- Mechanism: The correction factor √(1 + M/N) only adjusts for the added variability from generating M synthetic samples from an N-sample training set. It assumes the underlying estimator is √N-consistent, which DL models violate due to slower convergence of their bias.
- Core assumption: The correction formula is derived under the assumption of √N-consistent estimators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To partially account for this added variability, we will use the following SE estimator proposed by Raab et al. (2016)... Note that this is a minimal correction since it only applies to √N-consistent estimators, hence the added variability resulting from the regularisation bias in data-adaptive techniques (i.e., DL approaches), is not accounted for."
- Break condition: If a future correction formula accounts for non-√N convergence of bias, the inadequacy of the simple factor would be resolved.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Asymptotic normality and √N-consistency of estimators.
  - Why needed here: The paper's critique hinges on violations of these assumptions when using synthetic data.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for an estimator to be √N-consistent, and why is this important for standard error formulas?

- Concept: Generative models and their bias-variance tradeoffs.
  - Why needed here: Different types of generative models (statistical vs. DL) exhibit different convergence behaviors that affect inference.
  - Quick check question: How does the bias-variance tradeoff differ between statistical models like Bayesian networks and deep generative models like GANs?

- Concept: Type I error inflation in hypothesis testing.
  - Why needed here: Underestimated standard errors lead to overconfident test statistics and higher false-positive rates.
  - Quick check question: How does underestimating the standard error of an estimator affect the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ground truth simulator -> Four generative model trainers -> Synthetic data generator -> Estimator evaluator -> Inference tester -> Correction module

- Critical path:
  1. Simulate original dataset Di^orig
  2. Train generative model G on Di^orig
  3. Generate synthetic dataset Di^synth using G
  4. Apply statistical estimator to Di^synth
  5. Aggregate results over 200 Monte Carlo runs
  6. Compute bias, SE, convergence rates, and type I error
  7. Compare naive vs. corrected SE inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model flexibility vs. inferential validity: DL models fit better but have slower SE convergence
  - Sample size matching (M = N) vs. studying the effect of synthetic data volume
  - Computational cost of 200 Monte Carlo runs vs. precision of empirical estimates

- Failure signatures:
  - Naively low type I error rates despite known underestimation of SE (indicates miscalculation)
  - SE convergence rates > 0.5 for DL models (suggests implementation error)
  - No difference between corrected and naive SE type I error for DL models (suggests correction not applied)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with only Synthpop and BN to verify that corrected SE controls type I error at nominal level
  2. Isolate CTGAN alone to confirm progressive underestimation of SE with increasing N
  3. Compare convergence rates of bias and SE for TVAE to check if bias converges slower than SE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the exact mechanism by which DL models exhibit slower convergence rates for their estimators compared to statistical approaches, and can this be quantified precisely?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DL approaches exhibit slower-than-N^(-1/2) convergence rates, but does not provide a precise explanation for this phenomenon.
- Why unresolved: The paper only states that this is due to the regularization bias inherent in DL techniques, but does not provide a detailed analysis of why this leads to slower convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed theoretical or empirical study that quantifies the convergence rates of estimators for both DL and statistical approaches, and identifies the specific factors contributing to the difference.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the standard error correction factor proposed by Raab et al. (2016) be extended to account for the additional variability introduced by DL models, particularly their slower convergence rates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the current correction factor is insufficient for DL models due to their slower convergence rates, but does not propose a solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the limitation of the current correction factor but does not provide a concrete solution or methodology for extending it to DL models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new correction factor or methodology that accounts for the slower convergence rates of DL models, validated through simulation studies or real-world applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the implications of using synthetic data generated by DL models for hypothesis testing, particularly when the convergence rates of estimators are slower than expected?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the type 1 error rates are inflated when using synthetic data, especially for DL models, but does not explore the broader implications for hypothesis testing.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the statistical properties of estimators but does not discuss the practical implications for hypothesis testing, such as the impact on the validity of statistical inferences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the impact of using synthetic data on hypothesis testing, including the development of new statistical methods or guidelines for interpreting results when using synthetic data generated by DL models.

## Limitations
- The correction factor from Raab et al. (2016) is insufficient for deep generative models but no alternative is proposed
- The study focuses on a specific toy dataset structure that may not generalize to all tabular data scenarios
- The theoretical conditions under which √N-consistency breaks down are not fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The empirical demonstration that naive inference from synthetic data leads to inflated type I error rates is robust and well-supported by the simulation results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that deep generative models specifically suffer from slower convergence of standard errors is supported but relies on the specific simulation setup and may vary with different data structures.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that this represents an insurmountable barrier for DL approaches is premature given that alternative correction methods could potentially address the convergence issue.

## Next Checks
1. Test the sensitivity of convergence rate findings to different model specifications (e.g., alternative link functions in logistic regression) to determine if the "known" case is truly robust.
2. Implement an extended correction formula that accounts for non-√N convergence rates and evaluate whether it successfully controls type I error for deep generative models.
3. Vary the synthetic-to-original data ratio (M/N) systematically to isolate the contribution of regularization bias versus sampling variability in the SE underestimation.
