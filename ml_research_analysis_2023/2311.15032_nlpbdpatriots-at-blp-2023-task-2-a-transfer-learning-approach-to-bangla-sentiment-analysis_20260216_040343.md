# nlpBDpatriots at BLP-2023 Task 2: A Transfer Learning Approach to Bangla Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.15032
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15032
- Reference count: 9
- One-line primary result: Achieved 0.71 micro F1 score (12th place) using transfer learning with data augmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a transfer learning approach for Bangla sentiment analysis in the BLP-2023 shared task. The authors investigate multiple approaches including statistical models, transformer-based models (BanglaBERT, mBERT, MuRIL, XLM-R), few-shot prompting, and ensemble methods. Their best system combines transfer learning on augmented data with a micro F1 score of 0.71, ranking 12th out of 30 teams. The study demonstrates that transfer learning and data augmentation are effective strategies for low-resource language sentiment analysis.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a multi-pronged approach to Bangla sentiment analysis. They first experimented with statistical models (Logistic Regression, SVM) and transformer-based models (BanglaBERT, mBERT, MuRIL, XLM-R). The team then implemented data augmentation by merging labels from a larger Bangla sentiment dataset (Bangla YouTube Sentiment and Emotion dataset) into their training data. Finally, they created an ensemble model combining three transformer-based models using weighted average confidence scores. The methodology emphasizes transfer learning from pre-trained models and leverages data augmentation to address the limited size of the target dataset.

## Key Results
- Best system achieved micro F1 score of 0.71 using transfer learning with data augmentation
- Ensemble of three transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, XLM-R) improved score to 0.72
- Ranked 12th out of 30 teams in the BLP-2023 shared task
- Data augmentation approach involved merging labels from Bangla YouTube Sentiment and Emotion dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning with pre-trained transformer models improves performance on low-resource Bangla sentiment analysis by leveraging knowledge from larger multilingual corpora.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models like BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-R, and MuRIL have learned general language patterns from large datasets, which can be fine-tuned on the limited Bangla sentiment data to achieve better results than training from scratch.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained models contain relevant linguistic features and patterns that transfer effectively to the target task and language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our best system for this task is a transfer learning approach with data augmentation which achieved a micro F1 score of 0.71."
  - [section] "Our initial experiments include Bangla-BERT (Kowsher et al., 2022) which is only pre-trained on bangla corpus. We finetune the model on the train set and evaluate it on the dev set with empirical hyperparameter tuning. We get 0.64 as the best micro F1 using Bangla-BERT."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus search returned no relevant citations, suggesting limited published evidence for this specific transfer learning claim in Bangla.
- Break condition: If the pre-trained models do not contain relevant linguistic features for Bangla or the target task, or if the amount of task-specific data is too limited to fine-tune effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation by merging labels from a larger Bangla sentiment dataset improves model performance by increasing training data diversity and quantity.
- Mechanism: The authors merged labels from the Bangla YouTube Sentiment and Emotion dataset (Hoq et al., 2021) with their training data, converting 5-class labels to 3-class and adding more examples to each class.
- Core assumption: The additional data from the YouTube dataset is relevant and of sufficient quality to improve the model's learning without introducing harmful noise or bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our best system for this task is a transfer learning approach with data augmentation which achieved a micro F1 score of 0.71."
  - [section] "We augment the data of the Bangla YouTube Sentiment and Emotion dataset by Hoq et al. (2021)... This is how we get three labels out of five labels and merge it with our train data. Following this procedure, we finally achieve micro F1 score of 0.71 which we this shared task's leader board."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no citations found supporting the specific data augmentation approach used.
- Break condition: If the additional data is too noisy, contains conflicting labels, or is not representative of the target domain (social media posts), it may harm performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ensemble methods combining multiple transformer models improve performance by reducing variance and leveraging complementary strengths of different architectures.
- Mechanism: The authors combined predictions from BanglaBERT, MuRIL, and XLM-R using weighted average confidence scores, achieving a micro F1 of 0.72.
- Core assumption: Different transformer models capture different aspects of the language and task, and their combination can produce more robust predictions than any single model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, an ensemble model consisting of three transformer-based models generates a superior performance over the other approaches."
  - [section] "We then find the weighted average confidence of these three models... We get a 0.72 micro F1 score by this approach."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no citations found supporting the specific ensemble approach used.
- Break condition: If the models are too similar in their strengths and weaknesses, or if their errors are highly correlated, the ensemble may not provide significant improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning and fine-tuning of pre-trained language models
  - Why needed here: The limited size of the Bangla sentiment dataset makes training a model from scratch infeasible; transfer learning allows leveraging knowledge from larger pre-trained models.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between fine-tuning and training a language model from scratch, and when is each approach appropriate?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques for NLP
  - Why needed here: The class imbalance and limited size of the dataset necessitate methods to increase data diversity and quantity without collecting new data.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential risks and benefits of merging datasets with different label schemes and domains?

- Concept: Ensemble methods in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Combining multiple models can reduce variance and improve robustness, which is crucial for handling the noise and complexity of social media text.
  - Quick check question: How do different ensemble strategies (e.g., majority voting, weighted averaging) affect model performance, and what factors should guide the choice of strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model training (statistical ML, transformers, prompting) -> Data augmentation -> Ensemble prediction
- Critical path: The most critical path is the transfer learning and data augmentation approach, which involves preprocessing the augmented data, fine-tuning the transformer models, and combining their predictions.
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of pre-trained models involves tradeoffs between language coverage (BanglaBERT vs. multilingual models), model size, and fine-tuning efficiency. Data augmentation introduces the risk of label noise or domain mismatch. The ensemble approach requires careful calibration of model weights and confidence thresholds.
- Failure signatures: Overfitting is a major concern, especially with limited data and complex transformer models. Class imbalance may lead to poor performance on minority classes. Data augmentation may introduce noise or bias if the additional data is not carefully selected and processed.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune BanglaBERT on the training data with different learning rates and batch sizes to find the optimal configuration.
  2. Experiment with different data augmentation strategies, such as back-translation or synonym replacement, to increase data diversity.
  3. Compare the performance of different transformer models (e.g., BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-R) on a held-out validation set to identify the best base model for the ensemble.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of transformer models compare to statistical models in handling the imbalanced nature of the dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the dataset is imbalanced across the labels and mentions the performance of both statistical models (Logistic Regression and SVM) and transformer-based models (mBERT, BanglaBERT, MuRIL, XLM-R).
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides F1 scores for both types of models, it does not explicitly analyze or discuss how each model type handles the class imbalance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis comparing the precision, recall, and F1 scores for each class across statistical and transformer models, focusing on their ability to handle imbalanced data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of text length on the performance of sentiment analysis models for Bangla social media posts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper includes an error analysis section that discusses the performance of models based on text length, indicating that different lengths have varying F1 scores.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides some insights into how text length affects performance but does not explore the underlying reasons or propose methods to mitigate issues related to varying text lengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: An in-depth study exploring why certain text lengths perform better or worse, possibly including experiments with text length normalization or other preprocessing techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective is the ensemble approach in improving sentiment analysis performance compared to individual transformer models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes an ensemble approach combining BanglaBERT, MuRIL, and XLM-R, which achieved a micro F1 score of 0.72, higher than individual models.
- Why unresolved: While the ensemble approach shows improvement, the paper does not delve into why this approach is more effective or how it could be optimized further.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the ensemble method, including experiments with different combinations of models, weights, and confidence intervals to determine the optimal configuration.

## Limitations

- The modest improvement (micro F1 of 0.71) suggests that fundamental challenges of limited training data for low-resource languages remain significant.
- The data augmentation approach merges labels from YouTube content, introducing potential domain mismatch with social media posts.
- The ensemble approach, while improving results slightly, requires careful calibration and may not generalize well to different datasets or languages.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The general effectiveness of transfer learning for Bangla sentiment analysis is well-established, with the performance improvements over baseline statistical models being clear and replicable.
- Medium Confidence: The specific data augmentation approach and its impact on performance are reasonably supported, though the domain transfer from YouTube data to social media posts introduces some uncertainty.
- Medium Confidence: The ensemble method's contribution to performance improvement is demonstrated, but the optimal combination strategy may be sensitive to the specific models and datasets used.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Data Augmentation:** Systematically test the impact of different augmentation strategies (including no augmentation) to isolate the contribution of the YouTube dataset merging approach.

2. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Evaluate the trained models on a held-out set of pure social media posts to assess how well the YouTube-augmented models generalize to the target domain.

3. **Alternative Ensemble Strategies:** Compare weighted averaging with other ensemble methods (majority voting, stacking) to determine if the performance gain is robust to the combination approach.
