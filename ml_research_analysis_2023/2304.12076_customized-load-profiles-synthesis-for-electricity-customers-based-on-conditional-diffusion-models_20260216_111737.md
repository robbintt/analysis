# Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.12076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12076
- Reference count: 32
- One-line primary result: Proposed conditional diffusion model achieves 9% forecasting accuracy improvement over federated learning baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing customized electricity load profiles for individual customers. The method addresses data scarcity and privacy concerns in smart grid applications by generating high-quality synthetic data that captures customer-specific consumption patterns. The approach combines a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers and attention mechanisms, conditioned on historical load data and target dates. Experimental results on the Low Carbon London dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks in both data generation and augmentation scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method uses conditional diffusion models to generate customer-specific load profiles by incorporating historical load data and target dates as conditioning variables. The core architecture consists of a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers and attention mechanisms to accurately predict and remove noise during the reverse diffusion process. Customer data is encrypted using lattice-based cryptography before transmission to ensure privacy. The model is trained on aggregated data from multiple customers and can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to their load characteristics and application demands.

## Key Results
- Achieves RMSE of 0.9806 kW compared to 1.1694-1.5584 kW for benchmark models
- Improves MMD metric to 0.4092 compared to 0.4759-0.5727 for baselines
- Enhances load forecasting accuracy by up to 9% compared to federated learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conditional diffusion models can generate customer-specific load profiles by incorporating historical load and target date information.
- Mechanism: The model uses conditional reverse diffusion where noise prediction depends on both the noisy data and the conditioning variables (historical load, target date). This allows the model to condition generation on customer-specific patterns.
- Core assumption: The customer's load characteristics are captured sufficiently by their historical data and the target date.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "extend traditional diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to the customer's load characteristics and application demands"
  - [section]: "conditional information needs to be added to the load profiles synthesis process as target guidance"
- Break condition: If customer load patterns are highly non-stationary or if historical data is insufficient to capture relevant patterns, the conditioning may not generalize well.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stacked residual layers with attention mechanisms enable accurate noise estimation for the reverse diffusion process.
- Mechanism: The architecture processes the noisy input through multiple residual blocks, each with attention layers that extract temporal dependencies. Skip connections aggregate information across layers for final noise prediction.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in load profiles are complex but can be effectively captured by attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "design a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles"
  - [section]: "we design a deep learning model based on the attention mechanism and residual connection to predict the noises that are added to the original data during the diffusion process"
- Break condition: If the temporal dependencies are too long-range for the model's receptive field, or if the attention mechanism fails to capture relevant patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lattice-based cryptosystem ensures secure transmission of load data without compromising privacy.
- Mechanism: Each entity has public/private key pairs. Data is encrypted with the recipient's public key before transmission and decrypted with the private key, ensuring only the intended recipient can access the data.
- Core assumption: Lattice-based cryptography provides sufficient security against quantum computing threats while maintaining practical performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we adopt the Lattice-based cryptosystem to protect data security [20]. This cryptosystem is constructed based on the NP-hard problem of lattice, and it can therefore ensure the security of the encryption algorithm and even resist quantum computers"
- Break condition: If the computational overhead of encryption/decryption becomes prohibitive, or if implementation vulnerabilities exist.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and the forward/reverse diffusion process
  - Why needed here: The core generation mechanism relies on understanding how noise is progressively added and removed
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the forward diffusion process in diffusion models?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and temporal dependency extraction
  - Why needed here: The noise estimation model uses attention to capture complex temporal patterns in load profiles
  - Quick check question: How does multi-head self-attention help in extracting temporal features from sequential data?

- Concept: Conditional generation and conditioning variables
  - Why needed here: The model must understand how to incorporate customer-specific information (historical data, target date) into the generation process
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between unconditional and conditional diffusion models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Customer -> Encrypted Data Upload -> Server -> Global Conditional Diffusion Model -> Synthetic Profile Generation -> Encrypted Results -> Customer

- Critical path:
  1. Customer encrypts and uploads historical data to server
  2. Server trains conditional diffusion model on aggregated data
  3. Customer requests synthetic profiles with specific conditions
  4. Server generates profiles using conditional diffusion and returns encrypted results
  5. Customer decrypts and uses synthetic profiles

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. generation quality: More residual layers improve accuracy but increase computation
  - Encryption strength vs. performance: Stronger cryptography provides better security but may slow data transmission
  - Data aggregation vs. personalization: More aggregated data improves model quality but may dilute individual customer patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor generation quality: High RMSE/MAE, MMD values; synthetic profiles don't match real patterns
  - Security vulnerabilities: Decryption failures, unauthorized access to data
  - Performance bottlenecks: Slow training/inference times, high computational costs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test unconditional diffusion model generation on a single customer's data to establish baseline performance
  2. Implement conditional generation with simple conditioning (e.g., only target date) and compare to baseline
  3. Add full conditioning (historical data + target date) and measure improvement in generation quality metrics

## Next Checks

1. Implement ablation experiments to isolate the performance contribution of attention mechanisms versus residual connections in the noise estimation model

3. Test model generalization on out-of-distribution scenarios (e.g., customers with atypical load patterns or missing historical data)
