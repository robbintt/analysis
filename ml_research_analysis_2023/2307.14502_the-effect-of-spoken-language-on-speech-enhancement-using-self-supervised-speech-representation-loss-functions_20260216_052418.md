# The Effect of Spoken Language on Speech Enhancement using Self-Supervised Speech Representation Loss Functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.14502
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14502
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Language match between SSSR training and SE training has minor effect on SE performance; dataset size is more important

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how the spoken language affects speech enhancement when using self-supervised speech representation (SSSR) models as loss functions. The authors create multilingual datasets based on CommonVoice and DEMAND noise, covering English, Spanish, and Welsh. They train speech enhancement models using various SSSR representations (HuBERT, mHuBERT, XLSR) as loss functions, along with traditional spectrogram and time-domain losses. Results show that the language of the SSSR model has a minor effect on enhancement performance, while the amount of training data significantly impacts results. The study finds that HuBERT and mHuBERT perform similarly, with mHuBERT slightly outperforming in most cases, while XLSR shows mixed results despite being trained on the most diverse data.

## Method Summary
The authors create multilingual CommonVoice-DEMAND datasets by selecting clean audio from CommonVoice for English, Spanish, and Welsh, then artificially corrupting with DEMAND noise. They train speech enhancement models using SSSR-derived loss functions (HuBERT, mHuBERT, XLSR, WavLM) on these language-specific datasets, plus baseline models with spectrogram, STOI, and SISDR losses. All models are evaluated on English, Spanish, and Welsh test sets using PESQ, STOI, and Composite metrics. The study compares enhancement performance across different languages and SSSR models to determine the impact of language match and training data quantity.

## Key Results
- Language match between SSSR training and SE training has minor effect on enhancement performance
- The amount of training data for a particular language greatly affects speech enhancement performance
- HuBERT and mHuBERT perform similarly, with mHuBERT slightly outperforming in most cases
- XLSR shows mixed results despite being trained on the most diverse data
- SSSR-based loss functions generally outperform traditional spectrogram and time-domain loss functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The language match between SSSR training data and SE training data has a minor effect on SE performance.
- Mechanism: SSSR models encode phonetic and acoustic patterns that are largely language-independent when trained on diverse data, so the exact language match is not critical for SE loss function effectiveness.
- Core assumption: Phonetic and acoustic patterns captured by SSSR models generalize across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It is found that the training language of the self-supervised representation appears to have a minor effect on enhancement performance"
  - [section] "Interestingly, all SSSR loss function models trained using Spanish audio perform better on the Welsh testset than those trained on the English audio. This is despite the fact that Welsh is lexically more similar to English than Spanish"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on general SSSR use in SE but do not directly address language generalization
- Break condition: If SSSR models capture highly language-specific phonetic patterns that do not transfer across languages, then language match would become critical.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The amount of training data for a particular language in the SSSR model is more important than language match for SE performance.
- Mechanism: Larger training datasets provide more diverse phonetic and acoustic examples, leading to better generalization of SSSR representations regardless of language match.
- Core assumption: Diverse training data improves SSSR model quality and generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the amount of training data of a particular language, however, greatly affects performance"
  - [section] "XLSR, despite being trained on the most diverse data, shows mixed results" - suggesting that diversity helps but is not sufficient alone
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not directly address dataset size impact
- Break condition: If SSSR models overfit to their training language and cannot generalize from diverse data, then dataset size would be less important.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The specific self-supervised learning objective (BERT-style vs contrastive masking) affects the suitability of SSSR representations for speech enhancement tasks.
- Mechanism: Different training objectives capture different aspects of speech - BERT-style objectives may better preserve speech quality while contrastive objectives may better isolate background noise.
- Core assumption: Different SSSR training objectives encode different speech characteristics that are useful for different aspects of speech enhancement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "HuBERT and mHuBERT perform similarly, with mHuBERT slightly outperforming in most cases. XLSR, despite being trained on the most diverse data, shows mixed results"
  - [section] "Overall, these results suggest that the BERT style training objective HuBERT, mHuBERT and WavLM might make them better suited as loss function feature representations when signal quality is the main concern as shown by the high PESQ and CSIG scores while the contrastive feature encoding masking objective of XLSR makes it more suitable if the objective of the enhancement is background noise reduction at the cost of additional speech distortion as the higher CBAK scores of the XLSR models demonstrates"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on general SSSR use but do not compare training objectives
- Break condition: If all SSSR training objectives capture similar speech characteristics, then the choice of objective would not matter for SE performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SSSR models work and what they capture is essential for interpreting why language match has minimal effect on SE performance
  - Quick check question: What are the two main stages of SSSR models and what do they output?

- Concept: Speech enhancement loss functions
  - Why needed here: Knowing how SSSR representations are used as loss functions in SE training helps explain the experimental setup and results
  - Quick check question: How is the SSSR-based loss function defined in terms of the feature encoder outputs?

- Concept: Multilingual speech datasets and their characteristics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the properties of CommonVoice and DEMAND datasets is crucial for interpreting the experimental design and results across different languages
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between VoiceBank-DEMAND and CommonVoice-DEMAND datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SSSR model (GFE feature encoder + GOL output layer) → SE model (BLSTM layers + linear layers) → loss function (MSE between enhanced and clean SSSR representations) → training process
- Critical path: Data preparation → SSSR model selection → SE model training with SSSR-based loss → evaluation across languages
- Design tradeoffs: Language-specific vs language-agnostic SE models, dataset size vs language diversity in SSSR training, different SSSR training objectives
- Failure signatures: Poor SE performance on non-training languages, overfitting to specific languages, sensitivity to SSSR model choice
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SE models with HuBERT-based loss on English data and evaluate on English, Spanish, and Welsh test sets
  2. Train SE models with mHuBERT-based loss on Spanish data and evaluate on English, Spanish, and Welsh test sets
  3. Train SE models with XLSR-based loss on English data and evaluate on English, Spanish, and Welsh test sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the amount of training data for the self-supervised speech representation model affect its performance as a loss function in speech enhancement across different languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the amount of training data of a particular language, however, greatly affects performance" and notes that XLSR, trained on the most English speech data, performs worse than mHuBERT.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions that training data amount affects performance, it doesn't provide a detailed analysis of how varying amounts of data for different languages impact the effectiveness of the SSSR as a loss function.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments training SSSR models with varying amounts of data for different languages and evaluating their performance as loss functions in speech enhancement across multiple languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the specific self-supervised learning objective (e.g., BERT-style vs. contrastive masking) impact the effectiveness of the SSSR as a loss function in speech enhancement?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that "training objective and amount of training data has a greater effect" than language, and notes differences in performance between models trained with different objectives (HuBERT/mHuBERT vs. XLSR).
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that the training objective is important but doesn't provide a detailed comparison of different objectives' effectiveness in speech enhancement tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments training SSSR models with different learning objectives and evaluating their performance as loss functions in speech enhancement across multiple languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of self-supervised speech representation model impact speech enhancement performance across languages with varying degrees of similarity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests models across English, Spanish, and Welsh, noting that all SSSR models perform better on their respective training languages, but doesn't explore performance across a broader range of language similarities.
- Why unresolved: The study only covers three languages with varying degrees of similarity to English, leaving questions about performance across a wider range of language families and similarities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training and testing SSSR-based speech enhancement models across a diverse set of languages from different families and with varying degrees of similarity to the training languages.

## Limitations
- The study uses artificially corrupted speech data rather than real-world recordings, which may not fully capture the complexities of actual noise conditions
- The evaluation only considers three languages, limiting generalizability to other language families
- The analysis focuses on average performance metrics without detailed examination of individual speech samples or failure cases

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The finding that language match has minor effect on SE performance, supported by consistent results across multiple language pairs
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim about dataset size being more important than language match, as the evidence is mostly correlational
- **Medium Confidence:** The comparative performance of different SSSR models, as results show mixed patterns that could be influenced by implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Test the trained models on real-world noisy speech recordings to validate performance beyond artificial corruption
2. Expand the language coverage to include typologically diverse languages (e.g., Mandarin, Arabic) to test generalization claims
3. Conduct ablation studies varying dataset sizes systematically while controlling for language diversity to better isolate the impact of training data quantity
