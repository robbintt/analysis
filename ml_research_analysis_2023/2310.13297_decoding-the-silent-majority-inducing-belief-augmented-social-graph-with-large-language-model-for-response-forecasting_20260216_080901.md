# Decoding the Silent Majority: Inducing Belief Augmented Social Graph with Large Language Model for Response Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13297
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13297
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: SocialSense achieves up to 11.26% higher accuracy in sentiment polarity prediction for lurker users compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SocialSense, a novel framework for automatic response forecasting on news media that leverages a belief-augmented social graph induced by a large language model. The key innovation is capturing social dynamics and user beliefs by constructing a heterogeneous graph that connects users with similar values, even if they are distant in the explicit social network. The framework extracts latent user personas using ChatGPT, builds a belief-centered network, and propagates information to forecast responses. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both zero-shot and supervised response forecasting.

## Method Summary
SocialSense is a three-stage framework for response forecasting that uses LLM-extracted user personas to construct a belief-augmented social graph. First, ChatGPT extracts latent personas from user profiles and historical posts. Second, a heterogeneous graph is built connecting users, news items, and belief nodes based on Schwartz Theory of Basic Values and Moral Foundations Theory. Third, information propagates through this graph using HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer) to predict sentiment polarity and intensity. The framework operates in both zero-shot mode using only social context and supervised mode with historical response data.

## Key Results
- SocialSense outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both zero-shot and supervised response forecasting
- Up to 11.26% higher accuracy in sentiment polarity prediction for lurker users
- 44.6% of users share beliefs with others at least two hops away in the network
- Belief nodes improve performance by 1.91% in correlations and 4.83% in F1 scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bridging distant users with similar beliefs improves response forecasting by capturing implicit communities
- Mechanism: The belief-augmented graph connects users who share values but are geographically distant in the explicit social network, enabling information propagation across communities
- Core assumption: Users with similar beliefs respond to similar news in similar ways, even if they are not directly connected in the social network
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings reveal that a significant portion (over 44.6%) of users in the network data we collected for our experiment share beliefs with other users who are at least two hops away in the network."
  - [section 3.2] "This finding highlights the potential value of bridging these distant users and incorporating their beliefs as valuable features in response forecasting."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus doesn't directly address this mechanism, but related papers on graph neural networks support the general approach of leveraging network structure
- Break condition: If user beliefs don't significantly influence their response patterns, or if the LLM fails to accurately extract belief attributes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating social context through LLM-based persona extraction improves zero-shot response forecasting
- Mechanism: ChatGPT extracts latent user personas from profiles and historical posts, capturing internal beliefs that influence future responses beyond just past utterances
- Core assumption: Large language models can effectively extract meaningful user attributes from text that predict future behavior
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach consists of three stages: (1) extracting latent personas using a Large Language Model, (2) constructing a belief-centered network on top of the existing social network, and (3) information propagation."
  - [section 3.1] "In this initial stage of our framework, we design a prompt Pl that enables us to extract latent information not available anywhere online."
  - [corpus] Weak - while the corpus mentions LLM applications, it doesn't specifically validate this mechanism

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Heterogeneous graph structure with belief nodes improves model performance compared to homogeneous social graphs
- Mechanism: The belief-centered graph includes user-user, user-news, and user-belief edges, creating a richer representation than just social connections or user-news interactions alone
- Core assumption: Belief nodes serve as effective intermediaries that connect users with similar values, improving information flow and prediction accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The SOCIAL SENSE framework consists of three key stages: (1) inducing latent user personas using the Large Language Model (e.g., ChatGPT), (2) building a belief-centered network on top of the existing social network, and (3) propagating information across multiple levels."
  - [section 3.2] "This connection type offers two key benefits. Firstly, it introduces shortcuts between users who share similar beliefs or mindsets, facilitating the propagation of information across distant nodes."
  - [section 4.4] "To assess the effectiveness of the Belief-Centered Graph... we conduct an experiment where we removed the belief nodes... This leads to a decrease of 1.91% in correlations and 4.83% in F1 scores."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their application to heterogeneous graphs
  - Why needed here: The model uses HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer) to propagate information across the belief-augmented social network
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs, and why is HGT specifically suited for this task?

- Concept: Large Language Model prompting and zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on carefully designed prompts for both persona extraction and response prediction
  - Quick check question: How do different prompt structures (Pl, Ps, Pp) serve different purposes in the pipeline?

- Concept: Belief representation and moral foundations theory
  - Why needed here: The framework uses Schwartz Theory of Basic Values and Moral Foundations Theory to define belief nodes
  - Quick check question: What are the five moral foundations and ten human values used to construct belief nodes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data ingestion: User profiles, historical posts, social network data, news headlines
  - LLM module: ChatGPT for persona extraction and social prompting
  - Graph construction: Belief-augmented heterogeneous graph with user-user, user-news, and user-belief edges
  - GNN module: HGT for information propagation
  - Prediction head: MLP with softmax for sentiment classification
  - Evaluation: Correlation metrics for intensity, F1 scores for polarity

- Critical path:
  1. Extract latent personas using LLM (Section 3.1)
  2. Construct belief-augmented social graph (Section 3.2)
  3. Initialize node representations and propagate information using HGT (Section 3.3)
  4. Make predictions using MLP classifier

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Belief nodes vs. direct user-user connections: Belief nodes provide shortcuts but add complexity
  - LLM extraction vs. direct feature use: LLM captures deeper attributes but introduces potential noise
  - Zero-shot vs. supervised: Zero-shot is more general but less accurate than supervised learning

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on unseen users: Graph construction or propagation may not generalize
  - LLM extraction failures: Persona extraction may miss key attributes or introduce noise
  - Belief node irrelevance: If beliefs don't strongly correlate with responses, the augmented graph adds little value

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test belief extraction accuracy by sampling and manually evaluating LLM output
  2. Evaluate performance degradation when removing belief nodes from the graph
  3. Compare zero-shot vs. supervised performance across different user types (lurkers vs. active users)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the belief-augmented social graphs generalize to other domains beyond news media response forecasting, such as product reviews or social media discourse?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that exploring the application of belief-augmented social networks in other domains is a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the framework on a news media dataset and does not explore its generalizability to other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the framework to datasets from other domains, such as product reviews or social media discourse, and comparing the performance to domain-specific baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective social prompting strategies for leveraging large language models in zero-shot response forecasting tasks beyond the simulated information propagation approach proposed in this paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that developing an effective social prompting strategy for general-purpose applications is a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper only proposes one social prompting strategy and does not compare it to other potential approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different social prompting strategies, such as using different types of social context information or different prompt formats, and evaluating their impact on zero-shot response forecasting performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the belief-augmented social graph framework be adapted to handle dynamically evolving social networks where user beliefs and interactions change over time?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that investigating how response forecasting models can adapt efficiently to dynamically evolving data is a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the issue of handling dynamic social networks and how the framework would adapt to changes in user beliefs and interactions over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the framework's performance on datasets that capture the evolution of social networks over time, and comparing it to baseline approaches that handle dynamic networks.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness heavily depends on the quality of LLM's belief extraction and accuracy of belief-augmented graph construction
- The specific mechanisms by which the belief-augmented graph improves performance, particularly for zero-shot learning, need more detailed investigation
- Performance improvements depend on the specific belief nodes chosen, and different belief taxonomies might yield different results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general framework design and experimental methodology are well-specified and reproducible. The comparative performance gains over baseline methods are clearly demonstrated.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that bridging distant users with similar beliefs improves forecasting accuracy is supported by evidence but requires further validation across different datasets and topics.
- **Low confidence**: The specific mechanisms by which the belief-augmented graph improves performance, particularly for zero-shot learning, need more detailed investigation into how information propagates through the graph structure.

## Next Checks
1. Manually sample and evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT's extracted user personas and beliefs to quantify potential noise or inaccuracies in the belief graph construction
2. Beyond removing belief nodes, systematically test the impact of removing different edge types (user-user, user-news, user-belief) to understand which connections drive the performance improvements
3. Test the framework's performance across different news categories and user communities to validate whether the belief-augmented approach generalizes beyond the specific dataset used in the experiments
