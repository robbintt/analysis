# Topological Data Mapping of Online Hate Speech, Misinformation, and General Mental Health: A Large Language Model Based Study

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.13098
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13098
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Key outcome**: Hate speech posts closely matched language patterns in communities for Cluster B personality disorders (Narcissistic, Borderline, Antisocial) and Schizoid Personality Disorder, while misinformation posts showed weaker psychiatric disorder associations.

## Executive Summary
This study uses large language models and topological data analysis to examine connections between online hate speech, misinformation, and psychiatric disorders. Reddit posts from 54 communities were converted into 1536-dimensional embeddings using GPT-3, then classified and analyzed. Zero-shot classification revealed that hate speech posts closely matched language patterns in communities for Cluster B personality disorders and Schizoid Personality Disorder, while misinformation posts showed weaker psychiatric disorder associations. Topological data analysis revealed that psychiatric disorder communities formed a connected cluster closely linked to hate speech but largely separate from control communities, supporting the classification results and suggesting a spectrum of similarity to hate speech across disorders.

## Method Summary
The study collected 1000 posts each from 54 Reddit communities (37 psychiatric disorder communities, 14 hate speech/misinformation communities, 3 control communities). Individual posts were embedded using GPT-3's text-embedding-ada-002 model to create 1536-dimensional vectors. These embeddings were then aggregated to create distilled embeddings for each community. Zero-shot classification was performed by computing cosine similarity between individual post embeddings and community embeddings. Finally, topological data analysis using the Mapper algorithm visualized the global structure of the embedding space, revealing connected clusters of psychiatric disorder and hate speech communities.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot classification showed hate speech posts closely matched language patterns in Cluster B personality disorder communities (Narcissistic, Borderline, Antisocial) and Schizoid Personality Disorder
- Misinformation posts showed weaker associations with psychiatric disorder communities compared to hate speech
- Topological data analysis revealed psychiatric disorder communities formed a connected cluster closely linked to hate speech but largely separate from control communities
- The mapping revealed a spectrum of similarity to hate speech across psychiatric disorders

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-3 embeddings capture semantic similarities between online text and psychiatric disorder communities that traditional text analysis misses.
- Mechanism: GPT-3's transformer architecture learns high-dimensional contextual embeddings (1536D) that encode nuanced semantic patterns, allowing subtle linguistic similarities to be detected via vector distance even without explicit training labels.
- Core assumption: The semantic content of Reddit posts reflects underlying psychological states, and these patterns are preserved in the embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then utilized OpenAI’s GPT3 to derive embeddings of these posts, which are high-dimensional real-numbered vectors that presumably represent the hidden semantics of posts."
  - [section] "Zero-shot classification showed that hate speech posts closely matched language patterns in communities for Cluster B personality disorders... suggesting a spectrum of similarity to hate speech across disorders."
  - [corpus] Weak - only mentions transformers in the context of LLMs generally, not specific embedding mechanics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) using Mapper reveals hidden global structure in high-dimensional embedding space that linear methods miss.
- Mechanism: TDA projects 1536D embeddings into 2D via PCA, then segments and clusters the data into overlapping covers. This preserves nonlinear relationships, allowing visualization of connected regions (e.g., psychiatric disorders ↔ hate speech) without forcing linear separability.
- Core assumption: The global shape of the embedding space contains meaningful clusters that correspond to psychiatric and hate speech communities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, a topological data analysis (TDA) was applied to the embeddings to obtain a visual map connecting online hate speech, misinformation, various psychiatric disorders, and general mental health."
  - [section] "TDA mapping... revealed that psychiatric disorder communities formed a connected cluster closely linked to hate speech but largely separate from control communities."
  - [corpus] Missing - no neighbor papers discuss TDA or Mapper.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot classification using GPT-3 embeddings can identify relationships between unlabeled hate speech/misinformation and psychiatric disorder communities without needing labeled training data.
- Mechanism: By computing cosine similarity between the embedding of a test post and the embeddings of labeled communities, the model assigns the test post to the closest community class, even if that class was never explicitly trained on the test data.
- Core assumption: The embedding space is sufficiently structured that communities of the same type cluster together, enabling zero-shot inference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then performed various machine-learning classifications based on these embeddings in order to understand the role of hate speech/misinformation in various communities."
  - [section] "Zero-shot classification... revealed that hate speech posts closely matched language patterns in communities for Cluster B personality disorders."
  - [corpus] Weak - no neighbor papers explicitly describe zero-shot classification on psychiatric disorder embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: High-dimensional vector embeddings and cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: The study relies on measuring semantic similarity between Reddit posts and community embeddings in 1536D space.
  - Quick check question: If two embeddings have cosine similarity 0.9, are they more or less similar than two with similarity 0.3?

- Concept: Topological Data Analysis (Mapper algorithm)
  - Why needed here: TDA is used to visualize the global structure of the embedding space and reveal connected clusters of psychiatric disorder and hate speech communities.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of overlapping covers in Mapper?

- Concept: Zero-shot classification
  - Why needed here: The study classifies hate speech and misinformation embeddings without training on those labels, relying on similarity to known community embeddings.
  - Quick check question: How does zero-shot classification differ from traditional supervised classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → Embedding generation (GPT-3) → Distilled vs. IUP embeddings → Zero-shot classification → TDA (Mapper) → Results interpretation
- Critical path: Embedding generation → Zero-shot classification (requires both distilled and IUP embeddings) → TDA (requires distilled embeddings only)
- Design tradeoffs: Using distilled embeddings reduces individual speech pattern noise but may lose some granularity; using IUP embeddings preserves individual nuance but introduces noise.
- Failure signatures: High misclassification in zero-shot classification suggests embeddings don't preserve semantic distinctions; TDA producing a single node indicates loss of structure.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate distilled embeddings for a small set of known psychiatric and control communities; run zero-shot classification to verify basic separability.
  2. Compare zero-shot classification accuracy using IUP vs. distilled embeddings as training data on the same test set.
  3. Run TDA on a mixed dataset of psychiatric, hate speech, and control distilled embeddings to confirm expected clustering patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Do individuals with confirmed psychiatric diagnoses exhibit speech patterns similar to those observed in the Reddit communities used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that results are based on Reddit communities rather than confirmed diagnoses and suggests this is a key limitation.
  - Why unresolved: The study used self-identified communities as proxies for psychiatric disorders, which may not accurately represent the speech patterns of individuals with actual diagnoses.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of speech patterns from individuals with clinically confirmed diagnoses of the relevant psychiatric disorders.

- **Question**: What is the causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and engagement with hate speech or misinformation - do disorders increase vulnerability to such content, or does exposure to such content influence the development of disorder-like speech patterns?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The matter of the directionality of the relationship is not established" and poses this exact question in the discussion.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking individuals' exposure to hate speech/misinformation and subsequent changes in mental health or speech patterns, or interventions targeting one domain and measuring effects on the other.

- **Question**: How would the results differ if embeddings were collected from social media platforms with different user demographics than Reddit?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "Reddit was the only social media site we drew from; other sites may have different user demographics, and potentially different results."
  - Why unresolved: The study only used Reddit data, limiting generalizability to other platforms with potentially different user populations and community norms.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the study using the same methodology on other social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or specialized forums.

## Limitations
- The study relies on Reddit communities as proxies for psychiatric disorders rather than clinically confirmed diagnoses, potentially limiting generalizability to actual psychiatric populations.
- The specific mechanisms by which GPT-3 embeddings encode psychological states remain unclear, raising questions about the interpretability of the semantic similarities.
- The causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and engagement with hate speech/misinformation is not established, as the study only examines correlational patterns.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general finding that hate speech posts show linguistic similarities to Cluster B personality disorder communities
- Medium confidence: The specific clustering patterns revealed by TDA, given the parameter sensitivity
- Low confidence: The causal interpretation that these linguistic similarities reflect underlying psychiatric conditions rather than shared discourse patterns

## Next Checks
1. **Embedding validation**: Test whether GPT-3 embeddings from the same community remain stable across different time periods and collection methods, using cosine similarity thresholds to establish reliability
2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary TDA parameters (cover size, overlap percentage, clustering thresholds) to determine which structural features persist across configurations
3. **Cross-validation of classification**: Split communities into training and test sets to verify that zero-shot classification performance generalizes beyond the specific dataset used, comparing accuracy rates across different psychiatric disorder categories
