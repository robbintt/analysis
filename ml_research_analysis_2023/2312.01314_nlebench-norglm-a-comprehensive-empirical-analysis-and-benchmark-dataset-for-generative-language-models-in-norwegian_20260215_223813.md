# NLEBench+NorGLM: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis and Benchmark Dataset for Generative Language Models in Norwegian

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2312.01314
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01314
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Norwegian-specific models outperform English models on Norwegian tasks, with smaller models demonstrating reasoning capability through Chain-of-Thought prompting.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents NLEBench+NorGLM, a comprehensive benchmark and suite of generative language models for Norwegian. The authors compiled existing Norwegian datasets and trained four Norwegian Open Language Models (NorGLM) with varying parameter scales and architectures. They developed NLEBench, a benchmark for evaluating natural language generation capabilities in Norwegian, including translation and human annotation tasks. The study reveals that GPT-3.5 has limited understanding of Norwegian context, increasing model parameter scales shows limited impact on downstream task performance when pre-training data is constrained, smaller models can demonstrate reasoning capability through Chain-of-Thought, and multi-task datasets can verify LLM generalizability and interconnectedness of NLP tasks. The authors open-sourced their resources and code under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

## Method Summary
The study involves training four Norwegian Open Language Models (NorGLM) with different parameter scales (369M, 3B, 23B) and architectures (GPT2, Llama) from scratch on Norwegian data. The pre-training corpus includes Norwegian National Library, Schibsted news, OSCAR, mC4, Twitter, Reddit, and related language sources. The models are fine-tuned on downstream tasks including summarization, conversation, and NLU. Evaluation uses automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, MAUVE, perplexity, Entailment score, toxicity scores, bias measurements) and explores Chain-of-Thought effects on multi-task learning. The benchmark suite NLEBench includes datasets for story generation, conversational AI, summarization, question answering, and natural language understanding tasks.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5 demonstrates limited understanding of Norwegian context compared to Norwegian-specific models
- Increasing model parameter scales shows limited impact on downstream task performance when pre-training data is constrained
- Smaller models (369M) can demonstrate reasoning capability through Chain-of-Thought prompting
- Multi-task datasets can verify LLM generalizability and interconnectedness of NLP tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Training from scratch on Norwegian data is more effective than continuing to train an English model for low-resource languages.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns language-specific patterns, cultural nuances, and expressions that are absent or underrepresented in English-centric pre-training.
- **Core assumption:** The Norwegian corpus contains sufficient diversity and quality to enable robust language modeling from scratch.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We build upon the pioneering work to develop a series of fundamental Norwegian Generative Language Models (NorGLMs) with different parameter scales and Transformer-based architectures."
  - [section] "We trained several models based on the GPT2 architecture at different scales... We also trained a three billion-parameter model based on Llama architecture (NorLlama-3B) using Tencent Pre-training Framework."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus shows only related Norwegian papers; no direct evidence of Norwegian training data quality or coverage.
- **Break condition:** If the Norwegian corpus lacks sufficient diversity, the model may fail to generalize or capture essential language features.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Oversampling high-quality data improves model performance on specific downstream tasks.
- **Mechanism:** By increasing the representation of certain data types (e.g., news articles), the model develops stronger capabilities in related tasks.
- **Core assumption:** The quality and relevance of the oversampled data directly influence downstream task performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We find that: ... increasing model parameter scales demonstrates limited impact on the performance of downstream tasks when the pre-training dataset is constrained in size."
  - [section] "We continue training NorGPT-3B (NorGPT-3B-c) on a selection of relatively high quality data including news articles and data from Nasjonalbiblioteket."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus shows only related Norwegian papers; no direct evidence of data oversampling strategy.
- **Break condition:** If the oversampled data is not representative of the target task distribution, performance gains may be limited or even detrimental.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can improve model performance on complex tasks, even for smaller models.
- **Mechanism:** CoT provides a structured approach to problem-solving, allowing the model to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
- **Core assumption:** The model has sufficient knowledge and reasoning capability to benefit from CoT, regardless of its size.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "smaller models also demonstrate the reasoning capability through Chain-of-Thought."
  - [section] "we mainly explored two tasks using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method: based on the given news article, 1) whether document-grounded question answering (Q&A) can improve the model's ability to generate summaries."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus shows only related Norwegian papers; no direct evidence of CoT implementation or results.
- **Break condition:** If the model lacks sufficient knowledge or reasoning ability, CoT may not lead to improved performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Transformer-based architectures
  - **Why needed here:** The paper focuses on training Norwegian language models using Transformer-based architectures, which are the foundation of modern language models like GPT and Llama.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the key components of a Transformer model (e.g., self-attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward layers)?

- **Concept:** Fine-tuning vs. training from scratch
  - **Why needed here:** The paper compares the performance of models trained from scratch on Norwegian data with models that are continued-trained from English models.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning a pre-trained model versus training a model from scratch for a low-resource language?

- **Concept:** Evaluation metrics for language models
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses various evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, MAUVE, Entailment score) to assess the performance of Norwegian language models on different tasks.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the purpose of each evaluation metric and how it measures different aspects of language model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pre-training (Norwegian corpus) -> Model training (NorGLM suite) -> Fine-tuning (downstream tasks) -> Evaluation (NLEBench benchmark)
- **Critical path:** Pre-training phase determines the foundation of language models; quality and diversity of pre-training data directly impact downstream task performance
- **Design tradeoffs:** Model size vs. pre-training data size; larger models require more data but smaller models can be more efficient for specific tasks with limited data
- **Failure signatures:** Poor generalization on downstream tasks if pre-training data is insufficient or unrepresentative; overfitting if fine-tuning is not carefully designed
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train NorGPT-369M from scratch on Norwegian corpus and evaluate on text generation task
  2. Continue-train GPT-2 on Norwegian corpus and compare performance with model trained from scratch
  3. Fine-tune Norwegian models on summarization task and evaluate using ROUGE, BLEU, and MAUVE metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the correlation between a model's performance on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its original task performance hold across different low-resource languages beyond Norwegian?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a potential correlation between model performance on CoT and original tasks but notes the need for empirical and theoretical proof of generalizability.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to Norwegian, and the authors explicitly state that further research is needed to determine if this correlation applies to other low-resource languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar experiments with CoT on other low-resource languages (e.g., Finnish, Basque) and comparing the results to the Norwegian findings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal model size for low-resource languages when pre-training data is constrained, and how does this compare to mainstream languages like English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that increasing model parameter scales has limited impact on downstream task performance when pre-training data is constrained, suggesting smaller models may be more efficient for low-resource languages.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on Norwegian and a specific range of model sizes, leaving open the question of whether this finding generalizes to other low-resource languages or if there's an optimal size that balances performance and efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying model sizes and pre-training data quantities across multiple low-resource languages, comparing results to similar experiments in English.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of Norwegian-specific models compare to multilingual models fine-tuned on Norwegian data for various NLP tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares Norwegian-specific models (NorGLMs) to GPT-3.5 and NB-GPT-J-6B (a Norwegian-specific model continued from an English base), but does not directly compare to multilingual models fine-tuned on Norwegian.
- Why unresolved: The study does not include experiments with multilingual models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) fine-tuned on Norwegian data, leaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs between language-specific and multilingual approaches for low-resource languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art multilingual models on the Norwegian benchmark datasets and comparing their performance to the Norwegian-specific models across all tasks in NLEBench.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that may not fully capture nuanced language quality and cultural appropriateness in Norwegian
- Pre-training corpus composition and quality remain underspecified, with unclear Norwegian language representation and potential biases
- Comparison with GPT-3.5 based on public API version may differ from other studies' implementations

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims:**
- Norwegian-specific training data improves performance over English models for Norwegian tasks
- Smaller models can demonstrate reasoning capability through Chain-of-Thought prompting
- The developed benchmark suite provides useful evaluation infrastructure for Norwegian NLP

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Increasing model parameter scales has limited impact when pre-training data is constrained
- GPT-3.5 has limited understanding of Norwegian context
- Multi-task datasets can verify LLM generalizability

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Specific performance comparisons between Norwegian models and GPT-3.5 due to potential API version differences
- Energy efficiency rankings across different model sizes without detailed measurement methodology
- Claims about reasoning capability improvements through CoT without detailed experimental setup

## Next Checks
1. **Corpus Validation:** Conduct detailed analysis of Norwegian language representation in pre-training corpus, including dialect coverage, domain distribution, and potential biases to understand if performance limitations stem from model architecture or data quality issues.
2. **Human Evaluation Study:** Complement automated metrics with human evaluations of generated Norwegian text quality focusing on fluency, coherence, and cultural appropriateness to address limitations of relying solely on automatic metrics.
3. **Robustness Testing:** Evaluate model performance across different Norwegian dialects and code-switching scenarios to assess real-world applicability and reveal whether models generalize beyond standard Bokmål Norwegian.
