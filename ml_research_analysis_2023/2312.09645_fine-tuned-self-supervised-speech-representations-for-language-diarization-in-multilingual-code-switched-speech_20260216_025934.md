# Fine-Tuned Self-Supervised Speech Representations for Language Diarization in Multilingual Code-Switched Speech

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: Error rates reduced by 21.13% to 31.85% across different language groupings in multilingual code-switched speech diarization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to automatically identify spoken languages in multilingual code-switched speech using fine-tuned self-supervised speech representations from WavLM. The approach addresses the challenge of annotating code-switched speech corpora by enabling parallel processing of utterances by language experts. The method extracts contextual language representations from WavLM and uses them for language diarization, achieving substantial improvements over baseline systems. The work focuses on five South African languages (isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sesotho, English) and demonstrates that hierarchical language grouping improves accuracy while reducing classification complexity.

## Method Summary
The approach uses WavLM to extract contextual embeddings from audio, which are then fine-tuned on code-switched training data for language diarization. Three architectures are evaluated: BiLSTM and XSA as baselines, and WavLM with fine-tuned self-supervised representations. The corpus consists of 14.3 hours of code-switched speech from South African soap operas, split into four language-balanced subcorpora (E-Z, E-X, E-Se, E-So). Three hierarchical diarization tasks are evaluated: English/Bantu, English/Nguni/Sotho-Tswana, and individual language identification. Mel-spectrograms are extracted for baseline systems, while WavLM uses contextual embeddings from the last transformer encoder layer with a linear classifier mapping to language distributions.

## Key Results
- Error rates reduced by 21.13% to 31.85% across different language groupings compared to baseline systems
- Best performance achieved in identifying English/Bantu language groupings with error rate of 10.05%
- Performance degrades with increasing granularity of language categories, suggesting trade-off between complexity and accuracy
- Nguni languages benefit from additional data when grouped with Sotho-Tswana languages in hierarchical classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning WavLM on code-switched data improves language boundary detection in low-resource Bantu languages by leveraging phonetic features learned from English pre-training that transfer to Bantu languages. The pre-trained self-supervised representations capture transferable phonetic and phonological features that adapt to specific code-switched patterns during fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 2
Hierarchical language grouping (English/Bantu, English/Nguni/Sotho-Tswana, individual languages) improves accuracy by reducing classification complexity. By grouping similar languages, the model needs to learn fewer distinct boundaries, reducing confusion between linguistically related Bantu languages that are more confusable with each other than with English.

### Mechanism 3
WavLM's relative positional embeddings and denoising objective improve language boundary detection in code-switched speech. Relative positional embeddings allow the model to attend to relevant acoustic context around language switches, while denoising makes it robust to abrupt changes in speech characteristics created by language switches.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-supervised speech representation learning**: WavLM is pre-trained without labels using masked prediction objectives, providing general speech features. *Quick check: What is the main objective function used to pre-train WavLM?*

- **Cross-lingual transfer learning**: Understanding how features learned from English transfer to Bantu languages is critical for this approach. *Quick check: What linguistic properties are most likely to transfer between English and Bantu languages?*

- **Language diarization vs. language identification**: This work performs frame-level language segmentation, not just utterance-level classification. *Quick check: How does frame-level language labeling differ from utterance-level classification in terms of model architecture?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw waveform -> WavLM encoder -> Fine-tuned classifier -> Language boundaries
- **Critical path**: Raw waveform → WavLM encoder → Fine-tuned classifier → Language boundaries
- **Design tradeoffs**: Larger WavLM models improve accuracy but increase computation; hierarchical grouping improves accuracy but reduces granularity
- **Failure signatures**: High confusion between Nguni and Sotho-Tswana languages; degradation when moving from grouped to individual language classification
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train WavLM on monolingual English data only, evaluate on code-switched test set
  2. Fine-tune WavLM on code-switched training data with hierarchical grouping, evaluate
  3. Fine-tune WavLM on code-switched training data with individual language labels, evaluate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would multilingual pre-training on a corpus including the Bantu languages affect the language diarization performance compared to the monolingual English pre-training used in WavLM? The paper mentions this as a limitation and future work, stating the intention to investigate if monolingual pre-training hinders the ability to reliably learn discrete differences between languages within the same group by comparing multilingual self-supervised models.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal granularity of language categories for effective language diarization in multilingual code-switched speech, considering the trade-off between increased complexity and improved performance? The paper tested three hierarchical tasks with increasing granularity and observed degradation in performance as the number of categories increased, suggesting a need to determine the optimal balance.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of code-switched utterances in the training data affect the language diarization performance compared to training only on monolingual utterances? The paper notes that the lack of code-switched utterances could affect their ability to correctly categorize segments in the presence of rapid language changes, suggesting that including more code-switched utterances might improve performance.

## Limitations

- The corpus is relatively small (14.3 hours total) and domain-specific (soap operas), limiting generalizability to other code-switching scenarios
- Hierarchical grouping approach reduces granularity and may mask individual language boundary detection errors
- The paper doesn't provide ablation studies on the impact of WavLM's specific architectural features versus other pre-trained models

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Fine-tuning WavLM on code-switched data improves language boundary detection compared to baseline systems (well-supported by 21.13% to 31.85% error rate reductions).

**Medium confidence**: Hierarchical language grouping improves accuracy by reducing classification complexity (supported by error rate decreases, but direct measurement of confusion reduction not provided).

**Low confidence**: WavLM's relative positional embeddings and denoising objective specifically improve language boundary detection in code-switched speech (mentioned but no ablation experiments isolating individual contributions).

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on WavLM architectural features**: Remove the relative positional embeddings and denoising objective from WavLM, fine-tune on the same code-switched data, and compare performance to the full model to quantify the contribution of these specific features.

2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on code-switched speech from a different domain (e.g., interviews, news broadcasts, or conversational speech) to assess whether the improvements transfer beyond soap opera data.

3. **Individual language boundary analysis**: Analyze false positives and false negatives at the individual Bantu language level to determine whether errors are primarily due to linguistic similarity between languages or insufficient training data for specific language pairs.
