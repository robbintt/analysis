# Hazards from Increasingly Accessible Fine-Tuning of Downloadable Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14751
- Reference count: 30
- One-line primary result: More accessible fine-tuning of downloadable foundation models may increase hazards through reduced costs and improved cost sharing, while also enabling benefits through customization and research.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes the hazards arising from increasingly accessible fine-tuning of downloadable foundation models. The authors identify two main mechanisms through which accessibility may increase risk: cost reduction enabling malicious use by non-state actors, and improved cost sharing facilitating the creation of highly capable models that bypass oversight. They argue that these developments could make oversight more difficult while enabling both malicious actors and beneficial applications. The paper emphasizes the urgent need for developing effective mitigations given substantial remaining uncertainty about the magnitude and likelihood of potential hazards.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a conceptual analysis of how ongoing research areas improving fine-tuning accessibility may impact hazards. It examines mechanisms for cost reduction (algorithmic improvements, synthetic data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, quantization) and cost sharing (decentralized training, model composition). The authors analyze how these developments could facilitate malicious use by non-state actors and make oversight more difficult, while also considering potential benefits and mitigation strategies. The analysis uses a risk framework focusing on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

## Key Results
- Cost reduction in fine-tuning may enable non-state actors to develop dangerous capabilities more easily
- Improved cost sharing through decentralized training and model composition could create highly capable models that bypass oversight mechanisms
- More accessible fine-tuning enables beneficial applications through customization and research, creating a complex risk-benefit tradeoff

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing fine-tuning costs enables malicious actors to develop dangerous capabilities more easily
- Mechanism: Cost reduction lowers the barrier for non-state actors to fine-tune models for harmful purposes, shifting the cost-benefit analysis in favor of malicious use
- Core assumption: Actors have both the motivation and some baseline capability to engage in harmful activities, and fine-tuning can meaningfully reduce the difficulty of these activities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "cost reduction may facilitate malicious use by non-state actors"
  - [section] "cost reduction could enable more effective research on automated vulnerability finding in cybersecurity"
  - [corpus] "Deepfakes on Demand: the rise of accessible non-consensual deepfake image generators" (weak corpus signal, but relevant theme)
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data for harmful capabilities becomes scarce or if models cannot be effectively fine-tuned to acquire dangerous skills, this mechanism breaks down

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Improved cost sharing allows more actors to collaborate on creating highly capable models
- Mechanism: Decentralized training and model composition enable collectives to pool resources and create models that exceed the capabilities of individual actors, potentially bypassing oversight mechanisms
- Core assumption: Decentralized training methods can achieve performance comparable to centralized training, and model composition can meaningfully enhance capabilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "decentralized training methods may facilitate the construction of more capable models"
  - [section] "composition of models trained to expert level on specific domains... could lead to a single model that is generally capable"
  - [corpus] "Countering Autonomous Cyber Threats" (weak corpus signal, but relevant theme)
- Break condition: If decentralized training proves significantly less efficient than centralized training, or if model composition fails to produce meaningful capability gains, this mechanism breaks down

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: More accessible fine-tuning enables broader societal benefits through customization and research
- Mechanism: Lower costs and improved sharing allow academic researchers, independent developers, and civil society to adapt models for beneficial purposes, such as fact-checking or serving underrepresented languages
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning can be effectively used for beneficial purposes, and the benefits outweigh the potential harms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "accessible fine-tuning facilitates the downstream adaption of AI models to novel use-cases"
  - [section] "accessible fine-tuning has enabled the adaptation of language models to underrepresented or minority languages"
  - [corpus] "LabSafety Bench: Benchmarking LLMs on Safety Issues in Scientific Labs" (weak corpus signal, but relevant theme)
- Break condition: If the benefits of accessible fine-tuning are outweighed by the harms, or if the technology is primarily used for malicious purposes, this mechanism breaks down

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Risk assessment framework (hazard, exposure, vulnerability)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses this framework to analyze the potential impacts of more accessible fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: How does the risk framework help distinguish between different types of potential harms from accessible fine-tuning?

- Concept: Fine-tuning techniques and their trade-offs
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different methods of fine-tuning is crucial for assessing their impact on accessibility and potential hazards
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and reinforcement learning from AI feedback?

- Concept: Algorithmic progress and its implications
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses how algorithmic improvements may affect the long-term impact of more accessible fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: How might continued algorithmic progress affect the relative importance of accessible fine-tuning for developing dangerous capabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Cost reduction mechanisms (algorithmic improvements, synthetic data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, quantization) -> Cost sharing mechanisms (decentralized training, model composition) -> Mitigation strategies (making fine-tuning difficult for harmful tasks, machine unlearning, robust safety approaches) -> Benefit pathways (research, customization, societal resilience)

- Critical path: 1. Identify a capability of interest 2. Assess the impact of cost reduction on malicious use 3. Evaluate the implications of cost sharing for oversight 4. Consider potential mitigation strategies 5. Weigh the potential benefits against the risks

- Design tradeoffs: Flexibility vs. ease of use in fine-tuning methods, Openness vs. safety in model release strategies, Cost reduction vs. potential for misuse

- Failure signatures: If cost reduction does not meaningfully lower barriers for malicious actors, If cost sharing mechanisms prove ineffective or are easily regulated, If mitigation strategies fail to address the identified risks

- First 3 experiments: 1. Simulate the impact of reduced fine-tuning costs on the ability of non-state actors to develop harmful capabilities 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of decentralized training methods for creating highly capable models 3. Assess the potential benefits of accessible fine-tuning for beneficial applications (e.g., fact-checking, language preservation)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Will the cost of fine-tuning continue to decrease at a rate that makes it accessible to non-state actors within a short timeframe?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for cost reduction to facilitate malicious use by non-state actors
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while algorithmic progress may reduce costs, it is uncertain how quickly this will happen and whether it will be sufficient to enable non-state actors to engage in malicious activities
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data on the rate of cost reduction in fine-tuning, along with case studies of non-state actors successfully fine-tuning models for malicious purposes

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective are current oversight practices in detecting and preventing the fine-tuning of models for dangerous capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues that current oversight practices may be insufficient to address the challenges posed by cost sharing and decentralized training
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the limitations of current evaluation methods and the difficulty of imposing costs on decentralized developers, but does not provide a comprehensive assessment of oversight effectiveness
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of oversight practices across different jurisdictions, along with quantitative measures of their success in preventing the development of dangerous models

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the likelihood that cost reduction will lead to a significant increase in the number of attacks by non-state actors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that cost reduction may make it easier for non-state actors to engage in malicious use, but does not provide a quantitative estimate of the potential increase in attacks
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the offense-defense balance and the difficulty of attributing harm to perpetrators, making it challenging to predict the impact of cost reduction on attack frequency
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies of attack frequency in relation to advancements in fine-tuning technology, along with surveys of non-state actors to gauge their motivations and capabilities

## Limitations

- The analysis relies heavily on speculation about potential malicious use cases without concrete evidence of successful malicious applications
- The effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies, particularly those requiring cooperation from model developers, is uncertain given the decentralized nature of the ecosystem
- The paper does not fully account for potential countermeasures or the adaptive capabilities of oversight systems

## Confidence

- High confidence: Accessible fine-tuning will continue to improve in efficiency and cost-effectiveness based on clear trends in algorithmic progress
- Medium confidence: Cost reduction will lower barriers for malicious use, though the magnitude and practical implications remain uncertain
- Medium confidence: Cost sharing mechanisms could enable more capable models, but their effectiveness relative to centralized approaches is unclear
- Low confidence: Specific hazard scenarios and their likelihood, due to limited empirical evidence and rapidly evolving landscape

## Next Checks

1. Empirical study of fine-tuning capability transfer: Conduct controlled experiments to measure how effectively harmful capabilities can be added through fine-tuning, using current best practices and available data sources

2. Cost-benefit analysis of oversight mechanisms: Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of different oversight approaches (e.g., capability evaluations, data provenance tracking) under various fine-tuning accessibility scenarios

3. Comparative analysis of decentralized vs. centralized training: Benchmark the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art decentralized training methods against centralized approaches for developing highly capable models
