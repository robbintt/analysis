# Robust Bayesian Satisficing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08291
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08291
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces RoBOS algorithm achieving sublinear robust satisficing regret O(√T γ_T) and lenient regret O(√T γ_T + E_T) under distributional shifts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces robust Bayesian satisficing (RBS), a novel decision-making framework that combines satisficing with Bayesian optimization. The authors propose RoBOS, an algorithm that aims to achieve a satisfactory threshold τ under distributional shifts without requiring an uncertainty set as input. The key contributions include defining two regret measures (lenient regret and robust satisficing regret), proving sublinear regret bounds for RoBOS under certain assumptions, and demonstrating its effectiveness on synthetic and real-world problems.

## Method Summary
RoBOS is a Bayesian optimization algorithm that selects actions to achieve a satisfactory threshold τ while handling distributional shifts in contextual settings. It uses a GP surrogate model with UCB acquisition to compute optimistic fragility estimates. At each round, RoBOS selects the action that minimizes the estimated fragility, updates the GP posterior with observed data, and accumulates regret based on the difference between achieved rewards and the threshold τ.

## Key Results
- RoBOS guarantees sublinear robust satisficing regret O(√T γ_T) under certain assumptions on distributional shifts
- The algorithm achieves lenient regret O(√T γ_T + E_T), where E_T is the cumulative distribution shift
- Experiments show RoBOS outperforms other methods when the distributional shift is not precisely known or when the main objective is to achieve a desired value instead of maximizing reward

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RoBOS guarantees sublinear robust satisficing regret by combining UCB-based action selection with a GP surrogate that bounds uncertainty
- Mechanism: At each round, RoBOS computes an optimistic fragility estimate using UCBs. This ensures that chosen actions achieve at least τ − κ∥w*−w∥M in expectation. The GP posterior variance decays as O(γ_T/T), yielding sublinear regret in the form O(√T γ_T)
- Core assumption: Confidence bounds from Lemma 1 hold (probability ≥ 1−δ/2) and f has bounded RKHS norm B
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our algorithm guarantees sublinear lenient regret under certain assumptions on the amount of distribution shift."
  - [section]: "We prove that RoBOS achieves with high probability ˜O(γ_T√T) robust satisficing regret"
  - [corpus]: Weak – no direct GPR/GP bandit analogs mentioned
- Break condition: If f has unbounded RKHS norm or if confidence intervals fail, the regret bound collapses

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RoBOS achieves sublinear lenient regret O(√T γ_T + E_T) where E_T is the cumulative distribution shift
- Mechanism: When the true context distribution P* differs from the reference w, the lenient regret includes a term B′E_T, where B′ bounds the maximum MMD norm of f. This term captures the cost of distributional mismatch
- Core assumption: The reference distribution tracks the true distribution well enough that ∥w*−w∥M ≤ B′ and Assumption 1 (τ ≤ ⟨w, f_x̂⟩) holds
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We prove that RoBOS achieves with high probability ˜O(γ_T√T + E_T) lenient regret"
  - [section]: "lenient regret upper bound will depend on distribution shifts"
  - [corpus]: Weak – distributionally robust BO literature mentions similar dependence on uncertainty set radius, but not exact bound
- Break condition: If Assumption 1 is violated (τ too high) or if ∥w*−w∥M grows superlinearly, lenient regret becomes linear

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The estimated fragility ˆκ_τ,t is a safe optimistic proxy for the true fragility κ_τ,t
- Mechanism: ˆκ_τ,t is computed using UCBs, ensuring ˆκ_τ,t ≤ κ_τ,t with high probability (Lemma 2). This guarantees that the algorithm does not over-commit to fragile actions
- Core assumption: UCB confidence bounds hold and the GP posterior is calibrated
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Note that when ˆκ_τ,t(x) ≤ 0, the threshold τ is achieved under any context distribution given the UCBs of rewards of x."
  - [section]: "Lemma 2. Fix τ ∈ R. With probability at least 1 − δ, ˆκ_τ,t(x) ≤ κ_τ,t(x) for all x ∈ X and t ≥ 1."
  - [corpus]: Weak – no similar fragility estimation in neighbors
- Break condition: If the UCBs are too conservative (overly wide), ˆκ_τ,t may be too large, reducing efficiency

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling
  - Why needed here: RoBOS uses a GP to model the unknown reward function f, enabling uncertainty quantification and UCB/LCB computation
  - Quick check question: What is the posterior mean formula for a GP after observing {x_i, c_i, y_i} up to round t?

- Concept: Maximum Information Gain γ_T
  - Why needed here: γ_T appears in the regret bound and captures the learning efficiency of the GP kernel. It determines how quickly posterior variance shrinks
  - Quick check question: For a Matérn-ν kernel in d dimensions, what is the asymptotic scaling of γ_T?

- Concept: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
  - Why needed here: MMD measures the distributional shift between reference w and true w* contexts. It quantifies the fragility penalty
  - Quick check question: If M is the kernel matrix of contexts, how is the MMD between two distributions w and w' computed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - GP surrogate (mean µ_t, variance σ_t²) -> UCB/LCB computation -> Fragility estimator ˆκ_τ,t -> Action selector arg min_x ˆκ_τ,t(x) -> Context and reward observation -> GP posterior update

- Critical path:
  1. Observe reference distribution w_t
  2. Compute UCBs ucb_t(x, c) for all (x, c)
  3. Compute ˆκ_τ,t(x) for all x
  4. Select x_t = arg min_x∈X ˆκ_τ,t(x)
  5. Observe c_t ~ P*_t, y_t = f(x_t, c_t) + η_t
  6. Update GP posterior
  7. Repeat

- Design tradeoffs:
  - UCB width β_t vs exploration: larger β_t → safer but slower learning
  - Kernel choice: RBF vs Matérn affects γ_T and smoothness assumptions
  - Threshold τ: too high → frequent infeasibility; too low → loss of robustness

- Failure signatures:
  - Regret grows linearly → distributional shift too large or β_t too small
  - Algorithm rarely selects actions → fragility estimates always high (UCBs too conservative)
  - Instability in GP updates → kernel hyperparameters not tuned

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run RoBOS on synthetic f(x, c) with known ground truth; verify sublinear R_rs_T in log scale
  2. Vary w* away from w; observe R_l_T scaling with E_T
  3. Compare RoBOS vs DRBO with known uncertainty set; measure regret when shift is under-/over-estimated

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can RoBOS be extended to handle continuous action and context spaces effectively?
- Basis in paper: Explicit. The paper mentions this as a potential direction in the conclusion
- Why unresolved: Extending to continuous spaces requires more nuanced regret analysis and computationally efficient procedures for estimating fragility at each round
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing an extended version of RoBOS that works in continuous spaces with theoretical regret bounds and empirical validation

### Open Question 2
- Question: What alternative acquisition strategies can be designed for robust Bayesian satisficing?
- Basis in paper: Explicit. The conclusion suggests investigating Thompson sampling as an alternative to the UCB approach
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of different acquisition strategies in the context of robust satisficing has not been explored
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of RoBOS with UCB versus Thompson sampling or other acquisition strategies on benchmark problems

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of kernel function affect the performance of RoBOS in high-dimensional problems?
- Basis in paper: Inferred. The paper uses RBF and Matérn kernels but does not explore their impact in high dimensions
- Why unresolved: Kernel selection is crucial for GP performance, and high-dimensional problems pose additional challenges
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing RoBOS with different kernels on high-dimensional benchmark problems, analyzing performance and computational efficiency

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can RoBOS be adapted to handle non-stationary distributional shifts over time?
- Basis in paper: Inferred. The current analysis assumes stationary distributions, but real-world scenarios may involve non-stationary shifts
- Why unresolved: Adapting RoBOS to non-stationary environments requires dynamic adjustment of the algorithm's parameters and regret analysis
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a non-stationary version of RoBOS with theoretical guarantees and validating its performance on problems with evolving distributional shifts

## Limitations
- Bounds rely heavily on Assumption 1 (τ achievable under reference distribution) and bounded GP RKHS norm
- No explicit rate of MMD convergence provided, making E_T analysis incomplete
- UCB-based approach may be overly conservative, reducing efficiency in practice

## Confidence
- Sublinear robust satisficing regret (O(√T γ_T)): High - follows standard GP bandit analysis
- Sublinear lenient regret (O(√T γ_T + E_T)): Medium - depends on how well Assumption 1 holds and E_T growth
- Safety of fragility estimator (ˆκ_τ,t ≤ κ_τ,t): Medium - depends on UCB calibration

## Next Checks
1. Verify regret scaling empirically on synthetic problems with known f; plot log(R_T) vs log(T) to confirm sublinearity
2. Systematically vary the distributional shift magnitude; measure how R_l_T scales with E_T and test the assumption τ ≤ ⟨w, f_x̂⟩
3. Run sensitivity analysis on β_t; too large → excessive pessimism; too small → failure of high-probability guarantees
