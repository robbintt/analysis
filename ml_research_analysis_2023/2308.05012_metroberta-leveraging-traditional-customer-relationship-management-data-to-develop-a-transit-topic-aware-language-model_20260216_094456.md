# MetRoBERTa: Leveraging Traditional Customer Relationship Management Data to Develop a Transit-Topic-Aware Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05012
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Achieves 90% average accuracy classifying open-ended transit feedback into 11 topics using a RoBERTa-based model.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MetRoBERTa, a transit-topic-aware language model designed to classify open-ended customer feedback into 11 transit-specific topics. The authors use semi-supervised learning with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to engineer a training dataset from six years of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) customer feedback. They compare their RoBERTa-based model to traditional keyword-based and lexicon representations, demonstrating superior performance. The model enables agencies to better understand and improve customer experience at scale by adding structure to unstructured feedback sources like Twitter.

## Method Summary
The authors utilize semi-supervised learning with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on six years of WMATA CRM feedback to engineer a training dataset of 11 broad transit topics. They then train a RoBERTa-based classification model on this dataset and compare its performance to traditional TF-IDF-based models. The model is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and applied to classify unstructured feedback sources like Twitter, with integration to external data (ridership, GTFS) for generating performance reporting metrics.

## Key Results
- MetRoBERTa achieves an average topic classification accuracy of 90%, outperforming traditional TF-IDF methods.
- The model successfully classifies unstructured Twitter feedback into the 11 transit-specific topics.
- Integration with external data enables normalization of feedback volume, providing comparable time series across periods with varying ridership levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MetRoBERTa achieves high accuracy by leveraging semi-supervised topic modeling to create structured training labels from unstructured CRM data.
- Mechanism: The LDA-based clustering condenses 61 CRM problem categories into 11 coherent transit-specific topics, then RoBERTa fine-tunes on these labels to capture semantic context beyond keyword matching.
- Core assumption: LDA-derived topics adequately represent underlying complaint semantics and are stable across different time windows of data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We utilize semi-supervised learning to engineer a training dataset of 11 broad transit topics detected in a corpus of 6 years of customer feedback"
  - [section] "we opted to utilize a semi-supervised learning algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), on the dataset to re-categorize customer feedback instances into fewer, broader latent topics"
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors are mostly Twitter-focused sentiment papers, not LDA topic modeling studies.
- Break condition: If complaint language shifts significantly (e.g., new service types), LDA clusters may no longer align with actual customer intent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model outperforms TF-IDF methods because it captures context-aware semantics rather than just keyword co-occurrence.
- Mechanism: RoBERTa's transformer architecture allows it to understand word usage in context, reducing misclassification from homonyms or domain-specific phrasing.
- Core assumption: Semantic context is more predictive than exact keyword matches for topic classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our model outperforms those methods across all evaluation metrics, providing an average topic classification accuracy of 90%"
  - [section] "When words are used in a different context (e.g. pouring and swiping... keyword-based methods struggle)"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct evidence of transformer context handling in related papers; corpus is sentiment-heavy.
- Break condition: If training data contains highly ambiguous or sarcastic language, even context-aware models may fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integration with external data (ridership, GTFS) enables actionable performance metrics by normalizing feedback volume.
- Mechanism: Complaint counts per million riders provide comparable time series across periods with varying ridership levels.
- Core assumption: Ridership data is a valid proxy for exposure, so normalization reveals true service issue frequency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Adding structure to unstructured data" and "generating performance reporting metrics"
  - [section] "the reporting metric used is complaints per million riders, where the volume of complaints is normalized by ridership data"
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus examples of ridership-normalized feedback analysis.
- Break condition: If external data sources become unreliable or ridership patterns change drastically, normalization may mislead.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling
  - Why needed here: Condenses many CRM categories into coherent topics for training a classifier.
  - Quick check question: How does LDA determine topic assignments without labeled data?
- Concept: RoBERTa transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Enables semantic understanding and transfer learning for transit-specific text.
  - Quick check question: What makes RoBERTa better suited than vanilla BERT for this domain?
- Concept: TF-IDF feature weighting
  - Why needed here: Baseline comparison shows the advantage of context-aware models over keyword frequency.
  - Quick check question: Why might TF-IDF misclassify "pouring" in a bus feedback context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LDA preprocessing -> topic label assignment -> RoBERTa fine-tuning -> inference pipeline -> post-processing (sentiment, asset matching, normalization).
- Critical path: Preprocess CRM data -> LDA topic inference -> Train/test split -> RoBERTa fine-tuning -> Evaluate accuracy -> Deploy with extended pipeline.
- Design tradeoffs: LDA's keyword clustering is fast but may miss niche topics; RoBERTa gives accuracy but requires GPU resources and large training data.
- Failure signatures: High variance in cross-validation folds suggests topic overlap; zero classification for unseen vocabulary indicates need for re-training.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LDA with K=23 on sample CRM subset and inspect top words per topic.
  2. Train a baseline Logistic Regression on TF-IDF features and record macro F1.
  3. Fine-tune RoBERTa on the same split and compare accuracy to baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do model performance and generalizability change when applied to other transit agencies' CRM data with different terminology and complaint structures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states the model could be retrained with other agencies' data and mentions investigating generalizability as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study only tested the model on WMATA data. Performance on other agencies' data with different terminology, complaint structures, and service contexts is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Retraining and evaluating the model on CRM data from multiple other transit agencies, measuring classification accuracy and comparing to WMATA performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How much does the semi-supervised LDA topic detection approach limit the model compared to using ground truth labeled data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitation that LDA's keyword-based clustering can lead to false topic assignments, which then get used to train the model.
- Why unresolved: The study used LDA to generate training labels rather than manually labeled ground truth. The impact of any label noise on model performance is unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Manually labeling a subset of the CRM data with ground truth topics and training/retraining the model to compare performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle new, previously unseen topics that arise over time (e.g. new COVID variants, service changes, etc.)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the model would need to be retrained as new data becomes available, implying it may not handle new topics well without retraining.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated the model on historical data. Its ability to generalize to new, emerging topics is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Monitoring model performance over time as new topics arise, retraining as needed and measuring impact on accuracy.

## Limitations
- Reliance on proprietary WMATA CRM data makes independent validation difficult.
- LDA topic model may not generalize well to other transit agencies with different complaint vocabularies.
- 90% accuracy claim based on single agency data may not hold across diverse contexts.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence** in RoBERTa's contextual understanding improving classification over keyword-based methods, given strong empirical results.
- **Medium Confidence** in LDA topic engineering approach, as methodology is sound but topic stability across datasets is untested.
- **Medium Confidence** in external data integration for normalization, as concept is valid but lacks sensitivity analysis on ridership fluctuations.

## Next Checks
1. Apply trained MetRoBERTa model to feedback from a different transit agency or time period to assess topic consistency and model generalizability.
2. Retrain the model without the semi-supervised LDA step (using only raw CRM labels) to quantify the contribution of topic engineering to overall accuracy.
3. Analyze distribution of topics in training data to identify potential imbalances and test whether model over-predicts certain topics for underrepresented complaint types.
