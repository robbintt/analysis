# Brain-inspired Computational Intelligence via Predictive Coding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07870
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of predictive coding as a brain-inspired alternative to backpropagation

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews predictive coding (PC), a neuroscience-inspired learning framework that offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. The authors examine PC's theoretical foundations, recent implementations, and applications across supervised learning, NLP, computer vision, and robotics. While PC demonstrates desirable properties like locality, robustness, and support for arbitrary network topologies, its efficiency remains a challenge due to iterative inference requirements. The survey identifies important future research directions including more efficient optimization techniques and integration with stochastic generative models.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on predictive coding implementations, focusing on neural generative coding (NGC) and biased competition with divisive modulation (BC-DIM) approaches. It analyzes PC's application across various domains while identifying key challenges and opportunities. The authors discuss both theoretical foundations and practical considerations for implementing PC networks, examining how they compare to traditional backpropagation methods in terms of biological plausibility and computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- PC enables training of models with arbitrary network topologies through purely local updates
- PC networks demonstrate improved robustness compared to backpropagation-based models
- Iterative inference process creates significant computational overhead that limits scalability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Predictive coding achieves credit assignment through iterative inference rather than backpropagating error derivatives.
- Mechanism: Instead of computing global error derivatives, PC minimizes a local variational free energy via layer-wise updates. Each layer updates its value nodes to reduce prediction errors, spreading credit assignment across the network in a distributed way.
- Core assumption: The generative model structure is known and locally invertible, and variational free energy gradients are locally computable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PC exhibits desirable properties like locality, robustness, and the ability to handle arbitrary network topologies."
  - [section 2.1] "PC is the explicit (or implicit) use of prediction errors for the inversion of generative models."
  - [corpus] Weak — none of the related papers explicitly discuss the theoretical mechanism; only application contexts are mentioned.
- Break condition: If the generative model is misspecified or non-Gaussian, the variational approximation fails and convergence slows dramatically.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PC enables arbitrary network topologies because updates are purely local.
- Mechanism: By defining prediction and error nodes per neuron and allowing each to use only its local synaptic inputs and outputs, cycles and cross-connections are permitted. The energy is still globally defined but gradients are computed locally.
- Core assumption: The update rules remain stable even when layers are not strictly hierarchical.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PC can be used to train models with any given topology [32, 40]."
  - [section 3] "PC can be utilized to model networks with any kind of structure, making it ideal to digitally perform learning tasks that require brain-like architectures such as parallel cortical columns."
  - [corpus] Weak — related papers focus on scaling PC to deeper layers, not on arbitrary topologies.
- Break condition: When cycles create conflicting gradient directions, local updates may oscillate or diverge.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PC provides robustness because error signals are diffused across layers rather than backpropagated directly.
- Mechanism: Prediction errors at each layer influence both higher and lower layers simultaneously, distributing credit assignment pressure. This prevents sharp gradients and over-reliance on precise backward paths.
- Core assumption: The iterative inference process converges before parameter updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PC networks are naturally more robust in relation to standard models trained with backprop."
  - [section 3.1] "PC networks trained for supervised learning naturally model implicit gradient descent [42], a more stable formulation that reduces numerical instability."
  - [corpus] Weak — robustness is claimed but not empirically demonstrated in the neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If inference steps are too few or learning rate too high, errors won't diffuse properly and training destabilizes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational free energy minimization
  - Why needed here: It is the unifying objective that justifies both inference and learning in PC.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between variational free energy and prediction error in PC?

- Concept: Mean-field approximation
  - Why needed here: Enables factorizing posteriors over layers, making local updates tractable.
  - Quick check question: How does mean-field factorization enforce locality in PC updates?

- Concept: Laplace approximation
  - Why needed here: Allows treating posterior distributions as Gaussian, giving analytic gradient forms.
  - Quick check question: What would break in PC if the Laplace assumption were dropped?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Value nodes -> Prediction nodes -> Error nodes
  - Synaptic matrices (forward and feedback)
  - Precision matrices (error scaling)

- Critical path:
  1. Clamp input to lowest layer
  2. Iterate value node updates until convergence
  3. Perform weight update using frozen final states
  4. Repeat for next batch

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More inference steps → better accuracy but slower training
  - Narrower layers → less expressive generative model
  - Skipping precision weighting → faster but less stable

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence during inference → learning rate too high or model misspecified
  - Vanishing updates → precision weights too low or activation functions saturating
  - Oscillating weights → cyclic feedback causing conflicting updates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a shallow PC autoencoder on MNIST and compare convergence speed vs backprop
  2. Add skip connections and test on a small CNN task
  3. Implement precision weighting and measure robustness to noisy inputs

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency remains a fundamental challenge due to iterative inference requirements
- Most empirical results focus on relatively shallow networks, with scaling to very deep architectures still under investigation
- Survey is descriptive rather than presenting original experimental results, limiting direct verification of claims

## Confidence
- Arbitrary network topologies: Medium confidence - theoretical arguments but limited empirical validation
- Robustness claims: Low confidence - primarily theoretical with minimal empirical evidence
- Efficiency limitations: High confidence - well-documented and acknowledged as primary challenge

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark PC on deeper networks (50+ layers) to verify topology claims and efficiency trade-offs
2. Conduct systematic robustness testing comparing PC vs. backprop under various noise and adversarial conditions
3. Measure actual computational overhead of PC inference across different hardware platforms and batch sizes
