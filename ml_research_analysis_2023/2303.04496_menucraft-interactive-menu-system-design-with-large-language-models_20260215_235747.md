# MenuCraft: Interactive Menu System Design with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.04496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04496
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: Presents MenuCraft, an interactive tool using large language models for menu system design through dialogue

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MenuCraft, a tool that enables collaborative menu design between human designers and large language models through an interactive dialogue system. The approach leverages few-shot learning to tap into the pre-existing knowledge of LLMs without requiring task-specific training data. MenuCraft supports various interactions including topic-based design, command recommendation, tab organization, and hotkey assignment, demonstrating how conversational interfaces can facilitate iterative refinement of menu systems.

## Method Summary
MenuCraft employs few-shot learning with large language models (specifically ChatGPT) to design menu systems through interactive dialogue. The system takes designer inputs as conversational prompts, generates menu suggestions, and allows iterative refinement through feedback. The approach relies on the LLM's pre-trained knowledge of UI patterns and semantic relationships between commands, using conversational context to maintain design state across multiple turns.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates interactive menu design capability using ChatGPT through few-shot learning approach
- Shows iterative refinement possible through dialogue-based feedback loops
- Validates semantic understanding of command relationships for menu organization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot learning enables effective menu design without requiring task-specific training data
- Mechanism: The system leverages the broad knowledge of large language models by providing examples in a conversational format, allowing the model to adapt to menu design tasks using only a few demonstrations
- Core assumption: The LLM has been pre-trained on sufficient domain knowledge to understand menu design concepts, command relationships, and user interface patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Large language models can utilize their vast pre-existing knowledge in designing and refining menu systems"
  - [section 3.1] "ChatGPT is designed to take as input the previous turns in a conversation and utilize them to generate a prediction for the subsequent turn"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found for few-shot menu design applications

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interactive dialogue enables iterative refinement of menu designs through human-AI collaboration
- Mechanism: The conversational interface allows designers to provide feedback, request modifications, and ask for explanations, creating a feedback loop that progressively improves the menu design
- Core assumption: Designers can effectively communicate their requirements and preferences through natural language in a dialogue format
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MenuCraft enables collaboration between a human designer and a language model to design menus through an interactive dialogue system"
  - [section 4] Multiple examples show iterative refinement (e.g., "Remove the Format tab... replace it with a View tab")
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found for interactive menu design dialogue systems

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semantic understanding of command relationships improves menu organization and user experience
- Mechanism: The LLM applies its understanding of semantic relationships between commands to group related functions together and prioritize frequently used commands
- Core assumption: The LLM has learned meaningful semantic relationships from its training data that apply to menu command organization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "one crucial factor that designers need to consider is the semantic and systematic relation of menu commands"
  - [section 4.2] "commands with related operations are grouped and placed within the same tab and near each other"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found for semantic menu organization using LLMs

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning in large language models
  - Why needed here: MenuCraft relies on the ability to perform menu design tasks with minimal examples rather than requiring extensive training data or fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What is the minimum number of examples typically needed for few-shot learning to be effective in LLMs?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: ChatGPT (the model used in MenuCraft) was trained using RLHF, which helps it follow instructions and maintain conversational quality
  - Quick check question: How does RLHF differ from standard supervised learning in language model training?

- Concept: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles for menu design
  - Why needed here: MenuCraft applies HCI principles like Fitts' Law and associativity maximization to optimize menu layouts
  - Quick check question: According to Fitts' Law, what design factor most directly affects selection time in menu systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend Web interface with chat-based interaction -> LLM Engine ChatGPT/GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses -> Prompt Engineering Layer Templates and examples for different menu design tasks -> State Management Conversation history and current menu design state

- Critical path: Designer input → Prompt generation → LLM response → UI update → Designer feedback loop

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. specificity: Open-ended dialogue allows for creative solutions but may produce inconsistent results
  - Speed vs. optimization: Language model approaches provide quick suggestions but may not find optimal solutions compared to parameter-based optimization
  - General knowledge vs. domain expertise: Leveraging pre-existing knowledge avoids data collection costs but may miss domain-specific nuances

- Failure signatures:
  - Repetitive or generic suggestions despite specific prompts
  - Context loss across multiple dialogue turns
  - Incorrect assumptions about command relationships or usage patterns
  - Inconsistent formatting or response structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic topic-based menu generation with different domains (text editor, image editor, web browser) to validate semantic understanding
  2. Evaluate command recommendation accuracy by comparing suggested commands against established menu patterns in popular applications
  3. Assess iterative refinement capabilities by measuring improvement in menu design quality across multiple dialogue turns with a designer

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation with actual designers or user testing
- No comparison against traditional menu design approaches or established design patterns
- Potential variability in model responses across different sessions or prompts

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core concept that large language models can be effectively used for menu system design through interactive dialogue. The mechanism of leveraging pre-existing knowledge through few-shot learning is well-established in the LLM literature, though specific validation for menu design applications remains limited.

**Medium confidence** in the practical effectiveness of MenuCraft for real-world design scenarios. While the interactive dialogue approach shows promise for iterative refinement, the quality and consistency of AI-generated suggestions across different design contexts has not been thoroughly evaluated. The paper demonstrates proof-of-concept functionality but lacks empirical validation with actual designers.

**Low confidence** in claims about optimal menu organization and semantic command relationships. The paper asserts that the LLM can understand and apply semantic relationships between commands, but this relies heavily on the model's pre-training rather than validated domain expertise. The absence of user studies or comparative evaluations against established design practices limits confidence in these claims.

## Next Checks

1. **User Study Implementation**: Conduct a controlled study with professional UI designers comparing MenuCraft-generated menus against manually designed menus across multiple application domains, measuring both design quality and time efficiency.

2. **Consistency Testing**: Evaluate response consistency by having the same designer recreate menu designs across multiple sessions, measuring variation in suggestions and layout decisions.

3. **Domain Expertise Validation**: Compare MenuCraft's command groupings and hotkey recommendations against established HCI guidelines and popular application patterns to assess alignment with professional design standards.
