# Interpretable Detection of Out-of-Context Misinformation with Neural-Symbolic-Enhanced Large Multimodal Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.07633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07633
- Reference count: 6
- Accuracy achieved: 68.2%

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a neural-symbolic approach for detecting out-of-context misinformation by combining symbolic query extraction with neural vision-language models. The method extracts fact queries from text using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing and evaluates their consistency with images using large pre-trained vision-language models. A query ranker then selects the most important evidence to support the final prediction. Experiments on the NewsCLIPpings benchmark show the method achieves 68.2% accuracy and 73.0% AUC of ROC, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable evidence for human verification.

## Method Summary
The method uses a three-stage pipeline: First, AMR parsing converts captions into semantic graphs, from which elementary fact queries are extracted using a neighbor-search algorithm. Second, these queries are evaluated against images using a pre-trained vision-language model (CLIP or BLIP) to determine consistency. Third, a query ranker uses a fusion of caption, query, and vision embeddings to weight the most informative queries, which are then used to make the final prediction. This neural-symbolic integration aims to provide both high accuracy and interpretable evidence for misinformation detection.

## Key Results
- Achieved 68.2% accuracy and 73.0% AUC of ROC on NewsCLIPpings benchmark
- Outperformed state-of-the-art baselines including CLIP and VINVL
- Generated interpretable evidence that helps human verifiers understand model decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Extracting symbolic queries from AMR parses allows the model to focus on specific factual claims rather than entire image-caption pairs, improving interpretability and accuracy.
- Mechanism: The AMR parser converts the caption into a structured graph representing entities, relationships, and attributes. A neighbor-search algorithm extracts elementary fact queries (object, spatial-temporal, activity, relationship, attribute statements) from this graph. These queries are then evaluated individually against the image using a vision-language model.
- Core assumption: The AMR graph captures the essential semantic content of the caption, and the neighbor-search algorithm can reliably extract meaningful elementary fact queries from it.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed model first symbolically disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption"
  - [section 3.1] "To extract the above elementary statements, we first conduct named entity recognition and abstract-meaning-representation (AMR) parsing on the caption to acquire an graph description"
- Break condition: If the AMR parser fails to capture important semantic information from the caption, or if the neighbor-search algorithm extracts incorrect or irrelevant queries.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The query ranker improves accuracy by filtering out unreliable or unimportant queries, reducing noise in the final prediction.
- Mechanism: The query ranker uses a fusion of caption, query, and vision embeddings to predict the "supportive probability" of each query. Queries with high supportive probability (i.e., those whose answers align with the final prediction) are given more weight in the final decision.
- Core assumption: The query ranker can effectively learn which queries are most informative for determining the consistency of the image-caption pair.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The edges with high scores will be selected into the evidence sets. Finally, by counting the number of 'True' edges within the evidence sets, the model makes a prediction"
  - [section 4.3] "Our model's variant without Query Ranker can achieve a performance that is approximately same as fine-tuned CLIP, but still get substantially outperformed by VINVL. This reflect the limitations of AMR parsers and BLIP-2, which can respectively introduce errors into query extraction and query answering, and indicate the importance of query ranker."
- Break condition: If the query ranker fails to learn meaningful patterns from the training data, or if it overemphasizes unreliable queries.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a pre-trained vision-language model to evaluate the consistency between extracted queries and the image leverages the model's learned knowledge to capture complex semantics.
- Mechanism: The extracted queries are forwarded to a large pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP or BLIP) to predict whether the image supports or contradicts each query. The model's knowledge of the world helps it understand the meaning of the queries and their relationship to the image.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained vision-language model has sufficient knowledge to accurately evaluate the consistency between the extracted queries and the image.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed model first symbolically disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption and then forwards the query-image pairs into a pre-trained large vision-language model select the 'evidences' that are helpful for us to detect misinformation."
  - [section 4.3] "Second, our the proposed method outperform all baselines on almost all metrics, indicating the effectiveness of the propose model."
- Break condition: If the pre-trained vision-language model lacks the necessary knowledge to understand the queries or their relationship to the image.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing
  - Why needed here: AMR parsing converts natural language captions into structured semantic graphs, which are essential for extracting elementary fact queries.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary output of an AMR parser, and how is it used in this method?

- Concept: Vision-language models
  - Why needed here: Vision-language models like CLIP and BLIP are used to evaluate the consistency between extracted queries and images, leveraging their learned knowledge of the world.
  - Quick check question: How do vision-language models like CLIP and BLIP contribute to the misinformation detection process in this method?

- Concept: Neural-symbolic integration
  - Why needed here: This method combines neural (AMR parsing, vision-language model) and symbolic (query extraction, ranking) approaches to achieve both interpretability and accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the neural-symbolic integration in this method, and how do they work together?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: AMR Parser -> Query Extractor -> Vision-Language Model -> Query Ranker -> Final Classifier
- Critical path: AMR Parse → Query Extract → Vision-Language Model → Query Ranker → Final Classifier
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Interpretability: The method prioritizes interpretability by using symbolic queries, which may slightly impact accuracy compared to black-box approaches.
  - Complexity vs. Performance: The multiple components (AMR parser, query extractor, ranker) add complexity but improve performance and interpretability.
  - Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning: The method leverages pre-trained vision-language models but requires fine-tuning the query ranker on the specific task.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy: Could indicate issues with AMR parsing, query extraction, or the vision-language model's understanding of the queries.
  - Poor interpretability: Could suggest problems with the query extraction or ranking process.
  - High computational cost: Could be due to the complexity of the AMR parsing or the large number of queries generated.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test AMR parsing accuracy on a subset of captions to ensure it captures the essential semantic content.
  2. Evaluate the query extraction process by manually checking the extracted queries for relevance and correctness.
  3. Assess the vision-language model's ability to evaluate the consistency between a sample of queries and images.
