# Comparing Spoken Languages using Paninian System of Sounds and Finite State Machines

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2301.12463
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12463
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Sanskrit identified as central donor language in Indo-European and Dravidian word evolution through phonetic map analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to comparative linguistics by combining Panini's ancient system of sounds with modern finite state machine theory. The authors construct a phonetic map where phonemes are represented as coordinates, and words become paths through this space. By building Morphological Finite Automata (MFA) for word groups and computing distances on the phonetic map, they identify central and basic words that likely represent original forms. The methodology is applied to analyze cognates and related words across Indo-European and Dravidian languages, revealing Sanskrit as the central donor language with word transformations similar in Indian and European languages.

## Method Summary
The methodology constructs a phonetic map using Panini's classification system, where each phoneme is assigned coordinates based on its articulatory properties. Words are represented as state transitions through this phonetic space, and Morphological Finite Automata (MFA) are built for word groups to formally define valid word patterns. Distances between words on the phonetic map are computed to identify central words, with the assumption that words requiring minimal phonetic movement are more basic or original. The approach is validated through analysis of kinship terms, words for God, and Dravidian Tadbhava forms.

## Key Results
- Sanskrit identified as central donor language across Indo-European and Dravidian language families
- Word transformation patterns found to be similar in Indian and European languages
- MFA construction successfully models word groups and identifies valid word sequences
- Distance analysis on phonetic map reveals central words that likely represent original forms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Representing words as state transitions on a phonetic map enables systematic comparison of cognate relationships across languages. Each phoneme is mapped to a coordinate on a 2D phonetic plane, making words paths through this space. Distances between words reflect phonetic similarity, allowing quantitative analysis of how words change across languages. The core assumption is that phonetic proximity on the map correlates with perceived similarity of sounds and likelihood of cognate relationship.

### Mechanism 2
Constructing morphological finite automata (MFA) that accept word groups provides a formal grammar for cross-linguistic word analysis. For each word group, states represent phonemes or partial words, and transitions represent valid phoneme sequences. Accepting states correspond to complete words in the group, creating a formal language that can generate or validate cognates. The core assumption is that the sequence of phonemes in words follows regular patterns that can be captured by finite automata.

### Mechanism 3
Distance analysis on the phonetic map identifies central and basic words that likely represent original forms in language evolution. By computing distances between words in a group on the phonetic map, words with minimal total distance to others can be identified as central. This suggests they may be more basic or original forms from which others diverged. The core assumption is that words requiring less phonetic "movement" on the map are more fundamental or closer to ancestral forms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Panini's system of sounds and phonetic classification**: Forms the foundation for constructing the phonetic map and analyzing word formation. Quick check: How many primary categories of sounds are there in Panini's system, and what distinguishes them?

- **Finite automata theory and regular languages**: Provides the mathematical framework for constructing and analyzing morphological finite automata. Quick check: What distinguishes a deterministic finite automaton from a non-deterministic one in terms of state transitions?

- **Formal grammar and production rules**: Enables the construction of grammars associated with each m-language for word validation. Quick check: What are the components of a formal grammar in the form (NT, T, P, S)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Phonetic map generator → Word-to-path converter → Distance calculator → MFA constructor → Grammar generator. Each word group has an associated m-language with core and extended alphabets.

- **Critical path**: Phonetic map construction → Word path generation → Distance calculation → MFA construction → Grammar derivation. Each step depends on the previous one being correctly implemented.

- **Design tradeoffs**: The geometric mapping trades exact phonetic representation for computational tractability. Using finite automata trades expressive power for efficient word validation. The approach prioritizes systematic comparison over capturing all linguistic nuances.

- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect MFA construction will accept non-words or reject valid words. Poor phonetic mapping will yield meaningless distance calculations. If distance analysis doesn't identify plausible central words, the mapping may be flawed.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement the phonetic map for a small subset of Panini's sounds and verify distances between known similar sounds are smaller than between dissimilar sounds.
  2. Construct an MFA for a simple word group (like kinship terms) and test it accepts all known words while rejecting near-misses.
  3. Calculate distances for a word group and check if the identified central word matches linguistic intuition about the most basic form.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the proposed phonetic map topology be optimized to better reflect perceptual distances between sounds, beyond the current geometric layout based on articulation place and voicing? The authors acknowledge their phonetic map layout is based on a specific thought process but note "Alternative topologies also may be considered" without rigorous validation. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing that different phonetic map topologies yield different results in identifying central words, detecting cognates, or improving classification accuracy.

### Open Question 2
What is the formal relationship between the proposed Morphological Finite Automata (MFA) and traditional finite automata in theoretical computer science, and can MFAs be shown to accept exactly the regular languages over extended alphabets that include phonological transformations? While the paper uses MFA terminology and provides examples, it does not establish whether MFAs have the same expressive power as classical finite automata. What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs showing the equivalence or difference between MFAs and standard finite automata.

### Open Question 3
How can the methodology be validated empirically to demonstrate that Sanskrit words are indeed more "central" in the proposed phonetic map distance measure compared to cognates in other Indo-European languages? The authors claim Sanskrit as central based on distance calculations but this conclusion appears to be based on limited examples without statistical validation. What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale computational experiments comparing distance distributions of Sanskrit words versus cognates in multiple languages, with statistical tests showing whether Sanskrit consistently shows lower average distances within word groups.

## Limitations

- The approach's effectiveness hinges on the validity of mapping phonetic relationships to geometric distances, yet no empirical validation of this mapping is provided
- Construction methodology for Morphological Finite Automata lacks specification of how to handle irregular sound changes or exceptions in language evolution
- The corpus evidence reveals no citations or related work addressing this specific methodology, suggesting the approach may be novel but untested

## Confidence

- Phonetic map distance analysis: **Low** - No corpus evidence or validation provided for the geometric distance approach
- MFA construction for word groups: **Medium** - Formal automata theory is well-established, but application to linguistic word groups lacks empirical support
- Sanskrit centrality claims: **Low** - Based primarily on the authors' distance calculations without external linguistic validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the phonetic map by comparing distances between known phonetically similar sounds (like [p] and [b]) versus dissimilar sounds, ensuring the geometric distances align with linguistic perception.

2. Construct MFA for a small, well-documented word group (like numbers 1-10) and verify it correctly accepts all variants while rejecting near-misses that violate phonological rules.

3. Apply the distance analysis to a word group with known etymology to check if the identified central word matches the historically documented original form.
