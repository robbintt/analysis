# Satellite Captioning: Large Language Models to Augment Labeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10905
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: GPT-corrected captions improve METEOR scores and caption quality for remote sensing image captioning models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses grammatical errors, word repetition, and limited vocabulary in remote sensing image caption datasets, which can hinder model performance. The core method involves using ChatGPT to correct and enhance captions in the RSICD dataset by improving grammar, increasing word diversity, and reducing repetition. The corrected captions were compared to the original dataset using a captioning model trained with different feature extraction architectures (ResNet-101, VGG-16, VGG-19, MnasNet). Results showed a general improvement in caption readability and naturalism, with the GPT-corrected dataset achieving higher METEOR scores (e.g., 0.7033 vs. 0.6859 for ResNet-101) and more detailed, natural-sounding captions. The study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively enhance caption datasets, improving model performance.

## Method Summary
The method involves using ChatGPT to correct and enhance captions in the RSICD dataset by improving grammar, increasing word diversity, and reducing repetition. A custom prompt was used to instruct ChatGPT to generate concise, grammatically correct versions of existing captions. The corrected captions were then used to train captioning models with different feature extraction architectures (ResNet-101, VGG-16, VGG-19, MnasNet) using an encoder-decoder architecture with attention-based LSTM decoders. The performance of these models was evaluated using METEOR scores on a validation set.

## Key Results
- GPT-corrected dataset achieved higher METEOR scores compared to original dataset (e.g., 0.7033 vs. 0.6859 for ResNet-101).
- Improved caption readability and naturalism observed in GPT-corrected captions.
- Performance gains observed across multiple feature extraction architectures (ResNet-101, VGG-16, VGG-19, MnasNet).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ChatGPT grammar correction improves caption diversity and reduces repetition by generating concise, grammatically correct versions of existing captions, which inherently increases vocabulary variety and eliminates redundant phrasing. The default temperature=1.0 setting provides sufficient randomness to avoid repetition while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
Improved captions lead to better METEOR scores and more natural-sounding generated captions by replacing low-diversity, error-prone captions with higher-quality, varied ones, allowing the captioning model to learn to produce more descriptive and coherent output.

### Mechanism 3
Feature extraction architecture choice affects the magnitude of performance gain from caption augmentation because different backbones (ResNet-101, VGG variants, MnasNet) have varying capacities to leverage richer textual inputs; stronger encoders may benefit more from detailed captions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Image captioning pipeline (encoder-decoder with attention)**: Understanding how visual features are encoded and mapped to text is essential for diagnosing why caption quality affects model performance. Quick check: What is the role of the attention mechanism in the decoder during caption generation?
- **Transfer learning in computer vision**: The study uses pre-trained backbones (ResNet-101, VGG, MnasNet) to extract image features before training the captioning model. Quick check: Why is it beneficial to use a pre-trained network as the encoder in this captioning task?
- **Caption evaluation metrics (METEOR vs BLEU)**: The choice of METEOR over BLEU reflects a need to capture caption diversity and semantic similarity, not just n-gram overlap. Quick check: In what scenario would METEOR be preferred over BLEU for caption evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Image → Encoder (CNN backbone) → 14x14 feature map → Attention-weighted features → LSTM decoder → Caption generation
- **Critical path**: Image → Encoder → Attention-weighted features → LSTM decoder → Caption generation
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Larger encoders (ResNet) give better accuracy but higher computational cost
  - ChatGPT augmentation improves caption quality but introduces dependency on external API
  - Temperature=1.0 balances diversity and coherence; lower values may reduce repetition but also richness
- **Failure signatures**:
  - METEOR scores plateau or degrade after augmentation
  - Generated captions contain hallucinations or unrelated details
  - Overfitting to augmented captions due to excessive vocabulary expansion
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run the captioning model on the original RSICD dataset using ResNet-101; record baseline METEOR score.
  2. Apply the same model to the GPT-corrected dataset; compare METEOR scores and sample captions.
  3. Repeat experiments with MnasNet to verify performance gains are not architecture-dependent.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of GPT-corrected captions vary across different remote sensing image scene classes? The paper mentions 30 unique scene classes in the RSICD dataset but does not analyze performance variations across these classes.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal temperature parameter setting for ChatGPT when generating captions for remote sensing images? The paper mentions using the default temperature value of 1.0 but notes this could be adjusted to increase randomness.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of GPT-corrected captions compare to human-generated captions for the same images? The paper only compares GPT-corrected captions to the original human-generated captions in the dataset, not to new human-generated captions.

### Open Question 4
How does the length of the original captions affect the quality of GPT corrections? The paper does not analyze how caption length influences the effectiveness of GPT corrections.

## Limitations
- Findings based on a single remote sensing captioning dataset (RSICD) and specific captioning architecture, limiting generalizability.
- Reliance on ChatGPT introduces potential variability in augmentation quality due to API rate limits, model version changes, or prompt sensitivity.
- Extent of caption correction is unclear—it's not specified whether all captions were modified or only those with clear grammatical issues.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The general mechanism that correcting grammatical errors and increasing caption diversity can improve readability and naturalism of generated captions is well-supported by the data and intuitive.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that LLMs are a "simple and effective" augmentation method assumes the simplicity extends beyond a single dataset and model type.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that architectural differences significantly affect the magnitude of gains from caption augmentation is weakly supported—performance improvements appear relatively uniform across architectures.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same ChatGPT augmentation pipeline to a different remote sensing captioning dataset (e.g., UCM-captions or Sydney-captions) and retrain the captioning model to verify if METEOR improvements replicate.
2. Conduct a human evaluation study to check if GPT-corrected captions introduce hallucinations or details not present in the original images, ensuring the augmentation does not mislead the model.
3. Train models using: (a) original captions, (b) captions with only grammar corrections, and (c) captions with only vocabulary expansion. Compare METEOR scores to isolate which aspect of augmentation drives performance gains.
