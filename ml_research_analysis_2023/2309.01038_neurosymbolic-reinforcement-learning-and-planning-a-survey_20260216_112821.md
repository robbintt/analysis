# Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning and Planning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.01038
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01038
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of neurosymbolic RL, categorizing works into three models and identifying research opportunities and challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning (Neurosymbolic RL), an emerging field that combines neural networks and symbolic reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning. The authors categorize research works into three main RL models: Learning for Reasoning, Reasoning for Learning, and Learning-Reasoning. They analyze the neural and symbolic components used in each work, as well as RL algorithms, state space, action space, and policy modules. The survey identifies opportunities for Neurosymbolic RL in various domains, including robotics, gaming, intelligent question answering, safe reinforcement learning, and optimizing RL parameters. Challenges in automated generation of symbolic knowledge, verification and validation, Neurosymbolic RL algorithms, and balancing reasoning and learning are also discussed.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves collecting and reviewing 40 referenced papers on Neurosymbolic RL, covering neural components, symbolic components, RL algorithms, state space, action space, and policy modules. The authors categorize each paper into one of the three main RL models based on the role of neural and symbolic components in the RL process, and further sub-categorize based on applications. However, the specific criteria used to categorize papers into the three RL models are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to ensure consistent classification. The exact method for analyzing and comparing the RL components across different works is also not detailed, which could lead to subjective interpretations.

## Key Results
- Neurosymbolic RL enhances learning ability and reasoning skills by integrating neural and symbolic components.
- The survey categorizes neurosymbolic RL research into three main models: Learning for Reasoning, Reasoning for Learning, and Learning-Reasoning.
- Opportunities for neurosymbolic RL include robotics, gaming, intelligent question answering, safe reinforcement learning, and optimizing RL parameters.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The neurosymbolic integration improves reinforcement learning performance by reducing the search space of symbolic reasoning through neural feature extraction.
- Mechanism: Neural networks extract high-dimensional continuous representations from raw or unstructured inputs and map them to lower-dimensional symbolic spaces. This transformation enables the symbolic reasoning component to operate on a compressed, meaningful representation, thereby accelerating convergence and reducing computational complexity.
- Core assumption: The symbolic system can effectively operate on the symbolic representation derived from neural embeddings, and the mapping preserves essential decision-relevant information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Neurosymbolic agent has advantage of using both neural and symbolic counterpart so as to enhance not only its learning ability but also reasoning skills."
  - [section] "The neural part to transform it into a symbolic form that the symbolic system can work with."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss the neural-to-symbolic mapping mechanism.
- Break condition: If the neural-to-symbolic mapping loses critical information or the symbolic system cannot process the derived representation, the performance gains would be nullified.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Symbolic systems improve reinforcement learning interpretability by distilling learned neural policies into explicit programmatic rules.
- Mechanism: After a neural policy is trained via reinforcement learning, the symbolic component performs policy extraction or synthesis, converting the neural policy into a set of interpretable rules or decision trees. This process enables human oversight, verification, and debugging of the agent's behavior.
- Core assumption: The neural policy is sufficiently stable and generalizable for symbolic extraction, and the extraction process does not degrade performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach not only adds reasoning and explaining capabilities to DRL but also provides a breakthrough in the field of RL."
  - [section] "By leveraging DNNs, the model can benefit from their ability to learn complex patterns and generalize from data... The symbolic system can understand and interpret the reasoning process, making it easier to verify and understand the decisions made by the model."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss policy extraction or interpretability gains.
- Break condition: If the neural policy is too complex or noisy, symbolic extraction may fail or produce inaccurate rules, undermining interpretability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bidirectional neurosymbolic communication balances learning and reasoning by enabling iterative refinement between neural and symbolic components.
- Mechanism: The neural component generates candidate actions or value estimates, while the symbolic component validates or refines these outputs based on domain knowledge or logical constraints. The refined outputs are fed back to the neural network for further training, creating a closed-loop improvement cycle.
- Core assumption: The symbolic component's constraints are compatible with the neural learning process and do not overly restrict exploration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The two parts work together which make the RL model more interpretable and explainable."
  - [section] "In the Learning-Reasoning RL model, the neural and symbolic components work bidirectionally, where the output of one can be the input of the other."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss bidirectional communication or iterative refinement.
- Break condition: If symbolic constraints are too rigid or misaligned with the task, they may impede learning progress or cause the agent to converge to suboptimal policies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) fundamentals (MDP/POMDP, policy, reward, value function, model)
  - Why needed here: Understanding RL is essential to grasp how neurosymbolic systems integrate with the learning loop and how symbolic knowledge can shape policy or reward.
  - Quick check question: In an MDP, what are the four main components that define the agent-environment interaction?
- Concept: Symbolic reasoning basics (first-order logic, knowledge graphs, decision trees, automata)
  - Why needed here: Symbolic systems provide structured knowledge, constraints, and interpretability; knowing their forms helps design effective integration points.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between a knowledge graph and a decision tree in representing domain knowledge?
- Concept: Neural network feature extraction and embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: Neural components must transform raw or unstructured data into symbolic-compatible representations; understanding embeddings is key to designing the mapping.
  - Quick check question: How does a convolutional neural network typically reduce high-dimensional image data into a lower-dimensional feature vector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Neural network module: Handles perception, feature extraction, and policy/value estimation.
  - Symbolic reasoning module: Encodes domain knowledge, performs policy extraction, or provides constraints.
  - RL core: Defines the environment, reward, and learning algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO).
  - Integration layer: Manages data flow and synchronization between neural and symbolic modules.
- Critical path:
  1. Environment observation → Neural network → Symbolic module (if needed) → Action selection → Environment step → Reward update → Policy update.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tight coupling vs. loose coupling: Tight coupling enables faster feedback but may reduce modularity; loose coupling allows independent development but can slow convergence.
  - Symbolic complexity vs. neural capacity: More complex symbolic rules may require more powerful neural feature extractors and longer training times.
  - Interpretability vs. performance: Highly interpretable symbolic policies may underperform compared to pure neural policies in complex domains.
- Failure signatures:
  - Neural-to-symbolic mapping loss: Agent performance degrades after integration.
  - Symbolic constraint conflicts: Learning stalls or diverges due to overly restrictive rules.
  - Integration latency: Slow communication between modules leads to poor real-time performance.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Benchmark a simple gridworld with only neural DQN, then integrate a symbolic rule-based reward shaper and compare learning curves.
  2. Train a neural policy on a partially observable environment, extract a symbolic policy, and evaluate interpretability and performance trade-offs.
  3. Implement bidirectional feedback where symbolic constraints guide neural exploration in a sparse-reward task, measuring convergence speed and final reward.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can symbolic knowledge be automatically generated and updated in real-time for Neurosymbolic RL systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies automated generation of symbolic knowledge as a challenge, noting that current methods are time-consuming and non-scalable.

- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating scalable algorithms for automatic generation and real-time updating of symbolic knowledge, validated in complex Neurosymbolic RL scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective methods for verifying and validating Neurosymbolic RL models in safety-critical applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of validation and verification methods for Neurosymbolic RL models, especially in safety-critical settings like autonomous driving.
- Why unresolved: The field is relatively new, and existing verification techniques need expansion to be applicable to Neurosymbolic RL domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and successful application of verification and validation frameworks specifically designed for Neurosymbolic RL models in safety-critical scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the balance between reasoning and learning be optimized in Neurosymbolic RL systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the challenge of balancing reasoning and learning in Neurosymbolic RL, particularly in transitioning between neural and symbolic components without losing power.
- Why unresolved: Transitioning between components can lead to loss of learning or reasoning power, and the symbol grounding problem adds complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating effective strategies for optimizing the balance between reasoning and learning in Neurosymbolic RL systems, validated through improved performance in various tasks.

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on literature review rather than empirical validation of claimed mechanisms.
- The specific criteria used to categorize papers into the three RL models are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to ensure consistent classification.
- The exact method for analyzing and comparing the RL components across different works is not detailed, which could lead to subjective interpretations.

## Confidence
- High: The categorization framework (Learning for Reasoning, Reasoning for Learning, Learning-Reasoning) is clearly defined and well-organized.
- Medium: The identification of opportunities and challenges in neurosymbolic RL is reasonable but not empirically validated.
- Low: The specific mechanisms by which neurosymbolic integration improves performance lack experimental evidence in the survey.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a reproducibility study using a simple gridworld environment to compare pure neural RL with neurosymbolic RL using symbolic reward shaping.
2. Perform a systematic review of the 40 referenced papers to verify the categorization accuracy and identify any papers that may fit multiple categories.
3. Design an experiment to test the bidirectional communication mechanism by implementing symbolic constraints that guide neural exploration in a sparse-reward task and measuring convergence speed.
