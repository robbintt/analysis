# Comparative Analysis of Multilingual Text Classification & Identification through Deep Learning and Embedding Visualization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.03789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03789
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: FastText embeddings (16D) achieved 99.85% accuracy compared to Sentence Transformer (384D) at 95.74%

## Executive Summary
This study compares multilingual text classification and language detection using three language detection models (LangDetect, LangId, FastText) and three classification models (MLP, LSTM, CNN) with two embedding types (FastText and Sentence Transformer). The research demonstrates that lower-dimensional FastText embeddings (16D) trained on a large multilingual corpus outperform higher-dimensional Sentence Transformer embeddings (384D), with the FastText MLP model achieving 99.85% accuracy across all evaluation metrics. t-SNE visualization revealed clearer clustering patterns for FastText embeddings, supporting the performance findings. The results emphasize the importance of large multilingual corpora for effective embedding training and highlight the effectiveness of MLP architectures for this specific task.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comparative approach using a multilingual text dataset with 17 languages. Language detection was performed using LangDetect, LangId, and FastText models. Text embeddings were generated using FastText (16D) and Sentence Transformer (384D) approaches. t-SNE was applied for 2D visualization of embeddings to observe clustering patterns. Three classification models (MLP, LSTM, CNN) were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The experimental design focused on comparing embedding types and model architectures to identify optimal combinations for multilingual text classification.

## Key Results
- FastText embeddings (16D) achieved 99.85% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming Sentence Transformer embeddings (384D) at 95.74% accuracy
- FastText embeddings showed clearer clustering patterns in 2D visualization compared to Sentence Transformer embeddings
- MLP classification model outperformed LSTM and CNN models when using both embedding types
- Lower-dimensional embeddings (16D) proved more effective than higher-dimensional embeddings (384D) when trained on large multilingual corpora

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FastText embeddings with lower dimensionality (16D) outperform higher-dimensional Sentence Transformer embeddings (384D) in multilingual text classification.
- Mechanism: The 16D FastText embeddings capture essential language-specific patterns and statistical properties effectively due to training on a large multilingual corpus, enabling clear clustering in 2D visualization. Lower dimensionality reduces noise and computational complexity while maintaining discriminative power.
- Core assumption: A sufficiently large and diverse multilingual corpus enables low-dimensional embeddings to retain critical language-specific features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FastText embeddings (16D) trained on a large multilingual corpus showed clearer clustering and superior performance, with the FastText MLP model achieving 99.85% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score."
  - [section] "The results indicate that the dimensionality of the embeddings played a significant role in the clustering of languages, with FastText embeddings showing clear clustering in the 2D visualization due to its training on a large multilingual corpus."
  - [corpus] Weak - the paper mentions "large multilingual corpus" but doesn't specify corpus size or diversity metrics.
- Break condition: If the corpus is too small or unrepresentative, low-dimensional embeddings would lose critical language-specific information, degrading classification performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models outperform LSTM and CNN models for language classification using the tested embeddings.
- Mechanism: MLPs effectively capture both local and global patterns in the embedding space through their fully connected architecture, learning complex relationships between input features without the sequential processing overhead or local context limitations of LSTM and CNN models.
- Core assumption: Language classification can be effectively performed as a non-sequential pattern recognition task where MLP's global pattern detection is advantageous.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the FastText multi-layer perceptron model achieved remarkable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming the Sentence Transformer model."
  - [section] "The MLP model is a feed-forward neural network with multiple layers, while LSTM is a recurrent neural network designed to capture sequential dependencies. CNNs are typically used for image processing but can be applied to extract local features from sequences."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct comparison of MLP vs LSTM/CNN performance on identical embeddings is provided in the corpus evidence.
- Break condition: If language classification requires capturing sequential dependencies or local contextual patterns that MLPs cannot represent, LSTM or CNN architectures would outperform MLPs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: t-SNE visualization reveals clustering patterns that correlate with classification performance differences between embedding types.
- Mechanism: t-SNE preserves pairwise distances when reducing dimensionality, making it possible to visually identify whether embeddings maintain language-specific clusters. Clear clustering in 2D visualization indicates that embeddings preserve language-discriminative information that translates to better classification accuracy.
- Core assumption: Visual clustering patterns in t-SNE space correlate with the discriminative power of embeddings for classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FastText embeddings showing clearer clustering in the 2D visualization due to its training on a large multilingual corpus."
  - [section] "t-SNE is a technique that maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving pairwise distances. This allowed us to visualize the embeddings in two dimensions and observe clustering patterns among different languages."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't provide quantitative measures of clustering quality or correlation with classification accuracy.
- Break condition: If t-SNE creates artificial clusters not reflective of true embedding structure, or if classification relies on features not visible in 2D projection, visual clustering would not correlate with actual performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Embedding dimensionality and its impact on model performance
  - Why needed here: The paper directly compares 16D FastText embeddings with 384D Sentence Transformer embeddings, showing that lower dimensionality can outperform higher dimensionality when trained on appropriate data.
  - Quick check question: If you train embeddings on a corpus with only 5 languages versus 50 languages, how might this affect the optimal dimensionality for classification tasks?

- Concept: Neural network architecture selection for text classification
  - Why needed here: The paper compares MLP, LSTM, and CNN models, finding MLP superior for this specific task, which requires understanding the strengths and limitations of each architecture type.
  - Quick check question: What architectural feature of LSTM makes it particularly suited for sequence prediction tasks, and why might this be unnecessary for language identification?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction techniques for visualization
  - Why needed here: t-SNE is used to visualize high-dimensional embeddings in 2D space, and understanding how it preserves structure while reducing dimensions is crucial for interpreting the clustering results.
  - Quick check question: How does t-SNE differ from PCA in terms of preserving local vs. global structure when reducing dimensions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Language detection (LangDetect/LangId/FastText) → Embedding generation (FastText/Sentence Transformer) → Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) → Classification models (MLP/LSTM/CNN) → Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Critical path: Embedding generation → Classification model training → Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - FastText (16D) vs Sentence Transformer (384D): Lower dimensionality reduces computational cost and potential overfitting but requires sufficient training data to maintain discriminative power
  - MLP vs LSTM/CNN: MLPs are computationally simpler and effective for non-sequential pattern recognition, while LSTMs/CNNs better capture sequential or local patterns but may introduce unnecessary complexity
  - t-SNE perplexity and iteration parameters: Higher perplexity captures more global structure but may obscure local clusters; more iterations improve optimization but increase computation time
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor classification accuracy despite clear t-SNE clustering: Indicates that visual clusters don't translate to discriminative features for the specific classification task
  - Good accuracy but poor t-SNE clustering: Suggests that classification relies on features not well-preserved in 2D visualization
  - High variance in performance across different runs: Indicates sensitivity to random initialization or insufficient training data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train and evaluate all three classification models (MLP, LSTM, CNN) using only FastText embeddings, then only Sentence Transformer embeddings, to establish individual model performance baselines
  2. Embedding ablation: Train FastText embeddings with varying dimensionalities (8D, 16D, 32D, 64D) and evaluate classification performance to determine optimal dimensionality
  3. Corpus size impact: Train FastText embeddings on subsets of the multilingual corpus (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and evaluate how corpus size affects both t-SNE clustering quality and classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the performance of the language classification models vary with different embedding dimensionalities beyond 16 and 384?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares FastText embeddings with a dimensionality of 16 and Sentence Transformer embeddings with a dimensionality of 384, but does not explore other dimensionalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores two specific embedding dimensionalities and does not provide insights into how varying the dimensionality would impact model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with embeddings of different dimensionalities and comparing their performance in language classification tasks would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would the performance of the language classification models change when applied to a larger and more diverse dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a dataset consisting of text and language columns with 17 different languages, but does not explore the impact of dataset size and diversity on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how the models would perform on larger and more diverse datasets, which could potentially reveal limitations or strengths of the models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with larger and more diverse datasets and evaluating the performance of the language classification models would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the performance of the language classification models change when applied to low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not specifically address the performance of the models on low-resource languages, which are languages with limited available data for training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how the models would perform on low-resource languages, which could be an important consideration for real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with low-resource languages and evaluating the performance of the language classification models would provide evidence to resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Unspecified dataset details and lack of corpus size/diversity metrics prevent proper evaluation of embedding training quality
- No quantitative measures of t-SNE clustering quality or statistical significance testing between model performances
- Limited comparison to only three model architectures without exploring alternatives that might better capture sequential dependencies

## Confidence
- FastText vs Sentence Transformer performance claims: **Medium** - supported by accuracy metrics but lacks detailed experimental controls and dataset specifications
- MLP superiority over LSTM/CNN: **Low** - no direct comparison on identical embeddings provided, and the claim assumes language classification is purely non-sequential
- t-SNE clustering correlation with performance: **Low** - visual patterns are described but not quantitatively linked to classification metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying embedding dimensionality (8D, 16D, 32D, 64D) with FastText to determine optimal dimensionality and validate the 16D claim
2. Perform statistical significance testing between MLP, LSTM, and CNN performance across multiple runs to confirm MLP superiority
3. Measure correlation coefficients between t-SNE clustering metrics (silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index) and classification accuracy to validate the visualization-performance relationship
