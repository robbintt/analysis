# GEO: Generative Engine Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2311.09735
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GEO methods can boost source visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses through targeted content modifications

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), a new paradigm for content creators to optimize their websites for visibility in generative engine responses. The authors formalize the emerging framework of generative engines (GEs) that use LLMs to synthesize and summarize information from multiple sources. They propose a black-box optimization framework and introduce GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of 10K diverse user queries across multiple domains. Through rigorous evaluation, they demonstrate that GEO methods can boost visibility by up to 40% in GE responses. The paper shows that strategies like adding citations, quotations, and statistics significantly improve source visibility, with effectiveness varying across domains.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize generative engines as systems that retrieve sources from a search engine and synthesize responses using LLMs. They create GEO-bench with 10K queries across 9 domains and implement 9 GEO methods that modify source content through paraphrasing, adding statistics/citations, and improving fluency. For evaluation, they use two metrics: Position-Adjusted Word Count (measuring visibility) and Subjective Impression (human ratings). The methods are tested through controlled experiments and wild experiments using Perplexity.ai, with results showing relative improvements up to 40% for certain methods.

## Key Results
- GEO methods can boost source visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses
- Adding citations, quotations, and statistics significantly improves source visibility
- Effectiveness of GEO methods varies across domains, with some methods performing better in specific contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding authoritative citations and statistics directly to source content increases visibility in GE responses by making the source appear more credible and informative to the generative model.
- Mechanism: The generative engine's response generation process uses the credibility and informativeness of retrieved sources to construct its response. When a source contains verifiable statistics or authoritative citations, the GE is more likely to include it in the final response, thereby increasing its visibility.
- Core assumption: The generative model weights sources with more credible and data-backed information higher when synthesizing responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "including citations, quotations from relevant sources, and statistics can significantly boost source visibility"
  - [section] "Methods that performed well in our generative engine such as Cite Sources, Statistics Addition show high improvements of up to 9% and 37% on the two metrics"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains multiple GEO-related papers but no direct experimental data supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the generative engine's response generation process does not consider source credibility or if the model has a bias against cited information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Improving the fluency and readability of source content increases its visibility in GE responses by making it more accessible to the generative model.
- Mechanism: Generative engines are designed to produce clear, well-structured responses. When source content is easier to understand and more fluently written, the GE is more likely to incorporate it into the final response, as it aligns with the model's output preferences.
- Core assumption: The generative model prefers and prioritizes sources that are written in a clear, fluent manner when synthesizing responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "stylistic changes such as improving the fluency and readability of the source text... resulted in a significant boost of 15-30% in visibility"
  - [section] "the addition of relevant statistics wherever possible, ensures source visibility increasing in the final Generative Engine response"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains GEO-related papers but no direct experimental data supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the generative engine's response generation process does not prioritize source readability or if the model has a bias against simplified language.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using an authoritative and persuasive tone in source content increases its visibility in GE responses by making it appear more valuable and trustworthy to the generative model.
- Mechanism: Generative engines are designed to provide authoritative and trustworthy information to users. When a source is written in a confident and persuasive manner, the GE is more likely to include it in the final response, as it aligns with the model's goal of providing high-quality information.
- Core assumption: The generative model prioritizes sources that are written in an authoritative and persuasive tone when synthesizing responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "simply emphasizing parts of the text and using a more persuasive text style can also lead to decent improvements in visibility"
  - [section] "one would expect a more persuasive and authoritative tone in website content can boost visibility. However, to the contrary we find no significant improvement"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains GEO-related papers but no direct experimental data supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the generative engine's response generation process does not prioritize source tone or if the model has a bias against authoritative language.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their role in generative engines
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs work is crucial for grasping how generative engines synthesize responses and why certain GEO methods are effective.
  - Quick check question: How do LLMs differ from traditional search engines in terms of information retrieval and response generation?

- Concept: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) principles and their limitations in the context of generative engines
  - Why needed here: GEO is a new paradigm that builds upon traditional SEO but requires different strategies due to the unique nature of generative engines.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between optimizing content for traditional search engines and generative engines?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and generation
  - Why needed here: GEO methods often involve modifying text content, and understanding NLP techniques is essential for developing effective strategies.
  - Quick check question: How can NLP techniques be used to improve the fluency, readability, and credibility of source content?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Search Engine -> Generative Models (query reformulation, summarization, response generation) -> User Interface
- Critical path: Source retrieval -> Response generation based on retrieved sources -> Final response display
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing source visibility improvement with maintaining original content meaning and relevance
- Failure signatures: Inability to improve source visibility, responses not grounded in sources, inclusion of irrelevant/low-quality sources
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and evaluate the "Cite Sources" GEO method on a sample of queries to measure its impact on source visibility.
  2. Analyze the effect of improving source fluency and readability on its visibility in GE responses.
  3. Investigate the relationship between source tone and its inclusion in the final response by testing the "Authoritative" GEO method.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but the methodology suggests several areas for future research: How different generative engine architectures might impact GEO method effectiveness, the long-term effects of widespread GEO adoption on information quality and diversity, and how to adapt GEO methods for multimodal generative engines that generate responses beyond text.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on subjective human ratings for one metric, introducing potential rater bias
- Study focuses primarily on English-language queries, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Results are based on a single generative engine (Perplexity.ai), which may not generalize across different GE implementations

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core finding that GEO methods can improve source visibility in generative engine responses
- Medium confidence in the relative effectiveness rankings between different GEO methods
- Low confidence in the long-term sustainability of these optimization strategies

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed GEO methods across multiple generative engines (e.g., Google's SGE, Bing Chat) to verify consistency of results
2. Implement a monitoring framework to track the effectiveness of GEO methods over time
3. Validate the GEO framework on non-English queries and additional domains (e.g., healthcare, legal)
