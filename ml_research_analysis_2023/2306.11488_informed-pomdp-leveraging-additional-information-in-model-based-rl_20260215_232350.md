# Informed POMDP: Leveraging Additional Information in Model-Based RL

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.11488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11488
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Significant improvements in convergence speed and final performance compared to standard Dreamer algorithm when additional state information is available during training

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the informed POMDP, a new learning paradigm that distinguishes between training information and execution observations in partially observable environments. The key innovation is leveraging additional state information available during training to learn sufficient statistics for optimal control. By adapting the Dreamer algorithm to use an "informed world model" that generates latent trajectories from additional information rather than observations, the authors demonstrate significant performance improvements in convergence speed and final policy quality, particularly when the additional information provides better supervision than raw observations.

## Method Summary
The method extends the DreamerV3 algorithm by replacing the observation-based world model with an information-based world model. During training, the algorithm receives additional state information alongside standard observations, actions, and rewards. The informed world model learns to predict rewards and information given actions and history, rather than predicting observations. This learned generative model enables latent trajectory generation without explicit observation reconstruction, allowing the policy and value function to be trained on imagined trajectories based on the more informative additional information.

## Key Results
- Significant performance improvements on Mountain Hike environments with additional state information
- Better convergence speed compared to standard Dreamer algorithm across tested environments
- Demonstrated effectiveness in both flickering and non-flickering environments when additional information is available
- Consistent improvements when additional information provides better signal than observations about the underlying state

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Additional training information that is conditionally independent of observations given the information can improve policy learning speed and quality.
- Mechanism: The additional information provides a better signal for learning a predictive sufficient statistic, which in turn leads to better policies.
- Core assumption: The additional information satisfies the conditional independence assumption.
- Evidence anchors: Significant improvements in convergence speed and final performance when additional state information is available.
- Break condition: If the additional information violates the conditional independence assumption or is not sufficiently informative about the state.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learning a model of the information distribution instead of the observation distribution is a better objective in practice.
- Mechanism: The information is more informative than observations about the Markovian state, leading to better latent representations and policies.
- Core assumption: The information distribution is easier to learn than the observation distribution and provides better supervision for policy learning.
- Evidence anchors: The information is more informative than the observation about the Markovian state according to the data processing inequality.
- Break condition: If the information distribution is harder to learn than the observation distribution or provides worse supervision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The informed world model can generate latent trajectories without explicitly reconstructing imagined observations.
- Mechanism: The VRNN only uses the latent representation of the observation to update the statistic, allowing the use of the prior distribution to generate latent trajectories.
- Core assumption: The latent representation is sufficient for updating the statistic and does not require explicit reconstruction of observations.
- Evidence anchors: The learned generative model allows generating latent trajectories without explicit observation reconstruction.
- Break condition: If the latent representation is not sufficient for updating the statistic or explicit observation reconstruction is necessary.

  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of model-based RL compared to model-free RL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Informed POMDP → Recurrent statistic fθ → Information decoder qiθ → Reward decoder qrθ → Prior qpθ → Encoder qeθ → Latent policy gϕ → Critic vψ

- Critical path:
  1. Learn the informed world model (fθ, qiθ, qrθ, qpθ, qeθ) from interaction with the informed POMDP
  2. Generate imagined trajectories using the informed world model
  3. Optimize the latent policy gϕ and critic vψ based on the imagined returns

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using the information instead of observations as supervision: Pros - better signal for learning sufficient statistics, Cons - may hurt performance in some environments
  - Learning a latent representation instead of explicit observation reconstruction: Pros - more efficient, Cons - may lose some information

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on environments with high observation stochasticity
  - Degradation in environments where the information is not sufficiently informative about the state
  - Difficulty in learning the information distribution compared to the observation distribution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of the informed Dreamer and the standard Dreamer on a simple POMDP with additional state information available during training (e.g., Mountain Hike)
  2. Evaluate the effect of using different levels of additional information (e.g., full state, partial state, or noisy state) on the performance of the informed Dreamer
  3. Test the robustness of the informed Dreamer to violations of the conditional independence assumption by using additional information that is not conditionally independent of observations given the state

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions but implicitly raises several:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of the additional information (i) affect the performance of the informed POMDP approach compared to standard methods?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses that the performance improvement varies across different environments and mentions that the design of the information i is crucial.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows varying results across different environments but does not provide a systematic analysis of how the quality of additional information impacts performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the performance across environments with varying quality and types of additional information, along with a metric to quantify information quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the informed POMDP approach be extended to multi-agent settings where each agent has access to different additional information?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on single-agent environments and does not discuss multi-agent scenarios.
- Why unresolved: Multi-agent systems introduce additional complexity in terms of coordination and information sharing, which is not addressed in the current framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrating the application of informed POMDP to multi-agent environments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the informed POMDP approach handle environments with non-stationary dynamics or changing reward structures over time?
- Basis in paper: The paper assumes stationary dynamics and does not address scenarios where the environment's dynamics or reward structures change during training or execution.
- Why unresolved: Non-stationary environments pose challenges for model-based RL approaches, and it is unclear how the informed world model would adapt to such changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments in non-stationary environments showing the robustness and adaptability of the informed POMDP approach.

## Limitations
- The conditional independence assumption between observations and additional information given the state may be restrictive in real-world applications
- Empirical evaluation covers a limited set of tasks and doesn't thoroughly explore failure modes when the assumption is violated
- Sample efficiency comparisons are limited, requiring more rigorous analysis of performance as a function of training interactions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework and mathematical derivations for the informed POMDP formulation are sound
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical improvements over DreamerV3 are demonstrated, but sample efficiency comparisons are limited
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism by which additional information improves learning is theoretically justified but requires more extensive empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on environments where the conditional independence assumption is partially violated to understand robustness boundaries
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (information decoder, reward decoder) to performance gains
3. Evaluate sample efficiency metrics more rigorously by measuring performance as a function of training interactions across diverse POMDP tasks
