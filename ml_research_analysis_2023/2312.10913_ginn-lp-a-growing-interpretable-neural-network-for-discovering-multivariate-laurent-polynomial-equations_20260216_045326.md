# GINN-LP: A Growing Interpretable Neural Network for Discovering Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Equations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10913
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10913
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GINN-LP achieves 87.5% solution rate on multivariate Laurent polynomial discovery, outperforming state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods by 7.1% absolute margin.

## Executive Summary
GINN-LP is an interpretable neural network designed to discover multivariate Laurent polynomial equations from data. The approach uses a novel "power-term approximator" block that employs logarithmic and exponential activations to directly model polynomial terms, combined with a neural network growth strategy and sparsity regularization to identify concise equations. Evaluated on 48 multivariate Laurent polynomial datasets from SRBench, GINN-LP achieves a solution rate of 87.5%, outperforming state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods by an absolute margin of 7.1%. An ensemble method combining GINN-LP with secondary SR techniques further improves results to 95.1% solution rate and 99.1% accuracy (R2 > 0.99) across 113 datasets.

## Method Summary
GINN-LP uses an end-to-end differentiable interpretable neural network architecture with power-term approximator (PTA) blocks to model Laurent polynomial terms. The method implements a neural network growth strategy that iteratively adds PTA blocks in parallel, with sparsity regularization applied during training to promote concise equations. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with decaying learning rate, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping based on validation MSE improvement. After training, an unregularized phase refines the model, and exponents are rounded to the nearest integer to produce valid Laurent polynomial equations.

## Key Results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The "power-term approximator" (PTA) block can model any single term in a multivariate Laurent polynomial by exploiting the log-exponential identity.
- Mechanism: A PTA block uses a linear combination of logarithms of inputs followed by an exponential activation: y = exp(w1*log(x1) + w2*log(x2) + ... + wn*log(xn)) = x1^w1 * x2^w2 * ... * xn^wn. This directly produces monomials (and their reciprocals when weights are negative) that match Laurent polynomial terms.
- Core assumption: Input values are positive real numbers (since log is undefined for non-positive values).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This is facilitated by a new type of interpretable neural network block, named the 'power-term approximator block', consisting of logarithmic and exponential activation functions."
  - [section]: "If x1, x2, ..., xn denote the inputs to the block, the output yd of the linear activated neuron and the output of the network y are given by, yd = w1 log(x1) + w2 log(x2) + ... + wn log(xn) = log(x1^w1 x2^w2 ...xn^wn) (3) y = eyd = x1^w1 x2^w2 ...xn^wn (4)"
  - [corpus]: Weak; no direct citations to log-exponential identities for Laurent terms.
- Break condition: Inputs contain zero or negative values, causing log to be undefined or complex.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Growing the network by adding PTA blocks in parallel enables discovery of equations with multiple terms while controlling overfitting.
- Mechanism: Start with one PTA block, train, evaluate validation MSE, and add another block if performance improves sufficiently. Each new block is initialized randomly and trained alongside existing blocks, allowing the network to approximate multi-term Laurent polynomials. Early stopping based on validation MSE drop prevents overfitting.
- Core assumption: The number of PTA blocks needed equals the number of terms in the true equation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a neural network growth strategy that will enable finding the suitable number of terms in the Laurent polynomial that represents the data."
  - [section]: "When the network is grown, a new, randomly initialized PTA block is added in parallel without altering the weights of the already trained PTA blocks... This is performed iteratively till the network is grown to a pre-defined maximum size, or till an early stopping condition is reached."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no external citations supporting growth strategies for symbolic regression.
- Break condition: If the true equation has more terms than the maximum number of PTA blocks allowed, or if early stopping threshold is too strict.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sparsity regularization during training promotes concise equations by driving irrelevant coefficients to zero.
- Mechanism: Apply L1 and L2 regularization on the weight matrix during training, encouraging many weights to become exactly or near zero. After regularization, an unregularized phase allows remaining coefficients to converge accurately. Rounding exponents to nearest integer ensures valid Laurent polynomial form.
- Core assumption: Sparse weights correspond to fewer terms in the discovered equation, matching the simplicity preference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "along with sparsity regularization to promote the discovery of concise equations."
  - [section]: "During the regularized training phase, a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization is applied... we impose sparsity-promoting regularization on our interpretable neural network... a sparser weight matrix would result in a simpler equation."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no direct citations to sparsity in Laurent polynomial discovery.
- Break condition: If regularization strength is too high, important terms may be zeroed out, leading to underfitting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multivariate Laurent polynomials and their structure.
  - Why needed here: GINN-LP is designed to discover equations of this exact form; understanding the structure is essential for interpreting model outputs and designing PTA blocks.
  - Quick check question: What is the general form of a multivariate Laurent polynomial with two variables and total degree up to 2?

- Concept: Neural network growth strategies and early stopping.
  - Why needed here: The method incrementally adds PTA blocks and stops when validation performance plateaus; understanding this prevents overfitting and ensures efficient training.
  - Quick check question: How does the early stopping condition in GINN-LP differ from standard neural network early stopping?

- Concept: Sparsity-inducing regularization (L1/L2) and its effect on model complexity.
  - Why needed here: Regularization is used to promote concise equations; understanding its impact is crucial for tuning hyperparameters and interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization in terms of the sparsity of the learned weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer → PTA blocks (parallel) → linear combination layer → output
- Critical path: Forward pass through PTA blocks to produce monomial terms, linear combination to sum terms, loss computation (MSE), backpropagation through logs and exps to update weights, growth decision based on validation MSE
- Design tradeoffs: More PTA blocks increase expressiveness but risk overfitting; regularization strength balances sparsity vs accuracy; early stopping threshold affects model size
- Failure signatures: If PTA blocks cannot model needed exponents (e.g., negative inputs), training diverges or produces NaNs; if growth strategy is too aggressive, model overfits; if regularization is too strong, model underfits
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train GINN-LP on a simple single-term Laurent polynomial (e.g., y = x1^2 * x2^-1) and verify PTA block output matches expected monomial
  2. Test growth strategy by training on a two-term polynomial and confirming that two PTA blocks are added before early stopping
  3. Apply regularization and check that irrelevant weights shrink toward zero while important weights remain stable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise mechanism by which the neural network growth strategy in GINN-LP balances overfitting and model complexity, and how does this interact with the sparsity regularization to optimize model selection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes a neural network growth strategy that iteratively adds PTA blocks and applies sparsity regularization, but does not provide detailed evidence of the interaction between these mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The interaction between the growth strategy and regularization is described qualitatively but lacks quantitative analysis or ablation studies to demonstrate their combined effect on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study comparing GINN-LP with and without growth strategy or sparsity regularization, and their impact on overfitting and model complexity, would provide clarity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does GINN-LP's performance change when dealing with negative input values, and what modifications would be necessary to handle such cases effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that GINN-LP assumes all input values are positive real numbers due to the use of natural logarithmic activation, but does not explore solutions or performance implications with negative inputs.
- Why unresolved: The limitation regarding negative inputs is acknowledged, but no empirical evidence or theoretical framework is provided for addressing this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GINN-LP with datasets containing negative inputs and evaluating potential modifications, such as input transformations or alternative activation functions, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific effects of varying the number of training instances on the solution rate and model selection in GINN-LP, and how does this impact computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions training multiple instances of GINN-LP and selecting the best model, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how the number of instances affects performance or efficiency.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the training strategy, it lacks a comprehensive evaluation of how the number of training instances influences both solution rate and computational costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different numbers of training instances and analyzing their impact on solution rate, model selection, and training time would provide insights into optimizing this aspect of GINN-LP.

## Limitations
- Model performance decreases with high noise levels (>40%), reducing solution rate while maintaining R2 > 0.99 accuracy
- Limited to positive input values due to logarithmic activation, preventing direct handling of negative inputs
- Exact hyperparameter values and implementation details for growth strategy remain unclear, requiring careful tuning for optimal performance

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core PTA block mechanism using log-exponential identity to model Laurent polynomial terms
- Medium confidence: Neural network growth strategy and sparsity regularization effectiveness
- Low confidence: Exact hyperparameter values and implementation details for optimal performance

## Next Checks
1. Verify PTA block output matches expected monomials on controlled synthetic datasets with known Laurent polynomial structure
2. Test early stopping behavior by monitoring validation MSE trends during growth iterations and adjusting the 20% improvement threshold
3. Assess robustness to high noise levels (>40%) by systematically increasing noise and measuring solution rate and R2 accuracy degradation
