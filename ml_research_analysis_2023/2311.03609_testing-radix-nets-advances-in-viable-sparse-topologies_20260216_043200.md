# Testing RadiX-Nets: Advances in Viable Sparse Topologies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.03609
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03609
- **Reference count**: 21
- **Primary result**: RadiX-Nets show potential for sparse topologies matching dense network performance, but are sensitive to initialization and certain radices can cause erratic training behavior.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the RadiX-Net Testing Suite, a TensorFlow implementation for studying sparse neural network topologies. Using the Lenet 300-100 architecture on MNIST, the authors examine how network topology, initialization, and training behavior interact in RadiX-Nets. Key findings reveal that sparsity increases the occurrence of "strange models" with inconsistent training, random weight initialization significantly impacts learning ability especially at high sparsity, and RadiX-Nets maintain radial symmetry in saliency maps indicating better information preservation at high sparsity compared to magnitude-based pruning. The results suggest certain radices can generate stable sparse topologies while others lead to erratic behavior, highlighting the need for heuristics to select stable radices.

## Method Summary
The study uses the RadiX-Net Testing Suite implemented in TensorFlow to generate and train sparse neural networks with varying radices and sparsity levels on the MNIST dataset using Lenet 300-100 architecture. The methodology involves systematically varying radix lists to create different sparse connectivity patterns, training networks with different random initializations, and analyzing training accuracy, validation accuracy, and saliency maps. The testing suite includes visualization tools and a Pytest framework for validating implementation correctness.

## Key Results
- The frequency of "strange models" with erratic training behavior increases with sparsity but remains intermittent at lower sparsities
- Random weight initialization significantly impacts RadiX-Net learning ability, especially for networks with high sparsity levels (>90%)
- RadiX-Nets demonstrate radial symmetry in saliency maps, indicating better information preservation at high sparsities compared to magnitude-based pruning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Random initialization critically affects RadiX-Net training stability and accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: Sparse networks have fewer parameter degrees of freedom, making their loss landscape less smooth. Random initializations then place models in different regions of this rugged landscape, leading to varied convergence paths and final accuracies.
- **Core assumption**: Sparse topologies significantly alter the loss landscape geometry compared to dense networks.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Random weight initialization significantly impacts the ability of RadiX-Nets to learn, especially for high sparsity networks."
  - [section] "Figure 5 represents the effect of different random weight initializations on the post-training accuracy of RadiX-Nets... ranges are within 2%, though a quick fluctuation occurs once sparsities exceed 50%, increasing markedly in networks of 90% sparsity or higher."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus paper directly addresses random initialization in sparse networks.
- **Break condition**: If initialization method is changed to a structured or deterministic scheme, the instability could reduce or disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Certain radices generate stable sparse topologies while others lead to "strange models" with erratic training.
- **Mechanism**: Radices define the connectivity pattern in RadiX-Nets. Some patterns distribute input information evenly to outputs (stable), while others create bottlenecks or information loss (unstable). This effect is amplified at high sparsity.
- **Core assumption**: The radix list controls the distribution of input information through the network layers.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "certain radices can generate sparse topologies that match the performance of dense networks, while others lead to erratic training behavior."
  - [section] "Figure 8 shows the training behavior of all strange models found out of the original 426 models, showing highly variable accuracies that fail to match the 'normal' models after an order of magnitude more epochs."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus paper directly analyzes how radix choices affect network stability.
- **Break condition**: If all radices are constrained to uniform values, the strange model phenomenon might be eliminated.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Radial symmetry in RadiX-Nets preserves information flow at high sparsity levels better than magnitude-based pruning.
- **Mechanism**: Mixed radix topologies ensure equal outgoing connections from each node, preventing concentration of information in certain regions and maintaining uniform gradient flow across inputs.
- **Core assumption**: Uniform connectivity prevents gradient bottlenecks that occur in irregular sparse patterns.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "RadiX-Nets demonstrate radial symmetry in saliency maps, indicating their capacity to preserve information at high sparsities."
  - [section] "Figure 7 displays saliency maps for 99% sparsity in both low-magnitude-pruned and RadiX-Net models... the radial symmetry of the RadiX-Net's saliency map underscores its versatility across datasets and capacity to preserve information at high sparsities."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus paper directly compares radial symmetry preservation between pruning methods.
- **Break condition**: If network depth increases significantly, symmetry might break down due to cascading effects.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Mixed radix number systems and their application to neural network topology.
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding how radices define connectivity patterns is crucial for generating and debugging RadiX-Nets.
  - **Quick check question**: How does a radix list like [[10,10],[10]] translate into a sparse connectivity pattern between layers?

- **Concept**: Sparse matrix operations and their implementation in TensorFlow.
  - **Why needed here**: Efficient computation with sparse matrices is essential for scaling RadiX-Nets to large models.
  - **Quick check question**: What TensorFlow operations would you use to multiply a sparse mask with dense weight matrices?

- **Concept**: Loss landscape analysis and its relation to initialization and topology.
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding how topology and initialization affect convergence paths helps diagnose training issues.
  - **Quick check question**: How would you expect the loss landscape to differ between a dense network and a highly sparse RadiX-Net?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RadixLayer class → Mask function → CustomModel class → Training loop → Evaluation → Visualization tools
- **Critical path**: RadixLayer → CustomModel → Training loop → Evaluation → Visualization
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sparsity vs. stability: Higher sparsity reduces computation but increases risk of strange models
  - Radix selection vs. uniformity: Diverse radices create interesting patterns but may harm stability
  - Mask application frequency vs. memory: Applying masks every iteration ensures correctness but increases overhead
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Training accuracy plateaus below 60% after many epochs (strange models)
  - High variance in accuracy across different random seeds
  - Saliency maps lacking radial symmetry
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test a simple 2-layer RadiX-Net with uniform radix (e.g., [[5],[5]]) on MNIST to verify basic functionality
  2. Vary random seeds on a fixed topology to observe initialization effects on accuracy distribution
  3. Compare saliency maps between a RadiX-Net and a magnitude-pruned network at similar sparsity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can heuristics be developed to select radices that correlate with stable learning in RadiX-Nets?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper states that future work should focus on creating heuristics for which radices correlate to the irregular learning observed in "strange models."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies that certain radices lead to unstable training behavior ("strange models") but does not provide specific criteria for selecting radices that ensure stable learning.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental results demonstrating a correlation between specific radix selection strategies and consistent, high-accuracy training performance across multiple network architectures and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the effect of random initialization on training accuracy of RadiX-Nets depend on the particular radices chosen?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper shows that different seeds affect the training behavior of both "normal" and "strange" models differently, suggesting that the impact of initialization depends on the radices.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper demonstrates that initialization affects training, it does not quantify how different radices interact with initialization to influence outcomes.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A systematic study varying both radices and initialization seeds, showing how different combinations affect training stability and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does the performance of RadiX-Nets generalize across different data and network architectures?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper notes that testing the reliability of promising RadiX-Nets across different data and network architectures is necessary for dependable employment of machine learning models.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments were conducted only on the Lenet 300-100 architecture with the MNIST dataset, limiting generalizability.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental validation of RadiX-Nets on diverse datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and network architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) showing consistent performance.

## Limitations
- The study is limited to the MNIST dataset and Lenet 300-100 architecture, restricting generalizability to other domains and architectures
- The exact implementation details of the RadiX-Net Testing Suite are not fully specified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- The paper does not provide specific heuristics for selecting radices that ensure stable learning, leaving this as an open research question

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of "strange models" at high sparsity levels and the impact of random initialization on training outcomes
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that certain radices generate stable sparse topologies while others lead to erratic training
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that radial symmetry in RadiX-Nets preserves information flow at high sparsity levels better than magnitude-based pruning

## Next Checks

1. **Radix Selection Heuristics**: Develop and test heuristics for selecting radices that correlate with stable learning in RadiX-Nets. This could involve analyzing the relationship between radix patterns and gradient flow during training.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Validate the findings on additional datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to assess the generalizability of the observed phenomena.

3. **Alternative Initialization Methods**: Investigate the impact of different initialization schemes (e.g., Xavier, He initialization) on the stability and performance of RadiX-Nets, particularly at high sparsity levels.
