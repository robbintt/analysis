# Beyond Accuracy: Measuring Representation Capacity of Embeddings to Preserve Structural and Contextual Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.11294
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11294
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes comprehensive evaluation framework combining classification, clustering, t-SNE-based analysis, and trustworthiness with Bayesian optimization to measure embedding representation capacity on biological sequences.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for measuring the representation capacity of embeddings, moving beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture both structural and contextual information preservation. The framework combines four complementary metrics—classification accuracy, clustering silhouette, t-SNE-based neighborhood agreement, and trustworthiness—with weights optimized through Bayesian optimization. Applied to three biological sequence datasets using four different embedding methods, the framework demonstrates that spaced k-mers-based embedding achieves the highest representation capacity on two out of three datasets, providing practical guidance for embedding selection in bioinformatics applications.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates embedding representation capacity by first generating embeddings for biological sequences using methods like Spike2Vec, Spaced k-mers, PWM2Vec, and AutoEncoder. Each embedding is then assessed using four metrics: classification accuracy via logistic regression, clustering quality via silhouette score, structural preservation via t-SNE-based neighborhood agreement, and local relationship preservation via trustworthiness. Bayesian optimization (Optuna framework, 1,000 iterations) searches for optimal weights that maximize the weighted combination of these metrics. The final representation capacity score reflects the best combination of functional and structural aspects for each embedding method across different datasets.

## Key Results
- Spaced k-mers-based embedding achieved the highest representation capacity on two out of three biological sequence datasets
- The framework successfully differentiated between embedding methods, showing that PWM2Vec performed best on spike protein data while AutoEncoder excelled on protein subcellular location data
- Neighborhood agreement consistently received very small weights across all datasets, suggesting classification and clustering metrics dominate representation capacity assessment
- The optimization process converged to stable weight configurations, with classification accuracy typically receiving the highest weight followed by clustering silhouette score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework achieves balanced evaluation by combining classification, clustering, and t-SNE-based metrics weighted through Bayesian optimization.
- Mechanism: Individual metric scores are computed for each embedding method, then Bayesian optimization searches weight space to maximize a weighted representation capacity score, ensuring no single metric dominates.
- Core assumption: The relative importance of evaluation metrics is dataset-dependent and can be learned automatically through optimization.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions Bayesian optimization for weight optimization; [section] describes using Optuna framework for iterative weight search.
- Break condition: If optimization converges to trivial weights (e.g., one metric near 100%), the balance assumption fails and framework reduces to single-metric evaluation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: t-SNE-based neighborhood analysis captures structural preservation that classification and clustering alone miss.
- Mechanism: t-SNE reduces high-dimensional embeddings while preserving local neighborhoods; framework measures neighborhood agreement and trustworthiness to detect topology preservation beyond functional performance.
- Core assumption: Structural preservation of local neighborhoods is a distinct and important aspect of embedding quality requiring separate measurement.
- Evidence anchors: [section] states integration captures both functional and structural aspects; [section] details KNN-based neighborhood agreement and trustworthiness calculations.
- Break condition: If embeddings are already linearly separable, t-SNE-based metrics may add little value since neighborhood structure is trivial to preserve.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework provides actionable guidance for embedding selection by identifying which methods work best for specific data types.
- Mechanism: Empirical comparison across multiple real-world datasets (spike proteins, subcellular locations, human DNA) generates comparative representation capacity scores, revealing optimal embedding approaches for different biological sequence types.
- Core assumption: Representation capacity is context-dependent and varies across different types of biological sequences and embedding methods.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] shows spaced k-mers achieved highest capacity on two datasets; [section] demonstrates practical utility through analysis of four embedding methods.
- Break condition: If all embedding methods perform similarly across datasets, framework provides no actionable differentiation for model selection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
  - Why needed here: t-SNE is used to analyze neighborhood preservation in embeddings, a core component of the evaluation framework. Understanding how t-SNE works is essential to interpret neighborhood agreement and trustworthiness metrics.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of t-SNE when reducing high-dimensional data to lower dimensions?

- Concept: Bayesian Optimization
  - Why needed here: The framework uses Bayesian optimization (via Optuna) to automatically find optimal weights for combining different evaluation metrics. Understanding this optimization approach is crucial for grasping how the final representation capacity score is computed.
  - Quick check question: How does Bayesian optimization differ from grid search when tuning hyperparameters?

- Concept: Silhouette Score for Clustering Evaluation
  - Why needed here: Silhouette score is one of the four metrics used to evaluate embeddings. It measures how well-separated clusters are, helping assess whether embeddings capture meaningful groupings in the data.
  - Quick check question: What does a silhouette score close to +1 indicate about a data point's clustering assignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Biological sequences -> Embedding generation (Spike2Vec, Spaced k-mers, PWM2Vec, AutoEncoder) -> Metric computation (classification, clustering, neighborhood agreement, trustworthiness) -> Bayesian optimization (Optuna) -> Representation capacity score

- Critical path: 1) Generate embeddings for each method 2) Compute all four evaluation metrics 3) Run Bayesian optimization to find optimal weights 4) Calculate final representation capacity score 5) Compare across embedding methods and datasets

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. comprehensiveness: Using t-SNE and multiple metrics increases evaluation time but provides more complete assessment
  - Metric selection: The framework could include more metrics but would increase complexity and optimization difficulty
  - Dataset dependency: Optimal weights may vary significantly across different biological sequence types

- Failure signatures:
  - Optimization converges to extreme weights (e.g., 0.99 for one metric, 0.003 for others) indicates metrics are redundant or one dominates
  - All representation capacity scores are similar across embedding methods suggests framework isn't sensitive enough to differentiate
  - Neighborhood agreement scores consistently near 1.0 may indicate embeddings are already linearly separable

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run framework on a simple synthetic dataset where ground truth structure is known to verify t-SNE-based metrics work as expected
  2. Test with only two embedding methods on one dataset to ensure optimization process converges properly
  3. Run classification and clustering separately (without optimization) to establish baseline metric values before adding full framework

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating additional evaluation metrics beyond classification, clustering, neighborhood agreement, and trustworthiness impact the representation capacity scores of embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that future work could focus on incorporating additional evaluation metrics or tasks to provide a more comprehensive assessment of representation capacity.
- Why unresolved: The current framework uses four specific metrics, but the optimal set of metrics for measuring representation capacity across different domains and applications remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing the proposed framework with different combinations of evaluation metrics across multiple domains and embedding types would reveal which metrics are most critical for accurate representation capacity assessment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between neighborhood agreement weights and representation capacity across different types of biological sequence data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that neighborhood agreement consistently receives very small weights across all three datasets, suggesting it may not contribute significantly to representation capacity despite providing insights about local structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explain why neighborhood agreement has minimal impact on representation capacity scores or whether this pattern holds across other data types beyond biological sequences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying dataset characteristics (sequence length, alphabet size, class distribution) while measuring neighborhood agreement's contribution to representation capacity would clarify its theoretical importance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed evaluation framework perform when applied to non-biological sequential data such as time series or natural language sequences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework is validated only on biological sequence datasets (proteins and nucleotides), leaving its generalizability to other sequential data types unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The framework's effectiveness for measuring representation capacity may depend on specific characteristics of biological sequences that differ from other sequential data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the framework to diverse sequential data types (time series, text, sensor data) and comparing representation capacity rankings with established domain-specific evaluation methods would demonstrate its cross-domain applicability.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the representativeness and quality of the three biological datasets used, potentially limiting generalizability to other sequence types or domains
- Bayesian optimization requires substantial computational resources (1,000 iterations) and may converge to local optima rather than global solutions
- The assumption that weighted combination of metrics provides meaningful representation capacity score hasn't been validated against ground truth in controlled experiments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Combining multiple evaluation metrics (classification, clustering, t-SNE-based analysis) is well-established and theoretically sound; individual metric calculations are standard approaches
- **Medium Confidence**: Bayesian optimization approach for weight selection is novel and appropriate, but convergence behavior and sensitivity to initialization aren't thoroughly characterized
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of results across different biological sequence types and performance when embeddings are already linearly separable (making t-SNE-based metrics less informative)

## Next Checks

1. **Controlled Experiment Validation**: Test the framework on synthetic biological sequences with known ground truth structure to verify that representation capacity scores align with actual embedding quality

2. **Weight Sensitivity Analysis**: Run Bayesian optimization multiple times with different random seeds and initializations to assess stability of optimal weights and convergence patterns

3. **Cross-Domain Testing**: Apply the framework to non-biological sequence data (e.g., text or time series) to evaluate whether learned optimal weights transfer or if they're highly dataset-specific
