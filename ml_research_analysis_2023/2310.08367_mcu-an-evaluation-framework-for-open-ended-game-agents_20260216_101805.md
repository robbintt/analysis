# MCU: An Evaluation Framework for Open-Ended Game Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.08367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08367
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Introduces MCU framework with 3,452 atomic tasks, task composition mechanism, and 91.5% human alignment for evaluating open-ended game agents

## Executive Summary
MCU (Minecraft Universe) addresses the challenge of evaluating open-ended game agents by providing a comprehensive framework for generating and assessing diverse tasks in Minecraft. The framework introduces an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks spanning 11 major categories, a task composition mechanism for creating infinite diverse tasks, and a general evaluation framework that achieves strong alignment with human ratings. Empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with increasing task diversity and complexity, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in revealing agent capability gaps across six difficulty dimensions.

## Method Summary
The MCU framework operates through three main components: (1) an atomic task database containing 3,452 basic tasks with associated metadata and prerequisite dependencies; (2) a task composition engine that generates complex molecule tasks through logical operations (AND, OR) and constraints while maintaining consistent difficulty metrics; (3) an evaluation pipeline featuring the SkillForge benchmark and filtering mechanisms for targeted capability assessment. The framework employs six-dimensional difficulty scoring (time consumption, operational effort, planning complexity, intricacy, creativity, novelty) and uses t-SNE visualization to reveal semantic relationships between tasks, enabling efficient benchmark design and agent capability analysis.

## Key Results
- MCU achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment
- State-of-the-art foundation agents show significant performance degradation with increasing task diversity and complexity
- Task space visualization reveals effective clustering by category, with tasks naturally grouping by difficulty distribution
- Framework provides effective filters for targeted evaluation of specific agent capabilities across six difficulty dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework's use of composable atomic tasks enables scalable task generation while maintaining evaluation consistency
- Mechanism: Atomic tasks serve as modular building blocks that can be combined through logical operations (AND, OR) and constraints to create complex molecule tasks, while preserving consistent difficulty metrics across all generated tasks
- Core assumption: Complex tasks can be meaningfully decomposed into atomic subtasks with well-defined prerequisite dependencies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Atom tasks are the basic components of MCU, which can test a minimal ability of Minecraft agent by resolving prerequisite dependencies for the task"
  - [abstract] "MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks"
- Break condition: If prerequisite dependencies become too complex to resolve or atomic tasks cannot be meaningfully combined without losing evaluation validity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Six-dimensional difficulty scoring provides a comprehensive capability assessment across different agent skill dimensions
- Mechanism: Each task is scored across time consumption, operational effort, planning complexity, intricacy, creativity, and novelty, creating a multi-dimensional feature vector that captures diverse aspects of agent performance
- Core assumption: Different difficulty dimensions correlate with distinct agent capabilities and can be reliably measured through heuristic scores
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Each task proposed in recent works can be covered by MCU. On top of that, MCU can serve as a unified evaluation protocol for Minecraft agent research"
  - [abstract] "These scores offer a multi-dimensional assessment of a task from different angles"
- Break condition: If heuristic scores fail to capture meaningful differences between tasks or become unreliable for novel task types

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task space visualization reveals semantic relationships between tasks and enables efficient benchmark design
- Mechanism: By projecting task difficulty vectors into 2D space using t-SNE, tasks naturally cluster by category, revealing that tasks within categories share similar difficulty distributions while maintaining intra-category variance
- Core assumption: Task difficulty features capture meaningful semantic relationships that can be visualized in reduced dimensions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Visualization of the SkillForge Task Space... Notice the clustering effect in the space, where tasks of the same category tend to group together"
  - [abstract] "Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks"
- Break condition: If clustering patterns break down for new task types or visualization fails to reveal meaningful relationships

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task decomposition and prerequisite dependency resolution
  - Why needed here: Understanding how complex tasks can be broken down into atomic components with prerequisite chains is fundamental to MCU's task generation mechanism
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the prerequisite dependency graph for a simple task like "craft iron sword" using the atomic task framework?

- Concept: Multi-dimensional difficulty assessment and metric design
  - Why needed here: The framework's effectiveness depends on understanding how different difficulty dimensions (time, effort, planning, etc.) relate to agent capabilities and how to measure them
  - Quick check question: How would you design a metric to quantify the "creativity" difficulty dimension for a task like "build a house"?

- Concept: Task space analysis and benchmark selection
  - Why needed here: Understanding how tasks relate in feature space enables efficient benchmark design and targeted evaluation of specific agent capabilities
  - Quick check question: Given a 2D t-SNE projection of tasks, how would you select representative tasks that cover diverse capabilities while minimizing redundancy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MCU framework consists of three main components: (1) atomic task database with 3,452 tasks and associated metadata, (2) task composition engine for generating molecule tasks through combination and constraints, (3) evaluation pipeline with SkillForge benchmark and filtering mechanisms

- Critical path: Task generation → Difficulty scoring → Benchmark selection → Agent evaluation → Result analysis

- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades evaluation comprehensiveness for scalability - using atomic tasks and composition enables infinite task generation but requires careful management of task validity and difficulty consistency

- Failure signatures: Poor agent performance on novel tasks might indicate: (1) difficulty scoring inaccuracies, (2) insufficient task diversity in benchmarks, (3) limitations in the composition mechanism, or (4) agent weaknesses in specific difficulty dimensions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify task composition by generating simple molecule tasks from atomic components and checking difficulty score consistency
  2. Test the filtering mechanism by creating custom benchmarks targeting specific agent capabilities (e.g., planning vs. control)
  3. Evaluate a baseline agent on SkillForge benchmark and analyze performance across different difficulty dimensions to identify capability gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective methods for scaling up task difficulty calibration beyond the 3,452 curated atomic tasks to truly infinite task generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states MCU has a task generation approach that can create infinite tasks via operations on 3000+ collected atom tasks, but doesn't specify how to scale beyond the initial set.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the framework's ability to generate tasks, it doesn't provide concrete methodology for scaling beyond the initial curated set.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical demonstration of task generation performance and quality metrics when scaling to 10,000+ tasks or when applying novel composition operations beyond those described.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different combinations of difficulty dimensions (time consumption, operational effort, planning complexity, intricacy, creativity, novelty) correlate with actual agent performance across diverse task categories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces six difficulty dimensions but doesn't empirically analyze how these dimensions interact or predict agent success rates.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the dimensions but doesn't validate their predictive power or analyze correlations between dimensions and performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical analysis showing which combinations of difficulty dimensions best predict agent performance, or ablation studies removing specific dimensions from the evaluation framework.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between task redundancy and diversity in the SkillForge benchmark to maximize evaluation efficiency without sacrificing coverage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that existing benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific difficulty levels and that MCU aims to address this, but doesn't specify the optimal task selection strategy.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem of benchmark bias, it doesn't provide concrete methodology for determining the right balance between redundancy and diversity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of evaluation results using different task selection strategies (e.g., clustering-based vs random selection) and analysis of how task redundancy affects evaluation reliability.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and completeness of the atomic task database, which may not fully capture all aspects of Minecraft gameplay
- Six-dimensional difficulty scoring relies on heuristic metrics that may not perfectly correlate with actual agent capabilities, particularly for subjective dimensions like creativity and novelty
- Task composition assumes complex tasks can be meaningfully decomposed into atomic components, which may not hold for tasks requiring emergent behaviors or non-linear problem-solving

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The task composition mechanism and SkillForge benchmark design are well-specified with clear implementation details. The 91.5% alignment with human ratings provides strong validation for the evaluation framework's reliability.
- **Medium Confidence**: The six-dimensional difficulty scoring system is theoretically sound but relies on heuristic measurements that may require calibration for different agent types or task domains. The task space visualization effectively reveals semantic relationships but may become less reliable as the task database grows.
- **Low Confidence**: The framework's generalizability to other open-ended environments beyond Minecraft remains untested, and the scalability of the atomic task approach for domains with fundamentally different task structures is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Validate task composition consistency by generating molecule tasks from atomic components and measuring difficulty score variance across multiple composition patterns
2. Test the framework's sensitivity to task difficulty calibration by perturbing difficulty scores and measuring the impact on benchmark selection and agent evaluation
3. Evaluate the framework's generalizability by applying it to a different open-ended environment and comparing the effectiveness of the atomic task decomposition approach
