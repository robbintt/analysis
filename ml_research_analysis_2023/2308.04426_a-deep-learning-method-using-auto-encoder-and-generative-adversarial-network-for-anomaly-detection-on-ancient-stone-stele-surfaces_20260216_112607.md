# A Deep-Learning Method Using Auto-encoder and Generative Adversarial Network for Anomaly Detection on Ancient Stone Stele Surfaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04426
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Achieves 99.74% reconstruction accuracy and detects 7 types of anomalies on ancient stone stele surfaces without false alarms

## Executive Summary
This study presents a deep-learning method for automatic detection of deterioration and damage on ancient stone stele surfaces using an autoencoder (AE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. The approach enables real-time monitoring without requiring extensive anomaly samples by learning to reconstruct normal surface patterns. A high-definition camera captures images of the stele surface, which are preprocessed and fed into the model. Anomalies are detected by comparing input and reconstructed images using combined similarity measurements. The method was evaluated on the Longmen Grottoes case study, successfully detecting artificially designed anomalies including carving, crack, moss, doodle, salt, water stains, and bird dropping.

## Method Summary
The method employs an unsupervised learning approach based on AE/GAN architecture to detect anomalies on ancient stone stele surfaces. The model learns to reconstruct normal surface images with high fidelity, while anomalies—being previously unseen patterns—cannot be accurately reconstructed, resulting in high reconstruction errors. Post-processing includes image registration to align input and reconstructed images, color matching to eliminate illumination differences, and similarity measurement using both Matrix Subtraction (MS) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The final detection output is obtained by taking the union of MS and SSIM results and applying binarization with denoising.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.74% reconstruction accuracy measured by relative l2 norm error
- Successfully detects seven artificially designed anomalies (carving, crack, moss, doodle, salt, water stains, and bird dropping)
- Demonstrates zero false alarm rate in detection performance
- Eliminates need for labeled anomaly samples through unsupervised learning approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The AE/GAN architecture enables unsupervised anomaly detection by learning to reconstruct normal surface images with high fidelity. Since anomalies are previously unseen patterns, they cannot be reconstructed accurately, resulting in high reconstruction error at anomaly locations. The core assumption is that anomalies are sufficiently different in pixel space from normal surface patterns that reconstruction error is statistically separable. This breaks down if anomalies are visually similar to normal patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Combining MS and SSIM similarity measurements captures both pixel-level and structural differences between input and reconstructed images. MS measures absolute pixel differences while SSIM measures structural similarity, together covering brightness, color, and texture structure to improve detection robustness across anomaly types. This assumes different anomaly types exhibit distinct combinations of pixel-level and structural differences. The combination may not provide additional benefit if all anomalies are of similar type.

### Mechanism 3
Image registration and color matching remove systematic differences between input and reconstructed images that are not related to anomalies. Registration aligns reconstructed images to input images to eliminate spatial misalignment errors, while color matching adjusts brightness and color temperature to eliminate illumination differences. This assumes the AE/GAN model introduces consistent spatial and color distortions that can be corrected without affecting anomaly signals. Break conditions include if registration or color matching introduces artifacts or if systematic distortions are too complex to correct accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Autoencoder architecture and latent space representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how AE compresses and reconstructs images is fundamental to grasping why anomalies create high reconstruction errors
  - Quick check question: What happens to the latent representation when the input contains patterns never seen during training?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks and loss functions
  - Why needed here: The GAN component stabilizes training and improves reconstruction quality through adversarial loss
  - Quick check question: How does the discriminator's feedback improve the generator's ability to reconstruct normal patterns?

- Concept: Image similarity metrics (MS and SSIM)
  - Why needed here: These metrics form the basis of anomaly detection by quantifying differences between input and reconstructed images
  - Quick check question: What type of differences does each metric capture, and why is combining them beneficial?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: HD camera → Preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, cropping, augmentation) → AE/GAN model (Encoder E, Generator G with encoder GE and decoder GD, Discriminator D) → Post-processing (registration, color matching, similarity measurement with MS/SSIM, binarization with denoising) → Output binary mask
- Critical path: Image capture → Model inference → Similarity measurement → Binarization → Detection output
- Design tradeoffs: High resolution provides better anomaly detail but increases computational cost; unsupervised learning eliminates labeling effort but may have lower precision than supervised methods
- Failure signatures: High false positive rate suggests reconstruction accuracy is insufficient or thresholds are too low; missed anomalies suggest reconstruction error is not distinctive enough or thresholds are too high
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test reconstruction accuracy on normal images with varying illumination conditions to verify color matching effectiveness
  2. Evaluate MS and SSIM detection performance separately on each anomaly type to understand their individual strengths
  3. Test detection with simulated anomalies of varying sizes to determine minimum detectable anomaly size and appropriate denoising thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed method perform in detecting anomalies under varying lighting conditions and weather patterns over extended periods of time? The paper mentions data augmentation by adjusting white balance and exposure to simulate variations in photographic parameters under different lighting conditions, but does not discuss performance in real-world scenarios with varying weather patterns and lighting conditions over extended periods. Testing the method on a larger dataset collected over an extended period, covering various weather conditions and lighting scenarios, would provide insights into its performance and robustness in real-world applications.

### Open Question 2
Can the proposed method be adapted to detect anomalies on other types of cultural heritage materials, such as wood, metal, or ceramics? The paper focuses on the application of the method to ancient stone steles but does not discuss the potential for adapting the method to other materials commonly found in cultural heritage sites. Testing the method on various cultural heritage materials and comparing its performance across different types of surfaces would help determine its adaptability and potential for broader application.

### Open Question 3
How can the selection of optimal detection thresholds be improved to enhance the method's performance and reduce the risk of false alarms or missed detections? The paper mentions that the choice of detection thresholds significantly influences the quality of detection, but does not discuss the selection of optimal thresholds or methods to improve this aspect of the method. Developing and testing various methods for selecting optimal detection thresholds, such as machine learning algorithms or statistical analysis, would help improve the method's performance and reduce the risk of false alarms or missed detections.

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to 283 images from a single site (Longmen Grottoes) over six months
- All anomalies were artificially designed rather than naturally occurring
- Does not report false positive rates, precision-recall curves, or statistical significance testing
- Minimum detectable anomaly size and performance degradation with camera distance are not addressed

## Confidence
- High: The AE/GAN architecture can learn to reconstruct normal surface patterns and detect pixel-level differences between input and reconstructed images
- Medium: The combination of MS and SSIM metrics improves detection robustness across different anomaly types
- Low: The method will perform similarly on naturally occurring anomalies and on stone stele surfaces from different locations or time periods

## Next Checks
1. Test detection performance on naturally occurring anomalies from multiple stone stele sites to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the minimum detectable anomaly size by systematically varying anomaly dimensions and measuring detection accuracy
3. Assess performance degradation with varying camera-to-surface distance to determine operational range limitations
