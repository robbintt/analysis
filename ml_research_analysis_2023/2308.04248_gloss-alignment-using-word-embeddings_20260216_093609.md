# Gloss Alignment Using Word Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04248
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieved up to 33.22 BLEU-1 score in word alignment between sign language glosses and subtitles

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning sign language glosses with spoken language subtitles in broadcast content. The authors propose a novel method using word embeddings from large language models like BERT and Word2Vec to map glosses to subtitles. This approach is computationally efficient as it relies on a single modality (text) rather than multimodal inputs, making it suitable for conjunction with existing alignment techniques.

The method is evaluated on two datasets: MeineDGS (German Sign Language) and BOBSL (British Sign Language), demonstrating its language-agnostic nature. Results show significant improvement in alignment quality, with the method recovering up to 33.22 BLEU-1 score. The iterative refinement process through multiple passes over the data further enhances alignment accuracy, making this approach particularly effective for creating large-scale sign language datasets from broadcast content.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses word embeddings from BERT and Word2Vec to create a mapping between sign language glosses and their corresponding spoken language subtitles. The approach first computes similarity scores between gloss and subtitle words using both embedding models, then combines these scores into an alignment matrix. The algorithm performs iterative refinement through forward and backward passes, adjusting gloss boundaries based on alignment scores from previous iterations. This auto-regressive process continues until convergence, producing improved alignment between glosses and subtitles.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 33.22 BLEU-1 score in word alignment between glosses and subtitles
- Demonstrated language-agnostic performance on both German Sign Language (MeineDGS) and British Sign Language (BOBSL) datasets
- Showed significant improvement over baseline alignment methods through iterative refinement
- Computational efficiency maintained through single-modality text-based approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Word embeddings from BERT and Word2Vec can capture semantic and lexical relationships between glosses and subtitles, enabling alignment.
- Mechanism: The method leverages pre-trained embeddings to create a mapping matrix between glosses and subtitle words. BERT captures semantic similarity (e.g., "supermarket" and "SHOP"), while Word2Vec captures lexical overlap. These are combined into a single alignment score matrix.
- Core assumption: There is sufficient lexical and semantic overlap between glosses and their corresponding subtitle words to enable alignment through embedding similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using a single modality means our method is computationally inexpensive and can be utilized in conjunction with existing alignment techniques."
  - [section] "To find a mapping between a spoken language sequence X = (x1, x2, ..., xW ) with W words, and a sequence of glosses, Y = (y1, y2, ..., yG) with G glosses, we first apply Word2Vec"
  - [corpus] "weak corpus support for BERT-Word2Vec complementarity in alignment"
- Break condition: If the semantic or lexical overlap between glosses and subtitles is minimal, the embedding-based alignment will fail to recover correct mappings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative refinement of gloss-subtitle alignment improves results over single-pass alignment.
- Mechanism: The algorithm performs multiple forward and backward passes through the data, adjusting gloss boundaries based on alignment scores from the previous iteration. This autoregression allows the model to converge toward better alignments.
- Core assumption: Gloss-subtitle misalignment is consistent enough that iterative refinement can correct it without introducing new errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The proposed algorithm is auto-regressive, meaning the output of the first split affects the next iteration."
  - [section] "To counter this effect we iterate through the data from i = [0, 1, 2, ..., N] and then for each subsequent iteration we reverse the order"
  - [corpus] "weak evidence that multiple iterations improve alignment quality"
- Break condition: If misalignment patterns are inconsistent or random, iterative refinement may propagate errors rather than correct them.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Single-modality approach is computationally efficient compared to multimodal methods.
- Mechanism: By using only text embeddings rather than video or pose features, the method avoids expensive feature extraction and fusion steps required by multimodal approaches.
- Core assumption: Text-based alignment provides sufficient signal for gloss-subtitle alignment without needing visual or temporal information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using a single modality means our method is computationally inexpensive and can be utilized in conjunction with existing alignment techniques."
  - [section] "Previous work has attempted to align the subtitles with the sign language video by finding a correspondence between the glosses of the spotted isolated signs and words in the subtitle with a similar lexical form [10, 11, 12]. However, these works all require multimodal inputs and are expensive to compute."
  - [corpus] "no direct evidence of computational efficiency claims"
- Break condition: If visual or temporal cues are essential for correct alignment, the text-only approach will underperform multimodal alternatives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word embeddings and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: The entire alignment approach depends on measuring similarity between glosses and subtitle words using vector representations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between lexical and semantic similarity in the context of word embeddings?

- Concept: Sequence alignment and dynamic programming
  - Why needed here: The method finds optimal split points in gloss sequences based on alignment scores, which is fundamentally a sequence alignment problem
  - Quick check question: How does the argmax operation on alignment scores determine the optimal gloss split point?

- Concept: Auto-regressive models and iterative refinement
  - Why needed here: The alignment algorithm iteratively refines results, with each pass potentially improving on the previous one
  - Quick check question: What is the risk of error propagation in an auto-regressive alignment algorithm?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input processing -> Word2Vec embedding -> BERT embedding -> Alignment score matrix computation -> Iterative refinement -> Output alignment
- Critical path: The alignment score matrix computation is the bottleneck, as it requires computing outer products between all gloss and subtitle word embeddings
- Design tradeoffs: Single-modality efficiency vs. potential loss of visual/temporal information that could improve alignment accuracy
- Failure signatures: Low baseline BLEU scores indicate insufficient lexical overlap, while diminishing returns after few iterations suggest convergence to local optima
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test alignment on corrupted MeineDGS dataset with known misalignment to verify recovery capability
  2. Compare single-pass vs. multi-pass performance to determine optimal number of iterations
  3. Evaluate impact of Word2Vec filtering threshold (α) on alignment quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method compare to existing multimodal sign language alignment techniques in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that their method is computationally inexpensive and can be used in conjunction with existing alignment techniques, but do not provide a direct comparison.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of their method using word embeddings, but does not benchmark it against other methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison of the proposed method with existing multimodal alignment techniques in terms of alignment accuracy and computational cost.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different spoken language models (e.g., BERT vs. Word2Vec) on the alignment performance across different sign languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use both BERT and Word2Vec for creating word embeddings and show that combining them improves alignment, but do not explore the impact of using different models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how the choice of spoken language model affects the alignment performance across different sign languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of alignment performance using different spoken language models (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec, GPT) across multiple sign languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of sign language spotting affect the overall alignment performance, and can improvements in spotting algorithms further enhance the proposed method?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that their method can be used in conjunction with existing alignment techniques and that the quality of the underlying spottings introduces an error to any alignment approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the relationship between the quality of sign language spotting and the alignment performance, nor does it investigate how improvements in spotting algorithms could enhance the proposed method.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of alignment performance using different quality levels of sign language spotting data, and an investigation into how improvements in spotting algorithms could further enhance the proposed method.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on lexical and semantic overlap between glosses and subtitles, which may not hold for all sign languages or domains
- Computational efficiency claims lack direct empirical support with no runtime comparisons against multimodal baselines
- Iterative refinement mechanism could propagate alignment errors rather than correct them in cases of inconsistent misalignment patterns

## Confidence
- **High**: The fundamental approach of using word embeddings for alignment is technically sound and well-established
- **Medium**: The iterative refinement mechanism and its effectiveness across different languages
- **Low**: Computational efficiency claims and generalizability to sign languages beyond DGS and BSL

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Analysis**: Systematically test the iterative refinement process across multiple random initializations to quantify error propagation risk and determine optimal iteration count for different dataset characteristics.

2. **Multimodal Comparison**: Implement a multimodal baseline using video features (pose, hand shape) to directly compare alignment quality and computational requirements against the text-only approach.

3. **Cross-linguistic Generalization**: Evaluate the method on at least two additional sign languages with different linguistic properties to test language-agnostic claims and identify failure patterns.
