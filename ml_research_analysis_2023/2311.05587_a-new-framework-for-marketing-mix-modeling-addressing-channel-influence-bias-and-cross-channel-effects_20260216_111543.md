# A new framework for Marketing Mix Modeling: Addressing Channel Influence Bias and Cross-Channel Effects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.05587
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05587
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Physics-inspired hierarchical Bayesian model achieving R²=0.78, explained variance=0.78, and MAPE=0.088 on synthetic data

## Executive Summary
This research introduces a novel Marketing Mix Modeling framework that addresses over-attribution to high-investment channels and quantifies cross-channel effects. The approach integrates Michaelis-Menten equations for modeling channel saturation effects and Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic theory for cross-channel dynamics within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Using a synthetic dataset with 10 media channels, the method achieves strong predictive performance while providing investment-independent measures of channel efficacy through the Michaelis-Menten constant.

## Method Summary
The framework combines three key components: (1) Michaelis-Menten equations to model channel saturation effects with normalized constants providing investment-independent efficacy measures, (2) Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic theory to quantify cross-channel interactions as particle collision dynamics, and (3) hierarchical Bayesian modeling to integrate these effects while maintaining parameter identifiability. The approach uses NUTS MCMC sampling (1000 warmup, 1000 samples, 2 chains) and is validated on a synthetic dataset with 10 media channels and 144 weekly observations.

## Key Results
- Achieved R²=0.78, explained variance=0.78, and MAPE=0.088 on synthetic dataset
- Michaelis-Menten constant provides investment-independent channel efficacy measures
- N-particle system simulation reveals that most cross-channel interactions occur within two weeks
- Model demonstrates identifiability, enabling reliable parameter estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Michaelis-Menten constant provides investment-independent channel efficacy measure
- Mechanism: Uses normalized K_M to compare channel effectiveness regardless of absolute spending levels
- Core assumption: K_M value correlates with consumer "affinity" or "attitude" toward the channel
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions normalized Michaelis-Menten constant offers investment-independent measure; section discusses K_M as measure of consumer "affinity" to advertising

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic theory quantifies cross-channel funnel effects
- Mechanism: Models channel interactions as particle collisions where velocity represents channel influence
- Core assumption: Channel interactions follow random collision dynamics similar to gas molecules
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions Boltzmann-type equations to systematically quantify cross-channel dynamics; section describes pre-collisional and post-collisional states of N particles

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical Bayesian framework integrates multiple effects while maintaining identifiability
- Mechanism: Combines Michaelis-Menten shape effects, Maxwell-Boltzmann funnel effects, and traditional MMM components in unified Bayesian structure
- Core assumption: Model parameters are theoretically learnable from data
- Evidence anchors: Section shows model has identifiability, being able to learn true values of underlying parameters

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics
  - Why needed here: Provides mathematical framework for modeling channel saturation effects
  - Quick check question: What does the Michaelis-Menten constant K_M represent in enzyme kinetics?

- Concept: Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
  - Why needed here: Models random interactions between channels as particle collisions
  - Quick check question: How does the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describe molecular velocities in a gas?

- Concept: Bayesian hierarchical modeling
  - Why needed here: Integrates multiple layers of effects while incorporating prior knowledge
  - Quick check question: What advantage does hierarchical modeling provide when dealing with multiple correlated effects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data → Adstock transformation → Michaelis-Menten shape modeling → Maxwell-Boltzmann funnel modeling → Hierarchical Bayesian inference → Output predictions and parameter estimates
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Adstock transformation → Michaelis-Menten parameter estimation → Boltzmann interaction modeling → MCMC sampling → Result validation
- Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity vs. model accuracy; interpretability vs. flexibility; assumption simplicity vs. real-world accuracy
- Failure signatures: MCMC non-convergence; poor R² or MAPE metrics; parameter estimates with high uncertainty; residual patterns indicating model misspecification
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Michaelis-Menten shape modeling on single channel data without funnel effects
  2. Validate Maxwell-Boltzmann funnel modeling using synthetic two-channel interactions
  3. Run full model on synthetic dataset and compare against baseline Hill model implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Michaelis-Menten model's response curve differ from the traditional S-shaped Hill curve in real-world marketing data, and what implications does this have for media allocation decisions?
- Basis in paper: The paper explicitly compares the Michaelis-Menten model's saturation curves to traditional S-shaped Hill curves, noting that Michaelis-Menten produces a different curve shape that doesn't account for the "noise" effect at low investment levels that Hill models assume.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the theoretical difference between the two models and validates the Michaelis-Menten approach on synthetic data, it does not provide empirical evidence from real-world marketing campaigns comparing the actual performance and allocation recommendations of both models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using real marketing campaign data where both models are applied to the same datasets, measuring differences in predicted saturation points, ROAS estimates, and resulting budget allocation recommendations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for incorporating N-particle interaction modeling versus sequential pairwise interaction analysis in the Boltzmann-type equations for cross-channel effects?
- Basis in paper: The paper presents two approaches for modeling funnel effects - using high-order N-particle interactions (Equation 7) or sequential pairwise interactions (Equation 9) - and notes that each has advantages and disadvantages, but doesn't provide guidance on when to use which approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges both methods but doesn't establish criteria for choosing between them based on campaign characteristics, number of channels, or computational constraints. The trade-off between computational complexity and insight quality remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing across multiple real-world datasets with varying numbers of channels, comparing the accuracy, computational efficiency, and actionable insights generated by each approach under different conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the Michaelis-Menten constant (K_M) be reliably interpreted as a measure of consumer "affinity" or "attitude" toward advertising across different product categories and consumer segments?
- Basis in paper: The paper proposes that the Michaelis-Menten constant can be interpreted as a measure of consumer "affinity" to advertising, analogous to attitude in attitude-behavior models, but acknowledges this is a theoretical framework requiring empirical validation.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents this interpretation as a theoretical framework but doesn't provide empirical evidence demonstrating that K_M values consistently correlate with consumer attitude measures across different contexts, or how this relationship might vary by product category, consumer demographics, or advertising channel.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies measuring consumer attitudes through surveys or behavioral data alongside Michaelis-Menten parameter estimation, testing correlation strength across multiple product categories and consumer segments, and validating whether K_M provides actionable insights beyond traditional attitude measures.

## Limitations
- Limited validation on synthetic data only, without real-world marketing campaign testing
- Computational complexity increases significantly with number of channels, potentially limiting scalability
- Assumes channel interactions follow random collision dynamics that may not hold in coordinated marketing strategies

## Confidence
- Michaelis-Menten shape modeling: High
- Maxwell-Boltzmann funnel effects: Medium
- Hierarchical Bayesian integration: High

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to at least two real marketing datasets from different industries to test generalizability beyond synthetic data
2. Evaluate model performance and convergence with 20+ channels to assess computational limits and potential need for approximation methods
3. Implement and compare against state-of-the-art MMM approaches (e.g., Ridge regression, Bayesian structural time series) on identical datasets to quantify practical performance gains
