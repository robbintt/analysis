# Learning a Patent-Informed Biomedical Knowledge Graph Reveals Technological Potential of Drug Repositioning Candidates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.03227
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03227
- Reference count: 40
- Identified 229 drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer's disease with significant patent relatedness

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel approach for drug repositioning that combines biomedical knowledge graphs with pharmaceutical patent data to identify candidates with both scientific evidence and technological potential. The method constructs a structural biomedical knowledge graph (s-BKG) from DisGeNET and DGIdb databases, screens candidates based on gene-sharing with target diseases, then augments this with pharmaceutical patent data to form a patent-informed biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG). Using graph embedding and cosine similarity calculations, the approach ranks drug candidates by their relevance to disease-related patents. A case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates the method's ability to identify candidates with significant patent relatedness, while quantitative validation using Welch's t-test confirms that FDA Orange Book patents show significantly longer lifetimes than other pharmaceutical patents (p < 0.01).

## Method Summary
The method constructs an s-BKG from biomedical databases to screen drug repositioning candidates based on cosine similarity with target diseases, then augments this with pharmaceutical patent data to form p-BKG. Graph embedding (Node2Vec with 15 dimensions) converts the knowledge graph structure into vector representations, enabling relevance scoring between candidates and disease-related patents. Named Entity Recognition extracts drug-disease-gene relationships from patent abstracts, which are added to s-BKG to create p-BKG. Candidates are ranked using an average of patent-disease relatedness scores and shared gene counts between drugs and the target disease. The approach excludes drugs with direct therapeutic evidence from CTD database to focus on novel repositioning opportunities.

## Key Results
- Identified 229 drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer's disease through s-BKG screening
- Top candidates showed significant relatedness to AD-related patents (cosine similarity > 0.7)
- Welch's t-test demonstrated significant differences in patent lifetimes (p < 0.01) between FDA Orange Book patents and other pharmaceutical patents
- The combined ranking approach (patent relevance + gene-sharing) provided insights into market viability of candidates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph embedding converts biomedical relationships into vector representations that preserve proximity information
- Mechanism: Node2Vec creates low-dimensional vectors where drugs close in the knowledge graph have similar embeddings, enabling cosine similarity calculations
- Core assumption: Structural proximity in the knowledge graph reflects biological or functional similarity
- Evidence anchors: "graph-embedding methods are employed to analyse information from nodes in the knowledge graph in a structured manner"
- Break condition: If biological relationships don't correlate with graph structure, embedding proximity becomes meaningless

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Patent data adds technological potential signals to biomedical knowledge
- Mechanism: NER extracts drug-disease-gene relationships from patent abstracts, then these relationships are added to the knowledge graph to create p-BKG
- Core assumption: Patents contain valuable technological information about drug applications and mechanisms
- Evidence anchors: "NER is applied to the collected pharmaceutical patents, and p-BKG is constructed by adding patent information to s-BKG"
- Break condition: If patent language doesn't capture relevant technological relationships or if patents focus on unrelated aspects

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining biomedical similarity with patent relevance creates better drug repositioning candidates
- Mechanism: Candidates are ranked by both gene-sharing with target disease and patent relevance, using average ranking
- Core assumption: Higher gene-sharing indicates biological plausibility and higher patent relevance indicates technological potential
- Evidence anchors: "combining an average ranking offers insights into determining the market viability"
- Break condition: If either metric poorly predicts success or if their combination doesn't outperform either alone

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge graphs and graph embedding
  - Why needed here: The method relies on representing drugs, diseases, and genes as nodes with relationships as edges, then converting this structure into vector representations
  - Quick check question: How does Node2Vec differ from random walk approaches in capturing graph structure?

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for biomedical text
  - Why needed here: NER is used to extract drug, disease, and gene entities from patent abstracts to connect patents to biomedical entities
  - Quick check question: What challenges make biomedical NER more difficult than general NER?

- Concept: Cosine similarity for vector comparison
  - Why needed here: Used to measure relatedness between drugs and diseases in the embedding space, and between drugs and patents
  - Quick check question: What does a cosine similarity of 0.7 indicate about the angle between two vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → s-BKG construction → candidate screening → p-BKG construction → patent relevance scoring → ranking → validation
- Critical path: s-BKG construction → graph embedding → candidate screening → p-BKG construction → ranking
- Design tradeoffs: Using patent data adds technological signals but requires complex NER processing; excluding direct evidence focuses on novel candidates but may miss some valid options
- Failure signatures: Low cosine similarity despite known relationships (embedding failure), patent-NER misses relevant entities (NER failure), ranking doesn't correlate with validation results (integration failure)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate s-BKG construction by checking known drug-disease relationships have high cosine similarity
  2. Test NER on patent abstracts with known drug mentions to verify entity extraction accuracy
  3. Compare candidate rankings using only biomedical similarity vs. combined approach to quantify patent value addition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do side-effects information and its inclusion in the biomedical knowledge graph impact the accuracy and comprehensiveness of drug repositioning candidate identification?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the biomedical knowledge graph constructed does not cover side-effects information and suggests that including this information could provide a more comprehensive view of each drug's information.
- Why unresolved: The current study does not include side-effects information in the biomedical knowledge graph, and its impact on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of drug repositioning candidate identification is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Including side-effects information in the biomedical knowledge graph and comparing the results with the current study's findings would provide evidence on the impact of side-effects information on drug repositioning candidate identification.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the definition and threshold for drug repositioning candidates affect the identification of potential candidates, and what are the implications of different definitions and thresholds?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the process of defining drug repositioning candidates needs to be refined and that different definitions and thresholds for repositioning candidates need to be tested in future studies using techniques such as link prediction and network clustering.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a specific definition and threshold for drug repositioning candidates, but the impact of different definitions and thresholds on the identification of potential candidates is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing different definitions and thresholds for drug repositioning candidates using techniques such as link prediction and network clustering would provide evidence on the implications of different definitions and thresholds on the identification of potential candidates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the integration of various biomedical specialty datasets and pharmaceutical patent data impact the construction of a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph, and what are the potential benefits and limitations of such integration?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that it is possible to build a biomedical knowledge graph that provides richer information by integrating various biomedical specialty datasets and pharmaceutical patent data, but it also notes that refining the process of selecting patents considered to be technically valuable through further research is necessary.
- Why unresolved: The current study integrates some biomedical specialty datasets and pharmaceutical patent data, but the impact of integrating various datasets and the potential benefits and limitations of such integration are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating various biomedical specialty datasets and pharmaceutical patent data and comparing the results with the current study's findings would provide evidence on the impact of integration on the construction of a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph.

## Limitations

- Limited validation scope: The study focuses on Alzheimer's disease case study with 229 candidates, but broader validation across multiple diseases would strengthen generalizability claims
- Patent data limitations: FDA Orange Book patents represent a specific subset of pharmaceutical patents, and NER accuracy on patent abstracts remains unverified
- Methodological details missing: Exact weighting scheme for combining patent relevance and gene-sharing metrics is not specified

## Confidence

- High confidence: Graph embedding methodology and cosine similarity calculations (well-established techniques with clear implementation)
- Medium confidence: p-BKG construction approach (novel combination but relies on standard NER and graph construction)
- Low confidence: Claim that combining patent data significantly improves candidate selection without head-to-head comparison to biomedical-only approach

## Next Checks

1. Validate NER performance on patent abstracts by manually annotating a sample set and calculating precision/recall for drug-disease-gene entity extraction
2. Conduct ablation study comparing candidate rankings using biomedical-only approach versus patent-augmented approach to quantify added value
3. Test method on a second disease (e.g., Parkinson's) to assess generalizability of the p-BKG approach beyond Alzheimer's disease
