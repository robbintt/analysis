# Evaluating Language Models for Mathematics through Interactions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.01694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01694
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Interactive evaluation reveals human behavior patterns and model preference variations across mathematical topics, with notable divergence between correctness and helpfulness ratings.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CheckMate, an interactive platform for evaluating language models as mathematics assistants. Through a study with 30 participants evaluating three models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, GPT-4) on 54 undergraduate-level mathematics problems, the authors create MathConverse dataset and demonstrate that interactive evaluation captures unique behavior patterns. The study reveals that models showing uncertainty, being interpretable, and concise perform better as assistants, while also uncovering instances where participants with low confidence incorrectly rated incorrect outputs as correct.

## Method Summary
The authors developed CheckMate, an interactive evaluation platform where participants engage with three language models on undergraduate mathematics problems from ProofWiki. Participants rate each model generation for mathematical correctness (0-6 scale) and perceived helpfulness (0-6 scale), then provide final rank-order preferences. The study collected 3,177 rated generations from 30 participants with mathematics backgrounds ranging from undergraduate students to professors. Expert mathematicians conducted case studies on GPT-4's problem-solving to provide deeper analysis.

## Key Results
- Interactive evaluation captures unique human behavior patterns not visible in static benchmarks
- Notable divergence exists between mathematical correctness and perceived helpfulness ratings
- Models that communicate uncertainty, are interpretable, and concise perform better as mathematical assistants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interactive evaluation captures user behavior patterns that static evaluation misses
- Mechanism: Humans iteratively query models, rate each generation, and reveal preference patterns through interaction traces
- Core assumption: User ratings reflect meaningful differences in model capabilities and helpfulness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By analysing MathConverse, we derive a taxonomy of human behaviours and uncover that despite a generally positive correlation, there are notable instances of divergence between correctness and perceived helpfulness"
  - [section] "We introduce CheckMate, an adaptable prototype platform for humans to interact with and evaluate LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus provides related papers but no direct evidence of interaction capturing unique patterns
- Break condition: If user ratings are inconsistent or uninformative, the interaction traces lose value

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model preference varies across different mathematical topics and problem types
- Mechanism: Participants rate models on different mathematical domains, revealing topic-specific strengths and weaknesses
- Core assumption: Mathematical topics differ in difficulty and model performance varies accordingly
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We conduct a study with CheckMate to evaluate three language models... as assistants in proving undergraduate-level mathematics, with a mixed cohort of participants from undergraduate students to professors"
  - [section] "We select 54 problems from ProofWiki, a corpus of undergraduate-level mathematics problems. Nine problems are selected from each of six mathematics topics"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions RealMath benchmark but no direct evidence of topic-specific evaluation
- Break condition: If all topics show similar performance patterns, topic-specific variation loses significance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human uncertainty affects correctness judgments of model outputs
- Mechanism: Participants rate their confidence before interactions and their uncertainty influences how they judge mathematical correctness
- Core assumption: Users with low confidence in their own abilities may incorrectly rate incorrect outputs as correct
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uncover that despite a generally positive correlation, there are notable instances of divergence between correctness and perceived helpfulness in LLM generations"
  - [section] "We find instances wherein participants who indicated low confidence... ended up rating the generation as completely correct even when it was not"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't directly address human uncertainty effects on evaluation
- Break condition: If all participants consistently rate correctness accurately regardless of their confidence, uncertainty effects become irrelevant

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Interactive evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: Static benchmarks cannot capture the dynamic nature of human-model collaboration in problem-solving
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between static and interactive evaluation approaches?

- Concept: Mathematical proof assistance requirements
  - Why needed here: Understanding what makes mathematical assistance effective requires knowledge of proof structure and mathematical reasoning
  - Quick check question: What are the essential components of a valid mathematical proof that an LLM assistant should provide?

- Concept: Human-computer interaction principles
  - Why needed here: The study examines how humans naturally interact with LLMs in mathematical problem-solving contexts
  - Quick check question: How do human query patterns and correction behaviors inform the design of better LLM assistants?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Problem database -> Model API interface -> Interaction recording system -> Rating interface -> Data export functionality
- Critical path: User selects problem → interacts with model → rates each generation → provides final preferences → data saved
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time interaction vs. latency, comprehensive rating scales vs. cognitive load, privacy vs. user tracking
- Failure signatures: Participants abandoning interactions early, inconsistent rating patterns, model API failures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CheckMate with one simple problem and one model to verify basic functionality
  2. Run with three models on one problem to test preference collection system
  3. Scale to full problem set with multiple participants to validate data collection pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can interactive evaluation methods be standardized across different mathematical domains?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper introduces CheckMate as an adaptable platform for interactive evaluation and discusses its potential extension to domains beyond mathematics.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates CheckMate's application to mathematics but does not provide a framework for standardizing interactive evaluation across different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a general framework for interactive evaluation that can be applied across various domains, with case studies showing successful adaptation to non-mathematical domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between automated and human evaluation in assessing LLM mathematical reasoning?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper contrasts static evaluation with interactive evaluation and discusses the role of human evaluators in assessing mathematical correctness and helpfulness.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the value of interactive human evaluation but does not determine the optimal mix of automated and human assessment methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of different ratios of automated to human evaluation in various mathematical problem domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different mathematical problem types (e.g., proofs vs. calculations) affect LLM performance and user interaction patterns?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper uses undergraduate-level theorem proving problems but notes that different mathematical topics may yield different results.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a limited set of proof-based problems and does not systematically investigate how problem type affects LLM capabilities or user interaction strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive analysis of LLM performance and interaction patterns across a diverse set of mathematical problem types, including both proof-based and calculation-based problems.

## Limitations

- Limited participant sample size (30) and restricted problem set (54 problems) may not capture full mathematical reasoning diversity
- Mixed expertise cohort introduces variability in rating consistency across participants
- Case study sample size of 4 expert mathematicians may not generalize to broader mathematical domains

## Confidence

- High confidence: Divergence between correctness and helpfulness ratings, instances of low-confidence participants incorrectly rating incorrect outputs
- Medium confidence: Interactive evaluation capturing unique behavior patterns, topic-specific model preferences, general recommendations for model design
- Low confidence: Generalizability of specific case study findings beyond examined problems, universal applicability of derived behavior taxonomy

## Next Checks

1. Scale validation: Replicate with larger participant pool (n > 100) and expanded problem set (200+ problems across 10+ domains) to test robustness
2. Expert consistency check: Conduct blinded validation with multiple expert mathematicians independently rating same interaction traces to measure inter-rater reliability
3. Cross-model architecture validation: Test topic-specific performance patterns and interaction behaviors with newer model architectures (Claude, Gemini) to determine if findings are model-specific or general LLM limitations
