# A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Clustering Residential Electricity Load Profiles to Enhance Demand Response Programs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20367
- Reference count: 39
- The framework identifies optimal clusters in residential electricity consumption patterns using machine learning to improve demand response program targeting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a machine learning framework for clustering residential electricity load profiles to enhance demand response (DR) programs. The methodology involves feature engineering on smart meter data, applying multiple clustering algorithms, and using a probabilistic classifier with Explainable AI to interpret cluster formation. Tested on data from nearly 5000 households in London, the framework identified seven optimal clusters, with two clusters exhibiting significant internal dissimilarity that were further split, resulting in nine total clusters. The approach achieves high classification accuracy and provides interpretable insights into what drives cluster formation.

## Method Summary
The framework processes smart meter data through feature engineering to extract meaningful consumption patterns, then applies multiple clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to identify optimal clusters. A probabilistic CatBoost classifier is trained to emulate the clustering behavior while providing uncertainty quantification. Explainable AI methods reveal the key features driving cluster formation, enabling interpretable insights for DR program design. The methodology includes iterative refinement by identifying and splitting clusters with high internal dissimilarity.

## Key Results
- The framework identified seven optimal clusters based on Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz index
- Two clusters with significant internal dissimilarity (~10% of data) were further split, resulting in nine total clusters
- CatBoost classifier achieved exceptional performance with precision (0.99-1.00) and recall (0.91-1.00) across all clusters
- xAI revealed peak hour features as the primary drivers of cluster formation, with clear associations between consumption timing patterns and cluster assignments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Splitting dissimilar clusters after initial k-means improves DR program precision
- Mechanism: Initial k-means identifies 7 clusters; similarity matrices reveal two clusters (4 and 5) with high internal dissimilarity (~10% of data). Further splitting these clusters yields 9 total clusters, reducing intra-cluster variance and improving targetability for DR programs
- Core assumption: High internal dissimilarity within clusters reduces DR program effectiveness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our methodology shows that two of the clusters, almost 10% of the dataset, exhibit significant internal dissimilarity and thus it splits them even further to create nine clusters in total"
  - [section]: "It is obvious that instances assigned to classes with predictive probabilities falling below the threshold of 0.8 not only appear unsuitable for their designated class but also demonstrate limited suitability for the alternative existing classes"
- Break condition: If dissimilarity threshold is too low, over-splitting creates noise; if too high, meaningful patterns remain merged

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CatBoost classifier effectively emulates clustering behavior while providing probabilistic outputs
- Mechanism: Trained on k-means cluster labels, CatBoost achieves near-perfect precision/recall (0.99-1.00) on test data, effectively learning the cluster boundaries. Probability outputs enable uncertainty quantification and identification of borderline cases
- Core assumption: Classifier can learn non-linear cluster boundaries that k-means cannot perfectly capture
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "CatBoost fits almost perfectly to the given data for every cluster" with "Precision, Recall, and F1 Score values...exceptionally high"
  - [section]: "Utilizing widely recognized metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, we can discern that the CatBoost algorithm exhibits remarkable performance"
- Break condition: If data distribution changes significantly, classifier may overfit to training clusters and fail to generalize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: xAI reveals peak hour features as primary drivers of cluster formation
- Mechanism: Feature importance analysis via SHAP or similar xAI methods shows peak hour features (peak early morning, peak morning, etc.) have highest impact scores, explaining why clusters form around consumption timing patterns
- Core assumption: DR programs benefit from understanding feature drivers of clustering
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "This plot offers profound insights...The association between each class and its respective peak hour is notably clear"
  - [section]: "The only classes that hold room for improvement...are the ones we mentioned in our similarity matrices explanation, classes 4 and 5"
- Break condition: If xAI methods are improperly configured or if feature interactions are non-linear, importance rankings may be misleading

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: K-means clustering algorithm
  - Why needed here: Forms baseline clustering approach; understanding initialization, convergence, and limitations is essential
  - Quick check question: What distance metric does standard K-means use, and how does it determine cluster assignments?

- Concept: Cluster evaluation metrics (Silhouette, DBI, CHI)
  - Why needed here: These metrics guide optimal cluster number selection; understanding their mathematical definitions and sensitivities is crucial
  - Quick check question: Which metric balances cluster compactness and separation, and how does it behave when clusters have different densities?

- Concept: Feature engineering for time series data
  - Why needed here: The methodology transforms 30-minute interval data into meaningful features (peak hours, percentiles); understanding this transformation is key
  - Quick check question: How would you engineer features to capture both magnitude and timing patterns in residential load data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Feature engineering → Clustering (K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) → Evaluation → Similarity matrices → CatBoost classification → xAI interpretation → Cluster refinement
- Critical path: Feature engineering → K-means clustering → Similarity matrix analysis → CatBoost training → xAI feature importance
- Design tradeoffs: Multiple clustering algorithms provide robustness but increase computational cost; CatBoost adds interpretability but requires labeled training data
- Failure signatures: Low silhouette scores across algorithms suggests poor feature engineering; classifier overfitting indicates insufficient cluster diversity in training data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run K-means with k=2 to 32, plot all three evaluation metrics to identify elbow points
  2. Generate similarity matrix between K-means and Hierarchical clustering to identify consensus vs. divergent clusters
  3. Train CatBoost classifier and examine feature importance scores to validate peak hour hypothesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal cluster numbers for different residential electricity consumption datasets and how do they vary with geographic and demographic factors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the optimal number of clusters being seven for the London dataset but also mentions that two clusters with significant internal dissimilarity were further split.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for a single dataset (London households). Different geographic regions, demographics, and time periods may yield different optimal cluster numbers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using multiple datasets from different geographic regions, demographic compositions, and time periods, with systematic analysis of how optimal cluster numbers vary across these factors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different clustering algorithms perform when applied to electricity load profiling with varying feature engineering approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares four clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) and finds K-means performs best, but acknowledges that feature engineering significantly impacts results.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a specific set of engineered features. Different feature engineering approaches could change algorithm performance rankings and optimal cluster numbers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing multiple clustering algorithms with various feature engineering approaches on the same datasets, measuring performance differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the most effective approach for scaling clustering solutions to handle real-time data streams while maintaining interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for scalable solutions and introduces a probabilistic classifier with xAI for interpretability, but doesn't fully address real-time streaming scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on batch processing of historical data rather than real-time streaming data, and doesn't comprehensively evaluate the scalability of the xAI approach under different data volumes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of the proposed methodology on real-time streaming data, measuring processing time, classification accuracy, and interpretability quality under varying data loads.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance is highly dependent on the quality and specificity of feature engineering, which is not fully detailed
- Near-perfect classifier performance metrics (0.99-1.00 precision, 0.91-1.00 recall) suggest potential overfitting to the London dataset
- The methodology is tested on a single geographic region, limiting generalizability to other contexts

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The clustering methodology using multiple algorithms and evaluation metrics is sound and well-established
- **Medium confidence**: The CatBoost classifier effectively emulates clustering behavior, though generalizability requires validation
- **Medium confidence**: xAI feature importance findings, as the specific methods and validation approaches are not fully detailed

## Next Checks

1. Test the clustering framework on residential load data from different geographic regions and time periods to assess generalizability
2. Perform cross-validation on the CatBoost classifier to verify it is not overfitting to the London dataset
3. Validate the xAI feature importance results using multiple interpretability methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to ensure robustness
