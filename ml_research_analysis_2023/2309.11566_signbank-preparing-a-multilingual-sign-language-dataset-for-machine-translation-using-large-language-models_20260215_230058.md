# SignBank+: Preparing a Multilingual Sign Language Dataset for Machine Translation Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.11566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11566
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Improved sign language translation using cleaned SignBank+ dataset (BLEU 22.32, chrF 28.63 vs original BLEU 0.2, chrF 4.74)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving sign language machine translation by focusing on dataset quality and simplification of the translation system. The authors introduce SignBank+, a cleaned and expanded version of the SignBank dataset, optimized for machine translation between spoken language text and SignWriting. Unlike previous approaches that employ complex factorization techniques, they advocate for a simplified text-to-text translation approach. The evaluation results indicate that models trained on SignBank+ surpass those on the original dataset, with BLEU scores increasing from 0.2 to 22.32 and chrF scores from 4.74 to 28.63. This establishes a new benchmark for SignWriting-based sign language translation and provides an open resource for future research.

## Method Summary
The authors developed SignBank+ through a two-phase process: first cleaning the original SignBank dataset using rule-based methods followed by ChatGPT-based cleaning, then expanding the cleaned data using GPT-3.5-turbo to generate multiple equivalent expressions for each term. The cleaning pipeline (E1 + E4) combined rule-based corrections with LLM-based refinement using fixed few-shot examples. The expansion phase generated paraphrases, capitalization variants, and translations for each term. The authors trained multiple machine translation models (Sockeye, Fairseq, OpenNMT, mT5) on the cleaned/expanded data and evaluated performance using BLEU and chrF metrics, comparing results against the original dataset.

## Key Results
- BLEU scores improved from 0.2 to 22.32 when using cleaned SignBank+ data
- chrF scores improved from 4.74 to 28.63 with the cleaned dataset
- Simplified text-to-text translation approach matched or exceeded performance of complex factorization techniques
- SignBank+ dataset establishes new benchmark for SignWriting-based sign language translation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cleaning the dataset improves translation quality more than model architecture changes.
- Mechanism: Rule-based and LLM-based cleaning removes inconsistent and non-parallel entries, leading to cleaner training data.
- Core assumption: Parallel text-sign mappings are essential for accurate translation; noisy or incorrect pairs harm model learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our evaluation shows that models trained on SignBank+ surpass those on the original dataset, establishing a new benchmark for SignWriting-based sign language translation"
  - [section] "The hypothesis driving this study is twofold: First, a meticulously curated dataset will enhance the accuracy and reliability of translation models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers do not directly address data cleaning impact on sign language translation.
- Break condition: If the cleaning process removes too much data or introduces systematic biases, model performance could degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Simplified text-to-text translation performs as well as complex factorization techniques.
- Mechanism: Removing factorization steps and using standard machine translation models reduces complexity while maintaining performance.
- Core assumption: The complexity of factorization is not necessary when high-quality parallel data is available.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Contrary to previous works that employ complex factorization techniques for translation, we advocate for a simplified text-to-text translation approach."
  - [section] "Reverting to a simple text-to-text translation mechanism, omitting any factorization."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on different approaches (video, glosses) rather than comparing factorization vs. text-to-text.
- Break condition: If the data contains complex structural information that factorization captures but text-to-text misses, performance may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data expansion improves translation robustness by introducing variability.
- Mechanism: Generating multiple equivalent expressions for each term enriches the dataset and helps models handle linguistic variation.
- Core assumption: Exposure to multiple ways of expressing the same concept improves generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Variability in language representation can significantly benefit the robustness of machine translation models by providing multiple ways of expressing the same idea."
  - [section] "expand(language code, terms), producing expanded terms and proper capitalization."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers about data expansion effects.
- Break condition: If expansions introduce noise or incorrect translations, they may degrade rather than improve model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data cleaning and preprocessing in NLP
  - Why needed here: The SignBank dataset contains inconsistent entries, non-parallel text, and formatting issues that must be addressed before training.
  - Quick check question: What are the main sources of noise in the original SignBank dataset according to the paper?

- Concept: Machine translation evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these metrics to compare translation quality between original and cleaned datasets.
  - Quick check question: What BLEU score improvement did the cleaned dataset achieve over the original?

- Concept: Large language model prompting for data processing
- Why needed here: The paper uses ChatGPT/GPT models for both cleaning and expanding the dataset.
  - Quick check question: Which GPT model version was ultimately used for cleaning due to cost considerations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw SignBank data -> Rule-based cleaning -> ChatGPT cleaning (E1 + E4) -> Data expansion (expand()) -> MT model training (Sockeye/Fairseq/OpenNMT/mT5) -> BLEU/chrF evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Load raw SignBank data
  2. Apply cleaning rules and LLM-based corrections
  3. Generate expanded variations
  4. Train MT models on cleaned/expanded data
  5. Evaluate on test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cleaning vs. data retention: aggressive cleaning may remove useful data
  - Expansion vs. noise: more variations improve robustness but may introduce errors
  - Model complexity vs. data quality: simpler models work better with cleaner data

- Failure signatures:
  - BLEU/chrF scores remain low despite cleaning
  - Expanded data introduces systematic errors
  - Models overfit to expanded variations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline model on original SignBank data
  2. Train model on cleaned SignBank+ data
  3. Train model on expanded SignBank+ data and compare performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between dataset expansion (introducing multiple expressions for the same concept) and noise introduction in low-resource sign language machine translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that expanded data introduces both richness and potential noise, and they hypothesize that additional noise from expansion might smooth out existing noise in imperfect data.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows mixed results for expanded data performance and acknowledges difficulty in evaluating expansion quality due to subjective nature of valid expansions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying expansion strategies with quality estimation metrics, or human evaluation studies comparing expanded vs. non-expanded model outputs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop robust evaluation metrics for spoken-to-signed translation that are validated with human judgments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state this as a future work item: "robust evaluation metrics for spoken-to-signed translation should be created and validated with human judgments."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies on text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF) that may not capture the quality of SignWriting output, and there are no established human-validated metrics for this direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of SignWriting-specific evaluation metrics through systematic human judgment studies comparing automated scores with expert assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for encoding SignWriting as images or reducing token count to improve translation performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest this as future work: "optimizing the input representation, by encoding SignWriting as images, reducing the token count, or standardizing phoneme order, all of which could improve translation performance."
- Why unresolved: The paper uses 1D Formal SignWriting specification and doesn't explore alternative representations that might better capture spatial and temporal aspects of sign language.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different SignWriting representations (image-based, compressed token sequences, standardized phoneme ordering) against current text-based approaches.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo for data cleaning and expansion introduces potential bias and reproducibility concerns
- Lack of detailed implementation specifics for cleaning rules and few-shot examples makes faithful reproduction difficult
- Evaluation limited to SignWriting representation, limiting generalizability to other sign language notations

## Confidence
- High confidence: The baseline performance improvement (BLEU from 0.2 to 22.32, chrF from 4.74 to 28.63) is well-documented and represents a clear technical achievement.
- Medium confidence: The claim that simplified text-to-text translation matches or exceeds complex factorization approaches is supported by results but lacks direct comparative experiments.
- Low confidence: The long-term stability and generalization of LLM-cleaned datasets remain unproven, as does the optimal balance between cleaning aggressiveness and data retention.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproducibility Audit**: Implement the complete cleaning and expansion pipeline using only the specifications provided in the paper, documenting where assumptions must be made about missing implementation details. Compare results to the reported benchmarks to identify critical dependencies.

2. **Ablation Study Design**: Create controlled experiments isolating the effects of cleaning, data expansion, and simplified translation approach by testing each modification independently while holding other variables constant. This would clarify which mechanism drives performance gains.

3. **Cross-Notation Validation**: Extend the evaluation to alternative sign language representations (e.g., glosses, video-based features) to assess whether the dataset improvements generalize beyond SignWriting, addressing the current narrow evaluation scope.
