# You Can Generate It Again: Data-to-Text Generation with Verification and Correction Prompting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.15933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15933
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: VCP reduces SER from 0.89% to 0.41% on T5-small and from 0.60% to 0.33% on T5-base for ViGGO dataset, and from over 2.5% to almost 0 on E2E dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Verification and Correction Prompting (VCP), a multi-step approach for data-to-text generation that significantly reduces Semantic Error Rate (SER) while maintaining text quality. The method generates an initial output, verifies its correctness using a slot error checker, and regenerates the output if errors are found by incorporating error-correcting prompts. VCP achieves substantial SER reductions on benchmark datasets (ViGGO and E2E) by guiding the model to include previously omitted slot values through specialized prompts trained on a self-generated dataset.

## Method Summary
VCP follows a three-stage process: first, a T5 model is fine-tuned on data-to-text generation training data; second, a self-generated dataset is created where the fine-tuned model generates initial predictions that are then labeled with error-correcting prompts for any missing slots; third, the error-correcting prompts are trained to guide the model during regeneration. The approach freezes the original fine-tuned T5 model to preserve its text generation quality while only training the prompts, which are inserted adjacent to missing slot values to instruct the model to include them in subsequent predictions.

## Key Results
- On ViGGO dataset: VCP reduces SER from 0.89% to 0.41% on T5-small and from 0.60% to 0.33% on T5-base
- On E2E dataset: VCP reduces SER from over 2.5% to almost 0
- VCP maintains text quality while significantly reducing semantic errors
- The approach demonstrates effectiveness across different model sizes (T5-small and T5-base)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VCP reduces slot error rates by regenerating output when verification identifies missing keywords
- Mechanism: The approach generates initial output, verifies correctness with slot error checker, and adds error-correcting prompts adjacent to missing slots for regeneration
- Core assumption: Fine-tuned T5 model can effectively incorporate feedback from error-correcting prompts
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section descriptions of the verification and regeneration process
- Break condition: Slot error checker inaccuracies lead to ineffective error-correcting prompts

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Error-correcting prompts are trained to effectively guide model inclusion of missed slot values
- Mechanism: Self-generated dataset created using fine-tuned T5 model's initial predictions, with error-correcting prompts added to inputs with slot errors
- Core assumption: Self-generated dataset accurately represents model errors for effective prompt training
- Evidence anchors: Abstract description of data generation process and training methodology
- Break condition: Self-generated dataset not representative of actual model errors

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Freezing original fine-tuned T5 model preserves high-quality text generation
- Mechanism: Only error-correcting prompts are trained while original T5 model remains frozen
- Core assumption: Original fine-tuned T5 produces better quality text than further fine-tuned model
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section descriptions of training procedure
- Break condition: Error-correcting prompts insufficiently effective, requiring full model fine-tuning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data-to-text generation
  - Why needed here: VCP specifically designed for converting structured data into coherent text
  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of data-to-text generation, and what types of input data are commonly used?

- Concept: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models
  - Why needed here: VCP relies on fine-tuning pre-trained models like T5 for specific data-to-text tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of fine-tuning pre-trained language models, and how does it differ from training a model from scratch?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: VCP uses error-correcting prompts to guide model behavior during regeneration
  - Quick check question: How do prompts influence the behavior of language models, and what are some best practices for designing effective prompts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Fine-tuned T5 model -> Slot error checker -> Error-correcting prompts -> Data generator
- Critical path: 1) Fine-tune T5 model, 2) Generate self-generated dataset, 3) Train error-correcting prompts, 4) Use VCP for inference (generate, verify, prompt, regenerate)
- Design tradeoffs: Freezing T5 model preserves quality but may limit prompt effectiveness vs. full fine-tuning that could degrade text quality
- Failure signatures: High slot error rates indicate ineffective prompts, low text quality suggests negative prompt impact, high computational cost implies expensive error checking or regeneration
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare VCP with different numbers of error-correcting prompts (3 vs. 6), 2) Evaluate freezing vs. fine-tuning entire model on prompt dataset, 3) Test VCP robustness across different slot error types (boolean, numerical, categorical)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does effectiveness of error-correcting prompts compare to fine-tuning entire model on generated training data?
- Basis in paper: Explicit comparison showing lower BLEU and SER scores with full fine-tuning
- Why unresolved: Paper provides comparison but lacks detailed analysis of advantages and disadvantages
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive comparison including strengths and weaknesses analysis

- Question: How does slot error checker accuracy affect overall VCP performance?
- Basis in paper: Explicit mention of checker's limitations in recognizing different wordings for slot information
- Why unresolved: No detailed analysis of checker accuracy impact or improvement methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Study evaluating checker accuracy impact and exploring improvement methods

- Question: How does VCP perform on other data-to-text tasks like image-to-text generation or text style transfer?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from mention of potential applications to other problems where posterior checking is valuable
- Why unresolved: No experimental results or analysis on these tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results and analysis on these other tasks

## Limitations

- The slot error checker's exact implementation remains unclear, particularly for boolean slot value pairs
- The self-generated dataset creation process lacks specificity about how error-correcting prompts are constructed and validated
- The claim about preserving text quality by freezing the T5 model is not empirically validated against a fully fine-tuned baseline

## Confidence

- Claims about SER reduction on benchmark datasets: High (supported by quantitative results)
- Claims about mechanism of error-correcting prompts: Medium (lacks detailed validation and implementation clarity)
- Claims about benefits of freezing T5 model: Low (not directly tested or compared)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate VCP on additional data-to-text datasets beyond ViGGO and E2E to assess whether observed SER improvements generalize to different domains and data structures

2. **Ablation study on freezing vs. fine-tuning**: Systematically compare VCP's approach of freezing T5 model against version where entire model is fine-tuned on prompt training dataset, measuring both SER reduction and text quality impacts

3. **Error type analysis**: Conduct detailed error classification to determine whether VCP improvements come primarily from specific slot error types (boolean, numerical, categorical) and identify systematic weaknesses in handling certain error categories
