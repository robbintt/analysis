# Dynamically Updating Event Representations for Temporal Relation Classification with Multi-category Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20236
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20236
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: Proposed model achieves 65.9%, 55.8%, and 65.0% micro-F1 scores on English E2D, E2T, and E2E categories respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neural network model for temporal relation classification that dynamically manages event representations across multiple temporal links involving a common source event. The model processes temporal links in a source event centric chain using a recurrent neural network to update the source event representation sequentially. Multi-category learning is employed to leverage all three temporal link categories (E2E, E2T, E2D) simultaneously. Experiments on English and Japanese datasets show the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art systems and ablation baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both dynamic event representation and multi-category learning.

## Method Summary
The model uses BERT to encode mentions and a Source Event Centric (SEC) recurrent neural network (RNN) to dynamically update source event representations across temporal links (TLINKs) in a chain. The SECT chains are constructed by grouping TLINKs by source event and ordering target mentions chronologically. A two-layer GRU updates the source event embedding as it processes each TLINK in the chain. The model employs multi-task learning with three category-specific classifiers (E2E, E2T, E2D) sharing the BERT encoder and RNN layers, trained with a combined loss function. Japanese text is morphologically analyzed with Juman++ before processing.

## Key Results
- Achieves 65.9%, 55.8%, and 65.0% micro-F1 scores on English E2D, E2T, and E2E categories respectively
- Outperforms state-of-the-art systems and ablation baselines on both English and Japanese datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness of both dynamic event representation and multi-category learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequential RNN updating of source event embeddings captures temporal dependency patterns across TLINKs.
- Mechanism: The model processes all TLINKs involving the same source event in chronological order of target mentions, updating the source event representation at each step using a gated recurrent unit. This allows later predictions to benefit from information accumulated through earlier TLINKs in the chain.
- Core assumption: Temporal relations between events follow predictable patterns that can be learned from observing multiple TLINKs with the same source event in sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our model deals with three TLINK categories with multi-task learning to leverage the full size of data."
  - [section]: "We assume that our system is capable of learning dynamic representations of the centric event ei along the SECT chain via a 'global' recurrent neural network (RNN)."
  - [corpus]: Limited - the paper provides empirical results showing improvement but doesn't deeply analyze what specific temporal patterns the RNN learns.
- Break condition: If temporal relations between events are too context-dependent or non-sequential to benefit from chained processing, or if the order of target mentions doesn't reflect meaningful temporal progression.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-category learning with combined loss improves performance by sharing representation learning across TLINK categories.
- Mechanism: A single BERT encoder and RNN layer process all TLINKs, then feed representations to three separate category-specific classifiers (E2E, E2T, E2D). The combined loss function (L = LE2E + LE2T + LE2D) allows the shared layers to learn representations useful across all temporal relation types.
- Core assumption: There is significant overlap in the linguistic features needed to identify different types of temporal relations, making shared representation learning beneficial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our model deals with three TLINK categories with multi-task learning to leverage the full size of data."
  - [section]: "Our model further exploits a multi-task learning framework to leverage all three categories of TLINKs in the SECT chain scope."
  - [corpus]: The ablation study shows Multi-BERT (multi-category without global RNN) outperforms Local-BERT, suggesting benefit from category sharing even without the RNN component.
- Break condition: If the categories are too dissimilar and require completely different features, forcing shared learning could hurt performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Source event centric organization reduces computational complexity while maintaining global context benefits.
- Mechanism: Instead of modeling all TLINKs in a document globally, the model organizes TLINKs into chains centered on each source event. This limits the "global" scope to manageable chains while still allowing cross-TLINK learning within each chain.
- Core assumption: Temporal relations involving the same source event are more likely to share contextual dependencies than random pairs of events in a document.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper presents an event centric model that allows to manage dynamic event representations across multiple TLINKs."
  - [section]: "We propose a simplified scenario called Source Event Centric TLINK (SECT) chain."
  - [corpus]: Table 1 shows average TLINKs per SECT chain (5.5 for English, 2.4 for Japanese), suggesting chains are of reasonable length for RNN processing.
- Break condition: If temporal relations are primarily determined by document-level context rather than source-event-specific context, the chain-based approach may miss important information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal relation classification fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different types of temporal relations (E2E, E2T, E2D) and their linguistic cues is essential for designing appropriate features and evaluating model performance.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between E2E, E2T, and E2D temporal relations and give an example of each?

- Concept: Recurrent neural network dynamics
  - Why needed here: The model uses a two-layer GRU to sequentially update event representations. Understanding how RNNs maintain and update hidden states is crucial for debugging and improving the model.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the hidden state in an RNN after processing a sequence of inputs, and how does this enable the model to use context from earlier steps?

- Concept: Multi-task learning principles
  - Why needed here: The model combines three classification tasks through shared layers and a combined loss. Understanding when and why multi-task learning works helps in modifying or extending the approach.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using multi-task learning versus training separate models for each temporal relation category?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input text with events -> BERT encoder -> SECT chain organizer -> Source event centric RNN -> Category-specific classifiers -> Output predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenization and mention extraction
  2. BERT encoding of all mentions
  3. SECT chain construction
  4. RNN-based source event representation updates
  5. Classification through category-specific heads
  6. Loss calculation and backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - RNN directionality: Left-to-right assumes chronological order of target mentions reflects temporal order, which may not always hold
  - Chain scope: SECT chains limit global context to source-event-specific relationships, potentially missing document-level patterns
  - Multi-task vs single-task: Combined training helps with data efficiency but may force the model to learn suboptimal shared representations

- Failure signatures:
  - Degradation in E2E performance relative to E2T/E2D could indicate events are too contextually diverse for chained processing
  - Poor performance on long-distance TLINKs within chains might suggest the RNN struggles to maintain quality representations over many steps
  - Inconsistent performance across categories could indicate the combined loss isn't well-balanced for all relation types

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation test: Remove the RNN and compare to Multi-BERT baseline to verify the RNN adds value
  2. Input order variation: Process SECT chains in reverse order to test if chronology assumption is important
  3. Category-specific RNNs: Replace the shared RNN with three separate RNNs to test if multi-task learning is beneficial

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How does the model performance vary with different lengths of SECT chains?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Timebank-Dense contains around 10,000 TLINKs in only 36 documents and is 7 times denser than the original Timebank, implying significant variation in chain lengths.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis of model performance across different chain lengths or how chain length affects the quality of dynamic event representations.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing model performance across SECT chains of varying lengths, particularly analyzing if there's a threshold length beyond which performance degrades or if very short chains limit the benefits of the global RNN.

- Open Question 2: How robust is the model to noise or errors in temporal relation annotations in the training data?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on dense annotation schemas like Timebank-Dense, which involves compulsory dense annotation with complete graphs of TLINKs, suggesting potential sensitivity to annotation noise.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the model's robustness to annotation errors or noise in the training data, which is crucial for real-world applications where annotations may be imperfect.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating model performance when trained on artificially corrupted data or when exposed to varying levels of annotation noise, along with analysis of error propagation through the dynamic event representations.

- Open Question 3: Can the model effectively handle temporal reasoning across longer document spans beyond adjacent sentences?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on SECT chains within adjacent sentences and mentions that "globally managing event representations of a whole document takes an extremely heavy load for the dense corpora."
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the model's capability for cross-document or longer-range temporal reasoning, which could be important for comprehensive temporal understanding.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the model on datasets with longer-range temporal dependencies, or ablation studies removing the adjacent-sentence constraint to see how performance changes with increased temporal scope.

## Limitations

- Performance relies heavily on quality of event and time mention annotation, which can be error-prone and labor-intensive
- SECT chain construction assumes chronological ordering of target mentions reflects temporal progression, which may not always hold true
- Japanese results based on smaller dataset with different characteristics than English corpus, limiting cross-linguistic generalization claims

## Confidence

- High confidence in empirical results (65.9%, 55.8%, and 65.0% micro-F1 scores on English E2D, E2T, and E2E respectively) as these are directly measured on established benchmark datasets
- Medium confidence in claims about dynamic event representation learning, as the paper provides performance improvements but limited analysis of what temporal patterns the RNN actually learns
- Low confidence in claims about superiority of multi-category learning over separate training, as the ablation study shows improvements but doesn't explore the full space of possible training strategies

## Next Checks

1. **Chain order sensitivity**: Test the model's performance when processing SECT chains in different orders (chronological, reverse-chronological, random) to quantify the importance of the ordering assumption.

2. **Category-specific component analysis**: Replace the shared RNN with three separate RNNs (one per category) while keeping the multi-task loss to isolate the benefits of shared representation learning from shared RNN parameters.

3. **Cross-linguistic generalization**: Evaluate the model's performance on additional languages or domains to test whether the SECT chain approach generalizes beyond the English and Japanese datasets used in the experiments.
