# Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Large-Scale Dynamic Bayesian Network Structure Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01739
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01739
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 74.45% and 110.94% average improvements in two accuracy metrics, 93.65% runtime reduction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a divide-and-conquer approach for large-scale Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) structure learning, specifically targeting 2 Time-sliced Bayesian Networks (2-TBNs). The method adapts the Partition-Estimation-Fusion (PEF) strategy, originally designed for static Bayesian networks, to improve scalability and accuracy in DBN learning. By leveraging the temporal structure of 2-TBNs and incorporating parallel processing, the approach achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and structure learning accuracy on datasets with over 1,000 variables.

## Method Summary
The proposed method follows a three-step PEF strategy: Partition, Estimation, and Fusion. First, variables are clustered using a Modified Hierarchical Clustering (MHC) algorithm. Second, each cluster is processed independently using a base structure learning algorithm (PC-Stable) in parallel to learn subgraph structures. Finally, the learned subgraphs are fused together using an enhanced fusion technique that leverages prior knowledge of 2-TBN temporal constraints to improve accuracy. The method specifically exploits the Markov property of 2-TBNs by constraining the search space during fusion, preventing edges between variables within the same time slice and from future to past variables.

## Key Results
- Average improvements of 74.45% and 110.94% in two accuracy metrics (F1 Adjacent and F1 Arrowhead)
- 93.65% reduction in runtime on problem instances with more than 1,000 variables
- Successful scaling to datasets with up to 1,323 variables

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Reduced Computational Complexity
The divide-and-conquer approach splits the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, significantly reducing computational complexity. By partitioning variables into clusters using Modified Hierarchical Clustering, each subgraph becomes more manageable for structure learning algorithms.

### Mechanism 2: Improved Fusion Accuracy with Prior Knowledge
Leveraging prior knowledge of 2-TBNs improves fusion accuracy by constraining the search space. The method uses temporal structure to eliminate impossible edges during fusion, specifically preventing edges within the same time slice and from future to past variables.

### Mechanism 3: Parallel Processing Benefits
Independent processing of subgraphs during the estimation phase significantly reduces runtime. By executing structure learning for each cluster in parallel across multiple cores, the overall runtime is reduced to the maximum time taken by any single cluster.

## Foundational Learning

- **Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs)**: Understanding DBNs is essential to grasp why the 2-TBN structure can be exploited and how temporal dependencies differ from static BNs.
  - *Quick check*: What is the key difference between a DBN and a static BN in terms of how they represent dependencies?

- **Markov Equivalence Classes (MECs)**: The method uses MECs to represent learned structures, and understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting the evaluation metrics (F1 Adjacent and F1 Arrowhead).
  - *Quick check*: Why do many BN structure learning algorithms return MECs instead of DAGs?

- **Conditional Independence (CI) tests**: The partition and fusion phases rely heavily on CI tests to determine cluster membership and edge existence.
  - *Quick check*: How does the PC-Stable algorithm use CI tests to learn BN structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Partition (MHC) → Estimation (PC-Stable, parallel) → Fusion (enhanced with 2-TBN knowledge)
- **Critical path**: Partition → Estimation (parallel) → Fusion
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Cluster size vs. accuracy: Smaller clusters reduce computation but may miss cross-cluster dependencies
  - Parallelization vs. communication overhead: More clusters enable better parallelization but increase coordination complexity
  - Strict prior knowledge vs. flexibility: Tighter constraints on fusion improve accuracy but may exclude valid edges
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor accuracy: High inter-cluster correlations or violated Markov assumptions
  - Long runtime: Inefficient parallelization or imbalanced cluster sizes
  - Memory issues: Too many large clusters or inefficient data structures
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test with synthetic data where the true structure is known, varying the number of clusters to find the optimal balance between accuracy and runtime
  2. Compare performance with and without the 2-TBN-specific fusion improvements on a standard benchmark
  3. Profile runtime and memory usage with different base structure learning algorithms to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several limitations suggest areas for future research, including extending the approach to DBNs with more than 2 time slices and evaluating performance on datasets with millions of variables.

## Limitations
- Heavy dependence on accurate Modified Hierarchical Clustering to group correlated variables
- Assumes strict 2-TBN temporal constraints that may not hold in all real-world data
- Parallel processing benefits may not scale linearly beyond tested cluster sizes

## Confidence

- Runtime reduction claims: **High confidence** (well-supported by empirical results with multiple problem instances)
- Accuracy improvements: **Medium confidence** (based on specific metrics that may not generalize to all applications)
- Parallel processing benefits: **Medium confidence** (valid for tested configurations but scalability uncertain)
- 2-TBN prior knowledge assumptions: **Medium-Low confidence** (relies on strict temporal constraints that may not hold in all domains)

## Next Checks

1. **Inter-cluster dependency analysis**: Systematically measure the correlation between variables across different clusters to quantify the information loss from the divide-and-conquer approach.

2. **Temporal constraint relaxation testing**: Evaluate performance when relaxing the strict 2-TBN temporal constraints to understand the robustness of the fusion phase.

3. **Scalability profiling**: Test the method on problem instances with 10,000+ variables to determine whether the 93.65% runtime reduction scales linearly and identify the point at which parallelization overhead outweighs benefits.
