# InceptionCaps: A Performant Glaucoma Classification Model for Data-scarce Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00803
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: InceptionCaps achieves 0.956 accuracy, 0.96 specificity, and 0.9556 AUC on RIM-ONE v2 for glaucoma classification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents InceptionCaps, a novel deep learning model for automatic glaucoma classification from retinal fundus images in data-scarce environments. The model combines a pre-trained InceptionV3 convolutional base with a capsule network to effectively classify glaucoma cases using limited labeled data. Evaluated on the RIM-ONE v2 dataset, InceptionCaps demonstrates superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning models, achieving 95.6% accuracy, 96% specificity, and 95.56% AUC. The results highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning and capsule networks for medical image classification when training data is limited.

## Method Summary
InceptionCaps integrates a pre-trained InceptionV3 model with capsule network layers to classify glaucoma from retinal fundus images. The InceptionV3 base extracts hierarchical features from 64×64 pixel images, which are then processed by capsule layers that preserve spatial relationships between anatomical structures. The model is trained end-to-end on the RIM-ONE v2 dataset with basic preprocessing (resizing and normalization) without additional data augmentation. Transfer learning enables effective performance despite the limited dataset size, while capsule layers capture the part-whole relationships crucial for glaucoma diagnosis.

## Key Results
- Achieved 95.6% accuracy, 96% specificity, and 95.56% AUC on RIM-ONE v2 dataset
- Outperformed state-of-the-art models including VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 alone
- Demonstrated effective glaucoma classification in data-scarce environments without specialized preprocessing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning enables effective glaucoma classification with limited labeled data.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained InceptionV3 extracts rich hierarchical features from fundus images, which are then processed by capsule layers to preserve spatial relationships and part-whole structure.
- Core assumption: Features learned from ImageNet generalize sufficiently to medical fundus images for glaucoma detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A novel deep learning model, InceptionCaps, is proposed that combines a pre-trained InceptionV3 convolutional base with a capsule network."
  - [section]: "TL-based models that were trained on publicly available data, without any specialized preprocessing, were selected for the purposes of this work."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Corpus papers focus on glaucoma detection but don't directly validate InceptionCaps' transfer learning mechanism.
- Break condition: If feature distribution shift between ImageNet and fundus images is too large, pre-trained weights may introduce noise rather than useful features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Capsule layers preserve spatial relationships and part-whole structure better than traditional CNNs.
- Mechanism: Capsule layers encode spatial relationships between optic disc, cup, and other anatomical features, improving glaucoma detection accuracy.
- Core assumption: Glaucoma diagnosis relies on relative positioning of anatomical structures, not just their presence/absence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CNN's translation-invariant nature and inability to handle the part-whole relationship between objects make its direct application unsuitable for glaucomatous fundus image classification."
  - [section]: "CapsNet [7] overcame some of the shortcomings of CNNs... strives for viewpoint equivariance, i.e., any change in viewpoint at input results in a similar variance in the output's viewpoint."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related corpus papers don't specifically address capsule networks or spatial relationship preservation.
- Break condition: If capsule routing becomes unstable or fails to converge, the model may underperform compared to standard CNNs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining InceptionV3 with capsule network creates complementary feature extraction.
- Mechanism: InceptionV3 captures high-level abstract features while capsule layers capture low-level spatial relationships, resulting in more discriminative representations.
- Core assumption: Glaucoma detection benefits from both abstract feature patterns and precise spatial relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "InceptionCaps, a novel capsule network (CapsNet) based deep learning model having pre-trained InceptionV3 as its convolution base"
  - [section]: "The CNNs are complex models and increase the computational resource necessary. More work is needed to optimize the models' computational resource requirement by compressing the model through pruning and quantization."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Corpus papers don't discuss combined InceptionV3-capsule architectures.
- Break condition: If computational overhead becomes prohibitive or the two components don't integrate well, the hybrid approach may underperform simpler alternatives.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (64×64 fundus images) → InceptionV3 base → Primary capsules (32×8D) → Class capsules (2×16D) → Output (softmax)

- Critical path:
  1. Image preprocessing (resize, normalize)
  2. InceptionV3 feature extraction
  3. Capsule routing and vector encoding
  4. Class prediction via softmax
  5. Loss calculation and backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Resolution vs. computational cost: 64×64 chosen to balance detail and efficiency
  - Capsule routing iterations: 3 iterations provide good balance of accuracy and speed
  - Transfer learning vs. training from scratch: Transfer learning essential due to limited data

- Failure signatures:
  - Low training accuracy: Indicates underfitting or insufficient feature extraction
  - High training but low validation accuracy: Indicates overfitting to limited training data
  - Unstable routing: Indicates issues with capsule layer configuration

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: InceptionV3 alone with frozen weights vs. fine-tuned
  2. Capsule comparison: Test different base convolutional configurations (filter counts, kernel sizes)
  3. Data augmentation impact: Compare performance with and without geometric transformations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of InceptionCaps compare to other state-of-the-art models on larger, more diverse datasets with images from different ethnicities and camera models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the model cannot generalize well on diverse test input and should be trained on a larger, more diverse dataset to enable more generalized performance.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluated the model on the RIM-ONE v2, RIM-ONE dl, and ACRIMA datasets, which may not be representative of the broader population.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on larger, more diverse datasets with images from different ethnicities and camera models would provide insights into the model's generalization capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different pre-processing techniques, such as image segmentation and normalization, on the performance of InceptionCaps?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the model achieved the highest accuracy without any additional preprocessing and data augmentation, but does not explore the impact of different pre-processing techniques.
- Why unresolved: The study only used basic preprocessing techniques, such as resizing and pixel value normalization, and did not investigate the impact of more advanced techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different pre-processing techniques, such as image segmentation and normalization, would provide insights into their impact on the model's performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational resource requirement of InceptionCaps compare to other state-of-the-art models, and what are the potential optimization strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the CNNs are complex models and increase the computational resource necessary, but does not provide a detailed comparison of computational requirements.
- Why unresolved: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resource requirements of InceptionCaps compared to other models, nor does it explore potential optimization strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to measure the computational resource requirements of InceptionCaps and comparing them to other models, as well as exploring optimization strategies such as model pruning and quantization, would provide insights into the model's efficiency.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset evaluation with only 455 images from RIM-ONE v2 may not capture full glaucoma variability
- Insufficient cross-dataset validation to assess generalization across different imaging conditions and populations
- Incomplete architectural details for capsule network implementation make precise reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- High confidence: Transfer learning with InceptionV3 improves glaucoma classification performance compared to training from scratch
- Medium confidence: Capsule networks provide meaningful improvements over standard CNNs for glaucoma detection, but evidence is limited to single dataset
- Low confidence: The specific architectural choices (64×64 resolution, capsule dimensions, routing iterations) are optimal for this task

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test InceptionCaps on additional independent glaucoma datasets (e.g., ACRIMA, Drishti-GS) to assess generalizability across different imaging conditions and populations.

2. **Ablation study**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each component (InceptionV3 base, capsule layers, specific routing parameters) through controlled experiments removing or modifying each element.

3. **Clinical validation**: Assess model performance on clinically relevant subgroups (different stages of glaucoma, varying image quality) and compare diagnostic performance metrics with clinical experts.
