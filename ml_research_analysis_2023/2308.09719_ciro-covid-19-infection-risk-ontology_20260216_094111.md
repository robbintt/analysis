# CIRO: COVID-19 infection risk ontology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.09719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09719

- Primary result: Developed ontology-based system for automated COVID-19 infection risk assessment using RDF and OWL reasoning

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of automating infection risk assessment during contact tracing for highly contagious diseases like COVID-19, which traditionally required significant manual labor by public health officials. To solve this, the authors developed the COVID-19 Infection Risk Ontology (CIRO), a knowledge-based system that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL queries to represent and infer infection risks based on Japanese government guidelines and risk factors. The ontology models behavioral events, spatial contexts, and risk conditions to enable automated risk classification. Evaluation showed that CIRO successfully inferred infection risks formulated by the government and demonstrated reasoning feasibility, though computational efficiency challenges were identified for large-scale deployment. The system can flexibly extend to incorporate new risk factors and potentially apply to other infectious diseases.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing an OWL-based ontology (CIRO) encoding Japanese government COVID-19 risk factors and behavioral contexts, then converting patient survey data into RDF knowledge graphs. SPARQL queries identify overlapping events for contact tracing, while HermiT inference engine performs OWL reasoning to classify infection risk levels. The system uses an event-centric model linking agents, locations, actions, and times, with Situation classes modeling spatial context independently. The ontology was validated through consistency checks, SPARQL query testing, and HermiT inference on synthetic datasets with known risk levels.

## Key Results
- Successfully inferred government-formulated infection risks using OWL reasoning on synthetic datasets
- Validated ontology consistency and SPARQL query functionality for overlap detection
- Identified computational efficiency challenges with inference times ranging from 5-2000 seconds for 100-1000 records

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ontology-based knowledge representation enables automated infection risk inference from behavioral histories.
- Mechanism: CIRO encodes Japanese government risk factors and spatial/behavioral contexts as OWL axioms. SPARQL queries and OWL reasoning classify events into risk categories (Three Cs) based on cardinality and context conditions.
- Core assumption: Risk factors and spatial contexts can be formally modeled such that OWL reasoning will correctly classify infection risk levels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CIRO expresses infection risks of COVID-19 formulated by the Japanese government... using RDF and SPARQL queries."
  - [section 3.1.7] "OWL reasoning classifies Event and Situation instances into Three Cs classes."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence—no corpus mentions RDF/OWL modeling; claims are internal to paper.
- Break condition: If risk factors cannot be fully expressed in OWL 2 DL or if cardinality conditions fail to capture real-world complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Event-centric schema preserves spatiotemporal relationships needed for contact tracing.
- Mechanism: Each Event links agents, locations, actions, and times; Situation class models spatial context independently; context objects attach risk factors. This structure supports flexible querying and inference of overlaps.
- Core assumption: The event-centric model can capture all necessary details for risk assessment and that querying overlaps is sufficient for contact tracing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.1] "An event is an entity that describes 'who, when, where, and what' information obtained from the patients' behavior surveys."
  - [section 3.2] "Dummy data that imitate the actual behavior survey data are generated, and converted into a knowledge graph (KG) in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence; this is a design choice of the paper.
- Break condition: If real patient data contain details not captured by the schema or if querying becomes too slow with scale.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: OWL reasoning on the knowledge graph can infer infection risk levels for each event and situation.
- Mechanism: Class axioms (e.g., HighLevelClosedSpace) use existential restrictions and cardinality to classify instances; HermiT inference engine checks consistency and computes classifications.
- Core assumption: OWL 2 DL axioms can express the infection risk rules accurately and HermiT will scale sufficiently for real-time use.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "We employed axioms that OWL 2 DL can use to infer... we use HermiT... to verify whether it can correctly infer all infection risks."
  - [section 4.2] "We confirmed that the inference was valid in the all test cases."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence; evaluation is internal.
- Break condition: If inference time grows too large (as shown in experiments) or if axioms do not capture all risk scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL
  - Why needed here: RDF stores the knowledge graph; SPARQL queries retrieve risk-relevant events and overlaps.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between RDF triples and OWL axioms in this context?
- Concept: Web Ontology Language (OWL) and reasoning
  - Why needed here: OWL axioms encode infection risk rules; reasoning infers classifications not explicitly stated.
  - Quick check question: How does OWL 2 DL cardinality differ from SWRL rules for expressing "two or more"?
- Concept: Event-centric modeling
  - Why needed here: Captures who, when, where, what for each contact; essential for risk inference and overlap detection.
  - Quick check question: Why separate Situation from Event classes in the ontology?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - CIRO ontology (OWL classes, properties, axioms)
  - RDF knowledge graph (converted from patient survey data)
  - Triple store (GraphDB) with SPARQL endpoint
  - HermiT inference engine for OWL 2 DL reasoning
  - TogoDB for RDF conversion
  - End-user applications (not detailed in paper)
- Critical path:
  1. Patient surveys entered into spreadsheet
  2. TogoDB converts to RDF
  3. GraphDB stores triples
  4. SPARQL queries retrieve candidate overlaps
  5. HermiT performs OWL reasoning for risk classification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - OWL 2 DL expressiveness vs. inference performance (noted as slow at scale)
  - Detailed risk modeling vs. simplicity for non-experts
  - Privacy (anonymized RDF) vs. epidemiological detail
- Failure signatures:
  - Long inference times (experiments show 5–2000 seconds)
  - Incomplete risk classification due to schema gaps
  - SPARQL queries return too many or too few overlaps
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate ontology consistency with OntoDebug
  2. Run SPARQL queries on small RDF dataset to check overlap detection
  3. Test HermiT inference on synthetic dataset with known risk levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the scalability limitations of CIRO when processing large-scale contact tracing data in real-world public health scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies computational efficiency challenges for large-scale deployment, noting that with 10,000 data points, results could take up to 10 hours to obtain.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the need for data distribution and parallel processing, it does not provide concrete solutions or benchmarks for scaling CIRO to real-world volumes of contact tracing data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation studies demonstrating CIRO's performance on actual public health datasets with millions of records, including optimized parallel processing approaches and measurable improvements in inference speed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would incorporating biomedical ontologies like CIDO or IDO with CIRO affect infection risk inference accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CIRO focuses on public health operations while biomedical ontologies like CIDO integrate heterogeneous biomedical information, suggesting potential for integration but not exploring this direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the possibility of bridging CIRO with biomedical ontologies but explicitly states this is "beyond the scope of the present study," leaving the potential benefits and implementation challenges unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing CIRO's risk inference accuracy with and without integration of biomedical ontologies, measuring improvements in prediction accuracy and identifying specific biomedical factors that enhance risk assessment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the privacy implications and technical requirements for implementing CIRO in real-world contact tracing systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes a framework where patients report behaviors to a behavior reporting system, but doesn't address privacy concerns or technical requirements for data collection, storage, and sharing.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines a system architecture, it doesn't address critical implementation issues such as data anonymization, consent management, secure data transmission, or compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
- What evidence would resolve it: Privacy impact assessments and technical specifications for CIRO-based systems that demonstrate compliance with relevant privacy regulations, including data flow diagrams, encryption protocols, and user consent mechanisms.

## Limitations

- Computational performance is a significant limitation, with inference times ranging from 5 seconds to over 30 minutes for datasets of 1,000 records, making real-time application challenging
- Evaluation relied entirely on synthetic data without external validation or real-world deployment testing, limiting generalizability
- Applicability to other infectious diseases remains speculative as only COVID-19 was considered

## Confidence

- High confidence: OWL reasoning successfully inferred known risk classifications on synthetic datasets
- Medium confidence: Technical approach is sound but real-world effectiveness unproven due to lack of external validation
- Low confidence: Scalability claims are based on limited experiments with synthetic data only

## Next Checks

1. Test CIRO with anonymized real patient contact tracing data from multiple health departments to assess practical performance and accuracy
2. Benchmark CIRO's inference speed against rule-based systems and machine learning approaches using identical datasets
3. Evaluate CIRO's flexibility by applying the ontology structure to risk assessment for other respiratory diseases like influenza or tuberculosis
