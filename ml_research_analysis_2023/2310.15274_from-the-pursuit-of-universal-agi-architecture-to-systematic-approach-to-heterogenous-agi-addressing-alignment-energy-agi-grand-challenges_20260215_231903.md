# From the Pursuit of Universal AGI Architecture to Systematic Approach to Heterogenous AGI: Addressing Alignment, Energy, & AGI Grand Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15274
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes Systematic Approach to AGI (SAGI) using system design principles, neuromorphic chips, and moral architecture to address energy efficiency, alignment, and the AGI grand challenges

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a paradigm shift from pursuing universal AGI architectures to a Systematic Approach to AGI (SAGI) that addresses AI's trifecta of grand challenges: energy wall, alignment problem, and the leap to AGI. The core insight is that AGI can be achieved through system design principles rather than a single universal architecture, with alignment as the foundational criterion. SAGI leverages hardware-level integration, neuromorphic chips, and application-specific designs to overcome energy inefficiencies while embedding moral architecture into the system design. By focusing on system design principles and brain-inspired organization, the approach aims to guarantee alignment, efficiency, and scalability, moving beyond narrow AI toward robust, application-specific AGI systems.

## Method Summary
The method synthesizes system design principles from human brain architecture with contemporary hardware advancements to create AGI systems. It proposes using neuromorphic chips for energy efficiency, hierarchical modular networks for complexity management, specialized functional regions for cognitive capabilities, and dedicated moral architecture for alignment. The approach emphasizes end-to-end system design from building-block level to high-level architecture, integrating hardware optimization, cognitive function integration, and alignment mechanism implementation throughout the design and runtime stages.

## Key Results
- AGI achievable through system design rather than universal architecture
- Neuromorphic chips can provide orders-of-magnitude energy improvements and enable on-the-fly learning
- Alignment requires full system support through specialized functional regions and regulatory mechanisms
- Hierarchical organization and modularity enable efficient integration of diverse cognitive capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: System design enables AGI by capturing complexity that software-only approaches cannot represent efficiently.
- Mechanism: Hardware-level integration and neuromorphic chips provide orders-of-magnitude energy improvements and enable on-the-fly learning, eliminating energy-hungry training exercises.
- Core assumption: Natural intelligence is a complex system that cannot be adequately modeled through pure software mathematical approximations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Systematic AI approach uses system design principles from the building-block level to high-level system architecture as well as throughout the design and run-time stages."
  - [section] "Systematic AGI provides other advantages such as: Capturing and Dealing with Complexity...Current AI approaches use software implemented mathematical approximations to reach target functional goals, limiting efficiency and scalability of AI."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on AGI frameworks and safety but don't specifically address hardware-system complexity capture.
- Break condition: If neuromorphic chips cannot provide sufficient energy efficiency improvements or if on-the-fly learning proves infeasible for AGI-level complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Morality and alignment require full system support because they involve multiple competing cognitive subsystems and emotional processes.
- Mechanism: Specialized functional regions, connectivity patterns, and regulatory mechanisms are needed to represent the complexities of moral decision-making and integrate emotional signals.
- Core assumption: Moral decisions are system-dependent and involve complex interactions among subsystems rather than being purely outcome-based.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Capturing the complexities of human morality for alignment requires architectural support to represent the intricacies of moral decision-making and the pervasive ethical processing at every level."
  - [section] "Morality requires a balanced cognitive system and dedicated system support...without system design and system support it may not be possible to reach full alignment."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss AGI safety frameworks but don't specifically address the system-level requirements for moral decision-making.
- Break condition: If moral decision-making can be approximated through simpler reward-based learning without requiring complex system architecture.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical organization and modularity enable efficient integration of diverse cognitive capabilities while maintaining system performance and resilience.
- Mechanism: Brain-inspired modular networks operate hierarchically at different scales, with smaller modular networks integrated to form larger units and subsystems.
- Core assumption: Hierarchical organization provides advantages in dealing with complexity and enables efficient system integration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Systematic AGI approach uses system design principles from the building-block level to high-level system architecture"
  - [section] "Hierarchy appears to be central to the brain architecture, as it provides advantages in dealing with complexity. The brain is composed of modular networks that operate hierarchically at different scales"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers mention AGI architectures but don't specifically discuss hierarchical organization as a core principle.
- Break condition: If hierarchical organization proves too rigid for AGI applications or if alternative organizational principles prove more effective.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Neuromorphic chips -> Hierarchical modular networks -> Specialized functional regions -> Connectivity subsystems -> Regulatory mechanisms
- Critical path: Hardware optimization → System architecture design → Cognitive function integration → Alignment mechanism implementation → Testing and calibration
- Design tradeoffs: Energy efficiency vs. computational power, system complexity vs. controllability, hardware specificity vs. generalizability
- Failure signatures: Poor energy efficiency, misaligned moral decisions, system instability, inability to integrate diverse cognitive functions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic neuromorphic chip integration with simple learning algorithms to verify energy efficiency improvements
  2. Test hierarchical modular network organization with basic cognitive functions to validate integration capabilities
  3. Implement simplified moral decision-making mechanism using known brain regions to verify alignment architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can neuromorphic chips completely eliminate the energy wall for AI systems by replacing traditional software training methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses neuromorphic chips like Loihi-2 consuming less than 1 Watt power and proposes that replacing energy-hungry software training with neuromorphic chips could provide unprecedented opportunities to overcome the energy wall.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents promising evidence about neuromorphic chips' energy efficiency, it doesn't provide conclusive evidence that these chips can completely replace traditional training methods across all AI applications. The transition from current AI development processes to neuromorphic-based systems remains untested at scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful implementation of neuromorphic chips for training diverse AI models across multiple application domains, with comparative energy consumption data showing complete elimination of traditional training energy costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can systematic AGI approach ensure alignment with human morality given the system-dependent and context-specific nature of moral decision-making?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that morality is system-dependent, involves complex interactions among multiple subsystems, and requires specialized functions like empathy and theory-of-mind. It suggests that true alignment may require human-like AGI capabilities and full system support for morality.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the complexity of moral decision-making and its system dependence, but doesn't provide a concrete methodology for how systematic AGI can guarantee alignment across diverse moral scenarios and cultural contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of systematic AGI systems that demonstrate consistent moral alignment across diverse scenarios, including moral dilemmas with varying cultural contexts, and empirical evidence of how the system architecture supports moral decision-making.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific architectural requirements for systematic AGI to capture the complexity needed for artificial general intelligence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper argues that system design is critical for AGI and proposes using end-to-end system design principles from building-block level to high-level system architecture. However, it doesn't provide detailed architectural specifications.
- Why unresolved: While the paper emphasizes the importance of system design for AGI, it deliberately avoids providing detailed architecture or process flow, instead focusing on the need for systematic approach and principles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of systematic AGI systems with documented architectural specifications, including modular design, hierarchical organization, specialized functional regions, and connectivity patterns, along with performance metrics demonstrating their effectiveness in achieving AGI capabilities.

**Validation Check 1:** Implement a scaled-down prototype of the proposed moral architecture using existing neuromorphic hardware (e.g., Intel Loihi-2) and test its decision-making against established moral dilemma scenarios. Measure both alignment accuracy and energy consumption compared to conventional AI approaches.

**Validation Check 2:** Conduct a systematic comparison of hierarchical modular network organization versus alternative AGI architectures (such as transformer-based or hybrid approaches) on standardized cognitive task benchmarks to evaluate efficiency and performance claims.

**Validation Check 3:** Develop a formal methodology for transitioning from narrow AI capabilities to AGI through system design, including specific training curricula, evaluation metrics, and safety protocols. Validate this methodology through controlled experiments with progressively complex cognitive tasks.
