# Towards interpretable-by-design deep learning algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11396
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11396
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: IDEAL framework achieves competitive accuracy without fine-tuning by using prototype-based decision making in pre-trained latent spaces, demonstrating interpretability and resistance to overfitting on target spaces.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the IDEAL framework that transforms deep learning models into interpretable systems by recasting classification as similarity-based decision making using prototypes derived from pre-trained latent spaces. The framework operates in two stages: feature extraction using large pre-trained foundation models and prototype-based decision making via clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that IDEAL achieves competitive performance without fine-tuning, even surpassing fine-tuned models on confounded data. The method provides interpretable results through real image prototypes and effectively handles class-incremental learning without catastrophic forgetting.

## Method Summary
The IDEAL framework transforms deep learning models into interpretable ones by recasting classification as a similarity function to prototypes derived from training data in the latent space of large neural networks. The method consists of two stages: feature extraction using pre-trained foundation models and prototype-based decision making. Experiments demonstrate that the framework achieves competitive performance without fine-tuning, even surpassing fine-tuned models on confounded data. On CIFAR-10, ViT achieves 95.59% accuracy without fine-tuning versus 98.51% with fine-tuning. For class-incremental learning, the framework reaches 83.2% accuracy on CIFAR-100 without fine-tuning, exceeding state-of-the-art methods. The framework provides interpretable results through prototypes and resists overfitting on target spaces, making it suitable for transfer learning and lifelong learning scenarios.

## Key Results
- IDEAL achieves 95.59% accuracy on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning, compared to 98.51% with fine-tuning
- On confounded CUB data, non-fine-tuned models outperform fine-tuned counterparts with higher F1 scores
- For class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100, IDEAL reaches 83.2% accuracy without fine-tuning, exceeding state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using large pre-trained latent spaces without fine-tuning preserves generalization and reduces overfitting.
- Mechanism: The latent space learned from large generic datasets contains robust, generalizable features. Clustering in this space creates prototypes that are stable across related tasks.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained latent space is sufficiently discriminative and generalizable for new tasks without task-specific adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "improves the performance on confounded data over finetuned counterparts"
  - [section] "the evidence shows that the finetuned feature space shows less generalisation"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct neighbor papers discuss fine-tuning vs non-fine-tuning generalization trade-offs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prototype-based decision making in latent space provides interpretability while maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: Instead of opaque end-to-end classification, the model compares query features to learned prototypes and selects based on similarity, making the reasoning traceable.
- Core assumption: Euclidean distance (or similar metric) in the latent space meaningfully captures semantic similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the proposed models are interpretable through prototypes, mitigating the issue of confounded interpretations"
  - [section] "one can attribute the decision to a number of real image prototypes ranked by their similarity to the query image"
  - [corpus] Weak: Neighbors discuss prototype methods but not explicitly latent-space similarity interpretability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Online clustering enables efficient class-incremental learning without catastrophic forgetting.
- Mechanism: Prototypes are incrementally updated using clustering methods (e.g., ELM), allowing the model to add new classes without retraining from scratch.
- Core assumption: Incremental prototype updates can integrate new information without disrupting existing class boundaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the proposed IDEAL framework circumvents the issue of catastrophic forgetting allowing efficient class-incremental learning"
  - [section] "catastrophic forgetting through incremental update of the prototypes"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct neighbor discussion of incremental clustering without forgetting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent space embeddings from large vision transformers
  - Why needed here: The quality of the latent space determines both performance and interpretability of prototype-based decisions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why ViT embeddings outperform ResNet embeddings in this framework?

- Concept: Clustering for prototype selection
  - Why needed here: Prototypes must represent class distributions without requiring labeled data for each prototype.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between using k-means centroids vs nearest real data points as prototypes?

- Concept: Incremental learning without catastrophic forgetting
  - Why needed here: The framework must support lifelong learning by adding classes over time without losing prior knowledge.
  - Quick check question: How does ELM online clustering help prevent catastrophic forgetting compared to batch clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained backbone (ViT/ResNet/VGG) → Feature extractor → Clustering module (k-means/ELM/xDNN) → Prototype selector → Similarity function (ℓ2 distance) → Decision layer → Winner-takes-all or k-NN classifier → Final prediction

- Critical path:
  Feature extraction → Prototype selection → Similarity computation → Class assignment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More prototypes → Higher accuracy, slower inference, less interpretable
  - Finetuning → Higher accuracy on target task, less generalizable, computationally expensive
  - Online clustering → Supports incremental learning, may sacrifice some accuracy vs batch

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy → Poor latent space quality or insufficient prototypes
  - Misclassification without interpretable patterns → Prototype similarity metric mismatch
  - Slow incremental updates → Clustering method inefficiency or large feature dimensionality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare accuracy of IDEAL without fine-tuning on CIFAR-10 using ViT vs ResNet backbones.
  2. Visualize t-SNE of original vs fine-tuned feature spaces to detect overfitting.
  3. Measure class-incremental learning performance on CIFAR-100 with incremental class addition.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the discussion section implies several important directions for future research.

## Limitations
- The generalizability claims rely heavily on comparative evidence rather than theoretical guarantees
- Prototype-based interpretability assumes semantic meaning in latent space distances, which may not hold across all domains
- Incremental learning validation is limited to CIFAR-100 and lacks testing on more complex, real-world datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence in the framework's ability to provide interpretable results through prototype-based decisions
- Medium confidence in the generalization benefits of non-fine-tuned approaches, given the comparative evidence
- Medium confidence in catastrophic forgetting mitigation, pending broader dataset validation

## Next Checks
1. Test IDEAL on domain-shifted datasets (e.g., DomainNet) to evaluate latent space generalizability beyond natural images
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of prototypes to quantify the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff
3. Compare prototype-based explanations against post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) on the same models to validate interpretability claims
