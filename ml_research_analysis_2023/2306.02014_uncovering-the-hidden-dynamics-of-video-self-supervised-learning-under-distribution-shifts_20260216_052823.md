# Uncovering the Hidden Dynamics of Video Self-supervised Learning under Distribution Shifts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.02014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02014
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive analysis of six VSSL methods under various real-world distribution shifts

## Executive Summary
This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of how six video self-supervised learning (VSSL) methods behave under various real-world distribution shifts. The authors evaluate these methods across context, viewpoint, actor, source, and open-set shifts using a large-scale testbed. Key findings include v-MAE and supervised learning showing more robustness to context shifts due to stronger temporal learning, while contrastive methods excel at viewpoint invariance; v-MAE is robust to low-resolution inputs; finetuning generally improves performance but can cause in-distribution overfitting; and there is a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition performance when using frozen encoders.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates six VSSL methods (v-SimCLR, v-MOCO, v-BYOL, v-SimSiam, v-DINO, v-MAE) pretrained on Kinetics400/700 using ViT-B backbones. Methods are assessed across 17 benchmark pairs covering various distribution shifts through linear evaluation (frozen encoder + SVM/MLP), finetuning (end-to-end), unsupervised clustering, zero-shot recognition, and open-set recognition. Pretraining uses 800 epochs with batch size 768, followed by evaluation protocols including synthetic and natural distribution shifts.

## Key Results
- v-MAE and supervised learning show more robustness to context shifts due to stronger temporal learning
- Contrastive methods excel at viewpoint invariance through negative sampling
- v-MAE is robust to low-resolution inputs
- Finetuning generally improves performance but can cause in-distribution overfitting
- Trade-off exists between closed-set and open-set recognition performance with frozen encoders

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different VSSL methods learn different temporal dynamics that affect their robustness to context shifts.
- Mechanism: Contrastive and non-contrastive methods minimize temporal similarity to encourage time-invariant representations, while generative methods like v-MAE maximize reconstruction from masked inputs, learning time-variant features. This leads to v-MAE being more robust to context shifts because it can rely on temporal cues even when background context is missing or misleading.
- Core assumption: Temporal representations are more useful than spatial ones when contextual cues are absent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "v-MAE and supervised learning exhibit more robustness... v-MAE is a strong temporal learner"
  - [section 6, Q1] "v-MAE and v-Supervised show strong temporal learning capabilities as they learn time-variant representations as opposed to contrastive and non-contrastive methods which encourage learning time-invariant representations"
- Break condition: If background context is still informative for action recognition even in out-of-context videos, time-variant representations may not provide an advantage.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive methods exhibit stronger viewpoint invariance due to the presence of negative samples during pretraining.
- Mechanism: By comparing positive pairs to negative samples, contrastive methods like v-SimCLR and v-MOCO learn to map the same object or action from different viewpoints to similar embeddings, effectively building viewpoint-invariant representations. This is confirmed by their superior performance under viewpoint shifts compared to non-contrastive and generative methods.
- Core assumption: Viewpoint variance is a key challenge in video recognition and can be mitigated by explicit negative sampling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "contrastive methods, v-SimCLR and v-MOCO, exhibit strong performances against viewpoint shifts"
  - [section 6, Q1] "contrastive methods (v-SimCLR, v-MOCO) are robust to viewpoint shifts as they consistently achieve better performance in all three setups"
- Break condition: If the dataset contains very few viewpoint variations or if the encoder architecture already provides strong viewpoint invariance, negative samples may not be necessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: There is a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition performance when using frozen pretrained encoders.
- Mechanism: Strong frozen encoders (v-MOCO, v-SimCLR) overfit to known classes and become overconfident, leading to poor open-set performance. Weaker frozen encoders (v-DINO, v-SimSiam) retain more uncertainty, enabling better open-set recognition. This trade-off is not present when finetuning is applied.
- Core assumption: Open-set performance depends on the uncertainty calibration of the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When studying the notion of open-set recognition, we notice a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition performance if the pretrained VSSL encoders are used without finetuning"
  - [section 6, Q3] "v-MOCO reports 84.9% whereas v-DINO achieves 80.9% in standard closed-set recognition. The results presented in Figure 5 (d) suggest that there is a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition performance, particularly when frozen encoders are used without finetuning"
- Break condition: If a method can maintain strong closed-set performance while preserving calibrated uncertainty, the trade-off may be eliminated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distribution shift and its types (input-based vs. output-based)
  - Why needed here: The paper studies how VSSL methods behave under various distribution shifts (context, viewpoint, actor, source, zero-shot, open-set). Understanding the distinction between input-based (changes in px|y) and output-based (changes in py) shifts is critical to interpreting the results and designing appropriate evaluation protocols.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between an input-based shift (e.g., different viewpoints) and an output-based shift (e.g., unknown classes at test time)?

- Concept: Contrastive learning and InfoNCE loss
  - Why needed here: The paper compares six VSSL methods, including contrastive methods like v-SimCLR and v-MOCO. Understanding how contrastive learning works (maximizing similarity of positive pairs while minimizing similarity of negative pairs using InfoNCE) is essential to interpreting why these methods excel at viewpoint invariance and open-set recognition.
  - Quick check question: How does the InfoNCE loss in contrastive learning encourage viewpoint invariance?

- Concept: Generative modeling and masked autoencoders
  - Why needed here: v-MAE is a generative VSSL method that learns by reconstructing heavily masked inputs. Understanding how masked autoencoders work (encoding masked tokens and reconstructing them via a decoder) is crucial to interpreting why v-MAE is robust to low-resolution inputs and context shifts.
  - Quick check question: Why does training with heavily masked inputs make v-MAE more robust to low-resolution inputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ViT-Base encoder (patch size 4x16x16) -> Projector head (MLP) for contrastive/non-contrastive methods -> Predictor head (MLP) for v-BYOL, v-SimSiam, v-MOCO -> Target encoder (EMA-updated) for v-MOCO, v-BYOL, v-DINO -> Decoder (4 layers) for v-MAE
- Critical path: Pretraining (800 epochs, batch size 768) -> Linear evaluation (frozen encoder + SVM/MLP) or finetuning (end-to-end) -> OoD evaluation on 17 dataset pairs
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-view (v-MAE) vs. Siamese (others): Single-view allows generative learning but sacrifices viewpoint invariance; Siamese enables contrastive learning but requires careful augmentation
  - Aggressive cropping: Improves viewpoint invariance for contrastive methods but hurts v-MAE reconstruction quality
  - Linear vs. finetuning: Linear is faster and avoids overfitting but finetuning generally improves both InD and OoD performance
- Failure signatures:
  - v-MAE poor on viewpoint shifts due to lack of Siamese architecture
  - Contrastive methods poor on context shifts due to time-invariant bias
  - All methods degrade on extreme synthetic perturbations (especially v-MAE on rotations/translations)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Linear evaluation on Mimetics10 (OoD context shift) to compare v-MAE vs. contrastive methods
  2. Viewpoint invariance test on COIL100 using frozen encoders to measure similarity of same object from different angles
  3. Low-resolution robustness test on STL10 with systematically reduced input resolution (112→16)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the precise mechanisms by which finetuning leads to in-distribution overfitting in VSSL models, and how can this be systematically mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses finetuning generally improving InD performance but sometimes leading to poor OoD generalization, particularly under source shifts and temporal perturbations.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the phenomenon but doesn't delve into the underlying mechanisms or propose comprehensive mitigation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of representation drift during finetuning, identification of specific model components most affected, and empirical evaluation of regularization techniques or alternative finetuning strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different architectural choices (e.g., ViT vs. CNN backbones, varying model sizes) influence the robustness of VSSL methods under distribution shifts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses ViT-Base for all methods but notes resource constraints prevented exploring larger architectures or convolutional alternatives, suggesting potential for further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to one architecture family and size, leaving open questions about generalizability of findings to other architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of VSSL methods across multiple architecture types and scales under identical distribution shift scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal strategies for balancing closed-set and open-set recognition performance when using pretrained VSSL encoders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition when using frozen encoders, with contrastive methods performing well in open-set when finetuned but struggling when frozen.
- Why unresolved: While the trade-off is observed, the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for optimizing this balance or determining when to use frozen vs. finetuned encoders.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of hybrid approaches that dynamically adjust between frozen and finetuned modes based on task requirements and uncertainty estimation.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do different types of natural distribution shifts (context, viewpoint, actor, source) interact when occurring simultaneously, and what are the combined effects on VSSL performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates multiple simultaneous shifts (e.g., top-down synthetic videos combining viewpoint and actor shifts) but doesn't systematically analyze interaction effects.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies individual shift impacts but doesn't explore how shifts compound or potentially mitigate each other when occurring together.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments systematically varying combinations of shift types and measuring their joint effects on different VSSL methods.

## Limitations

- Reliance on synthetic and curated distribution shifts rather than fully naturalistic test conditions
- Correlation-based rather than causal analysis of mechanism-specific robustness
- Assumes perfect calibration for open-set recognition trade-off analysis

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Viewpoint invariance findings for contrastive methods, low-resolution robustness of v-MAE, general finetuning benefits
- Medium Confidence: Context shift robustness mechanisms, open-set vs closed-set trade-off under frozen encoders
- Low Confidence: Generalization of temporal learning claims across diverse video domains, effectiveness of aggressive cropping augmentation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing temporal information from v-MAE to quantify the contribution of time-variant representations to context shift robustness
2. Test the open-set/closed-set trade-off on a larger variety of semantic classes with varying degrees of similarity to pretraining data
3. Evaluate performance under naturalistic, unscripted distribution shifts in real-world video streams to validate controlled benchmark findings
