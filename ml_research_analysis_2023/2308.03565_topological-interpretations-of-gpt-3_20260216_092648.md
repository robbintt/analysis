# Topological Interpretations of GPT-3

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03565
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03565
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Topological methods reveal high correlations between sentence embeddings from GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT, suggesting shared semantic structure across models.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores topological interpretations of sentence embeddings from GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT by computing pairwise distances and correlations in high-dimensional spaces. Using Levenshtein distance for plain text, bottleneck distance for GPT-3 and Word2Vec embeddings, and cosine distance for Sentence-BERT, the authors map these distances into matrices. They employ MDS, CCA, and scaled Hausdorff distances to analyze correlations across and within embedding spaces. Key findings include high correlations between GPT-3 bottleneck distances and plain text Levenshtein distances, as well as between GPT-3 and Word2Vec embeddings. The study provides insights into semantic similarities across different embedding methods.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes semantic similarities across GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT embeddings by first converting sentences into high-dimensional vectors. Pairwise distances are computed using Levenshtein distance for plain text, bottleneck distance for GPT-3 and Word2Vec persistence diagrams, and cosine distance for Sentence-BERT. These distances are organized into 100x100 matrices. MDS visualizes within-space similarity, while CCA and scaled Hausdorff distances quantify cross-space correlations. The analysis reveals structural similarities between embedding methods, suggesting shared semantic encoding despite architectural differences.

## Key Results
- High correlation between GPT-3 bottleneck distances and plain text Levenshtein distances.
- Strong correlation between GPT-3 and Word2Vec embedding structures.
- MDS visualizations show cluster structures aligning with semantic similarity within each embedding space.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: High-dimensional embeddings capture semantic similarity through topological persistence diagrams.
- Mechanism: By embedding sentences into high-dimensional spaces (e.g., GPT-3 at 768D, Word2Vec at 128D), the method constructs persistence diagrams via Rips filtrations. The bottleneck distance between these diagrams reflects structural similarity, which correlates with semantic similarity.
- Core assumption: Topological features (connected components, loops) in embedding space correspond to meaningful semantic groupings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We first used three state-of-the-art word/sentence embedding methods including GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT, to embed plain text sentence strings into high dimensional spaces."
  - [section 5.1.2] "Then we compute a Rips persistence diagram for each reduced sentence matrix... Lastly, we compute pairwise bottleneck distance for any possible combination of two Rips persistence diagrams."
  - [corpus] Weak—no direct evidence of topological feature-to-semantic mapping validation.
- Break condition: If bottleneck distances do not correlate with human-annotated semantic similarity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Correlation across embedding spaces reveals shared semantic structure.
- Mechanism: Distance matrices from different embeddings (Levenshtein, bottleneck, cosine) are correlated using CCA and scaled Hausdorff distance. High correlation indicates that different embeddings preserve similar semantic relationships.
- Core assumption: Different embedding methods, despite architectural differences, encode overlapping semantic dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We observed correlations of the same sentence in different embedding spaces and correlations of different sentences in the same embedding space."
  - [section 5.2] "we compute the CCA and the scaled Hausdorff distances between any possible pair of distance matrices."
  - [corpus] Moderate—related work shows inter-embedding correlations but limited direct validation.
- Break condition: If CCA scores are low or scaled Hausdorff distances are large, indicating dissimilar structures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MDS visualizations reveal cluster structure aligning with semantic similarity.
- Mechanism: Multidimensional scaling reduces high-dimensional distance matrices to 2D for visual inspection. Similar coordinates indicate sentences with similar semantic roles.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity is preserved under MDS projection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3.1] "MDS is used to visualize similarity/information of pairwise distances among a set of100 embedded sentence vectors into a configuration of100 points mapped into an abstract Cartesian space."
  - [section 5.2] "From the six distance matrices in Figure 3, we observe that there are some correlations among sentence clouds in different embedding spaces."
  - [corpus] Weak—no quantitative validation of MDS cluster alignment with ground truth.
- Break condition: If MDS plots show no discernible clusters or cluster membership does not match semantic categories.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Levenshtein distance as a baseline semantic metric.
  - Why needed here: Provides a non-embedding baseline to compare embedding-based distances against plain text similarity.
  - Quick check question: Does Levenshtein distance increase monotonically with sentence length difference?
- Concept: Bottleneck distance for persistence diagrams.
  - Why needed here: Measures similarity between topological summaries, enabling comparison of embedding structure.
  - Quick check question: Is bottleneck distance symmetric and satisfies triangle inequality?
- Concept: Canonical Correlation Analysis for cross-modal correlation.
  - Why needed here: Quantifies shared variance between distance matrices from different embeddings.
  - Quick check question: Does CCA maximize correlation between linear combinations of the two input matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion → Sentence tokenization → Embedding (GPT-3/Word2Vec/Sentence-BERT) → Distance computation (Levenshtein/bottleneck/cosine) → Distance matrix → Correlation analysis (MDS/CCA/SHD) → Visualization.
- Critical path: Embedding → Distance matrix construction → Correlation analysis. Bottlenecks here affect all downstream insights.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding choice: GPT-3 (high compute, rich semantics) vs. Word2Vec (fast, contextual) vs. Sentence-BERT (balanced).
  - Distance metric: Levenshtein (exact but sparse), bottleneck (topological but costly), cosine (efficient but ignores structure).
  - Dimensionality reduction: PCA (lossy but scalable) vs. direct high-D comparison (accurate but expensive).
- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in distance matrices across embeddings → weak semantic consistency.
  - Poor CCA scores (<0.3) → embeddings capture different semantics.
  - MDS plots with no clear clusters → semantic structure not preserved.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute Levenshtein and cosine distances for same sentence pairs; check correlation.
  2. Embed a small subset with GPT-3 and Word2Vec; compare bottleneck distance distributions.
  3. Run MDS on one distance matrix; verify cluster separation matches known sentence categories.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do topological features of sentence embeddings correlate with semantic meaning across different embedding methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly explores correlations between sentence embeddings from GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT, using topological methods like bottleneck distance and canonical correlation analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies correlations, it does not establish a direct causal link between topological features and semantic meaning, leaving open questions about the interpretability of these correlations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating consistent semantic similarities across different embedding methods when topological features are preserved or altered would provide clarity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the topological interpretation of sentence embeddings improve model error discovery and repair in natural language processing tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests future directions in model interpretation, including error discovery and repair, but does not provide empirical evidence or methodologies for achieving this.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines potential applications but lacks detailed methodologies or case studies to validate the effectiveness of topological interpretations in practical error correction scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing improved error detection and correction rates using topological methods in NLP models would substantiate this application.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different distance computation methods (e.g., Levenshtein, bottleneck, cosine) affect the interpretation of semantic similarities in sentence embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses multiple distance computation methods to analyze sentence embeddings, noting differences in results and correlations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not fully explore the impact of each distance method on the interpretability of semantic similarities, nor does it compare their effectiveness comprehensively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing the impact of each distance method on semantic interpretation accuracy would clarify their relative effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Limited corpus size and diversity may affect generalizability of findings.
- Topological feature-to-semantic mapping lacks direct human-annotated validation.
- Parameter sensitivity of embedding and distance computation methods not explored.

## Confidence
- Semantic Consistency Across Embeddings: High
- Topological Interpretation Validity: Medium
- MDS Visualization Reliability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Compute correlation between bottleneck distances and human-annotated semantic similarity scores for a subset of sentence pairs.
2. Systematically vary embedding parameters (e.g., Word2Vec window size, Sentence-BERT pooling strategy) and distance computation settings; assess stability of CCA scores and MDS cluster structures.
3. Apply full analysis pipeline to a larger, more diverse corpus (e.g., Multi-Genre NLI, STS Benchmark); compare correlation patterns and MDS visualizations.
