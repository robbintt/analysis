## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Introduction -> Taxonomy -> Traditional Architectures -> Modern Architectures -> Challenges and Open Problems -> Related Tasks -> Conclusion

- Critical path: Understanding the evolution of VQA architectures, identifying the key challenges and open problems, and recognizing the relationships between VQA and related vision-language tasks.

- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the depth and breadth of coverage, ensuring that both traditional and modern VQA approaches are adequately represented, and providing a clear and consistent taxonomy throughout the survey.

- Failure signatures: Inadequate coverage of either traditional or modern VQA architectures, inconsistent or incomplete taxonomy, lack of discussion on challenges and open problems, or failure to connect VQA to related vision-language tasks.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple CNN-RNN-based VQA model using a pre-trained CNN backbone and an LSTM for question encoding.
  2. Experiment with different feature fusion strategies (e.g., element-wise addition, concatenation) and evaluate their impact on model performance.
  3. Fine-tune a pre-trained VLP model (e.g., CLIP or ALBEF) on a VQA dataset and compare its performance to a traditional VQA architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can VQA models be made more robust to domain shifts and out-of-distribution data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses generalization, robustness, and consistency as key challenges in model evaluation, highlighting the need for VQA models to perform well on data beyond the training distribution.
- Why unresolved: Current VQA models often struggle when faced with data from different domains or distributions, as seen in the challenges of VizWiz dataset with real-world images. While zero-shot learning and VLP techniques show promise, there's a lack of standardized frameworks to evaluate and improve model robustness across diverse domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing VQA model performance across multiple domains, with standardized metrics for robustness and generalization. Development of domain adaptation techniques specifically for VQA, along with benchmarks that rigorously test model performance on out-of-distribution data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective ways to reduce bias in VQA datasets and models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper extensively discusses various forms of bias in VQA datasets, including linguistic bias, gender and racial bias, and dataset imbalance. It highlights the need for bias mitigation strategies to develop fair and unbiased VQA systems.
- Why unresolved: While techniques like redistributing datasets and using counterexamples have shown some success, bias in VQA remains a significant challenge. The complex interplay between visual and textual modalities makes it difficult to identify and address all forms of bias effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different bias mitigation techniques, including their effectiveness in reducing various types of bias. Development of bias-aware VQA architectures and evaluation metrics that can quantify and monitor bias in model predictions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can VQA be effectively extended to handle multimodal inputs beyond images and text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for VQA to incorporate other modalities like audio and video, introducing the concept of multimodal question answering (MQA). It highlights the challenges of processing and fusing information from multiple modalities.
- Why unresolved: While there's growing interest in multimodal VQA, there's a lack of standardized datasets and architectures for handling complex multimodal inputs. The fusion of different modalities presents unique challenges in terms of representation, alignment, and reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of comprehensive multimodal VQA datasets covering various combinations of modalities. Creation of architectures that can effectively process and fuse information from multiple modalities, along with evaluation frameworks that assess performance across different multimodal tasks.

## Limitations
- Limited evidence from the corpus to support key claims about the survey's mechanisms and effectiveness
- Confidence in the specific technical details of the taxonomy and challenge identification is low
- Unable to verify the survey's effectiveness as a navigation tool without access to the full content

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The survey covers VQA as a multimodal task combining vision and language, and includes traditional CNN-RNN and modern VLP approaches.
- **Medium Confidence**: The survey provides a taxonomy of VQA problems, datasets, and methods, and discusses challenges and open problems.

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Coverage Verification**: Examine sections dedicated to CNN-RNN-based and VLP-based VQA models to assess whether the survey adequately covers both eras and explains the transition between them with sufficient technical depth.
2. **Taxonomy Validation**: Review the detailed taxonomy section to verify if VQA problems are systematically categorized by task type, modality, and answer generation procedure, and whether datasets and methods are organized in a coherent, navigable structure.
3. **Challenge Assessment**: Analyze the challenges and open problems section to determine if it identifies key issues like dataset bias, reasoning limitations, and evaluation metrics, and whether it provides actionable guidance for researchers to address these challenges.
