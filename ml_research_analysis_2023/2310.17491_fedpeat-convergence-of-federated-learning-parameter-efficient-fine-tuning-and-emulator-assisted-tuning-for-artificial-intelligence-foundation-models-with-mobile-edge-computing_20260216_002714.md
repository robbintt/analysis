# FedPEAT: Convergence of Federated Learning, Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning, and Emulator Assisted Tuning for Artificial Intelligence Foundation Models with Mobile Edge Computing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17491
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Combines federated learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and emulator-assisted tuning for efficient deployment of large foundation models on mobile edge devices

## Executive Summary
FedPEAT introduces a novel framework that addresses the computational and memory constraints of fine-tuning large foundation models on edge devices. By leveraging emulator compression and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, the approach enables collaborative model improvement without transferring full model weights. The framework incorporates a deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive control mechanism to optimize hyperparameters like emulator compression and device selection, achieving superior performance compared to traditional federated fine-tuning approaches.

## Method Summary
FedPEAT combines emulator compression with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to enable model fine-tuning without transferring full model weights to edge devices. The approach uses emulators to provide a compressed representation of the original foundation model, allowing edge devices to fine-tune using adapters instead of the full model. A deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive control mechanism dynamically optimizes hyperparameters including emulator compression parameters, device participation, and aggregation strategies. The framework operates in a federated learning environment where devices upload only adapter parameters to the server for aggregation.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior performance compared to traditional federated fine-tuning approaches
- Improves memory efficiency and reduces transmission delays while maintaining model accuracy
- Maintains privacy and computational efficiency through emulator-based compression
- Demonstrates effective hyperparameter optimization through deep reinforcement learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining emulator compression with parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables model fine-tuning without transferring full model weights to edge devices
- Mechanism: Emulators provide a compressed, fixed-parameter representation of the original foundation model, allowing edge devices to fine-tune using adapters instead of the full model
- Core assumption: Emulators can accurately approximate the behavior of the original model while being significantly smaller in size
- Evidence anchors: Limited direct evidence; requires empirical validation that emulators maintain sufficient accuracy after compression

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Federated learning with adapters enables collaborative model improvement while preserving data privacy
- Mechanism: Edge devices perform local fine-tuning using their data and adapters, then upload only adapter parameters to the server for aggregation
- Core assumption: Aggregating adapter parameters from multiple devices leads to improved global model performance
- Evidence anchors: Standard federated learning literature supports this aggregation approach

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive control optimizes hyperparameters for efficient federated tuning
- Mechanism: An RL agent dynamically selects emulator compression parameters, device participation, and other hyperparameters to minimize perplexity, transmission delay, and memory usage
- Core assumption: RL can effectively navigate the complex, sequential decision space of federated tuning optimization
- Evidence anchors: RL has been successfully applied to similar optimization problems in edge computing

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Foundation models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these models is crucial as FedPEAT aims to efficiently fine-tune them on edge devices
  - Quick check question: What are the typical parameter counts for modern foundation models like GPT-3 and BERT?

- Concept: Federated learning
  - Why needed here: FedPEAT extends PEAT into the federated learning domain, so understanding FL principles is essential
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning differ from traditional centralized training in terms of data privacy and communication patterns?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (e.g., LoRA, adapters)
  - Why needed here: PEFT techniques are combined with emulators in the PEAT approach, forming the basis of FedPEAT
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using adapters over full fine-tuning in terms of computational efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Server: Foundation model, emulator creation, adapter aggregation
  - Edge devices: Local data, emulators, adapters, PEFT
  - RL orchestrator: Hyperparameter optimization
  - Communication channels: Emulator distribution, adapter uploads

- Critical path:
  1. Server creates and distributes emulators to selected devices
  2. Devices perform local fine-tuning using PEFT on adapters
  3. Devices upload adapter parameters to server
  4. Server aggregates adapter parameters
  5. RL orchestrator updates hyperparameters based on performance metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Emulator compression vs. model accuracy
  - Number of participating devices vs. communication overhead
  - Frequency of emulator updates vs. transmission costs
  - RL training time vs. immediate performance gains

- Failure signatures:
  - High perplexity scores indicating poor model performance
  - Excessive memory usage on edge devices
  - Long transmission delays causing slow convergence
  - RL agent failing to improve metrics over time

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Full model fine-tuning on a single device to establish performance upper bound
  2. FedPEAT without adaptive control: Validate that the basic approach works before adding RL optimization
  3. FedPEAT with adaptive control: Test the full system with RL-driven hyperparameter optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does FedPEAT's performance compare to traditional federated learning approaches across different foundation model architectures?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates FedPEAT's effectiveness with GPT-2 XL but does not explore performance across different model architectures or domains
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single model architecture for demonstration purposes
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing FedPEAT against traditional federated learning across multiple foundation model types

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between emulator compression ratio and model performance degradation across different federated learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions emulator compression but doesn't provide detailed analysis of the performance-compression trade-off
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that emulators can be compressed but doesn't quantify the precise relationship between compression levels and performance impact
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive ablation studies showing performance degradation curves across different compression ratios

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does FedPEAT's adaptive control mechanism perform under non-stationary conditions where device capabilities and channel conditions change dynamically?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates adaptive control in a static geographic space but doesn't address dynamic, non-stationary environments
- Why unresolved: The experimental setup uses fixed conditions, and the paper doesn't explore performance under varying environmental conditions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing FedPEAT under dynamic conditions where device capabilities change over time

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of emulator compression accuracy tradeoff
- Performance gains from deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive control not fully quantified
- Scalability to truly large models (beyond GPT-2 XL) remains unverified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The combination of federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like adapters
