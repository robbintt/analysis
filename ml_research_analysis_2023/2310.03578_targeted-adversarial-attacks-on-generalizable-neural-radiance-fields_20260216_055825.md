# Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03578
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03578
- Authors: [Not specified in source]
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Successful targeted adversarial attacks on IBRNet GeNeRFs using low-intensity perturbations and adversarial patches

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates targeted adversarial attacks on generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs), specifically targeting the IBRNet model. The authors demonstrate that both low-intensity perturbations and adversarial patches can successfully modify rendered images to include or remove objects. Their results show that attack effectiveness strongly depends on the number of compromised source images, with majority consensus required for successful manipulation of the final rendered output.

## Method Summary
The authors employ two attack strategies: iterative FGSM with momentum for low-intensity perturbations and patch-based attacks with varying patch sizes. Both methods optimize source images to minimize the difference between rendered output and manually created adversarial ground truth images containing desired modifications. The attacks are evaluated on the IBRNet model using subsets of source images (2-10 views) and different patch sizes (2×2 to 20×20).

## Key Results
- Attacks require majority consensus from source images to be effective, with ℓ2 distances below 0.015 when 8-10 views are attacked versus above 0.020 when fewer are compromised
- Patch-based attacks need sufficiently large patches (typically 10×10) to significantly impact rendered scenes
- Local modifications in source images can affect distant regions in the rendered output through the GeNeRF pipeline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial attacks on GeNeRFs succeed when a majority of source images are compromised
- Mechanism: Modifying input pixels in multiple source images propagates through the differentiable rendering pipeline, causing the synthesized output to deviate from the original scene
- Core assumption: The GeNeRF model relies on features extracted from multiple source views, and changes in enough of these views will alter the final rendered image
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our results indicate that attacks are most effective when applied to a majority of source images"
  - [section]: "These results clearly indicate that attacks were successful in most cases when a significant majority of the source views were targeted"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citations to similar attack methodologies in corpus

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Patch-based attacks can modify distant regions of the rendered scene even when applied to local areas in source images
- Mechanism: The patch modifications in source images influence the ray transformer and density prediction stages of the GeNeRF pipeline, allowing localized changes to affect global scene properties
- Core assumption: The neural network's learned representations connect local image features to global scene structure in a way that permits non-local effects from local perturbations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "patch-based attacks requiring sufficiently large patches (typically 10x10) to have a significant impact"
  - [section]: "These attacks are not restricted to local neighborhoods, as even distant regions can be manipulated with such modifications"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers but none specifically address patch-based attacks on NeRFs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Targeted attacks can successfully insert, delete, or modify objects in rendered scenes while maintaining visual realism
- Mechanism: By defining a specific adversarial ground truth image with desired modifications and optimizing source images to minimize the difference, the attack achieves precise control over rendered content
- Core assumption: The differentiable nature of the GeNeRF pipeline allows gradient-based optimization to find source image modifications that produce the desired output changes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "showing that these attacks can modify rendered images to include or remove objects"
  - [section]: "We manually placed a hallucinated object on the rendered image. The resulting image serves as the adversarial ground truth image"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no corpus citations address targeted attacks on NeRFs specifically

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differentiable rendering pipeline
  - Why needed here: Understanding how gradients flow from rendered output back to source images is crucial for implementing adversarial attacks
  - Quick check question: What are the key differentiable components in a GeNeRF pipeline that enable backpropagation of adversarial gradients?

- Concept: Multi-view feature aggregation
  - Why needed here: GeNeRFs combine features from multiple source views, so understanding this aggregation is essential for knowing which views to attack
  - Quick check question: How does the number of source views affect the quality and vulnerability of GeNeRF rendering?

- Concept: Adversarial optimization techniques
  - Why needed here: Both low-intensity and patch-based attacks require optimization strategies to find effective perturbations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks, and why is this distinction important for GeNeRFs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source images → CNN encoder → Feature aggregation → Ray transformer → Density/color prediction → Volume rendering → Final image
- Critical path: Source images feed into the CNN encoder for feature extraction, features are aggregated across views, processed by the ray transformer for density prediction, and rendered through volume rendering to produce the final image. The attack optimization targets source images through gradient backpropagation.
- Design tradeoffs: Using more source views improves rendering quality but increases attack surface area. Patch-based attacks offer practical real-world applicability but may have limited effect compared to global perturbations.
- Failure signatures: Attack failure manifests as high ℓ2 distance between rendered output and ground truth, indicating the network is resistant to the perturbations. Low PSNR and SSIM values also indicate attack failure.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic untargeted attack on a single source view to verify the differentiable pipeline works
  2. Test low-intensity attack effectiveness with varying numbers of attacked source views (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
  3. Experiment with patch-based attacks of different sizes (2x2, 5x5, 10x10, 20x20) on a single source view

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How does the effectiveness of adversarial attacks on GeNeRFs vary when the hallucinated object's size and complexity are increased?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates successful attacks with manually placed hallucinated objects, but does not investigate the impact of object size or complexity on attack effectiveness
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of targeted attacks rather than systematically exploring the relationship between object characteristics and attack success
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying the size and complexity of hallucinated objects while measuring attack success rates and image quality metrics

- **Question**: What is the minimum number of source images required for a successful targeted attack on GeNeRFs when using adversarial patches?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that attacks are generally successful if at least four out of ten source images contain a sufficiently large patch (10×10)
  - Why unresolved: The study only tested with ten source images and did not explore scenarios with fewer source images to determine the absolute minimum required
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing with varying numbers of source images (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5) while maintaining attack parameters to identify the threshold for successful attacks

- **Question**: How do adversarial attacks on GeNeRFs affect the generated depth maps, and can attackers manipulate depth information to create safety-critical scenarios?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "the generated depth map were not investigated in the current work" and focuses solely on rendered images
  - Why unresolved: The study deliberately excluded depth map analysis, leaving a critical gap in understanding the full impact of adversarial attacks on GeNeRFs
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting targeted attacks while simultaneously analyzing both rendered images and generated depth maps to quantify the relationship between image manipulation and depth distortion

## Limitations

- Attack effectiveness heavily depends on compromising a majority of source images, becoming ineffective with minority attacks
- Patch-based attacks show inconsistent performance, with small patches having minimal impact despite optimization
- Evaluation is limited to the IBRNet model specifically, with transferability to other GeNeRF variants untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The observation that attacks require a majority of source images to be effective is well-supported by quantitative results showing clear performance degradation when attacking fewer views
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about patch size requirements (10×10 minimum) is supported by data but lacks rigorous ablation studies across different scene types
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that distant regions can be manipulated through local patch modifications lacks sufficient explanation of the underlying mechanism

## Next Checks

1. **Transferability test**: Evaluate the same attack methodology on alternative GeNeRF architectures (such as NeRF-- or KiloNeRF) to determine if the attack mechanisms generalize beyond IBRNet

2. **Physical-world feasibility**: Implement the patch-based attacks using printable adversarial patches in a real-world setup with actual cameras to verify whether digital optimization translates to effective physical-world attacks

3. **Robustness countermeasures**: Test defensive strategies such as adversarial training, input sanitization, or architectural modifications to determine which approaches can effectively mitigate the identified vulnerabilities
