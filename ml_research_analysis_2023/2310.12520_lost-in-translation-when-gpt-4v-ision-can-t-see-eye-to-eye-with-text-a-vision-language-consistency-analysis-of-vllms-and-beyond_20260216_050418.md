# Lost in Translation: When GPT-4V(ision) Can't See Eye to Eye with Text. A Vision-Language-Consistency Analysis of VLLMs and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.12520
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12520
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Key outcome**: GPT-4V performs significantly better on text-based tasks than image-based tasks for complex reasoning problems, despite having equal information in both modalities.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes the consistency between vision and language modalities in multimodal systems like GPT-4V, introducing a novel evaluation framework that categorizes tasks as Translation Variant (TV) or Translation Invariant (TI). Experiments reveal that GPT-4V performs significantly better on text-based tasks than image-based tasks for complex reasoning problems, despite having equal information in both modalities. The authors propose a "Vision Description Prompting" method that improves performance by first extracting image descriptions into text before solving the task. This highlights the non-compound nature of current multimodal models, where language and vision modalities have different reasoning capabilities, and suggests the need for more integrated system designs.

## Method Summary
The study categorizes vision-language tasks into Translation Invariant (TI) and Translation Variant (TV) based on whether information integrity is maintained during modality translation. The researchers evaluate GPT-4V's performance on paired image-text tasks across six datasets, measuring pairwise consistency between modalities. They introduce Vision Description Prompting (VDP) as a method to improve vision-based task performance by first extracting textual descriptions from images. The framework provides a systematic approach to analyze cross-modal consistency and identify modality-specific weaknesses in VLLMs.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V shows modality-dependent performance differences, with text modality outperforming vision modality by over 40% on complex reasoning tasks
- Vision Description Prompting improves vision-based task accuracy by over 30% through leveraging stronger language reasoning capabilities
- Translation Variant tasks exhibit larger modality performance gaps than Translation Invariant tasks due to information loss during modality conversion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4V demonstrates superior reasoning performance in text modality compared to vision modality for complex tasks.
- Mechanism: The model maintains separate internal representations for vision and language modalities rather than integrating them into a unified compound representation, leading to modality-dependent performance differences.
- Core assumption: The model's architecture and training process result in distinct processing pathways for visual and textual inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our findings reveal that models like GPT-4V tend to perform consistently modalities when the tasks are relatively simple. However, the trustworthiness of results derived from the vision modality diminishes as the tasks become more challenging."
  - [section]: "Math Equation Solving, Math reasoning and State Machine Reasoning. However, as tasks become more challenging and involve higher levels of logical reasoning, such as solving mathematical equations and engaging in reasoning processes, we observe a substantial difference of over 40% in accuracy when comparing the performance of these tasks in image format and text formats."
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks when tasks require extensive visual information that cannot be adequately represented in text format, or when the model is retrained with explicit cross-modal integration objectives.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vision Description Prompting (VDP) improves vision-based task performance by leveraging the model's stronger language reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: VDP first extracts textual descriptions from visual inputs, then processes these descriptions using the model's language modality strengths before combining with original visual information.
- Core assumption: The model's language processing pathway is more robust for complex reasoning than its vision processing pathway.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Expanding on our findings, we introduce 'Vision Description Prompting,' a method that effectively improves performance in challenging vision-related tasks."
  - [section]: "Remarkably, we observed a significant improvement in accuracy (by over 30%) when solving problems based on image inputs."
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks when the extracted text description loses critical visual information necessary for task completion, or when the additional processing step introduces latency that outweighs accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Translation Variant (TV) tasks show larger modality performance gaps than Translation Invariant (TI) tasks due to information loss during modality conversion.
- Mechanism: TV tasks involve information that cannot be fully preserved when converting between modalities, creating inherent difficulty differences that compound with the model's modality-specific weaknesses.
- Core assumption: Information loss during translation between modalities creates additional cognitive load that the model handles unevenly across modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We categorize vision-language tasks into two distinct groups: translation variant tasks and translation invariant tasks, contingent upon whether information integrity is maintained during the transition from one modality to another."
  - [section]: "VQA Common Sense Reasoning. Surprisingly, the model performs significantly better when prompted with text questions than with images in Translation Variant tasks, even though images often contain more information to answer the questions."
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks when tasks are carefully designed to minimize information loss during translation, or when the model develops better cross-modal alignment through continued training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Translation Invariant vs. Translation Variant task classification
  - Why needed here: This classification framework provides the foundation for analyzing cross-modal consistency and identifying where the model's modality-specific weaknesses emerge.
  - Quick check question: Given a task that requires counting objects in an image, would this be classified as TI or TV, and why?

- Concept: Pairwise consistency metrics for cross-modal evaluation
  - Why needed here: Standard accuracy metrics don't capture the relative performance differences between modalities; pairwise metrics reveal consistency patterns that inform model improvement strategies.
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves 80% accuracy on text inputs and 60% on image inputs for the same task, what would the pairwise consistency score be?

- Concept: Vision-language model architecture differences
  - Why needed here: Understanding how multimodal models process different input types helps explain the observed performance disparities and guides prompting strategy development.
  - Quick check question: What architectural features would you expect to see in a "compound" bilingual model versus a "non-compound" one, and how might these manifest in vision-language systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multimodal encoder → modality-specific encoding → cross-attention layers → unified transformer decoder
- Critical path: Image/text input → modality-specific encoding → cross-attention layers → decoder output. The bottleneck for complex reasoning tasks appears to be in the cross-attention and integration stages.
- Design tradeoffs: The current architecture prioritizes language modeling capabilities, which creates the observed vision-language consistency issues but may be optimal for general-purpose applications where text dominates.
- Failure signatures: Large accuracy gaps between modalities for complex reasoning tasks, high pairwise consistency scores for simple tasks but low scores for complex tasks, and improved performance with VDP prompting.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the pairwise consistency evaluation on a new TI task to validate the framework generalizes beyond the reported datasets.
  2. Test VDP prompting on a TV task to determine if the benefits extend to tasks where information cannot be fully translated between modalities.
  3. Create a synthetic dataset where visual and textual information are perfectly aligned to test whether the model can achieve compound bilingualism in ideal conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different training methodologies for VLLMs (contrastive learning vs. embodied image-language modeling) affect the consistency between vision and language modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that VLLMs use distinct training methodologies like contrastive learning and embodied image-language modeling, which may lead to performance disparities across modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these different training approaches but does not conduct experiments comparing their effects on modality consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments training identical models using contrastive learning versus embodied image-language modeling, measuring modality consistency across the same task sets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Vision Description Prompting (VDP) method be extended to improve performance on Translation Variant (TV) tasks, or is it inherently limited to Translation Invariant (TI) tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces VDP for TI tasks where information is preserved across modalities, but doesn't explore its application to TV tasks where information is lost during translation.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests VDP on TI tasks and suggests it works by extracting textual information from images, but doesn't investigate whether this approach could help with TV tasks that have no direct text equivalent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying VDP to TV tasks like visual counting or maze solving, measuring whether the text extraction step provides any benefit even when complete information cannot be preserved.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural modifications could create more compound bilingual VLLMs that don't require modality translation for complex reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that current VLLMs are non-compound systems with different reasoning capabilities across modalities, and suggests the need for more integrated system designs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem of modality inconsistency and proposes a prompting workaround, it doesn't explore architectural solutions that might create truly compound representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of VLLM architectures with shared reasoning modules, cross-modal attention mechanisms, or unified representation spaces, measuring consistency improvements across complex reasoning tasks.

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework applied to a small set of six datasets with limited task diversity
- Experiments focused exclusively on GPT-4V, limiting generalizability to other VLLMs
- Single Translation Variant task may not represent the full spectrum of TV challenges

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The basic observation that GPT-4V shows modality-dependent performance differences for complex reasoning tasks is well-supported by experimental data
- **Medium Confidence**: Vision Description Prompting's effectiveness is demonstrated, but improvement percentages may vary with prompt engineering
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about architectural reasons for modality differences are speculative without access to internal architecture details

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Model Validation**: Test the TV/TI classification framework and VDP prompting on at least two additional VLLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude) to determine if consistency patterns are model-specific or representative of current VLLM architectures.

2. **Expanded TV Task Set**: Develop and evaluate a comprehensive suite of TV tasks that systematically vary the degree of information loss during modality translation, measuring how performance degradation correlates with translation complexity.

3. **Real-time Consistency Monitoring**: Implement a continuous evaluation pipeline that monitors cross-modal consistency during extended interactions with GPT-4V, identifying whether consistency patterns change based on conversation context, task difficulty progression, or user expertise level.
