# Analysis of the Reasoning with Redundant Information Provided Ability of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04039
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04039
- Reference count: 0
- Key result: LLMs show significant performance drops on reasoning tasks with redundant information, especially when numbers are involved

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates how large language models handle redundant information in reasoning tasks by introducing the Reasoning with Redundant Information Provided (RRIP) task. The researchers modified the GSM-8K dataset with four types of redundant information and tested LLaMA2-13B-chat and GPT-3.5. Both models experienced substantial performance degradation on RRIP tasks compared to standard QA tasks, particularly when redundant information shared subjects with the original content or included numbers. The study concludes that current LLMs struggle with redundant information and suggests incorporating such data into future training to improve performance.

## Method Summary
The study modified the GSM-8K dataset by creating 50 question-answer pairs with four types of redundant information: duplication (DU), simplification (SI), same subject with number (SSN), and meaningless information (MI). Two models, LLaMA2-13B-chat and GPT-3.5, were evaluated on both the original and modified datasets using three metrics: accuracy (ACC), single-right rate (SRR), and almost-right rate (ARR). Each model was queried 5 times per question with specific temperature and sampling parameters to assess consistency and performance changes.

## Key Results
- Both LLaMA2-13B-chat and GPT-3.5 showed significant performance drops on RRIP tasks compared to standard GSM-8K tasks
- Performance degradation was most severe with redundant information that shared subjects with original content or included numbers
- Models tend to incorporate all numerical information into calculations regardless of relevance, leading to incorrect answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs incorporate all numerical information into calculations regardless of relevance
- Mechanism: When processing questions with redundant numerical information, LLMs treat all numbers as potentially relevant and include them in intermediate reasoning steps, even when they are explicitly marked as irrelevant
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism in LLMs cannot effectively filter out numerical data based on contextual irrelevance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results showed both models experienced significant performance drops on RRIP tasks compared to standard QA tasks, particularly when dealing with redundant information that shared subjects with the original content or included numbers."
  - [section] "The direct reason for the performance loss is that LLMs tend to take all the numbers that appear in the question into consideration and calculation, which may allocate limited attention to unnecessary calculations."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus - weak correlation
- Break condition: When models develop stronger contextual filtering mechanisms or receive explicit training to identify and ignore irrelevant numerical information

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Confusion from redundant information with same subject as original content disrupts reasoning
- Mechanism: When redundant information shares subjects with original content and includes numbers, LLMs become confused about which information is relevant, leading to incorrect calculations and answers
- Core assumption: Subject overlap creates sufficient ambiguity to overwhelm the model's ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "particularly when dealing with redundant information that shared subjects with the original content"
  - [section] "When model deals with the redundant information, it tends to calculate based on it despite the instruction of question. This calculation may reduce the attention model paid on the needed information, which causes the loss of accuracy."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus - weak correlation
- Break condition: When models improve their ability to maintain context boundaries between original and redundant information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Performance degradation increases with similarity between redundant and original information
- Mechanism: As redundant information becomes more similar to the original content (from meaningless to same-subject-with-numbers), the difficulty of distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information increases, causing greater performance drops
- Core assumption: The model's ability to filter information degrades exponentially as the similarity between redundant and original information increases
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Although SSN and SI are more related to the question in the original dataset, both of them are kind of confusing, which means even humans have to read the questions carefully to pick out useful information."
  - [section] "The study designed a modified version of the grade school math 8K (GSM-8K) dataset which has several variants focusing on different attributes of redundant information."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence from "Information Re-Organization Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models" - no direct citation
- Break condition: When models develop hierarchical attention mechanisms that can maintain separate contexts for original and redundant information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs process multi-step reasoning is essential to grasp why redundant information causes performance drops
  - Quick check question: What happens to an LLM's reasoning chain when it encounters numerical information that appears relevant but is actually redundant?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in transformer models
  - Why needed here: The study's findings about performance degradation are directly related to how attention mechanisms handle numerical information in context
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism determine which tokens to focus on when processing mathematical word problems?

- Concept: Dataset modification and experimental design
  - Why needed here: The study's methodology of modifying GSM-8K with different types of redundant information is crucial for understanding the experimental approach
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between the four types of redundant information introduced in the study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GSM-8K dataset preprocessor -> LLM inference engine (LLaMA2-13B-chat and GPT-3.5) -> Answer extraction -> Metric calculation -> Result analysis module

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → LLM inference → Answer extraction → Metric calculation → Performance analysis

- Design tradeoffs: The study chose to modify existing GSM-8K questions rather than create entirely new ones, balancing realism with controlled experimental conditions

- Failure signatures: Accuracy drops of 10%+ on tasks with same-subject redundant information, incorrect inclusion of irrelevant numbers in calculations, inconsistent answers across multiple attempts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the study's findings using a larger sample size of GSM-8K questions to validate the observed performance drops
  2. Test whether explicitly prompting the model to identify and ignore redundant information improves performance on RRIP tasks
  3. Evaluate whether fine-tuning on a dataset with redundant information improves RRIP task performance compared to the baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the position of redundant information within a question affect LLM performance on RRIP tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that future research could examine "the influence of the position of redundant information" as an area for further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The current study only modified questions to include redundant information but did not systematically vary the position of this information within the questions.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experimental study that systematically varies the position of redundant information (beginning, middle, end) in questions and measures performance changes across these conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would increasing the sample size beyond 50 question-answer pairs significantly change the observed performance differences between LLaMA2-13B-chat and GPT-3.5 on RRIP tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges using only 50 question-answer pairs and suggests that "a larger sample size" could be used for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study's sample size may be too small to draw definitive conclusions about relative model performance differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A replication study using a substantially larger dataset (e.g., hundreds or thousands of questions) to determine if the observed performance patterns hold with greater statistical power.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would incorporating redundant information into the training data of LLMs affect their performance on RRIP tasks compared to models trained without such data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that "future training on LLMs should focus on this problem by constructing part of the training data with redundant information provided."
- Why unresolved: The study only demonstrated the problem exists but did not test whether training LLMs with redundant information improves their ability to handle it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment training two versions of an LLM (one with redundant information in training data, one without) and comparing their performance on identical RRIP tasks.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (50 modified questions) may not provide sufficient statistical power
- Manual dataset modification introduces potential annotation bias
- Only two models tested, limiting generalizability across the broader LLM landscape

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The observation that both models show performance drops on RRIP tasks compared to standard GSM-8K tasks is well-supported by the experimental results and consistent across multiple redundant information types.
- Medium Confidence: The attribution of performance degradation to LLMs' tendency to incorporate all numerical information into calculations is plausible but could benefit from additional ablation studies to confirm this mechanism.
- Low Confidence: The claim that incorporating redundant information into training will necessarily improve RRIP task performance is speculative, as the study did not test this hypothesis experimentally.

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate with Larger Sample Size**: Test the RRIP methodology on a larger subset of GSM-8K (e.g., 200+ questions) to determine if the observed performance drops are consistent across a broader range of mathematical reasoning tasks and to reduce sampling variability.

2. **Prompt Engineering Experiment**: Evaluate whether explicitly prompting models to identify and ignore redundant information before reasoning improves performance on RRIP tasks, using variations like "Identify any irrelevant information in this problem before solving" or "Only use the information necessary to solve this problem."

3. **Fine-tuning Validation**: Fine-tune LLaMA2-13B on a dataset augmented with redundant information similar to the RRIP variants, then compare performance on RRIP tasks against the baseline model to test whether training on such data improves the ability to handle redundancy.
