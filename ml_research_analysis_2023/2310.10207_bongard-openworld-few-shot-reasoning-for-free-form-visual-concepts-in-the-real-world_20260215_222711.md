# Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in the Real World

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10207
- Reference count: 40
- Human performance: 91% accuracy on benchmark tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark designed to evaluate few-shot reasoning capabilities of machine vision models in the real world. Building upon the classical Bongard Problems, it incorporates two novel challenges: open-world free-form concepts from an open vocabulary and real-world images instead of synthetic diagrams. The benchmark consists of 1.01K unique problems featuring compositional visual concepts exclusively depicted by positive image sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models struggle to match human performance, with the best model achieving only 64% accuracy compared to humans' 91%.

## Method Summary
Bongard-OpenWorld builds upon the classical Bongard Problems by incorporating open-world free-form concepts extracted from the Conceptual Captions dataset using a grid sampling method, and real-world images from the Open Images dataset. The benchmark construction involves crowd-sourcing challenging visual concepts, introducing distractors and hard negatives to prevent trivial solutions, collecting corresponding images, and selecting query images for each problem. The evaluation includes few-shot learners (ProtoNet, MetaOptNet, SNAIL), VLM+LLM combinations, and a neuro-symbolic approach, with performance measured on binary classification of query images and concept induction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves 64% accuracy vs 91% for humans on the benchmark
- All model families (few-shot learners, VLMs, LLMs, neuro-symbolic approaches) struggle with open vocabulary free-form visual concepts
- Abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge concepts are particularly challenging for models
- Real-world images add complexity compared to synthetic diagrams used in similar benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The grid sampling method balances diversity and top-concept selection when extracting visual concepts from CC-3M.
- Mechanism: By partitioning the large CC-3M dataset into small grids of 300 captions each, then sampling top concepts within each grid before combining, the method introduces variance that promotes sampling long-tailed concepts while still favoring frequent, relevant concepts.
- Core assumption: Small grid size introduces sufficient variance to capture diverse, long-tailed concepts while maintaining concept relevance.
- Evidence anchors: The paper states that instead of picking the top concept tuples of the whole CC-3M dataset, each time they only compute the frequency within a grid with only 300 CC-3M captions, pick the tops, then move on to the next grid. They find this balances the need for sampling top concepts and sample diversity, as the variance introduced by a small grid facilitates the sampling of more long-tailed concepts in CC-3M.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The inclusion of distractors and hard negatives in Bongard-OpenWorld problems is crucial for preventing trivial solutions and ensuring the need for true concept induction.
- Mechanism: Distractors are introduced by prompting ChatGPT to expand the positive concept into sentences with additional, irrelevant content, while hard negatives are created by modifying the concept to only partially overlap with the positives. This ensures that models cannot simply recognize common elements but must induce the full, specific concept.
- Core assumption: The partial overlap between positives and negatives forces models to reason about the full concept rather than just recognizing common elements.
- Evidence anchors: The paper explains that to further increase the intra-diversity among the positives P and therefore perplex the induction of given visual concepts C, they prompt ChatGPT to expand it into 10 sentences for positives by inserting distracting objects, attributes, etc. while ensuring common ground is still C. Moreover, by partially modifying the positive concept to produce negative concepts, they ensure the content of the negative images partially overlaps with the positives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of open vocabulary free-form concepts and real-world images in Bongard-OpenWorld presents a significant challenge to current models, leading to a substantial gap between human and machine performance.
- Mechanism: The open vocabulary nature of the concepts, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge, requires models to handle a vast and diverse set of visual concepts. The use of real-world images, as opposed to synthetic diagrams, adds another layer of complexity due to the variability and noise inherent in real-world data.
- Core assumption: Current models, even those with strong pretraining on large datasets, struggle to generalize to the open vocabulary and diverse nature of the concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld.
- Evidence anchors: The paper states that their benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. While the LLM-based models use either BLIP-2 or ChatCaptioner captions as the image representations... However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Bongard-OpenWorld problems are formulated as few-shot learning tasks, where models must learn from a small number of examples to make predictions on new data.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between few-shot learning and traditional supervised learning?

- Concept: Visual reasoning
  - Why needed here: The task requires models to reason about visual concepts and their relationships, not just recognize objects or attributes.
  - Quick check question: How does visual reasoning differ from object recognition?

- Concept: Open vocabulary and free-form concepts
  - Why needed here: The concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are not limited to a fixed set of categories but can be any composition of terms from an open vocabulary, requiring models to handle a wide range of visual concepts.
  - Quick check question: Why is it challenging for models to handle open vocabulary concepts compared to fixed vocabulary concepts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual concept extraction (grid sampling from CC-3M) -> Dataset construction (crowd-sourcing, distractors/hard negatives, image collection, query selection) -> Model evaluation (few-shot learners, VLMs, LLMs, neuro-symbolic approaches) -> Metric computation (accuracy, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGEL, CIDEr)
- Critical path: Extract visual concepts → Construct dataset with distractors/hard negatives → Train and evaluate models → Compute performance metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Grid size for concept extraction trades off between diversity and relevance; distractors/hard negatives increase difficulty but improve realism; real-world images add complexity but enhance applicability
- Failure signatures: Models performing at chance level may indicate overly difficult concepts or ineffective distractors/hard negatives; uneven performance across subsets may suggest overfitting to certain concept types
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate ProtoNet on a subset with short, non-commonsense concepts to establish baseline
  2. Compare performance of few-shot learner with different image representations (pretrained vs scratch)
  3. Compare few-shot learner performance with and without auxiliary captioning task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of different grid sizes when sampling visual concepts from CC-3M captions?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using a grid size of 300 captions for sampling concepts from CC-3M, but does not explore the impact of different grid sizes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an analysis of how varying the grid size affects the diversity and quality of sampled visual concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different grid sizes (e.g., 100, 300, 500, 1000) and comparing the resulting concept diversity, accuracy on Bongard-OpenWorld tasks, and human evaluation of concept quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge affect model performance on Bongard-OpenWorld?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions crowd-sourcing challenging concepts including abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge, and states that problems with these concepts are more difficult to solve.
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes the increased difficulty, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how these specific types of concepts impact model performance or what makes them particularly challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting ablation studies by removing abstract attributes and commonsense concepts from the dataset and comparing model performance. Additionally, analyzing model errors on these specific concept types to identify failure modes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between few-shot learning and language model-based approaches for Bongard-OpenWorld?
- Basis in paper: The paper explores both few-shot learning methods and LLM/VLM combinations, but does not determine an optimal hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats few-shot learners and LLM/VLM approaches separately without investigating potential synergies or hybrid architectures that could combine their strengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating hybrid models that integrate few-shot learning mechanisms with LLM/VLM components, testing different architectural designs and training strategies to find the optimal balance.

## Limitations

- Grid sampling mechanism lacks systematic ablation studies across different grid sizes to validate optimal balance between concept diversity and relevance
- Human baseline comparison lacks detailed evaluation protocol specifications including participant expertise and training procedures
- Neuro-symbolic approach and VLM+LLM implementations lack critical implementation details like exact prompt templates and hyperparameter choices

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core claim that Bongard-OpenWorld presents a significant challenge to current models is well-supported by extensive experiments across multiple model families (few-shot learners, VLMs, LLMs, neuro-symbolic approaches), all showing substantial gaps from human performance.

**Medium confidence**: The mechanism by which grid sampling promotes concept diversity is plausible given the described methodology, but would benefit from quantitative validation through systematic ablation studies varying grid sizes.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that distractors and hard negatives are crucial for preventing trivial solutions is theoretically sound, but the effectiveness of these design choices could be further validated through controlled experiments comparing problems with and without these elements.

## Next Checks

1. **Grid size ablation study**: Systematically evaluate concept extraction quality across grid sizes (100, 300, 500, 1000 captions) to quantify the tradeoff between concept diversity and relevance, measuring both the long-tail coverage and the accuracy of extracted concepts.

2. **Controlled problem difficulty analysis**: Create controlled subsets of Bongard-OpenWorld problems varying the presence/absence of distractors and hard negatives, then measure model performance changes to validate that these design elements are indeed responsible for the observed difficulty.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate few-shot learners trained on Bongard-OpenWorld on related benchmarks (Bongard-RWR+, BPRL) and vice versa to quantify how well performance transfers between synthetic and real-world Bongard-style problems, revealing whether the gap stems from concept complexity or real-world image variability.
