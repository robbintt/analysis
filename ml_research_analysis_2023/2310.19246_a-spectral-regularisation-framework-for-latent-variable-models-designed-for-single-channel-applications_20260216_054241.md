# A spectral regularisation framework for latent variable models designed for single channel applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19246
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19246

- The spectrally-regularised-LVMs Python package addresses source duplication in single channel latent variable model (LVM) applications through spectral regularisation

## Executive Summary
The spectrally-regularised-LVMs package introduces a novel spectral regularisation framework for single-channel latent variable models to address the critical issue of source duplication. By incorporating a spectral regularisation term during parameter estimation, the framework enforces disjoint spectral support among extracted latent components. This approach enables effective blind source separation in single-channel applications where traditional methods struggle with component redundancy. The package provides both symbolic and explicit implementations of common LVMs like PCA and ICA, with automatic gradient and Hessian computation capabilities.

## Method Summary
The package implements a linear LVM framework that uses hankelisation to convert single-channel time-series into matrix format suitable for LVM processing. During parameter estimation, a spectral regularisation term is added to the objective function to encourage spectral orthogonality between components. The framework employs sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) to iteratively increase the prominence of the regularisation term during optimization. Users can implement custom objective functions symbolically using SymPy for automatic derivative computation, or use pre-implemented PCA and ICA modules. The LinearModel class orchestrates the complete workflow from data pre-processing through model fitting and source extraction.

## Key Results
- Provides a consistent linear LVM optimisation framework incorporating spectral regularisation
- Addresses source duplication issue in single-channel LVM applications via novel spectral regularisation term
- Enables automatic gradient and Hessian computation through symbolic objective function implementation
- Makes it easier to investigate and utilise LVMs with spectral regularisation in single-channel applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Spectral regularisation term prevents source duplication by enforcing spectral orthogonality among latent components.
- Mechanism: The spectral regularisation term Lsr(wi) minimizes the dot product between the Fourier domain representation of current component vector b(wi) and previously solved component vectors b(wj). This encourages each component to capture unique frequency information.
- Core assumption: Fourier domain representations adequately capture spectral characteristics for orthogonality enforcement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed package addresses the source duplication issue via the addition of a novel spectral regularisation term."
  - [section] "The spectral regularisation term encourages the wi solution to be spectrally unique with respect to the previous solution vectors wj, where j < i."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't mention spectral regularisation for LVM source duplication.
- Break condition: If the Fourier transform does not adequately represent the spectral characteristics needed for orthogonality, or if the penalty parameter α is poorly tuned.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) provides adaptive control over regularisation strength.
- Mechanism: SUMT iteratively increases the prominence of the spectral regularisation term during each optimisation iteration, allowing for controlled enforcement of spectral orthogonality.
- Core assumption: Gradually increasing regularisation strength leads to better convergence than constant regularisation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To remove ambiguity behind the choice of α, the sequential unconstrained minimisation technique (SUMT) is used within the model optimisation step to iteratively increase the prominence of the regularisation term during each optimisation iteration."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about SUMT usage for spectral regularisation in LVMs.
- Break condition: If SUMT causes premature convergence to suboptimal solutions or if the iterative increase in regularisation destabilizes the optimisation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Symbolic implementation of objective functions enables automatic gradient and Hessian computation.
- Mechanism: Using SymPy for symbolic representation allows the package to automatically derive first and second order derivatives of arbitrary objective functions, reducing implementation burden and potential errors.
- Core assumption: Symbolic differentiation provides accurate and efficient gradients/Hessians for the optimisation process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Users can implement their objective functions directly using the symbolic Python package SymPy [16] to automatically obtain the gradient and Hessian of the model objective function."
  - [section] "Alternatively, the objective function for two common LVMs, PCA and ICA, can be called through the sub-modules present in the package."
- Break condition: If symbolic differentiation becomes computationally expensive for complex objective functions, or if numerical instability occurs in derived expressions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hankelisation for single-channel time-series pre-processing
  - Why needed here: Transforms 1D time-series into a matrix format suitable for LVM framework, enabling application to single channel data.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of window length (Lw) and shift parameter (Lsf t) affect the hankelised matrix structure and subsequent LVM performance?

- Concept: Spectral orthogonality and disjoint spectral support
- Why needed here: Fundamental requirement for blind source separation in single channel LVM applications, preventing source duplication.
- Quick check question: Why is disjoint spectral support necessary for perfect source recovery in single channel LVM applications?

- Concept: Deflation-based optimisation in LVM parameter estimation
- Why needed here: Enables sequential extraction of latent sources, where each component is solved for one-by-one while orthogonalizing against previously found components.
- Quick check question: How does the deflation approach differ from joint estimation of all latent components, and what are the trade-offs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pre-processing (hankelisation) -> Objective function initialization (symbolic/explicit) -> Spectral regulariser setup -> Parameter estimation via .fit() -> Model application via .transform()/.inverse_transform()

- Critical path: Data pre-processing (hankelisation) → Objective function initialization (symbolic/explicit) → Spectral regulariser setup → Parameter estimation via .fit() → Model application via .transform()/.inverse_transform()

- Design tradeoffs: Symbolic vs explicit objective function implementation (automatic derivatives vs computational efficiency), choice of optimisation strategy (first-order vs second-order methods), and spectral regularisation strength (controlled by SUMT).

- Failure signatures: Source duplication in extracted components (insufficient regularisation), slow convergence (poor choice of optimisation parameters or objective function), or runtime errors (dimension mismatches in pre-processing).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test PCA with synthetic data containing known orthogonal components to verify basic functionality without spectral regularisation.
  2. Apply negentropy-based LVM to a simple non-Gaussian signal mixture to demonstrate source separation capability.
  3. Use the IMS bearing dataset with spectral regularisation enabled to validate the package on real-world single channel time-series data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the spectral regularisation term affect the convergence speed and computational complexity of the optimisation process compared to standard LVM methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the model estimation step may be computationally extensive if d << D as much compute is wasted on duplicate information, and the proposed spectral regularisation term aims to address this issue.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis of the impact of spectral regularisation on convergence speed and computational complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the convergence speed and computational complexity of the proposed method with standard LVM methods on various datasets would provide evidence to answer this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the penalty enforcement parameter α affect the performance of the spectral regularisation term in different scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the choice of α is ambiguous and uses the sequential unconstrained minimisation technique (SUMT) to iteratively increase the prominence of the regularisation term during each optimisation iteration.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide guidelines or empirical evidence on how to choose the optimal value of α for different scenarios or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the performance of the spectral regularisation term with different values of α on various datasets and scenarios would provide evidence to answer this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the spectral regularisation term perform in scenarios where the underlying sources have overlapping spectral support?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the disjoint spectral support requirement is necessary to fully recover the latent sources, but the spectral regularisation term aims to encourage spectral orthogonality even in cases where this requirement is not met.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis of the performance of the spectral regularisation term in scenarios with overlapping spectral support.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating the performance of the spectral regularisation term in scenarios with overlapping spectral support would provide evidence to answer this question.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of spectral regularisation depends critically on the choice of penalty parameter α, with no systematic guidance provided for parameter selection.
- The assumption that Fourier domain representations adequately capture spectral characteristics may not hold for all signal types, particularly those with overlapping frequency content.
- The package currently focuses on linear LVMs, potentially limiting applicability to nonlinear latent structures common in complex single-channel applications.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The package provides a consistent framework for spectral regularisation in single-channel LVM applications, and the implementation of symbolic objective functions using SymPy is technically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism by which spectral regularisation prevents source duplication through disjoint spectral support is theoretically valid, though empirical validation across diverse signal types is needed.
- **Medium confidence**: The SUMT approach for adaptive regularisation strength control represents a reasonable optimisation strategy, but its superiority over fixed regularisation approaches requires comparative evaluation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation study**: Systematically evaluate the package's performance across multiple signal types (synthetic mixtures, real-world time-series, biomedical signals) to identify scenarios where spectral regularisation succeeds or fails.

2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Conduct experiments varying the penalty parameter α, hankelisation window length Lw, and shift parameter Lsf t to determine their impact on source separation quality and computational efficiency.

3. **Comparison with alternatives**: Benchmark the spectrally-regularised-LVMs approach against established single-channel separation techniques (e.g., independent component analysis variants, sparse component analysis) using standardized datasets and metrics.
