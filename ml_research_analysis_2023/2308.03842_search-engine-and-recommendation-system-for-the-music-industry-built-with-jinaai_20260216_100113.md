# Search Engine and Recommendation System for the Music Industry built with JinaAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03842
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03842
- Reference count: 14
- Presents neural search engine and recommendation system for music industry using Jina AI

## Executive Summary
This study presents a neural search engine and recommendation system for the music industry that leverages Jina AI to analyze user queries and retrieve relevant song lyrics. The system addresses common challenges in music search including popularity bias and limited language diversity by scraping over 28,000 song lyrics from multiple websites. By incorporating comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and Jina AI integration, the system provides unbiased search results through a user-friendly web application with real-time data analysis capabilities.

## Method Summary
The system scrapes song lyrics from multiple websites using Selenium, storing them in a MongoDB database for efficient retrieval. Data preprocessing includes noise removal, normalization, tokenization, and other standard NLP techniques to clean and standardize the lyrics data. Jina AI is then used to build the neural search engine that matches user queries with relevant lyrics based on semantic meaning. The system is deployed as a Streamlit web application with visualization capabilities using Plotly to analyze dataset distribution and search results across genres and emotions.

## Key Results
- Successfully built neural search engine that retrieves accurate song lyrics based on user queries
- Demonstrated dataset diversity across genres and emotions through distribution analysis
- Developed user-friendly web application with real-time data analysis capabilities
- Addressed popularity bias challenges through multi-source data collection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Jina AI's neural search engine effectively matches user queries with relevant song lyrics by leveraging deep learning models to understand semantic meaning.
- Mechanism: Jina AI processes the user's query through a neural network trained on song lyrics, enabling semantic understanding beyond simple keyword matching.
- Core assumption: The neural network has been sufficiently trained on diverse song lyrics to capture music-related semantic nuances.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions Jina AI framework for building neural search engines; [section] states the application is based on matching queries with lyrics.
- Break condition: If the neural network is not adequately trained on diverse music data, it may fail to understand certain music-related queries.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The preprocessing pipeline improves data quality and consistency, leading to more accurate search results.
- Mechanism: Raw song lyrics are cleaned and standardized through noise removal, normalization, and tokenization to make them easier for the neural network to process.
- Core assumption: Preprocessing steps are comprehensive and appropriate for music lyrics data.
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes preprocessing phases including noise removal, normalization, tokenization, and other text processing steps.
- Break condition: If preprocessing is too aggressive, it might remove important information or change the meaning of lyrics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: System's focus on reducing popularity bias ensures more diverse and representative search results.
- Mechanism: By scraping lyrics from multiple sources rather than relying on popular artists, the system builds a more comprehensive and diverse dataset.
- Core assumption: Data collection process is truly unbiased and representative of broader music landscape.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions addressing popularity bias; [section] identifies popularity bias as a huge downfall in query analysis.
- Break condition: If data collection inadvertently favors certain genres or artists, popularity bias may persist.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural search engines
  - Why needed here: To understand how Jina AI's neural network matches queries with lyrics based on semantic meaning rather than keywords.
  - Quick check question: How does a neural search engine differ from a traditional keyword-based search engine?

- Concept: Text preprocessing for NLP
  - Why needed here: To grasp the importance of cleaning and standardizing song lyrics data before neural network processing.
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in preprocessing text data for NLP tasks, and why are they important?

- Concept: Popularity bias in recommendation systems
  - Why needed here: To understand challenges of ensuring diverse search results in music recommendation systems.
  - Quick check question: What are potential negative impacts of popularity bias in music recommendation systems, and how can it be mitigated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Selenium scraping -> MongoDB database -> Preprocessing pipeline -> Jina AI neural search engine -> Plotly visualization -> Streamlit web interface
- Critical path: User query → Jina AI neural search engine → MongoDB database → search results → display in Streamlit app
- Design tradeoffs: Neural search provides more accurate semantic results but requires more computational resources and training data compared to keyword-based search
- Failure signatures: Irrelevant results indicate issues with neural network training or data quality; slow web application points to performance bottlenecks
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test search engine with various simple and complex queries to assess retrieval accuracy
  2. Analyze search results distribution across genres and artists to check for popularity bias
  3. Measure web application performance under different user loads to identify scalability issues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the search engine handle multi-language queries and lyrics beyond English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions lack of emphasis on regional and global languages in query analysis as a challenge.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide details on how the system handles non-English queries or lyrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Information on language detection, translation, or multilingual support features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific metrics are used to evaluate fairness and unbiasedness of the recommendation system?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes addressing popularity bias and ensuring fairness without detailing evaluation metrics.
- Why unresolved: No explicit metrics or evaluation methods are mentioned for assessing fairness in recommendations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Description of fairness metrics, evaluation procedures, and results demonstrating reduced bias.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the system handle real-time updates to the song database and maintain search accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The system scrapes data from multiple websites and stores it in MongoDB for easier retrieval and management.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explain how the system handles dynamic updates or ensures accuracy with constantly changing database.
- What evidence would resolve it: Details on database synchronization, update frequency, and accuracy maintenance mechanisms.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed information about specific Jina AI model architecture and hyperparameters
- No quantitative metrics provided for search accuracy or user satisfaction
- Dataset of 28,372 songs may not fully represent global music diversity
- No validation of actual effectiveness in reducing popularity bias through rigorous testing

## Confidence
- Confidence Level: Medium
  - Major uncertainties include incomplete documentation of Jina AI configuration and preprocessing pipeline
  - No quantitative performance metrics make it difficult to assess real-world effectiveness
  - Claims about bias reduction lack thorough validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive evaluation of search accuracy using standard information retrieval metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) across different query types and music genres.
2. Perform detailed analysis of search results to quantify actual impact on popularity bias, including distribution analysis across artist popularity, genre representation, and cultural diversity.
3. Implement controlled user study to assess system's usability, satisfaction, and effectiveness compared to existing music search platforms.
