# Causality-Inspired Fair Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17373
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FMMRec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fairness while maintaining competitive accuracy on MovieLens and MicroLens datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in multimodal recommendation systems where incorporating multiple data modalities (images, text, audio) can increase leakage of sensitive user information. The proposed FMMRec method achieves counterfactual fairness by disentangling sensitive and non-sensitive information from modal representations and using this disentanglement to guide fairer representation learning. The approach involves separating biased (containing sensitive information) and filtered (minimizing sensitive information) modal embeddings, mining modality-based fair and unfair user-user structures, and enhancing user representations while adversarially filtering out sensitive information.

## Method Summary
FMMRec operates in two phases: (1) Disentanglement learning, where filter and biased learner networks for each modality are trained to generate biased and filtered embeddings that respectively maximize and minimize sensitive attribute prediction accuracy; and (2) Modality-guided fairness learning, where fair/unfair user-user structures are mined from the disentangled embeddings, user representations are enhanced using these structures, and adversarial filtering is applied to eliminate sensitive information from both explicit and implicit representations. The method uses compositional filters with role indicators to distinguish user and item representations, applying discriminators to predict sensitive attributes from both explicit user representations and implicit representations aggregated from interacted items.

## Key Results
- FMMRec achieves significantly lower AUC/F1 values for sensitive attribute prediction while maintaining competitive accuracy
- On MovieLens dataset, FMMRec achieves AUC of 0.5224 for gender prediction on explicit representations (compared to 0.5431 for best baseline FairGo)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including AL, CAL, and FairGo across fairness and accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disentangling biased and filtered modal embeddings reduces sensitive information leakage in multimodal recommendations.
- Mechanism: By maximizing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy on biased embeddings and minimizing it on filtered embeddings, the model separates sensitive and non-sensitive information at the modal level before it can influence user representations.
- Core assumption: Different modalities contribute varying levels of sensitive information leakage, and this can be quantified and separated through adversarial training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we disentangle biased and filtered modal representations by maximizing and minimizing their sensitive attribute prediction ability respectively"
  - [section] "we propose to maximize the potential sensitive information of the biased embeddings and minimize that of filtered embeddings"
- Break condition: If the disentanglement fails to separate sensitive from non-sensitive information, or if the reconstruction loss doesn't preserve enough personalized information in filtered embeddings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mining modality-based fair and unfair user-user structures enables targeted fairness enhancement in user representations.
- Mechanism: The method constructs adjacency matrices from filtered (fair) and biased (unfair) modal embeddings, then uses these to identify and incorporate appropriate neighbor information that either enhances fairness or preserves personalization.
- Core assumption: Users with similar filtered modal representations have similar preferences when sensitive attributes are removed, and users with similar biased modal representations share sensitive-attribute-driven preferences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we leverage modal embeddings to mine fair/unfair (or filtered/biased) user-user graph structures"
  - [section] "we propose to fuse multiple unimodal matrices to an integrated multimodal matrix"
- Break condition: If the modality-based similarity matrices don't capture meaningful relationships, or if the k-nearest-neighbor sparsification removes too much structural information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adversarial learning on both explicit and implicit user representations ensures counterfactual fairness in multimodal recommendations.
- Mechanism: The method applies compositional filters with role indicators to distinguish user and item representations, then trains discriminators to predict sensitive attributes from both explicit user representations and implicit representations aggregated from interacted items.
- Core assumption: Sensitive information can leak through both direct user representations and indirect representations derived from their interactions with items.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "adversarially filtering out sensitive information"
  - [section] "we train two sets of discriminators...to predict the value of user 𝑢's sensitive attributes from the filtered user representation"
- Break condition: If the adversarial training doesn't effectively remove sensitive information, or if the accuracy-fairness tradeoff becomes too severe.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal recommendation systems and their data sparsity problem
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses fairness specifically in multimodal recommendations where multiple data modalities (visual, textual, audio) are incorporated to alleviate data sparsity
  - Quick check question: How does incorporating multiple modalities help with the data sparsity problem in traditional recommender systems?

- Concept: Counterfactual fairness and its requirements
  - Why needed here: The method explicitly aims for counterfactual fairness, which requires recommendation distributions to be independent of sensitive attributes even under hypothetical interventions
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes counterfactual fairness from other fairness definitions like statistical parity or equal opportunity?

- Concept: Adversarial learning for fairness
  - Why needed here: The method uses adversarial training as the primary technique to eliminate sensitive information from learned representations
  - Quick check question: How does the min-max game between filter and discriminator networks help achieve fairness in representation learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pretraining -> Disentanglement Learning -> Modality-guided Fairness Learning -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Pretraining → Disentanglement Learning → Modality-guided Fairness Learning → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. fairness tradeoff controlled by hyperparameters λ_Du and λ_Dv
  - Complexity vs. effectiveness tradeoff in choosing k neighbors for structure mining
  - Reconstruction quality vs. sensitive information removal in disentanglement learning
- Failure signatures:
  - If AUC/F1 values for sensitive attribute prediction remain high on explicit/implicit representations
  - If recommendation accuracy (Recall/NDCG) drops significantly compared to baseline
  - If disentangled embeddings don't show the expected pattern (biased > original > filtered in sensitive information leakage)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate disentanglement performance by comparing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy on original, biased, and filtered modal embeddings
  2. Test impact of different k values (number of neighbors) on fairness performance to find optimal balance
  3. Compare fairness performance with and without role indicators in compositional filters to verify their effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed disentanglement method (maximizing/minimizing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy for biased/filtered embeddings) compare to other potential disentanglement techniques (e.g., variational autoencoders, information bottleneck) in terms of fairness performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes a specific disentanglement approach but does not compare it to other methods.
- Why unresolved: The authors only evaluate their specific disentanglement method and do not benchmark it against alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the fairness performance and computational efficiency of different disentanglement techniques (e.g., VAEs, IB) applied to multimodal recommendation scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the proposed method on recommendation accuracy for different user groups (e.g., majority vs. minority groups) defined by sensitive attributes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper reports overall accuracy-fairness trade-offs, it does not analyze how accuracy varies across user groups defined by sensitive attributes.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on overall fairness metrics but does not investigate potential disparities in recommendation accuracy across different user groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of recommendation accuracy disaggregated by sensitive attribute groups, showing how accuracy changes for each group after applying the fairness method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle the potential leakage of sensitive information through other modalities not considered in the study (e.g., user-generated text reviews, user interaction patterns)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on visual, textual, and audio modalities but acknowledges that other modalities might contain sensitive information.
- Why unresolved: The authors only consider a limited set of modalities and do not explore the impact of other potential sources of sensitive information leakage.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the method's effectiveness in mitigating sensitive information leakage from additional modalities (e.g., user reviews, interaction patterns) and a discussion of potential strategies to address these additional sources of leakage.

## Limitations
- Weak empirical evidence supporting modality-specific disentanglement approach due to lack of comparable methods in literature
- Multiple hyperparameters (λ_h, λ_Du, λ_Dv, k) significantly impact performance but are not thoroughly analyzed
- Scalability to datasets with more modalities or different sensitive attribute types remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Experimental results demonstrating FMMRec's superiority over baselines on MovieLens and MicroLens datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical framework for counterfactual fairness through multimodal modality-specific disentanglement
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to different recommendation domains beyond movies and micro-videos

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation experiments removing individual components to quantify their relative contributions to fairness improvement
2. Systematically vary key hyperparameters across a wider range to understand their impact on accuracy-fairness tradeoff
3. Test FMMRec on additional multimodal recommendation datasets with different sensitive attributes to assess generalizability
