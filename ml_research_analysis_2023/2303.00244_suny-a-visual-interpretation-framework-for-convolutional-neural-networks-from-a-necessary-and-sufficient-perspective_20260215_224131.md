# SUNY: A Visual Interpretation Framework for Convolutional Neural Networks from a Necessary and Sufficient Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.00244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00244
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel visual explanation framework that provides bi-directional explanations from necessity and sufficiency perspectives, outperforming seven popular methods on deletion/insertion metrics, localization, and attack robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SUNY, a novel visual interpretation framework for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses limitations in existing Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based methods by incorporating causal reasoning from both necessity and sufficiency perspectives. Unlike traditional approaches that only explain "what" features are important, SUNY answers "why" questions by quantifying the causal effects of input features or model filters on model predictions. The framework generates 2D saliency maps that highlight both necessary and sufficient regions for model decisions, providing complementary explanations that better support model interpretation.

## Method Summary
SUNY implements a bi-directional quantification framework that uses either input features or model filters as hypothetical causes to generate explanations from both necessary and sufficient perspectives. The core innovation is the N-S Responsibility metric, which combines causal effect measurements with responsibility approaches to fairly distribute effects among interacting causes. For each cause, SUNY computes necessity by measuring the difference between the original prediction and the prediction when that cause is removed, while sufficiency is measured by the difference when that cause is preserved alone. The framework then generates 2D saliency maps by linearly combining feature maps weighted by their N-S responsibilities, providing interpretable visualizations that highlight both essential and sufficient regions for model predictions.

## Key Results
- SUNY outperforms seven popular interpretability methods on deletion/insertion AUC scores across ILSVRC2012 and CUB-200-2011 datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior localization ability compared to baseline methods while maintaining robustness against saliency attacks
- SUNY passes the sanity check, confirming that the generated explanations are meaningful rather than artifacts of the model architecture
- Semantic evaluation shows that necessity and sufficiency perspectives provide complementary explanations that better support human interpretation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SUNY's N-S Responsibility formulation provides more accurate individual cause importance scores than pure causal effect or responsibility methods.
- Mechanism: By combining causal effect (measuring outcome differences) with responsibility (measuring minimal cause sets) and distributing effects across interacting causes, SUNY captures both necessity and sufficiency perspectives while attributing individual importance.
- Core assumption: The linear combination of distributed causal effects accurately represents the importance of individual causes in the presence of other causes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives."
  - [section] "To fulfill R1, we provide a quantification to approximate a fair distribution of N-S Effect to a number of causes working cooperatively."
- Break condition: If interacting causes have highly non-linear effects on the outcome, the linear distribution assumption may break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The 2D saliency map format provides more interpretable explanations than previous CAM-based methods.
- Mechanism: By generating separate necessity and sufficiency heatmaps that highlight different aspects of the decision-making process, SUNY provides complementary information that helps users understand both what is essential and what is sufficient for the prediction.
- Core assumption: Human users can effectively interpret and utilize the distinction between necessary and sufficient regions in the explanation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SUNY generates 2D saliency maps that highlight necessary and sufficient regions for model predictions."
  - [section] "SUNY uniquely provides both necessary and sufficient information to support interpretation."
- Break condition: If users cannot distinguish between the semantic meaning of necessity versus sufficiency, the dual-map approach may cause confusion rather than clarity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SUNY's flexible cause selection (input features or model filters) enables broader applicability across different CNN architectures and interpretation needs.
- Mechanism: By allowing either input features or model filters as causes, SUNY can adapt to different architectural constraints and provide complementary insights depending on whether the focus is on what the model sees or how it processes information.
- Core assumption: Both input features and model filters provide meaningful and complementary causal information about the model's decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives."
  - [section] "Following the definitions in Sec. 4.1, SUNY provides CAM-based causal explanations regarding input features and model filters as hypothesized causes, respectively."
- Break condition: If one type of cause (features or filters) consistently provides more meaningful explanations than the other, the flexibility may add unnecessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal inference and counterfactual reasoning
  - Why needed here: The framework is built on causal theory to answer "why" questions about model decisions, requiring understanding of interventions and counterfactual outcomes.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between observational correlation and causal effect in the context of model explanations?

- Concept: Shapley value and cooperative game theory
  - Why needed here: The distribution of causal effects across interacting causes draws on principles similar to Shapley values for fair attribution in cooperative settings.
  - Quick check question: How would you distribute a total effect among three causes that work together to produce an outcome?

- Concept: Saliency map generation and visualization techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to convert importance scores into interpretable 2D visualizations is crucial for the practical application of the framework.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Grad-CAM and Score-CAM in terms of how they weight feature maps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Forward pass → Cause selection → Counterfactual intervention → Effect measurement → Responsibility calculation → Saliency map generation
- Critical path: Image → Forward pass → Cause selection → Counterfactual intervention → Effect measurement → Responsibility calculation → Saliency map generation
- Design tradeoffs: Flexibility in cause selection adds complexity but enables broader applicability; dual necessity/sufficiency maps provide richer information but may be harder to interpret.
- Failure signatures: Noisy or inconsistent explanations may indicate issues with the causal effect distribution assumption or inappropriate cause selection.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SUNY on a simple CNN trained on MNIST to verify the basic framework works and generates reasonable necessity/sufficiency maps.
  2. Compare SUNY explanations with Grad-CAM on a VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10 to validate improvements in localization and interpretability.
  3. Perform the deletion/insertion test on SUNY-feature and SUNY-filter to quantify the improvement in identifying important regions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SUNY perform when applied to non-CNN architectures such as transformers or vision transformers, and what modifications would be necessary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions SUNY is tested on different CNN architectures but does not explore other architectures like transformers.
- Why unresolved: The framework was designed and evaluated specifically for CNNs, and extending it to other architectures would require validation of the causal mechanism approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies applying SUNY to transformers or vision transformers with comparative analysis against existing interpretability methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational complexity of SUNY in terms of time and memory requirements compared to other interpretability methods, especially for large-scale models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that perturbation-based methods are computationally challenging, but does not provide detailed complexity analysis of SUNY itself.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates competitive performance, it lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the bi-directional necessity and sufficiency calculations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed benchmarking studies comparing SUNY's computational requirements against other methods across different model sizes and datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is SUNY to the choice of hyperparameters such as the minimum and maximum set sizes (a and b) for cause interaction analysis, and what is the impact on explanation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that a and b are pre-defined and can be empirically estimated using Monte Carlo sampling, but does not explore their sensitivity.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these hyperparameters exist but does not investigate how their values affect the resulting explanations or provide guidance on optimal selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic sensitivity analysis experiments varying a and b values across different models and datasets, showing their impact on explanation quality metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does SUNY perform in real-world applications beyond classification, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or medical imaging diagnosis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions plans to apply SUNY to image segmentation and vision-language tasks in future work, but does not demonstrate these applications.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to image classification tasks, and extending to other domains would require validation of SUNY's effectiveness in different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applied studies demonstrating SUNY's performance in specific real-world scenarios like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, with user studies validating interpretability benefits.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on counterfactual interventions assumes model behavior remains stable under hypothetical modifications, which may not hold for all architectures
- The linear distribution of causal effects across interacting causes represents a significant assumption that could break down with highly non-linear interactions
- While necessity and sufficiency provide complementary explanations, the framework lacks systematic user studies to validate whether this dual-perspective approach actually improves human understanding

## Confidence

- High: The framework's ability to generate interpretable 2D saliency maps is well-supported by the visualization results
- Medium: The quantitative improvements over baseline methods are demonstrated but could benefit from additional ablation studies on parameter sensitivity
- Medium: The claim that necessity and sufficiency provide complementary explanations is supported by qualitative results but lacks systematic user studies to verify interpretability benefits

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the parameters controlling effect distribution to determine their sensitivity and impact on explanation quality.
2. Test SUNY on additional architectures (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformers) to verify generalizability beyond VGG16 and Inception-v3.
3. Design user studies to empirically validate whether the necessity/sufficiency distinction improves human understanding compared to traditional saliency methods.
