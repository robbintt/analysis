# Overview of ImageArg-2023: The First Shared Task in Multimodal Argument Mining

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12172
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12172
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: First multimodal argument mining shared task with 31 submissions for Subtask-A and 21 for Subtask-B, achieving F1-scores of 0.8647 and 0.5561 respectively

## Executive Summary
The ImageArg-2023 shared task introduced the first benchmark for multimodal argument mining, focusing on two classification subtasks: Argument Stance Classification and Image Persuasiveness Classification. The task attracted 31 submissions for Subtask-A and 21 for Subtask-B from 9 teams across 6 countries. The dataset consists of tweets containing both images and text on controversial topics like gun control and abortion. Top-performing models demonstrated that multimodal feature fusion significantly improves performance, with CLIP-based models showing particular effectiveness for persuasiveness classification.

## Method Summary
The shared task involved two classification subtasks using a dataset of tweets with images and text. For Subtask-A (stance classification), participants fine-tuned pretrained language models like BERT, DeBERTa, and BERTweet on tweet text, optionally incorporating OCR-extracted text from images. Data augmentation techniques such as backtranslation and synonym replacement were commonly employed. For Subtask-B (persuasiveness classification), most successful approaches used multimodal models like CLIP or ViLT to jointly encode image-text pairs, or separate encoders with fusion strategies. Models were evaluated using F1-score on binary classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Top submission in Subtask-A achieved F1-score of 0.8647, demonstrating strong multimodal stance detection
- Best submission in Subtask-B achieved F1-score of 0.5561, showing the challenge of persuasiveness classification
- CLIP models were the most effective technique for extracting multimodal features in Subtask-B
- Data augmentation and ensemble methods significantly enhanced model performance across both subtasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal feature fusion improves stance classification performance.
- Mechanism: Combining text embeddings with extracted image text embeddings captures complementary argumentative signals.
- Core assumption: The stance expressed in tweet images often contains text that supplements or reinforces the stance in the tweet text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Table 3 reveals that the most successful submissions utilized pretrained language models such as DeBERTa, BERT, and BERTweet... The integration of data augmentation techniques, such as backtranslation and word substitution using WordNet, was observed to enhance performance... Leveraging features from the visual modality, whether through image representations or image-text representations, further improved performance..."
  - [corpus]: No explicit corpus-level evidence, but the ImageArg corpus includes both tweet text and images, implying potential multimodal signal alignment.
- Break condition: If extracted text from images is irrelevant, noisy, or misaligned with the tweet stance, multimodal fusion may introduce confusion rather than improvement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CLIP models are effective for multimodal persuasiveness classification.
- Mechanism: CLIP's unified vision-language encoder learns joint representations that capture cross-modal alignment between images and texts, enabling better assessment of whether images make texts more persuasive.
- Core assumption: Persuasiveness of an image depends on its semantic coherence with the accompanying text, which CLIP is trained to model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Table 4 indicates that utilizing CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) model is evident to be the most effective technique in extracting multimodal features, which yields the best results (top-4 systems leveraged CLIP). This indicates that a unified encoder can better model the cross-modal information fusion..."
  - [corpus]: The ImageArg corpus contains paired tweets and images, making it suitable for CLIP's cross-modal learning objective.
- Break condition: If persuasiveness is primarily determined by factors outside CLIP's training distribution (e.g., domain-specific rhetorical devices), its performance may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation improves stance classification performance.
- Mechanism: Augmentation techniques like backtranslation and synonym replacement expand the training data, helping models generalize to diverse linguistic expressions of stance.
- Core assumption: Stance-bearing expressions in tweets vary in wording but maintain consistent underlying semantic stance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The strategic use of data augmentation and ensemble methods further enhanced the models' effectiveness... Augmenting the relatively limited annotated corpus with these techniques appears to be advantageous."
  - [corpus]: The ImageArg corpus is relatively small (1814 train samples), justifying the need for augmentation to improve generalization.
- Break condition: If augmentation introduces synthetic examples that distort the original stance distribution or introduce noise, it may harm rather than help performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to encode and fuse visual and textual information is critical for the two classification tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does CLIP's vision-language encoder differ from separately trained image and text encoders?

- Concept: Data augmentation strategies
  - Why needed here: The dataset is relatively small, so augmentation is a key technique to improve model robustness.
  - Quick check question: What are the risks of using backtranslation for augmenting stance-bearing text?

- Concept: Argument mining fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The tasks involve identifying argumentative stances and persuasiveness, which are core goals of argument mining.
  - Quick check question: How does multimodal argument mining differ from traditional text-only argument mining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> OCR (optional) -> Text encoder (BERT/DeBERTa) + Image encoder (ViT/CLIP) -> Fusion layer -> Classifier
- Critical path: For stance classification: OCR -> Text encoder -> Text features; Image encoder -> Image features; Fusion -> Classifier -> Output. For persuasiveness classification: Image encoder + Text encoder -> CLIP joint encoder -> Classifier -> Output.
- Design tradeoffs: Separate encoders allow task-specific tuning but require explicit fusion; unified encoders (CLIP) are simpler but less flexible. OCR adds preprocessing overhead but may improve stance detection if images contain relevant text.
- Failure signatures: Low performance on tweets with sarcasm or image-dependent arguments suggests the model isn't capturing nuanced cross-modal relationships. Failure to generalize across topics suggests overfitting to training domain.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare CLIP-based unified encoder vs. separate image and text encoders with early/late fusion on Subtask-B.
  2. Test OCR-based text extraction combined with text-only model vs. multimodal model without OCR on Subtask-A.
  3. Evaluate impact of data augmentation (backtranslation, synonym replacement) on stance classification performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How do models perform on multimodal data outside the social media domain, such as academic papers or legal documents?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on social media data (tweets) and does not explore other domains.
  - Why unresolved: The study only examines the ImageArg dataset, which is specific to tweets on controversial topics.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the models on datasets from other domains and comparing performance to the social media results.

- **Open Question 2**: What is the impact of different image augmentation techniques on the performance of multimodal argument mining models?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that none of the teams explored augmentation for the visual modalities in Subtask-B.
  - Why unresolved: The study did not investigate the effects of image augmentation techniques.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various image augmentation methods and analyzing their impact on model performance.

- **Open Question 3**: How do different types of images (e.g., memes, infographics, photographs) affect the persuasiveness of an argument?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not differentiate between image types or their effects on persuasiveness.
  - Why unresolved: The study treats all images equally and does not analyze the influence of image types on persuasiveness.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the performance of models on different image types and identifying any correlations between image type and persuasiveness.

## Limitations

- The dataset size (1814 training samples) remains relatively small for multimodal learning tasks, potentially limiting model generalization
- Limited evaluation to only two controversial topics (gun control and abortion) raises questions about broader applicability
- Top-performing models required significant computational resources (e.g., CLIP, DeBERTa), making them less accessible for resource-constrained applications

## Confidence

- High confidence in the effectiveness of multimodal fusion for stance classification
- Medium confidence in CLIP's superiority for persuasiveness classification
- Medium confidence in data augmentation benefits

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate model performance on additional controversial topics beyond gun control and abortion to assess domain generalization
2. Test model robustness by introducing adversarial examples where image-text alignment is deliberately manipulated
3. Compare computational efficiency vs. performance trade-offs between unified multimodal encoders (CLIP) and separate encoders with fusion strategies
