core_contribution: This paper proposes the Reasoning Game, a cognition-oriented environment
  that encourages agents to reason and communicate high-level rules, rather than perceived
  low-level contexts. To conveniently evaluate the cognitive ability of agents through
  the Reasoning Game, the authors propose an unbiased rule-RAVEN dataset as a benchmark
  and a two-stage curriculum agent training method as a baseline.

# Emergent Communication for Rules Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04474
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Emergent communication system achieves high accuracy on rule reasoning tasks while developing compositional language that generalizes to unseen combinations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Reasoning Game, a cognition-oriented environment where agents must communicate to solve abstract rule reasoning problems. The authors propose a two-stage curriculum training method and an unbiased rule-RAVEN dataset to study emergent communication for high-level rule extraction rather than low-level perceptual features. Experimental results demonstrate that a semantically stable and compositional language emerges, enabling agents to apply extracted rules to novel contexts and transfer between different tasks and attributes.

## Method Summary
The approach involves pre-training a speaker agent on held-out rule sets to develop basic reasoning capabilities, followed by joint training with a listener agent using emergent communication. The speaker maps context panels to messages encoding rule information, while the listener uses these messages along with its own perception to select the correct target panel from candidates. Communication is trained using REINFORCE algorithm due to its discrete nature. The rule-RAVEN dataset ensures unbiased distractor generation through carefully designed distract rules that prevent inference through regular panel relationships alone.

## Key Results
- Two-stage curriculum training prevents communication failures that occur with direct joint training
- Emerged language shows higher topographic similarity (Topsim) between rules and messages than between panels and messages
- Agents successfully generalize to unseen rule combinations and transfer between different context attributes and tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Two-stage curriculum training enables successful emergent communication by pre-training the speaker on held-out rules to acquire basic reasoning capabilities before joint training.
- Mechanism: Stage one pre-trains speaker to map context panels to rule embeddings, developing reasoning ability to handle drifting context. Stage two joint training with listener benefits from stabilized semantic production.
- Core assumption: Speaker acquires sufficient reasoning capability from held-out rules to produce helpful messages during joint training despite different rule combinations.
- Evidence anchors: Section stating joint training from scratch leads to communication failures due to simultaneous drifting of context panels and message semantics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rule-RAVEN dataset design with rule-based candidate panel generation prevents overfitting and forces precise rule communication.
- Mechanism: Distract panels generated with close but incorrect rules prevent listener from inferring target through regular panel relationships, forcing precise speaker-listener communication.
- Core assumption: Distract rules are sufficiently similar to target rules to require precise communication but distinct enough to avoid trivial inference.
- Evidence anchors: Section describing careful distractor generation to represent close but not quite correct rules.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reasoning Game environment focused on high-level rules encourages emergence of semantically stable and compositional language.
- Mechanism: Task requiring reasoning about inter-context high-level rules rather than low-level perceptual features pushes agents to develop language capturing abstract relational patterns.
- Core assumption: Reasoning task inherently requires abstract rule extraction, not solvable by describing low-level features alone.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract stating semantically stable and compositional language emerges, and Topsim results showing higher correlation between rules and messages than panels and messages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning with REINFORCE algorithm
  - Why needed here: Discrete message tokens break end-to-end differentiability, requiring policy gradient method
  - Quick check question: How does REINFORCE estimate gradient of expected reward with respect to policy parameters?

- Concept: Curriculum Learning
  - Why needed here: Two-stage method helps convergence when contexts and semantics drift bilaterally by pre-training on simpler task
  - Quick check question: What intuition underlies curriculum learning in environments with multiple variable drifts?

- Concept: Compositional Language
  - Why needed here: Compositional language crucial for generalization and transferability, allowing combination of learned rules for new descriptions
  - Quick check question: How does Topsim metric measure compositionality of emergent language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Context panels → Speaker's perception and reasoning → Message → Listener's perception and reasoning → Candidate panel selection

- Critical path: Speaker receives context panels, applies perception and reasoning modules, generates message through LSTM encoder; Listener receives same panels, message through LSTM decoder, and reasoning module to select target panel

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Message length vs. vocabulary size: Longer messages convey more information but increase language emergence complexity; larger vocabularies allow precise communication but may slow convergence
  - Rule complexity vs. generalization: More complex rules require sophisticated language but could hinder generalization to unseen combinations

- Failure signatures:
  - Low train accuracy: Agents fail to converge due to insufficient reasoning capability or poor communication
  - High train accuracy but low test accuracy: Overfitting to training data from biased dataset or insufficient regularization
  - Low Topsim between rules and messages: Language fails to capture underlying rules, focusing on low-level perceptual features

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train agents with two-stage curriculum method on rule-RAVEN dataset, measuring train/test accuracy and Topsim
  2. Compare performance of agents trained with vs without two-stage curriculum to demonstrate effectiveness
  3. Evaluate generalization ability on unseen rule combinations and different context attributes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does degree of language compositionality relate to diversity and complexity of reasoning rules in rule-RAVEN dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions emerged language is semantically stable and compositional, discusses generalization abilities
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explicitly explore relationship between compositionality and rule diversity/complexity
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing compositionality under different rule sets using Topsim or other compositionality metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does two-stage curriculum training compare to other strategies in stability and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper introduces two-stage curriculum and states it ensures stable convergence
- Why unresolved: No comparison with other training strategies like joint training from scratch or alternative curriculum approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies between two-stage method and alternatives in convergence speed, stability, and final performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does communication channel capacity affect quality and efficiency of emergent communication?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions channel capacity sufficiency to describe all rule combinations
- Why unresolved: Doesn't explore impact of varying channel capacity on emergent communication process
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with different channel capacities measuring impact on rule extraction accuracy, message compositionality, and overall performance

## Limitations

- Symbolic rather than image-based dataset limits ecological validity for real-world visual reasoning tasks
- Effectiveness of two-stage curriculum depends on similarity between held-out and joint training rule sets, not empirically tested
- Potential subtle biases in distractor generation algorithm could influence language emergence patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Two-stage curriculum training improves convergence vs direct joint training; Topsim results strongly support rule-oriented communication

**Medium Confidence**: Emerged language enables generalization and transfer supported by experimental results but magnitude and hyperparameter dependence need investigation; compositionality claim based on Topsim may be premature

**Low Confidence**: Broader implications for human-like AI through emergent communication are speculative and not directly tested; Raven's Progressive Matrices comparison remains largely metaphorical

## Next Checks

1. Systematically vary similarity between held-out rule sets in stage one and joint training rule sets in stage two to determine minimum threshold for effective curriculum learning

2. Conduct ablation studies varying complexity and similarity of distract rules to quantify impact on language emergence patterns and test for potential biases in current generation algorithm

3. Evaluate emerged communication protocol's effectiveness when transferred to image-based reasoning tasks or different problem domains to assess generalizability beyond symbolic rule-RAVEN environment
