# Open Visual Knowledge Extraction via Relation-Oriented Multimodality Model Prompting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18804
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18804
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces OpenVik, a two-module approach using open relational region detection and format-free visual knowledge generation, outperforming existing methods and improving visual reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OpenVik, a novel approach for open visual knowledge extraction that generates format-free descriptions of relation-oriented regions in images. The method combines an open relational region detector with a format-free visual knowledge generator, leveraging large multimodal models with region-based prompting. The approach significantly outperforms existing methods on knowledge extraction tasks and demonstrates practical utility by improving performance on various visual reasoning benchmarks.

## Method Summary
OpenVik employs a two-module architecture: an open relational region detector and a format-free visual knowledge generator. The detector uses a Faster-RCNN backbone with relation-centric bounding boxes to identify regions containing relational knowledge. The generator uses a ViT-B/16 encoder with BLIP decoder, conditioning on detected regions via mask prompts to produce diverse, format-free descriptions. The method incorporates diversity-driven data enhancement strategies including random dropping and augmentation with external knowledge resources like ConceptNet and COMET.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing methods on visual knowledge extraction benchmarks
- Generated knowledge leads to consistent improvements on visual reasoning tasks
- Demonstrates superior knowledge diversity compared to format-restricted approaches
- Effective on downstream applications including text-to-image retrieval, grounded situation recognition, and visual commonsense reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Region detector leverages object detection pretraining to localize relational entities
- Mechanism: Faster-RCNN backbone pretrained on object detection is finetuned to predict union bounding boxes of subject-object pairs
- Core assumption: Objects in relational interactions often appear near each other spatially
- Evidence anchors: [section] "We change the original object-centric region labels to our newly created relation-centric box labels... The foreground of each relation-centric region label Uj is created by taking the union of the object-level bounding boxes of the entities..."
- Break condition: If objects in a relation are widely separated, union box will be too large and include irrelevant context

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompting large multimodal models with detected regions produces format-free relational knowledge
- Mechanism: Detected region masks are used as visual prompts in a BLIP-based decoder, guiding generation to focus on the relational context
- Core assumption: Large multimodal models have sufficient commonsense knowledge to describe relational scenes when given focused visual input
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a visual knowledge generator that generates format-free knowledge by prompting the large multimodality model with the detected region of interest"
- Break condition: If the detected region is noisy or too broad, the model may generate irrelevant or hallucinated knowledge

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diversity-driven data enhancement mitigates training set bias and improves generation variety
- Mechanism: Two strategies: (1) random dropping removes low-quality, high-frequency relations; (2) augmentation with external knowledge (ConceptNet, COMET) injects novel relations and entities
- Core assumption: The original dataset's long-tail bias toward frequent relations limits the richness of extracted knowledge
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we also explore two data enhancement techniques for diversifying the generated format-free visual knowledge"
- Break condition: If external knowledge is noisy or irrelevant, augmentation may introduce incorrect or off-topic relations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object detection and region proposal networks (RPNs)
  - Why needed here: OpenVik's relational region detector is built on Faster-RCNN's RPN and backbone
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the region proposal network in Faster-RCNN, and how does it differ from the final detection head?

- Concept: Multimodal transformers and visual grounding
  - Why needed here: The knowledge generator uses a ViT-B/16 encoder and a BLIP-based decoder
  - Quick check question: How does the BLIP model use image patches and detected regions to condition language generation?

- Concept: Knowledge graph concepts (entities, relations, triplets)
  - Why needed here: OpenVik's output resembles knowledge graph facts but in free-form text
  - Quick check question: Given a sentence like "the boat is docked at the pier", how would you extract a subject-verb-object triple, and why might this be limiting for richer descriptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Open relational region detector -> Format-free visual knowledge generator
- Critical path: Input image → region detector → N bounding boxes → crop regions → knowledge generator with mask prompt → format-free relational description
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Detector: Using union boxes is simple but imprecise; fine-grained relation detection would require more supervision
  - Generator: Free-form text increases expressiveness but makes evaluation harder; fixed formats are easier to parse but less rich
  - Augmentation: External knowledge adds diversity but risks introducing noise; careful filtering needed
- Failure signatures:
  - Detector: Overlapping or missing boxes → poor region grounding → noisy or incomplete descriptions
  - Generator: Hallucinations or irrelevant details → descriptions not faithful to image
  - Augmentation: Wrong relations/entities added → misleading knowledge
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Train detector from scratch vs. with pretrained backbone; compare region quality and downstream knowledge diversity
  2. Ablation: Generator with vs. without region mask prompt; measure adherence to image content
  3. Ablation: Data enhancement strategies (random dropping, ConceptNet, COMET) individually and combined; measure diversity and freshness of generated knowledge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the open visual knowledge extraction approach generalize to domains beyond the training data distribution?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates on visual reasoning tasks but does not test generalization to new domains
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates on in-distribution data. It's unclear if the approach can handle diverse visual concepts and knowledge not seen during training
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the approach on datasets from new domains, e.g. medical images, satellite imagery, artwork, etc. and measuring performance drop

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the quality of open visual knowledge compare to knowledge extracted by humans?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates knowledge quality metrics but does not compare to human performance
- Why unresolved: It's unclear if the extracted knowledge is on par with human-level understanding or if there are systematic differences in the knowledge produced
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting human evaluations to compare the quality and richness of knowledge extracted by the model vs humans

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the approach be scaled up to extract visual knowledge from massive image datasets like the internet?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a relatively small dataset for training
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the scalability of the approach to very large image datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the approach on large-scale image datasets and measuring the quantity and quality of knowledge extracted

## Limitations
- Detector precision: Using union boxes for relational regions is a strong simplification that may miss relations between distant objects or include irrelevant context
- External knowledge integration: ConceptNet and COMET augmentation may introduce noise or off-topic knowledge without careful filtering
- Evaluation granularity: In-depth quality metrics rely on automatic metrics and crowdsourced scoring with unclear evaluation protocols

## Confidence
- High confidence: The overall two-module architecture (detector + generator) and its integration with existing vision-language models is sound and well-motivated
- Medium confidence: The diversity-driven data enhancement strategies are plausible and grounded in related work, but their exact impact on knowledge quality is unclear
- Low confidence: Claims about "open" relational region detection and the generality of format-free knowledge generation are harder to verify without more qualitative examples or cross-dataset evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Ablation on detector design: Compare the union-box relational detector against a pipeline of object detection + relation scoring (e.g., VRL)
2. Knowledge quality audit: Sample generated descriptions and manually annotate for hallucination, relevance, and faithfulness
3. External knowledge impact: Conduct an ablation of each augmentation source (random dropping, ConceptNet, COMET) and measure their individual and combined effects
