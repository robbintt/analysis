# A Framework for Interpretability in Machine Learning for Medical Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.01685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01685
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Formalizes five core interpretability elements (localization, visual recognizability, physical attribution, transparency, actionability) for MLMI

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for interpretability in machine learning for medical imaging (MLMI) by identifying five core elements essential for real-world deployment. The framework connects these elements to existing interpretability methods and emphasizes the importance of considering intended users like clinicians and researchers. The authors argue that interpretability is crucial for troubleshooting, auditing, continual improvement, fairness, scientific insight, education, and building trust in MLMI models. The paper provides practical guidance for developing and evaluating interpretable MLMI models to improve patient care and advance the field.

## Method Summary
The framework was developed through systematic reasoning about common medical imaging tasks and their real-world goals, distilling these into five core interpretability elements. Rather than starting from existing methods, the authors grounded their approach in concrete clinical use cases and their underlying measurements. They then connected each element to established interpretability techniques from the literature, including radiomics, saliency maps, and case-based methods. The framework emphasizes user-centered design by distinguishing between different stakeholder needs (clinicians vs. researchers vs. model developers).

## Key Results
- Identified five core interpretability elements: localization, visual recognizability, physical attribution, model transparency, and actionability
- Connected framework elements to existing interpretability methods like radiomics, saliency maps, and case-based methods
- Emphasized importance of considering intended users (clinicians, researchers) when developing interpretable MLMI models
- Highlighted potential limitations including human bias induction and possible performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Framework success stems from identifying real-world tasks and distilling them into four core elements rather than starting from existing methods
- Mechanism: Grounding interpretability in concrete medical imaging use cases and their underlying measurements creates a practical foundation connecting directly to clinicians' and researchers' needs
- Core assumption: Medical imaging tasks and real-world goals can be systematically analyzed to reveal fundamental interpretability needs universal across applications
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By reasoning about real-world tasks and goals common in both medical image analysis and its intersection with machine learning, we identify five core elements of interpretability"
  - [section] "From the preceding section, it is apparent that real world models require insights that go beyond a single, aggregated, and quantifiable performance metric"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Framework effectiveness comes from connecting each element to existing interpretability methods, bridging theory and practice
- Mechanism: Mapping established techniques (radiomics, saliency maps, case-based methods) to identified elements provides practical guidance for practitioners
- Core assumption: Existing interpretability methods can be meaningfully categorized according to the four core elements
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In this section, we discuss several popular interpretability methods and describe how they relate to our aforementioned elements"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with FMR scores ranging from 0.0 to 0.63

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Framework value lies in explicitly considering intended users and their specific interpretability needs
- Mechanism: Distinguishing between interpretability needs of different user groups ensures practical relevance and clinical adoption
- Core assumption: Different user groups have distinct interpretability needs that can be systematically identified and addressed
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Interpretability is a subjective enterprise, and often times a useful interpretation is in the eye of the beholder"
  - [section] "Methods most useful to clinicians and researchers will differ greatly from methods most useful to model developers and auditors"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Medical image analysis tasks and their structures
  - Why needed here: Understanding structure of common medical imaging tasks is crucial for identifying types of predictions they produce and interpretability needs they generate
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between pixel-level tasks (like segmentation) and image-level tasks (like classification) in terms of their interpretability needs?

- Concept: Radiomics and feature engineering in medical imaging
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with radiomics workflows is important for understanding how existing interpretability methods connect to framework's elements
  - Quick check question: How do radiomics features typically exhibit localizability, recognizability, physical attribution, and transparency?

- Concept: Saliency maps and visualization techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding saliency maps is essential for grasping how different interpretability methods address localizability and transparency elements
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between CAM-based methods and attention mechanism-based methods for generating saliency maps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task identification and characterization → Element mapping and selection → Method recommendation → User needs assessment → Clinical relevance evaluation

- Critical path: Task identification → Element mapping → Method selection → User needs assessment → Clinical relevance evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Covers wide range of medical imaging tasks but may not delve deeply into task-specific nuances
  - Generality vs. specificity: Elements are general enough to apply across tasks but may not capture all task-specific interpretability needs
  - Clinical relevance vs. technical accuracy: Prioritizes clinical utility, which may sometimes trade off with technical precision

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to map existing methods to framework elements
  - Disconnect between identified elements and actual clinical needs
  - Overemphasis on technical aspects at expense of practical utility
  - Difficulty in adapting framework to new or emerging medical imaging tasks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply framework to specific medical imaging task (e.g., brain tumor segmentation) and document process of identifying elements and mapping methods
  2. Conduct user study with clinicians to evaluate framework's practical utility and identify areas for improvement
  3. Compare framework's method recommendations with current practices in clinical setting to assess effectiveness in guiding method selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective methods for evaluating the practical impact of interpretability in medical imaging models on real-world clinical outcomes and decision-making?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper discusses various goals of interpretability but notes that "often times in real world deployment, we have goals beyond this natural objective" and that interpretability is "principally valuable as an instrument to achieve other end goals"
- Why unresolved: While paper provides framework for understanding interpretability elements, it doesn't specify concrete evaluation metrics or study designs to assess how interpretability features actually affect clinical decision-making and patient outcomes
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical studies comparing decision-making accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and patient outcomes when using interpretable vs. non-interpretable models

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we balance the trade-off between model interpretability and performance in medical imaging applications, particularly when interpretability features may introduce biases or reduce model accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges that "interpretability in MLMI might run counter to the goal of ultimately augmenting the human user's capabilities" and notes that "constraining ML models to be human-understandable may result in models which overlap with or simply recapitulate patterns already identified by humans"
- Why unresolved: Paper identifies this tension but doesn't provide specific guidelines or methodologies for quantifying and optimizing this trade-off in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring performance impact of different interpretability methods across various medical imaging tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective ways to design interpretability features that are both clinically meaningful and technically feasible for different types of medical imaging tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper discusses how "interpretability is a subjective enterprise" and emphasizes importance of "intended users," noting that methods most useful to clinicians and researchers will differ from those useful to model developers
- Why unresolved: While paper identifies different interpretability elements, it doesn't provide specific guidance on how to tailor interpretability features to different medical imaging tasks or user groups
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of interpretability methods across different medical imaging tasks; user studies evaluating clinical utility of different interpretability features

## Limitations

- Framework focuses on conceptual elements rather than providing specific evaluation metrics or validation procedures
- May not fully capture all task-specific interpretability needs across diverse medical imaging applications
- Assumes universal applicability of identified elements across different medical imaging modalities, which may not always hold true

## Confidence

- Confidence in framework's core elements: High
- Confidence in method mappings: Medium
- Confidence in user needs assessment: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Conduct clinical validation study with radiologists and clinicians to assess alignment between framework's elements and their interpretability needs, measuring both usability and clinical impact

2. Systematically map framework's elements to a broader set of interpretability methods in medical imaging to identify any gaps or overlaps in current framework

3. Apply framework to different medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, ultrasound) to evaluate generalizability and identify modality-specific adaptations needed
