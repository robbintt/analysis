# Non Intrusive Intelligibility Predictor for Hearing Impaired Individuals using Self Supervised Speech Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.13423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13423
- Reference count: 0
- Non-intrusive intelligibility predictor using SSSRs achieves competitive performance to baselines on CPC1 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the use of self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) as feature extractors for non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired individuals. SSSRs from HuBERT and XLSR are used to extract intermediate and final layer features from hearing aid output audio. These features are input to a neural network with BLSTM layers and attention pooling to predict intelligibility scores. The proposed method achieves competitive performance to more complex non-intrusive baselines on the Clarity Prediction Challenge 1 dataset, with the HuBERT final layer model performing best. Performance degrades on a more challenging test set with unseen systems and listeners, suggesting overfitting and the need for more diverse training data.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) from HuBERT and XLSR as feature extractors for non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction. The approach extracts intermediate (GFE) and final (GOL) layer outputs from these SSSR models and inputs them to a neural network with BLSTM layers and attention pooling. Both the hearing aid output signal and the hearing loss simulated output are used as inputs to the models. The method is evaluated on the Clarity Prediction Challenge 1 dataset, comparing performance to baseline non-intrusive intelligibility predictors.

## Key Results
- The proposed SSSR-based method achieves competitive performance to more complex non-intrusive baselines on the CPC1 closed and open test sets
- HuBERT final layer features (GOL) outperform other feature extraction methods and the baseline model
- Performance degrades significantly on the open test set with unseen systems and listeners, suggesting overfitting to training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) encode both speech content and noise/distortion information that correlates with intelligibility.
- Mechanism: SSSRs trained to reconstruct masked audio implicitly learn representations capturing both linguistic patterns and acoustic distortions. When used as features for a non-intrusive predictor, these representations provide a rich signal about the quality of the processed audio.
- Core assumption: The self-supervised training objective forces the model to capture both linguistic and acoustic information in its representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent work [12–16] has found that in addition to speech content, SSSRs are also able to capture information on potentially corrupting noise and distortion in the input audio."
  - [section 3] "findings in [12] suggest that the output of the initial encoding stage GFE better captures quality-related information."
- Break condition: If the SSSR training data doesn't contain diverse enough noise/distortion patterns, the representations may not capture distortions relevant to hearing-impaired listeners.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using both intermediate (GFE) and final (GOL) layer representations from SSSRs can improve intelligibility prediction by capturing different aspects of the signal.
- Mechanism: The intermediate layer (GFE) captures low-level acoustic features and distortions, while the final layer (GOL) captures higher-level linguistic context. Using both provides complementary information to the prediction network.
- Core assumption: Different layers of SSSRs capture different types of information relevant to intelligibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "However, findings in [12] suggest that the output of the initial encoding stage GFE better captures quality-related information."
  - [section 6.2] "Five feature extraction methods are used; outputs of GFE and GOL for both, HuBERT and XLSR representations, as well as a spectrogram representation denoted as SPEC."
- Break condition: If the prediction network cannot effectively fuse information from multiple representation types, performance may not improve over using a single layer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Processing both hearing aid output and hearing loss simulated audio through SSSRs improves generalization by providing different views of the signal.
- Mechanism: The hearing aid output (ˆs[n]) contains the enhancement artifacts, while the hearing loss simulated output (ˆs′[n]) contains both enhancement artifacts and the simulated hearing loss effects. Using both provides complementary information about the intelligibility of the signal for hearing-impaired listeners.
- Core assumption: The hearing loss simulation captures relevant aspects of the hearing-impaired listening experience.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "Following the findings from Table 1, both the hearing aid output signal ˆ s[n] and that signal processed by the hearing loss simulation ˆ s′[n] are used as the input audio to the models, as no conclusive best representation is indicated by these results."
- Break condition: If the hearing loss simulation doesn't accurately model the specific hearing impairments in the test set, this dual-input approach may not provide benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning in speech
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SSSRs are trained and what information they capture is crucial for knowing why they might be useful for intelligibility prediction.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the training objectives of HuBERT and XLSR?

- Concept: Non-intrusive vs intrusive speech intelligibility metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper compares non-intrusive methods (which don't require clean reference signals) to intrusive baselines, so understanding this distinction is important.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of non-intrusive intelligibility prediction for hearing aid development?

- Concept: Hearing loss simulation and audiogram representation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses hearing loss simulation to encode listener-specific hearing characteristics, so understanding this process is important for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How does the hearing loss simulator in the Clarity dataset modify the audio signal based on the audiogram?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input audio (ˆs[n] or ˆs′[n]) -> SSSR feature extraction (GFE or GOL) -> BLSTM layers -> Attention pooling -> Output (predicted intelligibility)
- Critical path: Feature extraction -> BLSTM processing -> Attention pooling -> Output
- Design tradeoffs: Using SSSR features vs spectrograms (more complex but potentially more informative), using single vs multiple SSSR layers (more parameters but potentially more information), using single vs dual audio inputs (more data but potentially better coverage)
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to training systems/listeners (poor performance on open set), inability to generalize across different types of distortions, sensitivity to specific hearing aid algorithms
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of HuBERT vs XLSR for intelligibility prediction
  2. Compare performance using GFE vs GOL layers for each SSSR model
  3. Compare performance using ˆs[n] vs ˆs′[n] as input to determine if hearing loss simulation improves results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) be effectively used for non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired individuals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the use of SSSRs as feature extractors for non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that SSSRs can be used as feature extractors and achieve competitive performance, it does not fully explain why and how quality-related information is encoded well in such representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis of the relationship between SSSRs and intelligibility scores, and exploration of different SSSR architectures and training strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can non-intrusive intelligibility prediction models be improved to generalize to unseen systems and listeners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed models tend to overfit to specific hearing aid systems and listeners, and suggests that larger datasets could help mitigate this issue.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive solution to improve generalization to unseen systems and listeners.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with larger and more diverse datasets, and exploration of regularization techniques or transfer learning approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed SSSR-based intelligibility prediction models be extended to handle more complex listening scenarios, such as multi-talker conversations or dynamic noise environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on single-talker speech in noise, and does not address more complex listening scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The proposed models are designed for a specific task and may not generalize well to more complex scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with more complex listening scenarios, and exploration of model architectures and training strategies that can handle such scenarios.

## Limitations

- The proposed approach shows overfitting on the open test set, suggesting limited generalization to unseen hearing aid systems and listeners.
- The specific hearing loss simulation process that creates the hearing loss simulated audio (ˆs′[n]) is not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess whether this step accurately captures the listening experience of hearing-impaired individuals.
- Performance comparison is limited to the CPC1 dataset, and the approach has not been validated on alternative datasets or with different types of speech distortions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The mechanism by which SSSRs capture both speech content and distortion information is well-supported by prior research and the authors' empirical findings.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that using both intermediate and final layer representations improves performance is supported by experimental results, but the benefit is not conclusive across all test conditions.
- **Low confidence:** The generalization of the model to unseen systems and listeners is questionable given the significant performance drop on the open test set.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate on additional datasets: Test the model on different speech intelligibility datasets with diverse hearing aid systems and listener profiles to assess generalization.
2. Analyze feature importance: Conduct ablation studies to determine which layers and input channels (ˆs[n] vs ˆs′[n]) contribute most to performance, and whether the attention mechanism is effectively fusing information.
3. Investigate overfitting: Examine model training curves, validation metrics, and perform cross-validation to better understand the source of overfitting and potential mitigation strategies (e.g., data augmentation, regularization).
