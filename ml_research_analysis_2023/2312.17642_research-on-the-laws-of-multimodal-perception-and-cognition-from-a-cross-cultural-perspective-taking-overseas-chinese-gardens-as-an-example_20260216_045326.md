# Research on the Laws of Multimodal Perception and Cognition from a Cross-cultural Perspective -- Taking Overseas Chinese Gardens as an Example

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.17642
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17642

- Primary result: Deep learning analysis of social media data reveals that overseas tourists' aesthetic preferences for Chinese gardens align with traditional design principles, with high value placed on architectural elements.

## Executive Summary
This study explores the relationship between perception and cognition in multimodal data analysis, focusing on spatial experience design in overseas Chinese gardens. Leveraging deep learning techniques, it analyzes textual and visual data from social media to uncover the relationship between people's perceptions and sentiment cognition within the context of overseas Chinese gardens. The study introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) alongside AI agents, which explore aesthetic cognition through chat scene simulation combined with web search. Results reveal that the aesthetic preferences of overseas tourists for Chinese gardens conform to general design principles, with a high value placed on architectural elements. The study provides new perspectives for understanding aesthetic experience and its impact on architecture and landscape design across diverse cultural contexts.

## Method Summary
The study collects multimodal data (text, images, metadata) from social media platforms (Flickr, Twitter, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Reddit) covering overseas Chinese gardens (2016-2023). Image segmentation is performed using FCN on ADE_20K to extract scene elements (buildings, plants, water), while sentiment analysis is conducted using ALBERT trained on TripAdvisor text with star ratings. A multi-agent system (MAS) with AI agents explores aesthetic cognition through simulated discussions and web searches. The analysis correlates scene element proportions with sentiment distributions to identify aesthetic preferences and their alignment with traditional design principles.

## Key Results
- Aesthetic preferences of overseas tourists for Chinese gardens conform to general design principles, with high value placed on architectural elements.
- Sentiment distributions peak when plant-to-building ratios approach 2:1, reflecting the "three parts water, two parts bamboo, one part house" principle.
- MAS agents successfully integrate multimodal data with external web knowledge to generate actionable aesthetic insights.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal deep learning can map visual scene features directly to sentiment scores without requiring manual translation into discrete emotion categories.
- Mechanism: The study trains an ALBERT-based sentiment model on Tripadvisor text paired with star ratings, then uses semantic segmentation (FCN) to extract scene elements from images. This enables direct regression from visual feature vectors to sentiment scores, preserving fine-grained emotional variation.
- Core assumption: Sentiment in user-generated content is reliably encoded in star ratings and can be predicted by deep neural networks trained on large-scale text data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Leveraging deep learning techniques, we analyze textual and visual data from social media, thereby unveiling the relationship between people's perceptions and sentiment cognition within the context of overseas Chinese gardens."
  - [section]: "Using the 54,086 image-free text data in the Tripadviser dataset, combined with its star ratings, we train an ALBERT deep learning model to recognize the sentiment polarity of the text."
  - [corpus]: Weak—no corpus paper directly discusses ALBERT for multimodal sentiment; this is an original methodological choice.
- Break condition: If star ratings do not correlate strongly with textual sentiment, the sentiment prediction model will fail to capture genuine user emotions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AI agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) can simulate cultural discourse and explore aesthetic cognitive patterns by integrating external data sources with model-generated insights.
- Mechanism: Agents access the processed image segmentation maps and sentiment scores as an "external knowledge base" and engage in simulated discussions, performing web searches to deepen their understanding of aesthetic rules. The MAS structure enables parallel exploration of different perceptual dimensions.
- Core assumption: Agents equipped with LLM reasoning can meaningfully combine structured data (segmentation, sentiment) with open-ended web information to produce actionable aesthetic insights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our study introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) alongside AI agents. Each agent explores the laws of aesthetic cognition through chat scene simulation combined with web search."
  - [section]: "In this study, we established a discussion community based on the MAS, a community in which individual agents conducted web searches through chatting combined with networking to explore the scientific law of aesthetic perception of overseas Chinese gardens."
  - [corpus]: Weak—no corpus paper describes a MAS for aesthetic cognition; closest is "The MuSe 2024 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge," which focuses on social perception, not cultural aesthetic law discovery.
- Break condition: If agents cannot integrate external web knowledge coherently, the simulated discussions will produce low-quality or inconsistent aesthetic insights.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-cultural differences in aesthetic perception can be quantified by correlating scene element proportions (e.g., building vs. plant ratios) with sentiment distributions, revealing whether foreign tourists' preferences align with traditional design principles.
- Mechanism: The study calculates the ratio of segmented plants to buildings in each image, then plots sentiment score distributions for each ratio. Peaks in sentiment at certain ratios suggest alignment with established aesthetic rules (e.g., "three parts water, two parts bamboo, one part house").
- Core assumption: Ratios of scene elements are stable indicators of aesthetic composition that correlate with viewer sentiment across cultural groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results reveal that the aesthetic preferences of overseas tourists for Chinese gardens conform to general design principles, with a high value placed on architectural elements."
  - [section]: "From the distribution of emotions, it can be seen that when the proportion of plants to buildings is close to 2:1, the distribution of emotions is concentrated in the positive range (greater than 0.6), which to some extent reflects the theory of 'three parts of water, two parts bamboo, and one part of the house' described by Li Gefei."
  - [corpus]: Weak—no corpus paper quantifies cross-cultural aesthetic rule adherence via element ratios; this is an original empirical approach.
- Break condition: If element segmentation fails to accurately capture culturally relevant features, ratio-based sentiment analysis will not reflect true aesthetic preferences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic segmentation of urban images using deep learning models (e.g., FCN on ADE_20K).
  - Why needed here: To extract discrete scene elements (buildings, plants, water) from user-submitted garden photos so their proportions can be quantified and correlated with sentiment.
  - Quick check question: What output format does a semantic segmentation model produce for each pixel in an input image?
- Concept: Sentiment analysis with transformer-based language models (e.g., ALBERT) trained on review data with star ratings.
  - Why needed here: To predict fine-grained sentiment scores from textual comments without relying on fixed sentiment lexicons, enabling regression-based analysis.
  - Quick check question: How does ALBERT's parameter-sharing mechanism improve efficiency compared to BERT for large-scale sentiment prediction tasks?
- Concept: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and AI agents with LLM reasoning capabilities.
  - Why needed here: To simulate cultural discourse and integrate multimodal data with external knowledge sources for exploring aesthetic cognitive laws.
  - Quick check question: In a MAS, what is the difference between agent autonomy and centralized control, and why is autonomy important for this aesthetic cognition exploration task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Social media data (Flickr, Twitter, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Reddit) -> Image segmentation (FCN + ADE_20K) -> Element extraction and proportions -> Text sentiment analysis (ALBERT + TripAdvisor) -> MAS agent discussions + web search -> Aesthetic cognition insights
- Critical path: Social media data -> segmentation -> sentiment scoring -> MAS agent discussion -> insight extraction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using FCN (fixed architecture) vs. newer transformer-based segmentation models: FCN is stable and interpretable; newer models may yield better accuracy but require more compute and tuning.
  - Training ALBERT on TripAdvisor data vs. fine-tuning on domain-specific garden reviews: TripAdvisor provides scale and star ratings; domain-specific data may better capture garden-specific sentiment nuances.
  - MAS with fixed LLM vs. online LLM APIs: Fixed model ensures reproducibility; APIs provide cutting-edge reasoning but introduce cost and variability.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low sentiment prediction accuracy -> misaligned or insufficient training data; check correlation between star ratings and textual sentiment.
  - Segmentation errors (e.g., buildings classified as plants) -> model not well-adapted to garden scenes; validate with a held-out annotated subset.
  - MAS agents producing incoherent discussions -> LLM reasoning or external search integration failing; monitor agent outputs for logical consistency.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train ALBERT sentiment model on 10k TripAdvisor posts, evaluate on held-out set, verify >0.75 Pearson correlation with star ratings.
  2. Run semantic segmentation on 1k garden images, manually annotate 100 for accuracy, ensure mIoU >0.65 for building/plant/water classes.
  3. Deploy 2 MAS agents with a small LLM, give them 50 processed image-sentiment pairs, observe whether they can generate at least 3 distinct, coherent design insights.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential to apply this research framework to a broader range of research areas and provides new tools for understanding and addressing complex audience perception challenges.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses specifically on overseas Chinese gardens, and while the methodology shows promise, its applicability to other cultural landscapes has not been tested or validated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the methodology to analyze perceptions of other cultural landscapes (e.g., Japanese gardens, Mediterranean landscapes) and comparing the results to identify patterns and differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the AI agents and multi-agent system be further developed to enhance the analysis of complex aesthetic cognition patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the potential of AI agents and MAS to enhance the depth and breadth of data analysis and provide a more dynamic and interactive environment for studying aesthetic cognition.
- Why unresolved: The study provides a proof-of-concept for using AI agents and MAS, but their full potential in analyzing complex aesthetic cognition patterns remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing more sophisticated AI agents with advanced natural language processing capabilities and incorporating additional data sources (e.g., video, audio) to capture a wider range of perceptual and cognitive dimensions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the findings of this study be translated into practical design guidelines for creating culturally sensitive and engaging landscape spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the implications of the findings for architectural and landscape design practice, emphasizing the need to integrate cultural connotations and consider the preferences of visitors from different cultural backgrounds.
- Why unresolved: While the study provides insights into audience perceptions, translating these insights into specific design guidelines requires further research and collaboration between researchers, designers, and cultural experts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a set of design principles based on the study's findings and testing their effectiveness in creating culturally sensitive and engaging landscape spaces through real-world design projects.

## Limitations
- Social media data may overrepresent certain tourist demographics and underrepresent others, leading to potential bias in aesthetic preference analysis.
- The MAS framework's effectiveness depends on agents' ability to integrate external web knowledge coherently, which is not fully validated.
- The study's reliance on correlation between scene element ratios and sentiment scores assumes visual composition directly drives emotional response, without controlling for confounding factors.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The use of deep learning models (FCN, ALBERT) for segmentation and sentiment analysis, as these are well-established techniques with documented success.
- Medium confidence: The MAS agent framework's ability to generate meaningful aesthetic insights, as it is an innovative approach but lacks extensive validation in the literature.
- Low confidence: The generalizability of findings to broader cultural contexts, as the study focuses specifically on overseas Chinese gardens and may not capture the full diversity of aesthetic preferences.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a survey of tourists from diverse cultural backgrounds to validate the sentiment distributions and element ratios identified by the MAS agents.
2. Perform a robustness analysis by varying the segmentation model (e.g., using a transformer-based model) and re-evaluating the correlation between scene elements and sentiment scores.
3. Extend the MAS framework to include domain experts in landscape architecture and cross-cultural design to assess the practical applicability of the insights generated by the agents.
