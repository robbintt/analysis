# Explainable Topic-Enhanced Argument Mining from Heterogeneous Sources

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.12131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12131
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Novel topic-enhanced argument mining model that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both in-target and cross-target settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of information-seeking argument mining from heterogeneous sources by proposing a novel topic-enhanced model. The key insight is that target phrases alone are insufficient for capturing the diverse subtopics relevant to identifying argumentative stance. The proposed approach uses a neural topic model to extract explainable topics related to each target, then incorporates these topics into the argument representation through mutual learning between the topic and semantic representations.

## Method Summary
The model combines a neural topic model (NTM) with a language model (XLNet) through mutual learning. The NTM extracts sentence-level topic distributions and global topic-word distributions, from which explainable topics are selected for each target. These topics are concatenated with the target and input to the XLNet model for argument encoding. The mutual learning objective aligns the latent topic distribution from NTM with the semantic representation from XLNet, encouraging coherence between topical and argumentative structure. The model is trained jointly with cross-entropy loss for classification and mutual learning loss for topic-semantic alignment.

## Key Results
- TEAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both in-target and cross-target settings on the UKP ArgMin dataset
- Ablation studies show that removing topic extraction or mutual learning degrades performance
- Cross-target evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to unseen targets
- Visualization shows support/oppose arguments have more peaked topic distributions than non-argumentative sentences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Topic-enhanced representations improve argument mining by capturing target-relevant subtopics beyond the original target phrase
- **Mechanism**: The model extracts explainable topics from a neural topic model's global topic-word distribution, filtering out target words and selecting high-probability terms that represent subtopics. These topics augment the target representation during argument encoding
- **Core assumption**: Target-related subtopics contain information more relevant to identifying argumentative stance than target synonyms or lexical variations
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "a target is represented by a word or a phrase, which is insufficient to cover a diverse set of target-related subtopics"
  - [section 3.2] "expressions in subtopics can be used to improve the representation of an argument"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence showing subtopics improve classification over synonyms
- **Break condition**: If the extracted topics do not align with actual argumentative subtopics, the augmentation could introduce noise and harm performance

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Sentence-level topic distributions help distinguish argumentative from non-argumentative sentences by revealing the presence of reasoning
- **Mechanism**: Mutual learning minimizes the distance between the latent topic distribution (from NTM) and the semantic representation (from language model), forcing the model to align topical coherence with argumentative structure
- **Core assumption**: Argumentative sentences exhibit peaked topic distributions focused on target-relevant subtopics, while non-argumentative sentences have more diffuse topic distributions
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "the sentence-level topic information within an argument, which we believe is crucial for argument mining, is ignored"
  - [section 3.4] "support or oppose arguments are associated with more topics than none argument"
  - [section 5.3] Visualization shows support/oppose arguments have peaked topic distributions while none arguments do not
- **Break condition**: If topic distributions do not correlate with argumentative content, mutual learning could mislead the model

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Mutual learning between neural topic model and language model produces more coherent topics that benefit argument mining
- **Mechanism**: The semantic representation from the language model guides the NTM to generate topics that better capture argumentative structure, while the topic distribution guides the language model to focus on relevant topical information
- **Core assumption**: Semantic information from the language model can improve topic coherence and vice versa through bidirectional guidance
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.4] "the semantic representation information obtained from the language model could also be used to guide the generation of the latent topic distribution in the neural topic model with mutual learning"
  - [section 5.3] "TEAM without mutual learning leads to a slight decrease of the coherence scores"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence comparing topic coherence with/without mutual learning on argument mining performance
- **Break condition**: If the mutual learning objective dominates training, it could distort both topic and semantic representations

## Foundational Learning

- **Neural Topic Models**
  - Why needed here: To extract interpretable topic distributions that capture target-relevant subtopics for argument augmentation
  - Quick check question: What distribution does the neural topic model output for each sentence, and how is it used in the argument representation?

- **Variational Autoencoders**
  - Why needed here: The neural topic model is built on VAE framework to learn latent topic distributions through probabilistic inference
  - Quick check question: How does the reparameterization trick in the inference network enable gradient-based training of the topic model?

- **Mutual Learning**
  - Why needed here: To align the topic distribution from NTM with the semantic representation from the language model, capturing sentence-level topical information
  - Quick check question: What similarity metric is used between the topic distribution and semantic representation, and why is it chosen?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Neural Topic Model → Topic Extraction → XLNet Language Model → Mutual Learning → MLP Classifier

- **Critical path**: NTM generates latent topic distributions and global topic-word distributions → Explainable topics are extracted and filtered → XLNet encodes argument with target and extracted topics → Mutual learning aligns topic and semantic representations → MLP classifier predicts argument label

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Using XLNet instead of BERT provides better contextualization but may be slower
  - Mutual learning adds complexity but improves topic coherence and argument identification
  - Topic number K=10 balances granularity with computational efficiency

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor topic coherence → check NTM training and mutual learning effectiveness
  - Model ignores topic information → verify topic filtering and concatenation in input
  - Overfitting on in-target setting → validate with cross-target experiments

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation study removing topic extraction to measure performance drop
  2. Vary topic number K to find optimal balance between granularity and performance
  3. Cross-target evaluation to assess generalization to unseen targets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the TEAM model vary with different neural topic model architectures, such as different inference networks or prior distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a specific neural topic model (NTM) architecture based on variational autoencoder, but does not explore alternative architectures or compare performance
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates one NTM architecture, so it is unclear if other architectures could lead to better topic quality and downstream argument mining performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing TEAM with different NTM architectures (e.g. different inference networks, priors) and evaluating their impact on topic coherence and argument mining performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of TEAM compare to argument mining models that use other forms of external knowledge, such as structured knowledge bases or pre-trained language models with knowledge injection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on incorporating topic information from NTM, but does not compare to models using other external knowledge sources
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates TEAM against models using lexicon information or large language models without explicit knowledge injection, so it is unclear how topic information compares to other forms of external knowledge
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing TEAM to argument mining models that use structured knowledge bases or pre-trained language models with knowledge injection, evaluating their relative performance on argument identification and topic extraction

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of TEAM vary with the choice of topic coherence metrics and the number of topic words used for evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates topic coherence using NPMI, Cv, and Cp metrics with different numbers of topic words (5, 10, 15, 20), but does not explore the impact of different coherence metrics or numbers of topic words
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates a limited set of coherence metrics and numbers of topic words, so it is unclear if other choices could lead to different conclusions about topic quality
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating TEAM's topic coherence using different coherence metrics (e.g. UCI, UMass) and varying the number of topic words used for evaluation, comparing the results and their impact on downstream argument mining performance

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a single dataset (UKP ArgMin) without testing on additional domains or languages
- Mutual learning component lacks sufficient empirical validation linking topic coherence to argument mining performance
- Computational efficiency is not addressed despite the complexity of multiple neural components

## Confidence
- **Topic-enhanced representations improve argument mining** (High): Strong experimental evidence from in-target and cross-target settings shows consistent performance gains over baselines
- **Mutual learning improves topic coherence and argument identification** (Medium): Topic coherence scores show improvement, but lacks direct ablation studies showing performance degradation when removing mutual learning
- **Explainable topics capture target-relevant subtopics** (Medium): The topic extraction methodology is sound, but lacks qualitative analysis showing alignment with human interpretations

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on mutual learning**: Remove the mutual learning component and retrain the model to measure its specific contribution to argument mining performance
2. **Cross-domain evaluation**: Test the model on a different argument mining dataset to assess generalizability beyond the UKP ArgMin corpus
3. **Human evaluation of extracted topics**: Conduct a user study where human annotators judge whether the extracted topics are relevant to the target and capture meaningful argumentative subtopics
