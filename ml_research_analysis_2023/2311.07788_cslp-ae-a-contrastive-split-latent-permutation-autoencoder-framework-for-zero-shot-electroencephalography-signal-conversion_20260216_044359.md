# CSLP-AE: A Contrastive Split-Latent Permutation Autoencoder Framework for Zero-Shot Electroencephalography Signal Conversion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07788
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07788
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel contrastive split-latent permutation autoencoder achieves 80.32% subject classification and 48.48% task classification accuracy on EEG signals

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CSLP-AE, a novel framework for zero-shot EEG signal conversion that separates subject (style) and task (content) representations using a split-latent architecture combined with latent permutation and contrastive learning. The model enables direct conversion between unseen subjects and tasks by swapping corresponding latent codes, achieving superior performance compared to conventional autoencoders and contrastive learning baselines. Experiments on the ERP Core dataset demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately reconstruct neural responses for unseen subject-task combinations while providing interpretable content and style components.

## Method Summary
The CSLP-AE framework uses a CNN-based encoder to map EEG signals into two separate latent spaces representing subject and task information, with a decoder reconstructing the original signal. The model is trained using three losses: reconstruction loss for signal fidelity, contrastive learning loss for promoting disentanglement in each latent space, and latent permutation loss for encouraging structural encoding. The permutation loss works by swapping latents between pairs of samples and reconstructing, forcing the decoder to learn invariant structural information. This architecture enables zero-shot conversion by encoding an unseen subject-task pair and swapping their respective latents.

## Key Results
- Achieves 80.32% subject classification accuracy and 48.48% task classification accuracy on ERP Core dataset
- Demonstrates 51.7% lower ERP conversion MSE compared to baseline models for cross-subject and cross-task conversions
- Outperforms conventional autoencoders, contrastive autoencoders, and other self-supervised learning approaches in both classification and conversion tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The split-latent permutation loss enables zero-shot EEG conversion by learning a permutation-invariant structural encoding of the signal in both latent spaces.
- **Mechanism**: During training, the model encodes pairs of samples with either the same subject or the same task. It then swaps the corresponding latents between the pairs and reconstructs the inputs. This forces the decoder to learn to extract structural information that is invariant to the permutation, allowing it to rely on this information during conversion.
- **Core assumption**: The structural information of the EEG signal is highly correlated with both subject and task content.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The latent representations are guided using contrastive learning to promote the latent splits to explicitly represent subject (style) and task (content)."
  - [section]: "When the stand-alone latent-permutation method is used (SLP-AE), the decoder is allowed a reliability in the latent spaces... This might be a powerful tool since it further constricts the bottleneck in the auto-encoder sense, although at the cost of suboptimally encoding identical latent spaces."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of permutation-invariant encoding or its role in zero-shot conversion.
- **Break condition**: If the structural information is not highly correlated with subject and task content, the learned latent spaces will not be useful for conversion.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Contrastive learning in the split-latent spaces promotes disentanglement of subject and task content.
- **Mechanism**: By maximizing the similarity between positive pairs (samples with the same subject or task) and minimizing it between negative pairs (samples with different subjects or tasks) in each latent space, the model learns to encode subject and task information separately.
- **Core assumption**: The subject and task information can be effectively disentangled using contrastive learning in the latent space.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Importantly, the latent representations are guided using contrastive learning to promote the latent splits to explicitly represent subject (style) and task (content)."
  - [section]: "Contrastive learning in the latent space itself has nothing to do with decoding the structure of the data for reconstruction... When we add the latent-permutation loss back to the model, we see that the structural encoding property occurs again in the SQLP-AE model, while the CSQLP-AE model does not have this property due to the contrastive loss used in specializing the latent space."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of contrastive learning for disentanglement in EEG signals.
- **Break condition**: If the subject and task information cannot be effectively disentangled using contrastive learning, the learned latent spaces will not be useful for conversion.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The combination of split-latent permutation and contrastive learning enables both structural encoding and disentanglement, leading to superior conversion performance.
- **Mechanism**: The split-latent permutation loss forces the model to learn a permutation-invariant structural encoding, while the contrastive learning loss promotes disentanglement of subject and task content. The combination of these losses allows the model to learn latent spaces that are both disentangled and contain useful structural information for conversion.
- **Core assumption**: The combination of split-latent permutation and contrastive learning is more effective than either loss alone for EEG conversion.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "We contrast CSLP-AE to conventional supervised, unsupervised (AE), and self-supervised (contrastive learning) training and find that the proposed approach provides favorable generalizable characterizations of subject and task."
  - [section]: "The CSLP-AE model is able to keep the latent spaces disentangled while also providing the structural encoding information required for the conversion method to work... We propose the latent-permutation method as a replacement for the standard auto-encoder reconstruction loss to be used in conjunction with contrastive learning."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct comparison of the combination of split-latent permutation and contrastive learning to other methods for EEG conversion.
- **Break condition**: If the combination of split-latent permutation and contrastive learning does not lead to better conversion performance than either loss alone, the proposed approach may not be effective.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Permutation-invariant encoding
  - Why needed here: The split-latent permutation loss forces the model to learn a permutation-invariant encoding of the signal in both latent spaces, which is crucial for zero-shot conversion.
  - Quick check question: What is the main purpose of the split-latent permutation loss in the proposed framework?

- **Concept**: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Contrastive learning is used to promote disentanglement of subject and task content in the split-latent spaces, which is necessary for effective conversion.
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning contribute to the disentanglement of subject and task information in the proposed framework?

- **Concept**: Split-latent architecture
  - Why needed here: The split-latent architecture explicitly divides the latent space into subject and task representations, which is the foundation for the proposed conversion method.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using a split-latent architecture for EEG conversion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input EEG -> CNN Encoder -> Split-latent space (subject + task) -> Decoder -> Reconstructed EEG
- **Critical path**: Encoder -> Split-latent space -> Decoder -> Loss functions -> Classifier
  - The critical path is the flow of information from input to output, including the loss functions and classifier evaluation.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Capacity of latent spaces: Balancing between having enough capacity to encode relevant information and preventing the model from simply duplicating information in both latent spaces.
  - Choice of loss functions: Selecting appropriate loss functions (split-latent permutation and contrastive learning) to achieve the desired properties (structural encoding and disentanglement).
  - Model complexity: Balancing between model complexity and the risk of overfitting, especially with limited EEG data.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor conversion performance: If the learned latent spaces do not contain useful information for conversion, the model will not be able to accurately convert EEG signals between subjects and tasks.
  - Lack of disentanglement: If the subject and task information is not effectively disentangled in the latent spaces, the model will not be able to perform targeted conversions.
  - Overfitting: If the model is too complex or the training data is limited, the model may overfit to the training data and not generalize well to unseen subjects and tasks.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train CSLP-AE on a small subset of the ERP Core dataset and evaluate conversion performance on a held-out test set.
  2. Compare CSLP-AE to a baseline autoencoder model (without split-latent permutation or contrastive learning) on the same task.
  3. Analyze the learned latent representations using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) to assess disentanglement and identify potential issues.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed CSLP-AE framework generalize to other biological signals beyond EEG, such as MEG or fMRI?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "While the present work only considers conversion of EEG, the proposed CSLP-AE provides a general framework for signal conversion and extraction of content (task activation) and style (subject variability) components of general interest for the modeling and analysis of biological signals."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluate on EEG data from the ERP Core dataset and two additional EEG datasets (EEGMMI and SleepEDFx). No results are provided for other biological signals like MEG or fMRI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying CSLP-AE to MEG or fMRI datasets, comparing performance to baselines and showing successful conversion between subjects and tasks for those modalities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of CSLP-AE scale with the number of subjects and tasks in the dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The ERP Core dataset used has 40 subjects and 6 tasks. The authors mention the potential for future data from other laboratories. However, they do not explore how performance changes with varying numbers of subjects and tasks.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluate on one fixed dataset size. The authors do not provide analysis of how CSLP-AE performance would change if the number of subjects or tasks were significantly increased or decreased.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training and evaluating CSLP-AE on datasets with different numbers of subjects and tasks, measuring classification accuracy and conversion MSE across these different dataset sizes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can CSLP-AE successfully perform zero-shot conversion for entirely unseen tasks, or only for tasks seen during training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors state that "The tasks used in the experiments are all seen during training. This limits the scope of the results to the seen tasks and no conclusions can be drawn about the generalization of the model to unseen tasks."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluate on tasks that were present in the training data. The authors explicitly note that they cannot draw conclusions about performance on entirely new, unseen tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating CSLP-AE on a dataset with tasks that were not present during training, measuring classification accuracy and conversion performance for these truly unseen tasks.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability beyond ERP responses, as experiments only use ERP Core dataset with specific experimental conditions
- Architectural complexity makes it difficult to isolate which component (split-latent, permutation, or contrastive) drives the improvements
- Only one additional baseline dataset (EEGMMI) used for validation, limiting confidence in cross-dataset performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework's core concept of split-latent representation learning for EEG conversion is well-supported by experimental results on ERP Core dataset
- **Medium confidence**: The zero-shot conversion capability is demonstrated but limited to the ERP Core dataset, requiring validation on more diverse EEG datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority over baseline models is demonstrated, though the baselines may not represent state-of-the-art EEG processing methods

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test CSLP-AE on additional EEG datasets (e.g., motor imagery, sleep staging) to verify generalizability beyond ERP responses
2. **Ablation study**: Systematically remove split-latent permutation or contrastive learning components to quantify their individual contributions to conversion performance
3. **Baseline comparison**: Compare against modern self-supervised learning approaches (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL) adapted for EEG to establish competitive positioning
