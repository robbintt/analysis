# Towards Generalized Multi-stage Clustering: Multi-view Self-distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18890
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 7.6% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes DistilMVC, a multi-view clustering method that addresses the overconfidence problem in pseudo-labels through self-distillation. The method uses a teacher-student network architecture to convert pseudo-labels into dark knowledge, providing richer semantic information for clustering. By maximizing mutual information across different hierarchical levels and incorporating entropy regularization, DistilMVC achieves significant improvements on eight multi-view datasets compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
DistilMVC is a multi-stage deep multi-view clustering framework that combines autoencoders, contrastive learning, and knowledge distillation. The method first pre-trains autoencoders to reconstruct each view while learning mutual information across views. During fine-tuning, a student network learns from both the teacher network and self-distillation signals, where the teacher generates pseudo-labels converted into dark knowledge through temperature scaling. The student network maximizes mutual information at different hierarchical levels while the teacher is updated via momentum averaging of student parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 7.6% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art methods
- Outperforms existing multi-view clustering approaches on all eight tested datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness of self-distillation in reducing pseudo-label overconfidence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
DistilMVC reduces overconfidence in pseudo-labels by converting them into dark knowledge through knowledge distillation. The teacher network generates high-dimensional features that are linearly separable and can be clustered into pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels are converted into dark knowledge by applying softmax with temperature scaling. The KL divergence between the student network's output and the dark knowledge provides a smoother supervision signal that contains richer semantic information than raw pseudo-labels.

### Mechanism 2
DistilMVC learns common semantics across views by maximizing mutual information at different hierarchical levels. The student and teacher networks project low-dimensional representations into high-dimensional subspaces where contrastive learning is applied. This maximizes the lower bound of mutual information between views. Additionally, invariant information clustering (IIC) directly maximizes mutual information in the low-dimensional latent space.

### Mechanism 3
DistilMVC prevents model collapse through entropy regularization and momentum-based teacher network updates. An entropy balance term is added to the student contrastive loss to avoid trivial solutions where all samples are clustered into the same class. The teacher network parameters are updated using exponential moving average of the student network parameters, which provides stable supervision and prevents the teacher from becoming too weak.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Distillation**: DistilMVC uses teacher-student network architecture to transfer knowledge from high-dimensional features to low-dimensional representations through dark knowledge.
  - Why needed: To convert overconfident pseudo-labels into richer semantic information for better clustering guidance
  - Quick check: What is the difference between pseudo-labels and dark knowledge in the context of self-supervised learning?

- **Contrastive Learning**: DistilMVC uses contrastive learning to maximize mutual information between views at different hierarchical levels.
  - Why needed: To learn common semantic representations across multiple views
  - Quick check: How does InfoNCE loss help in maximizing the lower bound of mutual information?

- **Multi-view Data Representation**: DistilMVC handles multiple views by learning common representations while maintaining view-specific diversity.
  - Why needed: To capture complementary information from different data modalities
  - Quick check: Why is it important to maintain the respective diversity of views in multi-view clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Autoencoders -> Student network -> Teacher network -> Predictor -> Contrastive learning modules -> Self-distillation module
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Pre-training: Reconstruct views and learn mutual information across views
  2. Fine-tuning: Apply self-distillation to convert pseudo-labels to dark knowledge
  3. Inference: Weighted combination of student network outputs for final clustering
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using teacher-student architecture adds complexity but provides better supervision; multiple hierarchical levels of mutual information maximization increase computational cost but improve semantic learning; momentum updates for teacher network add stability but introduce lag in adaptation
- **Failure signatures**: Poor clustering accuracy despite training completion; loss values plateauing early without improvement; high variance in clustering results across different runs; one cluster dominating all samples (model collapse)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train on Caltech-2V dataset with default parameters and verify convergence of loss and accuracy
  2. Test different temperature values (τs, τt) to find optimal range for dark knowledge quality
  3. Compare clustering performance with and without self-distillation component to validate its effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does DistilMVC's performance scale with increasing numbers of views beyond five, and what are the computational bottlenecks that emerge in high-view scenarios?

### Open Question 2
Can the multi-view self-distillation framework be extended to semi-supervised or active learning settings, and what modifications would be needed to incorporate limited labeled data?

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is DistilMVC to the choice of temperature hyperparameters (τs, τt) in non-ideal conditions, such as highly imbalanced or noisy multi-view datasets, and are there adaptive strategies to set these parameters?

## Limitations
- The core assumption that dark knowledge provides richer semantic information than pseudo-labels lacks direct experimental validation
- Critical architectural details remain unspecified, including exact network architectures and hyperparameter values
- Evaluation is limited to eight specific multi-view datasets, which may not represent real-world diversity

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- DistilMVC improves clustering accuracy on tested datasets (ACC, NMI, PUR improvements demonstrated)
- The multi-view self-distillation framework is novel and technically sound
- Entropy regularization and momentum updates prevent trivial solutions

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Dark knowledge provides better supervision than pseudo-labels (supported by results but mechanism not fully explained)
- Multi-level mutual information maximization improves semantic learning (logical but not directly validated)
- Teacher-student architecture adds stability (theoretical justification but limited empirical validation)

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The exact contribution of each component to overall performance (no ablation studies)
- Generalizability to other multi-view clustering scenarios beyond tested datasets
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (no comprehensive sensitivity analysis)

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Ablation Study**
Implement versions of DistilMVC without: (a) self-distillation, (b) multi-level mutual information maximization, (c) entropy regularization. Compare performance to isolate each component's contribution.

**Check 2: Hyperparameter Sensitivity**
Test DistilMVC with different temperature values (τs, τt) ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 and momentum coefficients from 0.1 to 0.9 to identify optimal ranges and assess robustness.

**Check 3: Noisy View Robustness**
Evaluate DistilMVC on datasets with artificially injected view noise or missing views to assess its robustness compared to baseline methods.
