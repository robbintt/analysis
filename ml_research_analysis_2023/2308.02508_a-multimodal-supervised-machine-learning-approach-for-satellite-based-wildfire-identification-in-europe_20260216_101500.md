# A Multimodal Supervised Machine Learning Approach for Satellite-based Wildfire Identification in Europe

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02508
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Proposed multimodal approach achieves 80.53 F1 score for wildfire identification using XGBoost with all data sources

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel supervised machine learning approach for satellite-based wildfire identification in Europe. The authors propose a multimodal fusion system that combines thermal anomaly data from MODIS and VIIRS with contextual information from Sentinel-3 and land cover data to improve detection accuracy. The approach leverages cross-referencing of thermal anomalies with the EFFIS database to construct a large-scale hotspot dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms single-source methods, achieving an F1 score of 80.53 using XGBoost with all data sources, while still maintaining promising performance (79.14 F1) with only Sentinel-3 and LULC data for near real-time deployment.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a supervised machine learning approach that cross-references thermal anomalies from MODIS and VIIRS with the EFFIS wildfire database to create a labeled dataset of over 9.5 million hotspots. They extract features including fire radiative power (FRP), thermal band values, number of previous hotspots (NPH) over 12/24/36 hours, and time-based features. The system incorporates multimodal data sources: MODIS/VIIRS thermal anomalies, Sentinel-3 SLSTR/OLCI imagery, and ESRI LULC data. Models are trained using XGBoost, Logistic Regression, MLP, and ResNet-18 architectures with a 56%/28%/16% train/validation/test split across 50 stratified folds to handle class imbalance (3% positive, 97% negative).

## Key Results
- Multimodal approach achieves 80.53 F1 score using XGBoost with all data sources
- Near real-time capable system achieves 79.14 F1 score using only Sentinel-3 and LULC
- Significant improvement over single-source approaches (77.27 F1 for MODIS/VIIRS only)
- Model handles severe class imbalance (3% positive, 97% negative) effectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The fusion of multi-modal satellite data improves wildfire detection accuracy over single-source approaches. By combining thermal anomaly data from MODIS and VIIRS with contextual information from Sentinel-3 and land cover data, the model can disambiguate true wildfires from false positives that share similar thermal signatures. This mechanism assumes thermal anomalies from different satellite sources can be reliably aligned and cross-referenced with ground-truth wildfire events from EFFIS.

### Mechanism 2
The use of land cover information helps filter false positives by providing contextual understanding of the landscape. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data provides information about whether a thermal anomaly occurs in forested areas, urban areas, or agricultural land, allowing the model to learn patterns of where wildfires are more likely to occur. This mechanism assumes certain land cover types have higher wildfire probability and this relationship is learnable by the model.

### Mechanism 3
Temporal features and previous hotspot history provide critical context for distinguishing active wildfires from other thermal events. The model uses features like Number of Previous Hotspots (NPH) over 12, 24, and 36 hours before the current detection, along with time-related features, to identify patterns consistent with wildfire behavior. This mechanism assumes wildfire events exhibit characteristic temporal patterns that can be captured by these features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature engineering and selection
  - Why needed here: The paper shows that selecting specific features (FRP, t21, t31, tm13, tm15, ti4, ti5) and creating derived features (NPH, time features) is crucial for model performance
  - Quick check question: Why did the authors choose to use only specific MODIS/VIIRS bands rather than all available bands?

- Concept: Supervised learning with imbalanced datasets
  - Why needed here: The dataset has a 3% positive and 97% negative class ratio, requiring techniques like undersampling and class weighting
  - Quick check question: What sampling strategy did the authors use to handle the class imbalance, and why was this approach chosen?

- Concept: Multimodal data fusion
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates combining satellite imagery (S3, LULC) with point-based features (MODIS, VIIRS) using different architectures (XGBoost, ResNet)
  - Quick check question: How does the ResNet architecture handle the combination of image data and tabular features differently from XGBoost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Collection -> Cross-referencing with EFFIS -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> Validation -> Prediction

- Critical path:
  Data Collection → Cross-referencing with EFFIS → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Validation → Prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using XGBoost vs. ResNet: XGBoost works well with tabular features but may miss spatial patterns; ResNet captures spatial information but requires more computational resources
  - Including vs. excluding MODIS/VIIRS: Including them improves accuracy but requires more data sources; excluding them enables near real-time deployment
  - Undersampling vs. oversampling: Undersampling was chosen to maintain geographical distribution balance

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation when EFFIS database quality decreases
  - Model bias toward certain geographic regions if sampling is not properly stratified
  - Overfitting when using all features without proper regularization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train XGBoost with only MODIS/VIIRS features (FS1) to establish baseline performance
  2. Multimodal impact: Train XGBoost with all feature sets (FS4) to measure improvement from adding Sentinel-3 and LULC
  3. Real-time capability: Train and evaluate model using only Sentinel-3 and LULC (FS6) to test near real-time deployment feasibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the proposed approach be effectively applied to detect small wildfires (less than 30 hectares) that are currently excluded from the EFFIS database?
- How does the proposed approach perform in regions outside Europe, particularly in areas with different vegetation types and fire regimes?
- Can the integration of time series analysis from geostationary satellites, such as Meteosat Third Generation, improve the real-time detection accuracy of the proposed system?

## Limitations

- The approach relies on EFFIS ground truth data which excludes wildfires smaller than 30 hectares
- The model is trained and validated exclusively on European data, raising questions about geographical generalizability
- The temporal resolution of satellite data (MODIS at 1km, VIIRS at 350m/750m) may miss smaller or rapidly evolving fires

## Confidence

- Confidence Level: High - The core claim about multimodal fusion improving detection accuracy is well-supported by experimental results showing F1 score improvements from 77.27 to 80.53
- Confidence Level: Medium - The near real-time deployment capability claims have uncertainty as the paper doesn't provide detailed computational efficiency analysis
- Confidence Level: Medium - Generalizability to non-European regions is uncertain since the model is trained exclusively on European data

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-regional validation**: Test the trained model on wildfire data from non-European regions (e.g., North America, Australia) to assess geographical generalizability and identify potential regional biases in the model.

2. **Temporal stability analysis**: Evaluate model performance when trained on earlier years (2012-2017) and tested on later years (2018-2022) to assess whether the learned patterns remain stable over time as climate conditions and land use patterns change.

3. **Computational efficiency benchmarking**: Measure actual inference latency, memory usage, and computational requirements for the Sentinel-3 + LULC-only model under realistic deployment conditions to validate the near real-time deployment claims with concrete performance metrics.
