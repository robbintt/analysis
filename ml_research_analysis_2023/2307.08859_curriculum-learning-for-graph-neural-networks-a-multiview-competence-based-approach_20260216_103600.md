# Curriculum Learning for Graph Neural Networks: A Multiview Competence-based Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.08859
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08859
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Key outcome**: MCCL achieves 3.3-6.7 absolute points improvement in F1-score over state-of-the-art models on link prediction and node classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multiview Competence-based Curriculum Learning (MCCL), a novel approach for training graph neural networks (GNNs) that dynamically prioritizes training examples based on graph complexity indices and model competence. The method leverages 26 different graph complexity measures, grouped into clusters, to provide a rich curriculum that adapts during training. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements on real-world link prediction and node classification tasks, with MCCL achieving 3.3 and 1.8 absolute points improvements in F1-score over the state-of-the-art model on link prediction datasets and 6.7 and 4.9 absolute points improvement on the node classification dataset.

## Method Summary
MCCL implements a curriculum learning framework for GNNs that uses graph complexity indices as difficulty criteria. The approach calculates 26 different graph complexity measures for each subgraph, groups them into 10 clusters using k-means, and randomly selects one representative index from each cluster. During training, a scheduling scheme selects training examples based on the best-performing complexity index and the model's competence at each iteration. The competence function gradually increases the fraction of training data used over time, starting from a small initial fraction and expanding to cover the entire dataset. The method is model-agnostic and can be applied to any GNN architecture.

## Key Results
- MCCL achieves 3.3 absolute points improvement in F1-score over state-of-the-art model on link prediction datasets
- MCCL achieves 1.8 absolute points improvement in F1-score on additional link prediction datasets
- MCCL achieves 6.7 and 4.9 absolute points improvement on node classification dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model improves training by dynamically prioritizing key complexity indices based on model competence during training.
- Mechanism: At each training iteration, the framework selects a subset of training examples based on the best complexity index and model's competence. The model updates its competency and the scheduler determines the next best view for training.
- Core assumption: Different graph complexity indices capture different aspects of graph difficulty, and model competence can be used as a proxy for which indices are most useful at each training stage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training."
  - [section 2.3]: "Our framework strategically prioritizes key difficulty indices while training a GNN model. Specifically, the framework employs two mechanisms to determine which index should be used for training at iteration t: (i) model-based and (ii) index-based approaches."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus mentions "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Loss-decrease-aware Curriculum Learning" but doesn't provide direct evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If model competence is not a good proxy for difficulty estimation, or if complexity indices do not correlate with actual learning difficulty, the scheduling scheme may fail to select useful training examples.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using multiple views of graph difficulty (complexity indices) allows the model to learn more effectively than single-criterion approaches.
- Mechanism: The approach considers 26 different graph complexity indices, grouped into clusters to avoid redundancy. During training, the scheduler selects from these indices based on their effectiveness.
- Core assumption: Graph data has multiple dimensions of complexity that cannot be captured by a single index, and combining these views provides a richer curriculum.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1]: "Various graph complexity indices were introduced in graph theory. We consider 26 of such indices which represent criteria of difficulty in our curriculum learning framework."
  - [abstract]: "The proposed solution advances existing research in curriculum learning for graph neural networks with the ability to incorporate a fine-grained spectrum of graph difficulty criteria in their training paradigms."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus mentions "Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning" but doesn't provide direct evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the complexity indices are highly correlated or redundant, or if the clustering approach fails to capture genuinely distinct views of difficulty, the multiview approach may not provide additional benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The competence-based scheduling allows for efficient training by gradually increasing the fraction of training data used over time.
- Mechanism: Uses a competence function that starts with a small fraction of training data and gradually increases to cover the entire dataset, with the specific indices used determined by their effectiveness.
- Core assumption: Training effectiveness improves when the model is gradually exposed to more of the training data, and this exposure should be guided by both competence and index effectiveness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2]: "We define model competence at each training iteration t as the fraction of training data that can be used by the model at time t... Our curriculum learning framework employs difficulty indices to select c(t) fraction of examples to train its downstream model."
  - [abstract]: "The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus mentions "Curriculum Learning for Graph Neural Networks: Which Edges Should We Learn First" but doesn't provide direct evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the competence function does not align with actual learning progress, or if the gradual increase in training data fraction does not improve learning efficiency, the scheduling approach may be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: The paper applies curriculum learning specifically to GNNs, which operate on graph-structured data by propagating information through nodes and edges.
  - Quick check question: How do GNNs differ from traditional neural networks in terms of their input and message passing mechanism?

- Concept: Curriculum Learning
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on curriculum learning principles, which involve ordering training examples by difficulty to improve model performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the core hypothesis behind curriculum learning, and how does it relate to human learning?

- Concept: Graph Complexity Measures
  - Why needed here: The paper uses various graph complexity indices as difficulty criteria for curriculum learning.
  - Quick check question: What are some common graph complexity measures, and how might they relate to the difficulty of learning from a graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Graph complexity index computation module (calculates 26 different indices for each subgraph)
  - Competence function module (implements the c(t) function from Equation 1)
  - Scheduling module (selects which indices to use at each iteration based on model-based or index-based criteria)
  - GNN training module (the base GTNN model)
  - Data preprocessing module (creates subgraphs and computes initial complexity scores)

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Complexity index computation → Initial scheduling → GNN training iteration (repeat until convergence)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of complexity indices vs. computational cost (26 indices provide rich views but increase computation)
  - Model-based vs. index-based scheduling (model-based is more expensive but potentially more accurate)
  - Easy-to-hard vs. hard-to-easy ordering (affects which examples are prioritized at different training stages)

- Failure signatures:
  - Model converges very slowly or not at all (scheduling may be ineffective)
  - Model overfits to early training examples (competence function may increase too slowly)
  - No improvement over baseline (complexity indices may not capture useful difficulty signals)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run MCCL with only degree-based indices to establish a baseline for single-view performance
  2. Run MCCL with random ordering of training examples to verify that the scheduling provides benefit
  3. Run MCCL with only the model-based scheduling mechanism disabled to compare its effectiveness against index-based scheduling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different graph complexity indices perform across various graph tasks beyond link prediction and node classification, such as clustering and graph-level classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the model has not been applied to other graph-based tasks such as clustering and graph-level classification, and that future work will extend the approach to these tasks.
- Why unresolved: The model's effectiveness on these additional tasks has not been evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the model to clustering and graph-level classification tasks with performance comparisons to baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the model change when applied to graphs where nodes do not contain textual content, compared to its performance on text-containing graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the model has been exclusively tested on graphs where nodes contain textual content, which may limit its application to more general graph types.
- Why unresolved: The model's effectiveness on non-textual graphs has not been evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the model to graphs without textual content and comparing performance to baseline methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational cost of calculating graph complexity indices scale with the size and density of the graph, and what strategies could be employed to mitigate this cost?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that calculating complexity indices for large-scale graphs can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for denser areas in the graphs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost or potential mitigation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the computational cost of calculating graph complexity indices for varying graph sizes and densities, along with proposed strategies to reduce this cost.

## Limitations
- Substantial computational overhead for calculating 26 graph complexity indices, particularly challenging for large-scale graphs
- Clustering approach to select representative indices may introduce information loss
- Effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and relevance of chosen complexity indices, which may not generalize to all graph types

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of using multiple graph complexity indices for curriculum learning is well-founded and experimental results showing significant improvements are reliable
- **Medium Confidence**: The scheduling mechanism's effectiveness depends on specific implementation details not fully disclosed in the paper
- **Low Confidence**: The generalization of the approach to completely different graph domains or larger-scale applications remains uncertain due to computational requirements

## Next Checks
1. **Computational Efficiency Analysis**: Measure and report the additional training time and resource requirements introduced by the 26 complexity index calculations and compare against baseline methods to assess practical applicability.

2. **Index Sensitivity Study**: Systematically evaluate the impact of different combinations of complexity indices on model performance to determine if the current clustering approach is optimal or if certain indices could be excluded without significant performance loss.

3. **Domain Transfer Experiment**: Apply MCCL to at least two additional graph datasets from different domains (e.g., social networks, molecular graphs) to verify the approach's robustness and identify any domain-specific limitations or requirements.
