# TimeBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Temporal Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.17667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17667
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: TimeBench benchmark reveals significant performance gaps between LLMs and humans in temporal reasoning, with GPT-4 outperforming others while open-source models struggle particularly in commonsense reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TimeBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across three hierarchical levels: symbolic, commonsense, and event temporal reasoning. The benchmark encompasses 10 datasets with 16 sub-tasks and incorporates four distinct task formats (MCQ, NLI, FRC, CTG) to simulate real-world scenarios. Experiments were conducted on popular LLMs including GPT-4, LLaMA2, and others under zero-shot and few-shot settings with chain-of-thought prompting. The results demonstrate a significant performance gap between state-of-the-art LLMs and humans, with GPT-4 showing superior performance while open-source models exhibit notable limitations, especially in commonsense reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The TimeBench benchmark evaluates LLMs on temporal reasoning tasks using a prompt-based approach with standard I-O prompting and chain-of-thought prompting under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The evaluation includes 10 datasets across three hierarchical levels (symbolic, commonsense, event temporal) with 16 sub-tasks, using four task formats: MCQ, NLI, FRC, and CTG. Models tested include GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, Vicuna-1.5, Mistral, Baichuan2, ChatGLM3, and FLAN-T5. The benchmark employs accuracy metrics for NLI and date calculation tasks, option-based EM and F1 for MCMAQ tasks, token-based EM and F1 for FRC tasks, and composite generation metrics for CTG tasks. All experiments were conducted with temperature set to 0 for greedy search.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 significantly outperforms other LLMs across all temporal reasoning levels, demonstrating superior symbolic, commonsense, and event temporal reasoning capabilities
- Open-source models generally exhibit subpar performance, particularly struggling with commonsense reasoning tasks compared to proprietary models
- Chain-of-thought prompting does not consistently improve performance and may even impair results in certain cases, highlighting the complexity of temporal reasoning in LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark's hierarchical categorization (symbolic, commonsense, event temporal reasoning) allows for granular diagnostic assessment of LLM temporal reasoning.
- Mechanism: By stratifying temporal reasoning into three distinct cognitive levels, the benchmark isolates specific reasoning deficits, enabling targeted model improvements.
- Core assumption: Temporal reasoning skills can be decomposed into independent cognitive layers that can be evaluated separately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TIME BENCH categorizes temporal reasoning into symbolic, commonsense and event temporal reasoning, covering 10 datasets with 16 sub-tasks."
  - [section 2.2]: "we delineate temporal reasoning into three hierarchical levels...symbolic temporal reasoning, commonsense temporal reasoning, and event temporal reasoning."
- Break condition: If reasoning skills are fundamentally interdependent rather than hierarchical, this categorization would obscure rather than clarify model capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of multiple task formats (MCQ, NLI, FRC, CTG) provides a more realistic evaluation of model performance in real-world scenarios.
- Mechanism: Diverse task formats simulate varied real-world temporal reasoning contexts, preventing overfitting to a single question style and revealing format-specific model weaknesses.
- Core assumption: Real-world temporal reasoning problems come in varied formats that require different cognitive approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In contrast to them, we incorporate four distinct task forms, offering a more realistic simulation of challenges models encounter in real-world scenarios."
  - [section 2.6]: "Real-world scenarios are diverse in task forms. To investigate the model's authentic performance, we select diverse task forms."
- Break condition: If model performance varies significantly across formats due to superficial factors rather than genuine reasoning capability differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The comprehensive scope covering 10 tasks with 16 sub-tasks ensures broad coverage of temporal reasoning phenomena, preventing narrow benchmarking.
- Mechanism: Extensive task coverage captures the full spectrum of temporal reasoning challenges, from basic date arithmetic to complex event-event relationships, providing a complete capability assessment.
- Core assumption: Temporal reasoning encompasses a wide range of cognitive phenomena that cannot be captured by a limited set of tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TIME BENCH provides a thorough evaluation for investigating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models."
  - [section 2.3-2.5]: Detailed description of symbolic, commonsense, and event temporal reasoning tasks with specific examples.
- Break condition: If task redundancy exists or if certain critical temporal reasoning phenomena are overlooked despite the comprehensive scope.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal commonsense reasoning
  - Why needed here: The benchmark evaluates models on temporal commonsense knowledge including event duration, frequency, order, and typical timing - fundamental for understanding everyday temporal scenarios.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify which aspects of temporal commonsense (duration, frequency, order, typical time) are being tested in a given scenario?

- Concept: Implicit temporal reasoning
  - Why needed here: The benchmark specifically includes tasks requiring inference beyond explicit temporal markers, testing the model's ability to extract and reason about temporal relationships not directly stated.
  - Quick check question: Given a context with implicit temporal relationships, can you identify what temporal information must be inferred versus what is explicitly stated?

- Concept: Multi-hop reasoning
  - Why needed here: The benchmark includes event-event temporal reasoning requiring multiple inference steps, testing the model's ability to chain temporal relationships across several events.
  - Quick check question: In a scenario with multiple events, can you trace the logical steps needed to determine the temporal relationship between non-adjacent events?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The benchmark consists of three hierarchical reasoning levels (symbolic, commonsense, event temporal), each containing multiple task types with various sub-tasks, evaluated using different formats (MCQ, NLI, FRC, CTG) and metrics.
- Critical path: Data collection → Task categorization → Format design → Metric selection → Model evaluation → Analysis of performance gaps across reasoning levels and task types.
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive scope vs. evaluation complexity; realistic task formats vs. potential shortcut vulnerabilities; hierarchical categorization vs. potential oversimplification of reasoning interdependencies.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on specific sub-tasks indicating reasoning deficits; inconsistent performance across task formats suggesting format-specific weaknesses; significant gap between explicit and implicit reasoning indicating inability to extract temporal information from context.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a model on TimeX-NLI (symbolic reasoning) to establish baseline performance on abstract temporal expressions.
  2. Test the same model on MCTACO (commonsense reasoning) to assess temporal knowledge application in everyday scenarios.
  3. Run the model on MenatQA (implicit event-time reasoning) to evaluate capability with complex, context-dependent temporal relationships.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the alignment process impact the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and what specific aspects of alignment lead to performance degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses alignment degradation and mentions that the training during the alignment phase has disrupted the original language modeling capability and caused the model to deviate from strictly adhering to demonstrations during in-context learning.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides insights into the reasons for alignment degradation but does not delve into specific aspects of alignment that lead to performance degradation. It also does not explore the relationship between alignment and temporal reasoning capabilities in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of aligned and base models on various temporal reasoning tasks, along with an analysis of the alignment process and its impact on the model's capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does chain-of-thought prompting consistently improve the performance of LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks, or are there specific types of tasks where it is more effective?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the inconsistent effects of chain-of-thought prompting on temporal reasoning tasks, noting that it can sometimes impair performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a general analysis of the impact of chain-of-thought prompting but does not provide a detailed breakdown of its effectiveness across different types of temporal reasoning tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLMs with and without chain-of-thought prompting on a variety of temporal reasoning tasks, including symbolic, commonsense, and event temporal reasoning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of LLMs in handling implicit temporal reasoning, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the poor performance of LLMs in implicit temporal reasoning tasks, such as TRACIE, and suggests that models struggle with understanding implied events and multi-hop reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the limitations of LLMs in implicit temporal reasoning but does not provide specific strategies or solutions to address these limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments exploring different approaches to improve the implicit temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, such as incorporating additional training data or using specialized architectures.

## Limitations

- Benchmark scope limitations may not capture all critical temporal reasoning phenomena, and the focus on English-language tasks limits generalizability to multilingual capabilities
- Chain-of-thought prompting shows inconsistent effects on performance, sometimes impairing results, raising questions about its reliability for temporal reasoning tasks
- Evaluation relies primarily on accuracy-based metrics that may not fully capture nuanced temporal reasoning capabilities or distinguish between minor errors and complete failures

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: GPT-4 significantly outperforms other LLMs on TimeBench across all reasoning levels. This finding is well-supported by consistent performance patterns across multiple task types and is corroborated by the large performance gaps observed.

**Medium Confidence**: Open-source models generally exhibit subpar performance, especially in commonsense reasoning. While the trend is clear, performance variations among open-source models and the impact of alignment processes introduce some uncertainty.

**Low Confidence**: Chain-of-thought prompting consistently fails to improve performance. The evidence shows inconsistent effects across tasks, with some improvements and some degradations, suggesting this claim requires more nuanced qualification.

## Next Checks

1. **Task Format Transferability Test**: Evaluate the same models on temporally-annotated versions of existing benchmarks using identical task formats to TimeBench to determine if format-specific performance variations persist across different datasets.

2. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Assessment**: Adapt a subset of TimeBench tasks to other major languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) and evaluate the same models to test whether observed reasoning gaps reflect fundamental model limitations or English-specific training biases.

3. **Reasoning Trace Analysis**: Implement detailed analysis of model outputs with and without chain-of-thought prompting to identify whether performance differences reflect genuine reasoning quality or superficial response patterns, using both automated analysis and human evaluation of reasoning traces.
