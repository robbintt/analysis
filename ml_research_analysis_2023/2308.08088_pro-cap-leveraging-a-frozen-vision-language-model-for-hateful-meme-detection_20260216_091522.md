# Pro-Cap: Leveraging a Frozen Vision-Language Model for Hateful Meme Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2308.08088
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08088
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Pro-Cap achieves state-of-the-art results on hateful meme detection benchmarks, surpassing existing methods by 3-6 percentage points.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles hateful meme detection, a multimodal task requiring comprehension of both vision and language. The proposed method, Pro-Cap, leverages a frozen pre-trained vision-language model (PVLM) to generate hateful content-centric image captions through zero-shot visual question answering. Specifically, Pro-Cap prompts the PVLM with probing questions about common vulnerable targets (e.g., race, gender, religion) and uses the answers as image captions. These captions are then used as input to a text-based hateful meme detection model. Experiments on three benchmarks (FHM, MAMI, HarM) show that Pro-Cap significantly improves performance over existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results. For instance, Pro-CapPromptHate surpasses the original PromptHate by 4-6 percentage points on FHM and MAMI, and 3 points on HarM. Pro-CapBERT also outperforms multimodal BERT-based models of similar sizes. Case studies demonstrate that Pro-Cap provides essential image details for hateful content detection, enhancing model explainability.

## Method Summary
Pro-Cap converts multimodal hateful meme detection into a unimodal task by using a frozen PVLM (BLIP-2) to generate image captions through zero-shot visual question answering. The method asks probing questions about vulnerable targets like race, gender, and religion, then uses the answers as captions (Pro-Cap) combined with meme text as input to a text-based detection model (BERT or PromptHate). This approach efficiently leverages powerful PVLMs without fine-tuning while capturing essential visual details critical for detecting hateful content.

## Key Results
- Pro-CapPromptHate outperforms the original PromptHate by 4-6 percentage points on FHM and MAMI, and 3 points on HarM.
- Pro-CapBERT surpasses multimodal BERT-based models of similar sizes on hateful meme detection tasks.
- Case studies demonstrate that Pro-Cap provides essential image details that generic captions miss, improving model explainability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Pro-Cap provides hateful content-centric image captions that improve hateful meme detection accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The method uses a frozen pre-trained vision-language model (PVLM) to generate captions by answering probing questions about vulnerable targets (race, gender, religion, nationality, disability). These captions are then used as input to a text-based detection model, effectively converting multimodal information into a unimodal format while retaining critical visual details.
- **Core assumption:** The frozen PVLM can generate accurate and relevant answers to probing questions about vulnerable targets in hateful memes without fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Specifically, we prompt a frozen PVLM by asking hateful content-related questions and use the answers as image captions (which we call Pro-Cap), so that the captions contain information critical for hateful content detection."
  - [section 4.2] "We leverage PVLMs for zero-shot VQA to generate Pro-Cap as image captions. We want Pro-Cap to provide not only a general description of the image but also details critical for hateful meme detection."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pro-Cap improves hateful meme detection performance by providing essential image details that are often missing in generic image captions.
- **Mechanism:** The method generates captions that include information about common vulnerable targets in hateful content (e.g., race, gender, religion) by asking probing questions. These captions are then used as input to a text-based detection model, allowing the model to leverage both the meme text and the essential visual details.
- **Core assumption:** The generated captions contain information that is critical for hateful content detection and is not present in generic image captions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Specifically, we prompt a frozen PVLM by asking hateful content-related questions and use the answers as image captions (which we call Pro-Cap), so that the captions contain information critical for hateful content detection."
  - [section 4.2] "We want Pro-Cap to provide not only a general description of the image but also details critical for hateful meme detection."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Pro-Cap allows for the efficient use of powerful PVLMs without fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.
- **Mechanism:** The method leverages a frozen PVLM in a zero-shot VQA manner to generate image captions, eliminating the need for fine-tuning and reducing computational costs. The generated captions are then used as input to a text-based detection model, allowing for efficient utilization of the PVLM's capabilities.
- **Core assumption:** The frozen PVLM can generate accurate and relevant answers to probing questions without fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Recent studies have tried to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models (PVLMs) for this task. However, with increasing model sizes, it becomes important to leverage powerful PVLMs more efficiently, rather than simply fine-tuning them."
  - [section 4.1] "Recall that the key idea of our method is to elicit image details that are critical for hateful content detection, such as the gender and race of the people in the image."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Multimodal learning and cross-modal interactions
  - **Why needed here:** Hateful meme detection requires understanding both visual and textual information and how they interact. The proposed method leverages a frozen PVLM to generate image captions that capture essential visual details, which are then used as input to a text-based detection model. Understanding multimodal learning and cross-modal interactions is crucial for comprehending the effectiveness of this approach.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the challenges in multimodal learning, and how does the proposed method address them?

- **Concept:** Vision-language pre-trained models (PVLMs) and zero-shot visual question answering (VQA)
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed method uses a frozen PVLM in a zero-shot VQA manner to generate image captions. Understanding PVLMs and zero-shot VQA is essential for grasping the core idea behind the Pro-Cap approach.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the advantages of using a frozen PVLM in a zero-shot VQA manner, and how does this approach differ from fine-tuning the model?

- **Concept:** Hateful content detection and vulnerable targets
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed method focuses on detecting hateful content in memes and targets specific vulnerable groups (e.g., race, gender, religion). Understanding the characteristics of hateful content and vulnerable targets is crucial for designing effective probing questions and evaluating the method's performance.
  - **Quick check question:** What are some common vulnerable targets in hateful content, and how can we design probing questions to elicit relevant information about these targets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Meme image + text -> Frozen PVLM (BLIP-2) with probing questions -> Pro-Cap (answers) + meme text -> Text-based detection model (BERT/PromptHate) -> Hateful/non-hateful prediction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate image captions using a frozen PVLM and probing questions
  2. Combine the meme text and Pro-Cap as input to a text-based detection model
  3. Train the text-based detection model on the combined input
  4. Use the trained model to predict whether a meme is hateful or not

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using a frozen PVLM vs. fine-tuning: The proposed method reduces computational costs but may not achieve the same level of performance as fine-tuning.
  - Probing questions vs. generic image captions: Probing questions provide more relevant information for hateful content detection but may require more effort to design and implement.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Inaccurate or irrelevant image captions generated by the PVLM
  - Text-based detection model unable to effectively utilize the provided information
  - Poor performance on hateful meme detection tasks

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the Pro-Cap method using a frozen PVLM and a simple text-based detection model (e.g., BERT)
  2. Compare the performance of the Pro-Cap method with a baseline method that uses generic image captions
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of different probing questions in generating relevant image captions for hateful content detection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** How can probing questions be dynamically selected for hateful meme detection?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors mention that using all probing questions may not be optimal and suggest training a model to dynamically select probing questions.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper only suggests this as a potential future direction without providing concrete methods or experiments to support this approach.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing the performance of models using dynamically selected probing questions versus using all probing questions on hateful meme detection datasets.

- **Open Question 2:** What are the most effective probing questions for hateful meme detection?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors use a set of probing questions about vulnerable targets like race, gender, religion, etc., but the effectiveness of each question is not evaluated.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of each probing question on the model's performance.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comprehensive study comparing the performance of models using different combinations of probing questions on hateful meme detection datasets.

- **Open Question 3:** How does the length of answers to probing questions affect the performance of hateful meme detection models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors conduct an ablation study on the impact of the length of answers to probing questions, but the results are inconclusive.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the length of answers affects the model's performance or how to optimize the length for different datasets.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A detailed analysis of the relationship between answer length and model performance, including experiments with different answer lengths on various hateful meme detection datasets.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of probing questions may vary across different meme domains and cultural contexts.
- The method focuses on a limited set of vulnerable targets, which may not capture all forms of hateful content.
- The performance on out-of-domain datasets or with different PVLM architectures remains to be validated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Pro-Cap significantly improves hateful meme detection performance over existing methods on evaluated benchmark datasets (FHM, MAMI, HarM).
- **Medium confidence:** Pro-Cap allows for efficient use of powerful PVLMs without fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.
- **Low confidence:** The probing questions are universally effective in eliciting relevant information about vulnerable targets in hateful memes across different cultural contexts and meme domains.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the Pro-Cap method on additional hateful meme datasets from different domains to assess its generalizability and robustness to diverse content.
2. Compare the performance of the Pro-Cap method using different PVLMs (e.g., CLIP, Florence) to determine the impact of the underlying vision-language model on the quality of generated captions and overall detection performance.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of the probing questions' effectiveness by manually examining the generated captions and assessing their relevance to hateful content detection. Investigate the impact of different question formulations and the inclusion of additional vulnerable targets on the method's performance.
