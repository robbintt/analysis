# DORSal: Diffusion for Object-centric Representations of Scenes et al

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.08068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08068
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 5-10x improvement in FID for novel view synthesis while preserving object-level editing capabilities

## Executive Summary
DORSal introduces a novel approach for high-fidelity novel view synthesis of 3D scenes that preserves object-level editing capabilities. The method conditions a video diffusion model on object-centric slot representations extracted by a pre-trained OSRT model. This allows DORSal to handle uncertainty in unobserved regions through diffusion while maintaining object-level structure for editing. The approach significantly outperforms prior methods on both synthetic MultiShapeNet and real-world Street View datasets, achieving 5-10x improvement in FID while retaining the ability to edit individual objects through slot removal.

## Method Summary
DORSal combines object-centric scene representations with video diffusion to generate novel views of 3D scenes. The method uses a pre-trained OSRT model to extract 32 object slots per scene, which are then used to condition a video diffusion architecture based on a Multiview U-Net. During training, DORSal processes multiple views of a scene in parallel, using cross-attention and FiLM-modulation to integrate object slots and target poses into the U-Net. The model is trained for 1M steps with cosine noise schedule and classifier-free guidance. For editing, individual slots are removed from the conditioning set at inference time, allowing object removal from generated scenes.

## Key Results
- 5-10x improvement in FID compared to 3DiM on both MultiShapeNet and Street View datasets
- Superior novel view synthesis performance with PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics consistently outperforming baseline
- Object-level editing demonstrated through mIoU and ARI metrics, though acknowledged as "basic" capability limited by slot quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DORSal leverages object-centric scene representations to enable high-fidelity novel view synthesis while preserving object-level editing capabilities.
- Mechanism: By conditioning a video diffusion model on object-centric slot representations, DORSal can handle uncertainty in unobserved regions through diffusion while maintaining object-level structure for editing.
- Core assumption: Object slots extracted from a pre-trained OSRT model provide sufficient information to condition the diffusion model for novel view synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DORSal, a method for generating high-fidelity novel views of 3D scenes while preserving object-level scene editing capabilities."
  - [section 1]: "DORSal is a diffusion generative model conditioned on a simple object-centric scene representation."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.421" - Indicates relevant literature exists but specific evidence for this mechanism is limited in the corpus.
- Break condition: If object slots do not capture sufficient scene information or fail to maintain object-level structure, the conditioning will be ineffective and the model will not achieve high-fidelity synthesis or editing capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of a video diffusion architecture with object slot conditioning allows DORSal to scale to more complex scenes and perform better on real-world Street View data compared to prior methods.
- Mechanism: The video diffusion architecture, combined with object slot conditioning, can process large sets of target views efficiently and handle the complexity of real-world scenes by attending to object-level representations.
- Core assumption: The video diffusion architecture is more efficient than alternative architectures for processing multiple views and handling complex scenes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Compared to prior work on 3D Diffusion Models [51], DORSal scales to more complex scenes, performing significantly better on real-world Street View data."
  - [section 3.1]: "To attain consistency between L views generated in parallel, following Video Diffusion [17], each frame has feature maps which are enriched with 2d convolutions to process information within each frame and axial (self-)attention to propagate information between frames."
  - [corpus]: Limited specific evidence in the corpus for this mechanism; the claim relies on the authors' comparison to 3DiM.
- Break condition: If the video diffusion architecture does not provide the claimed efficiency or fails to handle complex scenes, DORSal will not outperform prior methods.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DORSal's ability to perform object-level scene editing is enabled by its conditioning on object-centric slot representations, which allows for the independent manipulation of object presence.
- Mechanism: By conditioning on object slots, DORSal learns to compose scenes out of individual objects, enabling basic object-level scene editing capabilities at inference time through slot removal.
- Core assumption: Object slots capture individual objects in a way that allows for their independent manipulation during scene editing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The approach is evaluated on both complex synthetic scenes (MultiShapeNet) and real-world Street View data, demonstrating superior performance in both novel view synthesis and object-level editing compared to prior methods."
  - [section 3.2]: "At inference time, we explore a simple form of scene editing: by removing individual slots, we can—if the slot succinctly describes an individual object in the scene—remove that object from the scene."
  - [corpus]: "SlotLifter: Slot-guided Feature Lifting for Learning Object-centric Radiance Fields" - Indicates relevant work on object-centric representations but no direct evidence for this specific mechanism in the corpus.
- Break condition: If object slots do not accurately capture individual objects or if their removal does not result in meaningful scene edits, the editing capability will be compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object-centric scene representations
  - Why needed here: DORSal relies on object-centric scene representations as conditioning for the diffusion model to enable both high-fidelity novel view synthesis and object-level editing.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using object-centric scene representations over other types of scene representations in the context of DORSal?

- Concept: Diffusion models for image generation
  - Why needed here: DORSal uses a diffusion model to generate novel views of 3D scenes, leveraging its ability to handle uncertainty and generate high-quality images.
  - Quick check question: How does a diffusion model differ from other generative models like GANs or VAEs in terms of its approach to image generation?

- Concept: Video diffusion architectures
  - Why needed here: DORSal employs a video diffusion architecture to process multiple views of a scene efficiently and maintain consistency across generated frames.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a video diffusion architecture that enable it to process multiple views of a scene?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - OSRT (Object Scene Representation Transformer) -> extracts object-centric slot representations from input views
  - Video diffusion architecture (Multiview U-Net) -> generates novel views conditioned on object slots and poses
  - Object slots -> latent representations of objects in the scene
  - Target poses -> camera poses for the novel views to be generated
  - Conditioning mechanism -> cross-attention and FiLM-modulation to integrate object slots and poses into the U-Net

- Critical path:
  1. Input views are encoded by OSRT to extract object slots
  2. Object slots and target poses are used to condition the video diffusion architecture
  3. The diffusion model generates novel views of the scene
  4. For scene editing, individual slots are removed from the conditioning set, and the model generates edited views

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a pre-trained OSRT model allows for efficient extraction of object slots but limits end-to-end training
  - The video diffusion architecture enables processing of multiple views but may be sensitive to the ordering of frames in the dataset
  - Slot dropout during training can improve editing quality but may negatively impact novel view synthesis performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry or low-quality novel views may indicate insufficient conditioning information or poor integration of object slots into the diffusion model
  - Inconsistent edits across views may suggest issues with the object slot representation or the conditioning mechanism
  - Slow generation or high memory usage may indicate inefficiencies in the video diffusion architecture or the slot extraction process

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the quality of object slots extracted by OSRT by visualizing the slots and comparing them to ground truth object segmentations
  2. Test the conditioning mechanism by generating novel views using object slots from a known scene and comparing the results to ground truth
  3. Evaluate the editing capability by removing individual slots and observing the effect on generated views, comparing the results to ground truth object segmentations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper explicitly calls out several open questions and directions for future work:

1. **End-to-end training**: The authors note that DORSal is not end-to-end trained and is limited by the quality of the separately trained OSRT model. They acknowledge that end-to-end training comes with additional challenges but is worth exploring in future work.

2. **Scaling to larger scenes**: While DORSal scales better than 3DiM to more complex scenes, the authors suggest that cascaded models or other architectural improvements could further enhance performance on larger, more complex datasets.

3. **Improving editing capabilities**: The paper acknowledges that editing is "basic" and limited by the ability of slots to faithfully represent individual objects. They suggest that more sophisticated editing techniques and better slot representations could enhance this capability.

## Limitations

- DORSal relies on a pre-trained OSRT model without end-to-end fine-tuning, potentially limiting performance on domains where the pre-training data distribution differs from target scenes
- The "basic" editing capability is explicitly acknowledged as limited by slot representation quality, with slot removal not always producing semantically meaningful edits
- The method's performance gains are primarily validated against a single prior method (3DiM) without broader ablation studies isolating architectural contributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claim that DORSal improves novel view synthesis quality compared to 3DiM (5-10x improvement in FID) is well-supported by the paper's quantitative results on both MultiShapeNet and Street View datasets, with specific metric values provided across multiple evaluation criteria (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID).

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism claim that video diffusion architecture enables scaling to more complex scenes is moderately supported through comparative results but lacks ablation studies isolating the architectural contribution from other factors like object-centric conditioning.

**Low Confidence**: The editing capability claims have limited validation - while mIoU and ARI metrics are reported, the paper provides minimal qualitative examples of successful edits, and the "basic" editing capability is explicitly acknowledged as limited by slot representation quality.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on architectural components**: Remove the video diffusion architecture while keeping object-centric conditioning to quantify the specific contribution of the architecture to performance gains over 3DiM.

2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate DORSal on scenes where the pre-trained OSRT model was not trained (different object categories or scene types) to assess robustness of the object-centric conditioning approach.

3. **Editing capability stress test**: Systematically evaluate editing performance across scenes with varying numbers of objects and occlusion levels to quantify the relationship between scene complexity and editing success rate.
