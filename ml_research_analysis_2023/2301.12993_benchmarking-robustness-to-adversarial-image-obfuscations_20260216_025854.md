# Benchmarking Robustness to Adversarial Image Obfuscations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.12993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12993
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces a new benchmark for evaluating image classifiers against adversarial obfuscations, showing that newer architectures, larger models, and specific augmentations improve robustness, though generalization to unseen obfuscations remains limited.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating image classifiers against adversarial obfuscations, which simulate methods used by malicious actors to bypass content filters. The benchmark, based on ImageNet, includes 22 obfuscations designed to drastically alter images while preserving their original content intent. The study evaluates 33 pretrained models and trains additional models with various augmentations and training methods. Results show that newer architectures, larger models, and specific augmentations improve robustness to these obfuscations, though generalization to unseen obfuscations remains limited. The benchmark provides insights into model robustness and encourages further research into methods that can leverage known attacks for better generalization.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate image classifiers against adversarial obfuscations. It is based on the ImageNet 2012 dataset and includes 22 obfuscations, covering color changes, transformations, compositions, overlays, and machine-learning-based manipulations. The main metric is the worst-case accuracy on 3 hold-out obfuscations. The study evaluates 33 pretrained models and trains additional models with different augmentations, architectures, and training methods on subsets of the obfuscations to measure generalization.

## Key Results
- Newer architectures, larger models, and specific augmentations improve robustness to adversarial obfuscations.
- Training on known obfuscations can improve robustness to similar but unseen obfuscations, but gains diminish with more training obfuscations.
- Generalization to unseen obfuscations remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Drastic visual changes can degrade model accuracy while preserving human-recognizable semantics.
- Mechanism: Strong obfuscations disrupt pixel-level features while keeping high-level semantic content intact, causing models to misclassify while humans still recognize the image.
- Core assumption: Obfuscations are adversarial yet label-preserving.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "These obfuscations are designed to drastically alter images while preserving their original content intent" [section] "These represent a wide range of strong and varied manipulations..."
- Break condition: If obfuscations alter semantic label, the premise fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scaling model capacity and pretraining on larger datasets improves robustness to strong obfuscations.
- Mechanism: Larger models with richer pretraining develop more robust internal representations less sensitive to pixel-level perturbations.
- Core assumption: Added capacity and pretraining provide useful inductive biases that generalize to unseen distribution shifts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results show that newer architectures, larger models... improve robustness" [section] "Fig. 3 shows that scaling up in terms of parameters... leads to increased robustness"
- Break condition: If scaling does not improve robustness, the assumption about capacity helping generalization fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on known obfuscations can improve robustness to similar but unseen obfuscations, but gains diminish with more training obfuscations.
- Mechanism: Exposure to a variety of strong obfuscations during training allows the model to learn invariance to similar perturbations, improving generalization to new obfuscations. However, diminishing returns occur because the model saturates on the variety of transformations it can handle.
- Core assumption: The set of training obfuscations is representative enough of the space of possible obfuscations to induce useful invariances.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The study evaluates 33 pretrained models and trains additional models with various augmentations... Results show that... specific augmentations improve robustness"
- Break condition: If adding more training obfuscations does not improve generalization, or if the relationship between training and unseen obfuscations is not learnable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Distribution shift and robustness evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares model performance under normal data distribution versus under strong, adversarial distribution shifts introduced by obfuscations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between natural corruptions (ImageNet-C) and adversarial obfuscations in terms of their impact on model performance?

- Concept: **Adversarial robustness vs. ℓp-norm bounded attacks**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that its obfuscations represent a different, more practical threat model than standard ℓp-norm attacks, requiring a distinct robustness evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Why might ℓp-norm adversarial training not improve robustness to the obfuscations described in this paper?

- Concept: **Augmentation schemes and their generalization effects**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates various augmentation methods (MixUp, CutMix, etc.) to see if they help models generalize to unseen obfuscations.
  - Quick check question: Which augmentation method showed the strongest improvement across all hold-out obfuscations in the experiments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ImageNet validation -> 16 super-classes -> Obfuscation application -> Model evaluation -> Weighted accuracy calculation
- Critical path: 1. Load ImageNet validation, filter to 16 super-classes 2. Apply hold-out obfuscations 3. Evaluate model on each, check if all hold-out versions are correct 4. Compute weighted accuracy by super-class
- Design tradeoffs: Static vs. adaptive obfuscations (static chosen for reproducibility), Number of super-classes (16 chosen for balanced, human-recognizable categories), Hold-out vs. training obfuscations (allows measuring generalization)
- Failure signatures: Accuracy drops on hold-out obfuscations but not training ones → overfitting to training obfuscations, No improvement from scaling → capacity/pretraining insufficient for this shift, Certain obfuscations consistently hardest → may need targeted robustness methods
- First 3 experiments: 1. Evaluate a pretrained ResNet50 on hold-out obfuscations (baseline) 2. Train a ResNet50 on all training obfuscations and evaluate on hold-outs (generalization test) 3. Train with MixUp augmentation and compare hold-out performance (augmentation effect)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do adversarial obfuscations interact with different model architectures beyond the ones tested (e.g., transformer-based architectures for other vision tasks)?
- What is the optimal strategy for combining known obfuscations during training to maximize generalization to unseen obfuscations?
- How do adversarial obfuscations affect model performance on other robustness benchmarks beyond those tested?

## Limitations
- The relatively small number of hold-out obfuscations (3) may not fully capture the diversity of real-world adversarial manipulations.
- The benchmark focuses on ImageNet, limiting generalizability to other domains.
- The exact thresholds for what constitutes "preserved content intent" are not rigorously defined, potentially introducing subjectivity in labeling.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The claim that newer architectures and larger models improve robustness to strong obfuscations is well-supported by the experimental results and aligns with established scaling laws in deep learning.
- Medium confidence: The assertion that training on known obfuscations improves generalization to unseen obfuscations is supported by the results, but the limited number of hold-out obfuscations makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the extent of generalization.
- Low confidence: The paper's argument that its obfuscations represent a more practical threat model than standard ℓp-norm attacks is conceptually sound but lacks direct empirical comparison to quantify the difference in real-world scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Expand hold-out set: Validate the generalization results by increasing the number of hold-out obfuscations to 5-7, ensuring a more comprehensive assessment of model robustness to unseen manipulations.
2. Cross-domain evaluation: Test the benchmark's applicability to non-ImageNet datasets (e.g., medical imaging or satellite imagery) to assess its generalizability beyond natural images.
3. Attack transferability analysis: Conduct experiments to measure how well robustness to the paper's obfuscations transfers to other adversarial attack types (e.g., adversarial patches or generative adversarial network-based attacks) to validate the practical relevance of the benchmark.
