- Practitioners face institutional and operational challenges in co-producing Responsible AI values

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the challenges AI/ML practitioners face when co-producing and implementing Responsible AI (RAI) values across organizations. Through interviews with 23 practitioners from 10 organizations, the authors identify key institutional and operational challenges. Bottom-up structures create burden on individual "vigilantes" who champion RAI values without formal recognition, while top-down approaches lead to rigidity and underdeveloped centralized support. Practitioners face challenges in value knowledge, prioritization, interpretation tensions, and implementation conflicts. To address these issues, the authors propose "middle-out" RAI structures that balance top-down and bottom-up approaches, enabling equal participation and better value deliberations. They also introduce value levers as strategic tools to facilitate RAI value co-production, including scenario-based narratives, adversarial prioritization frameworks, and safe spaces for discussions. These strategies aim to create more inclusive and equitable RAI practices while reducing the burden on individual practitioners.

## Method Summary
The study conducted 23 interviews with AI/ML practitioners across 10 organizations to understand challenges in co-producing Responsible AI values. Researchers used thematic analysis based on Jasanoff's co-production framework, examining institutional structures, discourses, and representations. The analysis identified key challenges including knowledge gaps, value prioritization difficulties, and conflicts between different stakeholder interpretations. From these findings, the authors developed proposals for middle-out governance structures and specific value levers to facilitate more effective RAI implementation.

## Key Results
- Bottom-up RAI efforts create burden on individual practitioners who act as unpaid "vigilantes" championing values without formal recognition
- Top-down RAI approaches lead to rigidity and underdeveloped centralized support, making values difficult to interpret and implement
- Practitioners face significant challenges in value knowledge, prioritization, interpretation tensions, and implementation conflicts across organizational structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Middle-out RAI structures balance top-down rigidity and bottom-up burden by enabling equal participation across roles.
- Mechanism: Organizations adopt hybrid governance models that combine formal top-down compliance workflows with bottom-up exploratory activities, distributing RAI responsibilities to diverse stakeholders (data workers, UX researchers, policy experts) early in the AI lifecycle.
- Core assumption: Teams need both structured guidance and flexibility to adapt RAI values to context-specific use cases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Overall, our findings show that co-production of RAI values in practice is complicated by institutional structures that either support top-down decision-making by leadership or are inhabited by bottom-up practitioners exercising voluntary agency."
  - "Going forward, there is a need for a holistic middle-out approach that seeks a balanced synergy between top-down and bottom-up structures while balancing for the challenges that each of the structures provide."
- Break condition: If organizations fail to provide formal recognition or career incentives for bottom-up RAI contributions, burnout and deprioritization will occur.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adversarial prioritization frameworks surface value conflicts early, improving team alignment and reducing late-stage value changes.
- Mechanism: Teams explicitly roleplay opposing stakeholder perspectives to surface hidden value tensions (e.g., equity vs. accuracy), then use structured prioritization to converge on shared RAI values before implementation.
- Core assumption: Early exposure to conflicting interpretations prevents superficial value engagement and reduces reactive late-stage revisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "P04, a UX researcher, created bottom-up adversarial prioritization framework…This practice allowed them to bring forward interesting disagreements between different roles that were then resolved and prioritized…"
  - "Late stage value changes…substantially alter the project timeline…reducing the productivity of their overall RAI discourse and implementation efforts."
- Break condition: If facilitators lack experience mediating value disagreements, the framework may devolve into unproductive conflict.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: External RAI certifications and expert partnerships streamline fragmented institutional structures and reduce practitioner burden.
- Mechanism: Independent RAI consultancies provide modular activities (impact assessments, bias testing, stakeholder workshops) that organizations package into certifications, creating unified workflows across teams.
- Core assumption: Organizations benefit from external accountability and standardized processes to align disparate internal RAI efforts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "One of the ways in which organizations brought stability to their inconsistent top-down RAI institutional structures was by taking assistance of independent agencies or professionals…These programs act as facilitators between the non-technical and technical workforce…"
  - Corpus lacks direct citations of certification effectiveness; only one study mentions RAI governance frameworks.
- Break condition: If certifications become checkbox exercises without deep engagement, they risk reinforcing ethics-washing behaviors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Co-production framework (Jasanoff 2004)
  - Why needed here: The study uses co-production to analyze how AI/ML practitioners jointly create RAI values across institutional structures, discourses, and representations.
  - Quick check question: What are the three "sites" of co-production and how do they map to RAI challenges in the paper?

- Concept: Value levers (Shilton 2013)
  - Why needed here: Value levers are low-cost, participatory activities that facilitate value discussions; the paper identifies ten specific levers practitioners use to resolve RAI tensions.
  - Quick check question: How do value levers differ from traditional top-down RAI guidelines?

- Concept: Ethics-washing (Bietti 2020)
  - Why needed here: The paper highlights risks of superficial RAI compliance, where organizations adopt ethical language without meaningful cultural change.
  - Quick check question: What organizational behaviors distinguish ethics-washing from genuine RAI integration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RAI co-production system comprises three interconnected modules:
  - Institutional module: Top-down compliance workflows, bottom-up exploration spaces, middle-out hybrid governance
  - Discourse module: Knowledge-sharing channels, adversarial prioritization frameworks, safe space facilitation
  - Representation module: Value lever toolkits (scenarios, role-plays, model cards, office hours, certifications)

- Critical path: Practitioner → Identify RAI values → Engage in adversarial prioritization → Document via model cards/visual tools → Implement with office hour support → Validate through certification/external audit

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs. distributed RAI ownership: Centralized ensures consistency but risks rigidity; distributed encourages context-sensitivity but risks fragmentation
  - Early vs. late value integration: Early reduces rework but requires upfront investment; late is reactive but cheaper initially
  - Internal vs. external facilitation: Internal ensures domain knowledge but may lack objectivity; external brings standards but may lack context

- Failure signatures:
  - Top-down only: Teams deprioritize unfamiliar values, leading to superficial compliance
  - Bottom-up only: Burnout among volunteer "vigilantes," inconsistent value adoption
  - Adversarial frameworks without skilled facilitation: Destructive conflicts, stalled progress
  - Certifications without deep engagement: Ethics-washing, reputational risk

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Pilot middle-out governance: Combine top-down compliance checklist with bottom-up scenario workshops in one team; measure value adoption rates and practitioner satisfaction
  2. Test adversarial prioritization: Run a 2-hour role-play session where engineers, UX researchers, and product managers debate fairness vs. accuracy; track resolution quality and implementation changes
  3. External certification pilot: Partner with an RAI consultancy to audit one product's RAI processes; compare pre/post workflow efficiency and external stakeholder perception

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can middle-out institutional structures be effectively operationalized and simulated to balance the challenges of top-down and bottom-up approaches in RAI value co-production?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes middle-out structures as a solution to balance top-down and bottom-up challenges but acknowledges the need for future research to operationalize and simulate such structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for a middle-out approach but does not provide concrete methods or simulations for implementing such structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or case studies demonstrating successful implementation and outcomes of middle-out structures in RAI value co-production.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific participatory approaches can be developed to facilitate explicit value deliberations and resolve conflicts among diverse stakeholders in RAI value co-production?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests using participatory design fictions and other participatory approaches to align stakeholders on polyvocal speculations around embedded values.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes participatory approaches, it does not detail specific methods or tools for facilitating these deliberations and resolving conflicts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of participatory tools or frameworks that successfully facilitate explicit value deliberations and conflict resolution among stakeholders.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can external representations and participatory structures be designed to effectively engage end-user communities in RAI value co-production and ensure their values are considered?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the lack of external representations engaging end-user communities and suggests the need for participatory structures to include diverse external stakeholders.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the gap in engaging end-user communities but does not provide concrete designs or methods for creating these participatory structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of participatory structures that include end-user communities in RAI value co-production, with documented outcomes and feedback.

## Limitations
- The paper relies heavily on practitioner anecdotes rather than systematic evaluation of proposed solutions' effectiveness
- Claims about external certification programs streamlining RAI implementation lack direct evidence and supporting citations
- The proposed middle-out structures and value levers are not empirically tested, only suggested based on interview findings

## Confidence
- High confidence: Challenges of top-down rigidity and bottom-up burden on individual practitioners
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of middle-out structures and adversarial prioritization frameworks
- Low confidence: Claims about external certification programs streamlining RAI implementation

## Next Checks
1. Measure practitioner outcomes: Track whether teams using middle-out governance show higher RAI value adoption rates and lower practitioner burnout compared to traditional top-down or bottom-up structures.
2. Test adversarial prioritization effectiveness: Compare value alignment and implementation quality between teams using adversarial frameworks versus those using standard prioritization methods.
3. Evaluate certification impact: Conduct pre/post assessments of teams that engage with external RAI certifications to measure changes in workflow efficiency and value integration depth.
