# Solving Two-Player General-Sum Games Between Swarms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.01682
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01682
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: PINNs can solve general-sum swarm games up to 10 regions, outperforming DDQN and matching numerical solvers.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of solving two-player general-sum games between swarms using Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs. The authors propose using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn Nash equilibrial values governed by HJI equations, circumventing the curse of dimensionality that plagues traditional numerical methods. They formulate a general-sum game between two sub-swarms modeled by Kolmogorov forward equations, with the objective of maximizing their respective payoffs. The PINN approach is evaluated on three case studies: 2 regions, 4 regions, and 10 regions.

## Method Summary
The method formulates a two-player general-sum game between swarms using the Kolmogorov forward equation to model density evolution. PINNs are trained to approximate Nash equilibrial values by minimizing HJI PDE residuals plus boundary conditions, using a curriculum learning approach that starts from terminal conditions and gradually extends the time horizon backward. The learned value function generates closed-loop policies, which are evaluated against open-loop solutions from a boundary value problem (BVP) solver and compared with Nash Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) baselines.

## Key Results
- PINN-generated policies achieve higher payoffs than Nash DDQN across all tested cases.
- For 2 and 4 regions, PINN performance is comparable to numerical BVP solvers.
- The approach scales to 10 regions where traditional numerical methods become intractable.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PINNs can approximate Nash equilibrial values without discretizing the state space.
- Mechanism: The physics-informed neural network minimizes the residual of the HJI PDEs plus boundary conditions, effectively fitting a continuous function that satisfies the differential game's governing equations.
- Core assumption: The HJI equations have a unique viscosity solution when the Nash equilibrium exists.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "physics-informed machine learning methods with supervision can be used and have been shown to be effective in generating equilibrial policies in two-player general-sum games."
  - [section]: "the loss function that guides the learning of the general-sum value is: min θ L1( ˆνi; θ) := Σ H(...) + C1 B(...)"
  - [corpus]: Weak anchor - no direct citations on PINN HJI performance found.
- Break condition: If the solution is non-unique or non-smooth (e.g., discontinuous), PINN training may converge to incorrect or unstable values.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Kolmogorov forward equation allows swarm density modeling without tracking individual agents.
- Mechanism: By modeling the swarm as a continuous density field, the PDE describes how agents transition between regions, avoiding exponential growth in state space dimension.
- Core assumption: The number of agents is large enough for the mean-field approximation to hold (law of large numbers).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We consider the Kolmogorov forward equation as the dynamic model for the evolution of the densities of the swarms."
  - [section]: "As N → ∞, the empirical distribution converges to a deterministic quantity x(t) ∈ Ω..."
  - [corpus]: No direct citations found; assumption drawn from standard mean-field literature.
- Break condition: For small swarms (N small), the deterministic density assumption breaks down, leading to poor control performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Curriculum learning improves training stability for high-dimensional swarm games.
- Mechanism: Start training at the terminal boundary (t=T), then gradually extend the time horizon backwards, allowing the network to first learn stable terminal conditions before inferring earlier time values.
- Core assumption: Terminal conditions are easier to learn and provide a stable starting point for backward propagation through time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We implement curriculum learning by first learning the value at the final time and gradually increasing the time horizon starting from the end time."
  - [abstract]: Not explicitly mentioned; inferred from methodology section.
  - [corpus]: No direct citations; appears to be a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If terminal payoff is ill-defined or discontinuous, backward learning may propagate errors early in the trajectory.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs
  - Why needed here: These equations characterize the Nash equilibrial values for two-player general-sum differential games.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the Hamiltonian in HJI equations for game theory?

- Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
  - Why needed here: PINNs allow learning of PDE solutions without mesh discretization, avoiding curse of dimensionality.
  - Quick check question: How does PINN loss combine PDE residuals and boundary conditions?

- Concept: Kolmogorov Forward Equation / Mean-Field Models
  - Why needed here: They model swarm density evolution without tracking individuals, enabling scalability.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions does the empirical distribution converge to a deterministic density?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Value Network -> HJI Loss Function -> Dynamics Module -> ADAM Optimizer -> Curriculum Scheduler -> Evaluation Module

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize value network with small time horizon at T.
  2. Pretrain at boundary (t=0) for stability.
  3. Iteratively expand time horizon and retrain.
  4. Generate closed-loop trajectories using learned value function.
  5. Validate against open-loop BVP solver solutions.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High network capacity vs. overfitting in high dimensions.
  - Curriculum step size vs. convergence speed.
  - Softmax-like payoff (Boltzmann) vs. hard max for differentiability.

- Failure signatures:
  - Loss plateaus without decreasing → poor initialization or ill-conditioned HJI.
  - Value mismatch at final time vs. BVP → insufficient capacity or training data.
  - Closed-loop instability → poor backward-in-time value propagation.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate 2-region case and compare PINN vs BVP payoffs.
  2. Train with reduced data points to test sample efficiency.
  3. Increase temperature α in payoff to test effect on convergence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the verification of policies generated by physics-informed neural networks be ensured, especially for high-dimensional cases where analytical solutions are lacking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that an open question exists regarding the verification of policies due to the black-box nature of neural networks, particularly for higher-dimensional cases.
- Why unresolved: The inherent complexity and opacity of neural networks make it challenging to verify the correctness of the policies they generate, especially as the dimensionality of the problem increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing robust methods for verifying neural network policies, such as interpretability techniques or formal verification methods, would provide evidence of their reliability and correctness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential applications of the proposed approach in real-life scenarios, such as network communications or swarm robotics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests exploring applications to real-life inspired problems such as network communications as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in theoretical scenarios, its practical applicability and performance in real-world settings remain to be investigated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments and case studies in real-world scenarios, such as network communications or swarm robotics, would provide evidence of the approach's effectiveness and potential for practical implementation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the introduction of uncertainty in the system affect the complexity of solving general-sum games between swarms, and what strategies can be employed to address this complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that adding uncertainty to the system introduces a new layer of complexity, but does not explore this aspect in detail.
- Why unresolved: The impact of uncertainty on the dynamics of swarm interactions and the resulting strategies is not well understood, and existing methods may need to be adapted or new approaches developed to handle this complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating the effects of uncertainty on swarm dynamics and developing strategies to address this complexity, such as robust control methods or stochastic game formulations, would provide evidence of the approach's ability to handle uncertain environments.

## Limitations

- Scalability to very high-dimensional swarm games remains uncertain due to limited testing beyond 10 regions.
- Performance comparison with numerical solvers is limited to smaller cases, leaving uncertainty about efficiency gains for larger problems.
- The mean-field approximation via Kolmogorov forward equation may not hold for small swarm sizes, limiting applicability.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- PINNs can effectively approximate Nash equilibrial values for 2 and 4 region cases, showing comparable performance to numerical solvers.
- The mean-field approximation via Kolmogorov forward equation is valid for large swarms, enabling scalable density modeling.
- Curriculum learning improves training stability by starting from terminal conditions and gradually extending the time horizon.

**Medium Confidence:**
- The PINN approach maintains scalability and performance for the 10-region case, though detailed network specifications are lacking.
- Nash equilibrial values obtained via PINN result in higher payoffs compared to Nash DDQN across all tested scenarios.
- The combination of HJI PDE residuals and boundary conditions in the loss function effectively guides the learning process.

**Low Confidence:**
- Performance guarantees for swarm games with more than 10 regions remain uncertain due to limited testing.
- The impact of temperature parameter α in Boltzmann payoffs on convergence and policy quality is not thoroughly analyzed.
- Long-term stability of closed-loop trajectories generated by PINN-based policies requires further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate the PINN approach on a 20-region swarm game to assess computational efficiency and solution accuracy compared to baseline methods.
2. **Small Swarm Validation**: Test the method on a swarm with 50 agents to verify the validity of the mean-field approximation and identify breakdown conditions.
3. **Temperature Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform a parameter sweep on the temperature α in Boltzmann payoffs to determine its effect on convergence speed and policy optimality.
