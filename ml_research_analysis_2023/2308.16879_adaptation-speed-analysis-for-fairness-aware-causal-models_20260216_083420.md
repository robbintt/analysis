# Adaptation Speed Analysis for Fairness-aware Causal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.16879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16879
- Reference count: 38
- This paper analyzes the adaptation speed of causal models in the presence of sensitive variables across four domain shift scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes the adaptation speed of causal models in the presence of sensitive variables. It considers four domain shift scenarios induced by interventions on the bias, cause, both bias and cause, or effect variable. The core method is to compare the initial parameter distances between causal and anti-causal models after each intervention. Theoretical analysis shows that the causal model always has a speed advantage when the intervention is on the cause or both bias and cause. When the intervention is on the effect, the anti-causal model is faster only under certain conditions. When the intervention is on the bias alone, both models adapt at the same speed. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm these findings. The results provide guidance on which model to use depending on the type of domain shift.

## Method Summary
The method compares adaptation speeds of causal and anti-causal models under domain shifts. For synthetic data, the paper generates prior distributions p(A), p(X|A), and p(Y|A,X) from Dirichlet distributions with K categories, then creates transfer distributions by applying interventions on A, X, both A and X, or Y. Two models are initialized from the reference distribution: a causal model 𝒑𝜃→ (a,x,y) = 𝒑𝜃𝐴(a)𝒑𝜃𝑋|𝐴(x|a)𝒑𝜃𝑌|𝐴,𝑋(y|a,x) and an anti-causal model 𝒑𝜃← (a,x,y) = 𝒑𝜃𝐴(a)𝒑𝜃𝑌|𝐴(y|a)𝒑𝜃𝑋|𝐴,𝑌(x|a,y). Stochastic gradient descent updates parameters using transfer distribution samples, and initial parameter distances are computed to predict which model adapts faster. The Colored-MNIST and Adult datasets are used for real-world validation, with gender or RGB color as the sensitive bias variable.

## Key Results
- Causal models adapt faster than anti-causal models when interventions are on the cause or both cause and bias variables
- Anti-causal models adapt faster under certain conditions when interventions are on the effect variable
- Both models adapt at the same speed when interventions are on the bias alone
- Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets confirm theoretical predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal models adapt faster than anti-causal models when the intervention is on the cause or both cause and bias.
- Mechanism: The parameter distance between initial and target distributions is smaller for causal models in these scenarios, leading to faster convergence under stochastic gradient descent.
- Core assumption: The structural causal model (SCM) follows the form A → X and A, X → Y, where A is a sensitive variable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Theoretical analysis shows that the causal model always has a speed advantage when the intervention is on the cause or both bias and cause."
  - [section 4.3] "When the intervention is on the cause variable, the causal model consistently exhibits a speed advantage."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing direct evidence; the corpus contains related causal inference papers but not specific to adaptation speed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: When the intervention is on the effect, the anti-causal model adapts faster under certain conditions.
- Mechanism: The anti-causal model's parameter distance is smaller when the intervention on Y brings the target marginal distribution closer to a specific form related to the model's parameters.
- Core assumption: The effect variable Y's intervention creates a distribution where the anti-causal model's parameters align more closely with the target.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When the intervention is on the effect, the anti-causal model is faster only under certain conditions."
  - [section 4.3] "However, if the distance goes beyond this range, the anti-causal model will converge faster."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; related papers discuss causal models but not adaptation speed under interventions on effect variables.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interventions on the bias alone do not affect the relative adaptation speeds of the causal and anti-causal models.
- Mechanism: Both models are equally affected by changes in the bias variable's marginal distribution, so their initial parameter distances increase equally.
- Core assumption: The bias variable A's intervention does not alter the causal dependencies between X and Y.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When the intervention is on the bias alone, both models adapt at the same speed."
  - [section 4.3] "The initial distance between the two models can be expressed as δcausal = δanticausal = ∥𝒔𝐴 − 𝒔*𝐴∥2."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus papers focus on causal inference and domain adaptation but not specific to bias interventions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  - Why needed here: SCMs provide the framework for modeling the causal dependencies between variables, which is essential for understanding how interventions affect adaptation speed.
  - Quick check question: What are the components of an SCM, and how do they represent causal relationships?

- Concept: Interventions and Domain Shift
  - Why needed here: Understanding how interventions change the distribution of variables is crucial for analyzing the adaptation speed of causal models.
  - Quick check question: How does the do-operator mathematically represent an intervention in an SCM?

- Concept: Parameter Distance and Convergence
  - Why needed here: The initial distance between model parameters and target parameters determines the adaptation speed under gradient descent.
  - Quick check question: How is the parameter distance related to the KL-divergence between distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: A → X and A, X → Y (SCM structure with bias A between cause X and effect Y)
- Critical path: Sample from transfer distribution → Compute loss → Update parameters via SGD → Measure convergence to target distribution
- Design tradeoffs: Using a simple SCM limits generalizability but allows clear theoretical analysis; assuming categorical variables simplifies parameter representation but may not capture continuous data well
- Failure signatures: If the initial parameter distance is too large, convergence may be slow; if the intervention significantly alters the distribution, the theoretical predictions may not hold
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Intervene on the bias variable A and measure the adaptation speeds of both models
  2. Intervene on the cause variable X and compare the adaptation speeds
  3. Intervene on the effect variable Y and analyze under which conditions the anti-causal model adapts faster

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the advantage of causal models over anti-causal models in terms of adaptation speed persist in more complex structural causal models (SCMs) with multiple layers of bias and causality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper analyzes a simple SCM with a cause-bias-effect structure. It does not explore more complex SCMs with multiple layers or feedback loops.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a specific type of SCM and does not extend the analysis to more complex structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical and theoretical analysis of adaptation speeds in more complex SCMs with multiple layers of bias and causality, including those with feedback loops.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the presence of multiple sensitive variables (biases) affect the adaptation speed of causal and anti-causal models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper considers a single sensitive variable (bias) between the cause and effect. It does not address scenarios with multiple sensitive variables.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is limited to a single bias variable, and the impact of multiple biases on adaptation speed is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental and theoretical investigation of adaptation speeds in SCMs with multiple sensitive variables, comparing the performance of causal and anti-causal models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the theoretical framework for analyzing adaptation speeds be extended to non-linear causal relationships between variables?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a linear structural causal model (SCM) and does not consider non-linear relationships between variables.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is based on linear SCMs, and the extension to non-linear relationships is not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a theoretical framework that can handle non-linear causal relationships in SCMs and experimental validation of the framework's predictions.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes a specific structural causal model (SCM) with categorical variables and fully parameterized conditional distributions, limiting generalizability to continuous variables or different SCM structures
- The claim that anti-causal models adapt faster under certain effect interventions depends on specific parameter conditions that are not fully characterized
- Experimental validation is limited to synthetic data and two real datasets, which may not capture all possible domain shift scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: Claims about causal models adapting faster under interventions on cause or both cause and bias variables, supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation
- Medium confidence: Claims about anti-causal models adapting faster under specific conditions when the intervention is on the effect, as these depend on parameter conditions that require further verification
- Medium confidence: Claims about equal adaptation speeds when the intervention is on the bias alone, as this relies on the assumption that bias interventions do not affect conditional distributions

## Next Checks
1. Test the theoretical predictions on additional real-world datasets with different SCM structures to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of categories K and the parameter ranges to understand the conditions under which anti-causal models adapt faster
3. Implement continuous variable extensions to assess whether the theoretical results hold beyond categorical data
