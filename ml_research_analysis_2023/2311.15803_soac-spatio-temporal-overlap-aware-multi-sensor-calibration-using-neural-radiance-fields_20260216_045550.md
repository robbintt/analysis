# SOAC: Spatio-Temporal Overlap-Aware Multi-Sensor Calibration using Neural Radiance Fields

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.15803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15803
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms MOISST baseline with median rotation errors of 0.21-0.36°, translation errors of 5.24-6.36 cm, and temporal errors of 2.96-3.95 ms on KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Pandaset datasets

## Executive Summary
SOAC presents a self-supervised multi-sensor calibration method for autonomous driving systems that leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal calibration. The key innovation is using separate NeRF models for each camera and registering other sensors to these models, which prevents overfitting to regions only visible from one sensor. By training NeRFs with visibility grids that only consider overlapping regions between sensors, the method achieves superior calibration accuracy compared to existing approaches while being targetless and robust to dynamic environments.

## Method Summary
SOAC addresses multi-sensor calibration by training individual NeRF models for each camera sensor, where each NeRF only learns the part of the scene visible to its corresponding camera. The method uses a visibility grid system to identify overlapping regions between sensors, ensuring calibration optimization only considers areas where multiple sensors can observe the same geometry. Through an alternating optimization process, the method trains NeRFs with current calibration parameters, then optimizes sensor poses using the trained NeRFs as reference targets. A NeRF delaying schedule prioritizes the reference sensor's NeRF during early training stages, and correction bounding with sigmoid functions prevents calibration divergence.

## Key Results
- Achieves median rotation errors of 0.21-0.36° on KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Pandaset datasets
- Demonstrates translation errors of 5.24-6.36 cm, outperforming baseline MOISST method
- Shows temporal calibration accuracy of 2.96-3.95 ms while maintaining robustness in dynamic environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating NeRFs per camera and using visibility grids prevents overfitting to regions only visible from one sensor, which leads to better calibration robustness.
- Mechanism: By training individual NeRFs for each camera, each model only learns geometry and radiance for its own visible region. The visibility grid ensures that during registration, only overlapping regions between sensors are considered, preventing one sensor's data from biasing the calibration of another.
- Core assumption: The overlapping regions between sensors contain enough geometric and photometric information to constrain the calibration parameters accurately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas."
  - [section 3.2]: "Each NeRF model with parameters Θi will only learn the part of the scene that is observed by its respective camera sensor i"
  - [section 3.5]: "During the calibration step (Section 3.3) we exploit this visibility grid to only consider rays that overlap with trained regions on each NeRF used for registration"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The alternating optimization between NeRF training and sensor registration creates a feedback loop that progressively refines both the scene representation and calibration parameters.
- Mechanism: The method alternates between training NeRFs with sensor data and optimizing sensor poses using the trained NeRFs. This iterative process allows each stage to improve the other - better NeRFs provide more accurate registration targets, and better calibration provides more consistent data for NeRF training.
- Core assumption: The calibration changes are small enough between iterations that the NeRF representations remain valid while still allowing convergence to the correct calibration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we propose to represent the scene by using multiple NeRFs akin to their corresponding sensor and advocate to alternate the optimization target between NeRF training and sensor calibration"
  - [section 3.6]: "The training process can be summarized as follows: during each training step, a mini-batch of rays is first used in the scene representation training step... In a subsequent step, the same mini-batch is passed to the extrinsic and temporal optimization"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NeRF delaying schedules improve calibration by prioritizing the reference sensor's NeRF during early training stages.
- Mechanism: Since all sensors except the reference have incorrect initial calibration, the reference camera's NeRF is the most reliable early on. By delaying the training of other NeRFs based on their overlap with the reference, the method ensures that calibration optimization starts with the most accurate representation.
- Core assumption: The reference sensor's data provides a more stable and accurate scene representation than sensors with incorrect calibration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.6]: "That is why we introduce a delaying schedule for the other NeRFs based on the overlap with the reference camera"
  - [section 4.2]: "We show the impact of not delaying the NeRFs, as the accuracy and stability of the calibration plummet"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
  - Why needed here: NeRF provides a differentiable volumetric scene representation that can be used as a common frame for multi-sensor calibration
  - Quick check question: How does NeRF generate novel views from a set of input images?

- Concept: Gradient-based optimization and backpropagation
  - Why needed here: The method uses gradient descent to optimize both the NeRF parameters and the sensor calibration parameters simultaneously
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the visibility grid in preventing gradients from flowing through non-overlapping regions?

- Concept: Camera and LiDAR sensor models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to generate rays from sensor parameters and how to compare predicted vs. actual measurements is crucial for the calibration loss functions
  - Quick check question: How are depth measurements from LiDAR compared to the predicted depth from the NeRF during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline (ray generation, filtering) -> NeRF models (one per camera) -> Visibility grid system -> Calibration parameter optimization module -> Loss computation modules (photometric, depth, temporal)

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing (ray generation, visibility grid filling)
  2. NeRF training step with current calibration
  3. Calibration optimization step using trained NeRFs
  4. Repeat until convergence

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multiple NeRFs vs. single NeRF: Better calibration at the cost of increased memory and computation
  - Visibility grid resolution: Higher resolution provides more precise overlap detection but increases memory usage
  - Training schedule: Early focus on reference sensor vs. balanced training across all sensors

- Failure signatures:
  - Calibration parameters diverging despite training
  - NeRF representations becoming noisy or unrealistic
  - Loss plateaus without improvement in calibration metrics
  - Visibility grids not properly aligned with sensor fields of view

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with only the reference sensor to verify NeRF training works correctly
  2. Add one additional sensor and verify the visibility grid correctly identifies overlap regions
  3. Run full calibration with synthetic data where ground truth is known to validate the optimization process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the SOAC method perform when the initial calibration errors exceed the bounds set by the sigmoid function (2 meters translation, 500 ms temporal)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using an offset and scaled sigmoid function to bound the translation and temporal corrections, avoiding divergence and increasing stability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results demonstrating the method's performance when initial calibration errors exceed the predefined bounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing the calibration accuracy and robustness of SOAC when initial errors are larger than the sigmoid bounds would provide insights into the method's limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of epochs for the NeRF delaying schedule on the calibration accuracy and robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using a delaying schedule for NeRFs based on overlap with the reference camera, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how the number of delay epochs affects performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the calibration results to the number of epochs used in the NeRF delaying schedule.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of delay epochs for different datasets and sensor configurations would help determine the optimal schedule for achieving accurate and robust calibration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the SOAC method handle sensor synchronization when using an external synchronization system that provides accurate timestamps?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that without an external synchronization system, temporal calibration is necessary, but does not discuss the method's behavior when accurate timestamps are available.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the scenario where an external synchronization system provides precise timestamps, which could potentially simplify the calibration process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the calibration accuracy and robustness of SOAC when using an external synchronization system versus relying solely on temporal calibration would provide insights into the method's adaptability to different scenarios.

## Limitations

- Requires a reference sensor with known trajectory, which may not always be available in real-world deployment scenarios
- Performance is highly dependent on scene structure and geometric complexity, with limited validation in environments lacking sufficient overlap between sensors
- Calibration accuracy depends on the quality of initial priors, and poor initial estimates may lead to convergence issues

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core mechanism of using separate NeRFs per sensor and visibility grids to prevent overfitting - supported by extensive experimental validation across multiple datasets
- Medium confidence in the alternating optimization approach - while the results show improvement, the convergence properties and sensitivity to initialization are not fully characterized
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of the NeRF delaying schedule - demonstrated in ablation studies but the exact optimal scheduling strategy is not explored in depth

## Next Checks

1. Sensitivity Analysis: Test the method with deliberately incorrect initial calibration parameters to determine the range of initial errors that still allow successful convergence.
2. Scalability Test: Evaluate performance with a larger number of sensors (beyond the 4-camera + 2-LiDAR setup) to assess memory and computational scaling.
3. Real-world Deployment: Validate the method on a live autonomous vehicle platform with GPS/IMU reference to assess robustness to sensor noise and environmental variations not captured in the benchmark datasets.
