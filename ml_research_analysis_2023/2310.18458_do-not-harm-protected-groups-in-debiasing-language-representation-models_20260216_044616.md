## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18458
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed xGAP-Debias framework shows that reducing bias often degrades performance for all demographic groups, including those intended to be protected

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces xGAP-Debias, a framework for evaluating fairness in debiasing techniques for language models. The authors test four debiasing methods on a real-world text classification task and find that while bias reduction is achieved, it comes at the cost of degrading performance across all demographic groups. The framework advocates for debiasing techniques that maintain good downstream performance while ensuring no harm to protected groups. None of the evaluated methods achieved over 50% satisfaction rate under the proposed criteria, highlighting the need for comprehensive fairness assessment.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four debiasing techniques (Equality of Opportunity, Decoupled Classifiers, Counterfactual Data Augmentation, and Iterative Nullspace Projection) on the Bias in Bios dataset using Logistic Regression classifiers. The xGAP-Debias framework measures performance using True Positive Rate (TPR) and Group Average Precision (GAP) metrics, with satisfaction criteria requiring both "do no harm" to protected groups and improvement in equality. The evaluation uses 5-run repetitions for statistical significance and considers both weighted and unweighted satisfaction rates.

## Key Results
- None of the four debiased techniques achieved over 50% satisfaction rate under base and advanced criteria
- GAPRMS between protected attributes decreased substantially after debiasing, but at the expense of worsening model prediction for both groups
- Weighted performance of debiasing techniques was more distinctive than unweighted performance
- The framework revealed that bias reduction often comes at the cost of degrading performance for all demographic groups, including protected ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** xGAP-Debias reveals that debiasing interventions can harm protected groups by reducing their model performance while attempting to reduce bias.
- **Mechanism:** The framework evaluates both overall and group-wise performance using TPR and GAP metrics, identifying situations where bias reduction comes at the cost of degrading performance for all demographic groups.
- **Core assumption:** Performance metrics for protected groups should not worsen after debiasing, and the GAP between groups should decrease substantially.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "reducing biasing is at the cost of degrading performance for all demographic groups, including those the debiasing techniques aim to protect"
  - [section]: "we observe that after debiasing, across all groups, the GAPRMS between the protected attributes decreases substantially. However, this comes at the expense of worsening the model prediction for both groups"

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Weighted vs. unweighted satisfaction rates reveal the impact of debiasing on different population sizes within professions.
- **Mechanism:** By considering both weighted and unweighted calculations with respect to group population, the framework shows how debiasing affects larger vs. smaller demographic groups differently.
- **Core assumption:** The impact of debiasing should be evaluated considering the actual population distribution of demographic groups.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section]: "While the total number of satisfaction is similar, one technique might have the satisfaction on the profession with a large population"
  - [section]: "The weighted performance of the debiasing techniques is more distinctive than the unweighted"

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** None of the evaluated debiasing techniques achieves over 50% satisfaction rate under both base and advanced satisfaction criteria, highlighting the need for multiple assessments of fairness.
- **Mechanism:** The framework sets a high bar for satisfaction by requiring both "do no harm" and "improvement in equality" criteria to be met, revealing the limitations of current debiasing approaches.
- **Core assumption:** A debiasing technique should guarantee that after debiasing, the performance of the protected group does not worsen and the performance gap between protected attributes decreases substantially.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "none of the four debiasing methods achieves over 50% satisfaction rate under these criteria"
  - [section]: "none of them exceed 50% satisfaction rate under both base and advanced satisfaction criteria"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** True Positive Rate (TPR) as a performance metric
  - **Why needed here:** TPR is used to measure the accuracy of the model in identifying true positives within the overall population of the designated positive group(s), which is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of debiasing techniques.
  - **Quick check question:** How does TPR differ from accuracy, and why is it important in the context of evaluating debiasing techniques?

- **Concept:** Group Average Precision (GAP) as a fairness metric
  - **Why needed here:** GAP quantifies the disparity in the model's classification task performance across different prediction classes and protected attributes, which is essential for assessing the fairness of debiasing interventions.
  - **Quick check question:** How is GAP calculated, and what does it reveal about the fairness of a model's predictions across different demographic groups?

- **Concept:** Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) as a debiasing technique
  - **Why needed here:** CDA is one of the evaluated debiasing techniques, and understanding its mechanism is crucial for interpreting the results of the xGAP-Debias framework.
  - **Quick check question:** How does CDA work, and what are its potential limitations in achieving fairness without harming protected groups?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Debiasing technique application -> Logistic Regression training -> TPR/GAP evaluation -> Satisfaction rate calculation
- **Critical path:** The critical path involves applying debiasing techniques to the model, evaluating the performance using TPR and GAP metrics, and assessing the satisfaction rates based on the "do no harm" and "improvement in equality" criteria.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The framework trades off simplicity for comprehensiveness by using multiple metrics and criteria to evaluate debiasing techniques, which may increase the complexity of the evaluation process.
- **Failure signatures:** Failure occurs when debiasing techniques reduce bias at the cost of degrading performance for protected groups, or when they fail to meet the satisfaction criteria for both base and advanced satisfaction.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Apply each debiasing technique to the Bias in Bios dataset and calculate the overall TPR and GAPRMS before and after debiasing.
  2. Evaluate the group-wise TPR and GAP for each profession and gender group to assess the impact of debiasing on different subgroups.
  3. Calculate the weighted and unweighted satisfaction rates for each debiasing technique to determine their effectiveness in achieving fairness without harm.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do different debiasing techniques compare when evaluated across diverse NLP tasks beyond text classification?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors mention that their proposed xGAP-Debias framework allows for flexibility in using any desired evaluation metric to match the use case at hand, suggesting the need to test across various tasks.
- **Why unresolved:** The study focuses solely on a multiclass text classification task, limiting generalizability to other NLP applications like language generation or named entity recognition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Conducting experiments applying the four debiasing techniques (EO, Decoupled, CDA, INLP) to diverse NLP tasks and comparing their performance and fairness metrics across these tasks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the long-term effects of debiasing techniques on model performance and fairness in real-world applications?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note that debiasing techniques often degrade performance for all demographic groups, including protected ones, suggesting potential unintended consequences in practical use.
- **Why unresolved:** The study is limited to a single dataset and short-term performance metrics, without considering how debiasing might affect model behavior over time or in dynamic environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal studies tracking model performance and fairness metrics across different time periods and real-world deployment scenarios after applying debiasing techniques.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do debiasing techniques affect intersectional fairness when considering multiple protected attributes simultaneously?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors acknowledge that gender is more complex and non-binary, but limit their study to binary gender as the protected attribute, highlighting a gap in understanding intersectional effects.
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework only considers single protected attributes, potentially missing compound biases that emerge when multiple demographic factors interact.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Extending the xGAP-Debias framework to handle multiple protected attributes and evaluating debiasing techniques on datasets with intersectional demographic information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to binary gender as the primary protected attribute, not accounting for non-binary identities or intersectional characteristics
- Focus on a single text classification task with Logistic Regression may not capture the full complexity of modern language models
- The 50% satisfaction threshold appears arbitrary without theoretical justification for why this represents an acceptable level of fairness achievement

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the methodological framework itself - the xGAP-Debias approach provides a systematic way to evaluate debiasing techniques by considering both performance preservation and fairness improvement.
- **Medium confidence** in the empirical findings that none of the four debiasing techniques achieve over 50% satisfaction rate, given the consistent experimental setup and multiple debiasing methods tested.
- **Low confidence** in the claim that debiasing inherently harms protected groups, as this conclusion is based on a limited set of techniques and a single application domain.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the xGAP-Debias framework to additional text classification tasks (sentiment analysis, hate speech detection) to verify if the observed trade-offs between bias reduction and performance degradation persist across different applications.
2. Test the same debiasing techniques with transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) instead of Logistic Regression to determine if more sophisticated architectures can achieve better satisfaction rates while maintaining fairness.
3. Implement additional fairness evaluation metrics such as Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity, and Counterfactual Fairness to cross-validate whether the TPR-GAP framework captures all relevant aspects of fairness in debiasing language models.
