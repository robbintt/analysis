# Deep Learning for Time Series Classification of Parkinson's Disease Eye Tracking Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.16381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16381
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ROCKET with SFD pruning achieves 96% accuracy for subject-level Parkinson's disease classification from fixation data

## Executive Summary
This study explores deep learning approaches for Parkinson's disease classification using eye-tracking data from saccade experiments. Rather than relying on hand-crafted saccade features, the authors utilize raw fixation data from the preparatory phase before each trial. Two state-of-the-art time series classification models, InceptionTime and ROCKET, are implemented and compared. The results demonstrate that fixation data carries valuable information about health status, with ROCKET outperforming InceptionTime and achieving particularly strong results at the subject level (96% accuracy) when combined with a novel feature selection method called Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD).

## Method Summary
The study processes eye-tracking data from 63 subjects (28 healthy controls, 28 Parkinson's patients on medication, 30 Parkinson's patients off medication) performing prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. Each trial consists of approximately 1.5 seconds of fixation data before target movement, yielding 4-dimensional time series (x-position, y-position, x-velocity, y-velocity). The data is preprocessed with a 20Hz high-pass filter to remove head movements and tremor, then split into fixation trials. Two deep learning models are trained: InceptionTime with 4 inception modules and ROCKET with 10,000 random convolutional kernels. The ROCKET model is further pruned using Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD), which iteratively removes the least informative features while maintaining classification accuracy.

## Key Results
- ROCKET achieves 68% accuracy for trial-level classification and 88% accuracy for subject-level classification
- SFD pruning improves ROCKET performance to 73% trial-level accuracy and 96% subject-level accuracy
- SFD reduces model parameters by 92% while maintaining or improving accuracy
- Fixation data shows low inter-subject variability, making it suitable for machine learning applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fixation data contains relevant information about Parkinson's disease status with low inter-subject variability.
- Mechanism: The simplicity and homogeneity of the fixation task reduces subject-specific features in the data, allowing models to learn disease-relevant features without overfitting.
- Core assumption: Fixation data variability is dominated by disease state rather than individual differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results suggest that fixation data has low inter-subject variability and potentially carries useful information about brain cognitive and motor conditions"
  - [section] "This low variability likely stems from the simplicity and homogeneity of the fixation task"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks direct fixation data studies but includes related work on ROCKET and Parkinson's classification
- Break condition: If fixation task introduces significant individual differences or disease status does not dominate the signal variance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ROCKET's random convolutional kernels can extract relevant features from fixation time series without overfitting.
- Mechanism: The large number of non-trainable random kernels transform the input into a high-dimensional feature space where linear classification can separate classes effectively.
- Core assumption: The random kernels can capture relevant temporal patterns in fixation data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ROCKET outperforms InceptionTime, achieving 68% accuracy for trial classification"
  - [section] "Only the linear classifier needs to be fit to the data. The low number of trainable parameters... mitigate the risk of overfitting"
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - corpus includes the original ROCKET paper and multiple studies showing ROCKET's effectiveness
- Break condition: If fixation data lacks the temporal structure that random kernels can exploit, or if the data is too noisy for this approach.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) improves model generalization by removing irrelevant features.
- Mechanism: The linear classifier in ROCKET allows iterative removal of the least informative features, reducing model complexity while maintaining or improving accuracy.
- Core assumption: Some features extracted by ROCKET are irrelevant to the classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "achieving an accuracy of 96%... while reducing model parameters by 92%"
  - [section] "SFD significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising the test set accuracy"
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - corpus includes the original SFD paper showing this approach works across multiple datasets
- Break condition: If all features extracted by ROCKET are equally informative, or if feature removal removes critical information.

  - Quick check question: Why can't we just use traditional machine learning on raw fixation data without temporal modeling?

- Concept: Eye tracking data characteristics
  - Why needed here: Knowing the data structure and preprocessing requirements for eye movement analysis
  - Quick check question: What makes fixation data different from saccade data in terms of signal characteristics?

  - Why needed here: Choosing between InceptionTime and ROCKET based on dataset characteristics
  - Quick check question: When would a deep learning model be preferred over a simpler method like ROCKET for time series classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw data → High-pass filtering → ROCKET transformation → Linear classification → SFD pruning
- Critical path: Raw data → High-pass filtering → ROCKET transformation → Linear classification → SFD pruning
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs interpretability, computation time vs accuracy, feature retention vs generalization
- Failure signatures: Poor accuracy indicates either insufficient disease signal in data or inappropriate model choice; overfitting suggests need for stronger regularization or simpler models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline accuracy with simple features vs raw data to confirm fixation data contains disease signal
  2. Compare ROCKET performance with different numbers of kernels to find optimal complexity
  3. Apply SFD with varying feature retention percentages to find the sweet spot between model size and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific involuntary eye movement patterns in fixation data carry the most diagnostic information for Parkinson's disease?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that subtle involuntary eye movements during fixation convey significant health-related information, but does not specify which patterns are most informative.
- Why unresolved: The study uses deep learning models that learn features automatically, but does not analyze or interpret what specific eye movement patterns the models identify as disease markers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the learned features or attention maps from the neural networks showing which specific eye movement characteristics (e.g., microsaccades, drift patterns, velocity distributions) are most correlated with disease status.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do fixation data characteristics differ between early-stage and advanced Parkinson's disease patients?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that they do not have access to data from the same individual at different disease stages, which is a major limitation.
- Why unresolved: The study only examines PD vs HC classification without exploring disease progression or staging, as they lack longitudinal data from the same subjects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal eye-tracking data from PD patients at multiple disease stages, allowing analysis of how fixation patterns change as the disease progresses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would fixation data from different experimental paradigms (e.g., smooth pursuit, visual search tasks) provide complementary diagnostic information to saccade experiments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their study is limited to a single experimental paradigm and suggest future work should expand to other saccade experiments.
- Why unresolved: The study only uses prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, limiting understanding of whether fixation data generalizes across different eye-tracking paradigms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of fixation data classification performance across multiple experimental paradigms (smooth pursuit, visual search, free viewing) to determine if certain tasks provide superior diagnostic information.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (63 subjects) may limit generalizability to larger, more diverse populations
- Exclusive focus on eye-tracking data from saccade experiments leaves uncertainty about results translating to other biomarker modalities
- Lack of systematic optimization of filter cutoff frequencies and model parameters may impact reproducibility

## Confidence

- Trial-level classification claims (68-73% accuracy): Medium confidence - results are consistent across cross-validation folds but limited by sample size
- Subject-level classification claims (88-96% accuracy): Medium confidence - high performance but may reflect dataset-specific patterns
- Mechanism claims about fixation data properties: Low confidence - theoretical justification but limited empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on an independent dataset with larger sample size and different demographics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies with varying high-pass filter cutoffs to determine optimal frequency thresholds for tremor removal
3. Compare fixation-based classification performance against established saccade-based features to quantify the added value of the proposed approach
