# Adversarial Infrared Blocks: A Multi-view Black-box Attack to Thermal Infrared Detectors in Physical World

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.10712
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10712
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: AdvIB achieves over 80% attack success rate in physical world tests and 51.2% average success rate against advanced detectors.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Adversarial Infrared Blocks (AdvIB), a novel physical attack method designed to fool thermal infrared detectors in real-world scenarios. The method optimizes physical parameters of infrared blocks (position, angle, length, color) to create stealthy adversarial patterns that disrupt pedestrian detection. By attaching these blocks to the inside of clothing, the attack remains covert while effectively manipulating the thermal signature captured by infrared cameras. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate AdvIB's effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness across digital simulations and physical deployments.

## Method Summary
AdvIB employs Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize physical parameters of hot and cold infrared blocks that are attached to clothing. The method models each block using four parameters: position, length, angle, and color (hot at 53°C or cold at 24°C). DE optimizes these parameters to minimize the detector's confidence in identifying pedestrians, operating in a black-box setting without requiring gradient information. The attack is evaluated on the FLIR-IB dataset (1011 infrared images of pedestrians) using YOLOv3 as the target detector, with robustness tested against YOLOv5 and YOLOv8.

## Key Results
- Physical tests show over 80% attack success rate under various distances (3.8m, 5.4m, 7.0m) and angles (0°, 90°, 180°)
- Digital attack success rate of 74.2% against YOLOv3, 52.4% against YOLOv5, and 30.8% against YOLOv8
- Average attack success rate of 51.2% against advanced detectors demonstrates robustness
- Stealthy design with blocks attached inside clothing maintains covertness while achieving high effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optimizing physical parameters of infrared blocks fools thermal infrared detectors from multiple angles.
- Mechanism: AdvIB optimizes position, angle, length, and color of hot and cold blocks to create adversarial patterns that alter thermal signatures and disrupt detector performance.
- Core assumption: Infrared cameras capture grayscale thermal patterns where hot blocks appear white and cold blocks appear black, and these patterns can be optimized to deceive detectors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By optimizing the physical parameters of the adversarial infrared blocks, this method can execute a stealthy black-box attack on thermal imaging system from various angles."
  - [section] "Our modeling of the infrared block is demonstrated in Figure 3, where four physical parameters are utilized to represent an infrared block."
- Break condition: If infrared camera resolution is too low to detect subtle temperature differences or if detectors are robust against such adversarial patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attaching infrared blocks to inside of clothing enhances stealthiness.
- Mechanism: Internal placement keeps perturbations invisible to naked eye under normal lighting while remaining detectable by infrared cameras, making attack difficult for human observers to detect.
- Core assumption: Infrared blocks are small enough not to significantly alter clothing appearance in visible light while remaining effective in thermal imaging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For stealthiness, our method involves attaching the adversarial infrared block to the inside of clothing, enhancing its stealthiness."
  - [section] "The hot and cold blocks are attached to the inside of a pedestrian's clothing, making the perturbation difficult for the human eye to detect."
- Break condition: If clothing material is too thick to allow thermal signature through or if placement causes noticeable bulges.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Differential Evolution algorithm effectively optimizes physical parameters in black-box setting.
- Mechanism: DE finds optimal infrared block configuration without requiring gradient information from target detector by iteratively improving attack parameters through population evolution.
- Core assumption: DE can handle non-differentiable and combinatorial nature of physical parameters, with detector output serving as reliable fitness measure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Instead, we use the differential evolution algorithm (DE) [15] to optimize the physical parameters of infrared blocks."
  - [section] "The advantages of using DE to optimize AdvIB include: 1) DE employs a differential mutation operator for genetic manipulation, which is simple to implement..."
- Break condition: If search space is too large for DE to converge or detector output is too noisy for meaningful optimization feedback.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Infrared imaging and thermal detection principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how infrared cameras capture thermal signatures and how detectors process this information is crucial for designing effective adversarial attacks.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a hot block and a cold block in terms of their appearance in an infrared image?

- Concept: Adversarial machine learning and black-box attacks
  - Why needed here: AdvIB operates without knowledge of target model's internals, requiring understanding of generating effective perturbations in such settings.
  - Quick check question: How does a black-box attack differ from a white-box attack in terms of information available to attacker?

- Concept: Differential Evolution algorithm and optimization techniques
  - Why needed here: DE is core optimization algorithm used to find most effective infrared block configuration, so understanding its mechanics is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are key differences between Differential Evolution and gradient-based optimization methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Infrared Block Modeling -> Differential Evolution Optimization -> Adversarial Sample Generation -> Physical Deployment -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Define infrared block model with physical parameters
  2. Set up Differential Evolution with appropriate mutation and crossover rates
  3. Implement fitness function based on detector output probability
  4. Run optimization to find most adversarial block configuration
  5. Generate adversarial sample and evaluate effectiveness
  6. Deploy physical attack and test robustness in real-world conditions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of infrared blocks vs. stealthiness: More blocks may increase effectiveness but reduce stealthiness
  - Block size vs. visibility: Larger blocks may be more effective but more noticeable
  - Optimization iterations vs. computation time: More iterations may yield better results but take longer to compute

- Failure signatures:
  - Low attack success rate: Optimized blocks are not effective enough to fool detector
  - High visibility: Blocks are noticeable to human observers, compromising stealthiness
  - Poor robustness: Attack fails under different distances, angles, or environmental conditions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test effectiveness of different numbers of infrared blocks (4, 7, 10) on simple detector
  2. Evaluate impact of block size (6%, 12%, 16% of bounding box width) on attack success rate
  3. Assess robustness of attack at different distances (3.8m, 5.4m, 7.0m) and angles (0°, 90°, 180°)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Limited environmental testing: Physical experiments conducted under specific controlled conditions without addressing impact of wind, rain, humidity, or varying temperatures on thermal signature.
- Temperature control challenges: Maintaining precise temperature control for cold blocks (24°C) in varying ambient conditions presents significant practical implementation challenges not addressed.
- Generalization concerns: Attack success rate varies significantly across different detector architectures (74.2% for YOLOv3 vs 30.8% for YOLOv8), suggesting method may not be robust across different systems.

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in digital attack effectiveness claims. Promising results against YOLOv3 and advanced detectors, but significant variation across architectures suggests limited robustness.
- Low confidence in physical world deployment claims. Over 80% success rate reported but limited experimental details, environmental conditions, or sample size provided for validation.
- Medium confidence in Differential Evolution optimization effectiveness. Well-established algorithm but insufficient detail about parameter tuning or convergence analysis provided.

## Next Checks
1. **Environmental Robustness Testing**: Conduct physical experiments across wide range of environmental conditions (temperatures from -10°C to 35°C, humidity levels, wind speeds, lighting conditions) to assess how these factors affect thermal signature and attack effectiveness of infrared blocks.

2. **Cross-Detector Generalization**: Test AdvIB method against broader range of thermal infrared detectors beyond three models evaluated, including different backbone architectures, training datasets, and parameter settings to assess true robustness and generalization capabilities.

3. **Human Perception Studies**: Conduct blinded human studies where participants view images/videos of people wearing infrared blocks under various conditions to empirically measure visibility and detectability of perturbations, directly validating stealthiness claims beyond theoretical assertions.
