# Equivariant geometric convolutions for emulation of dynamical systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.12585
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12585
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework for coordinate-free neural networks on geometric images with improved physics emulation accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GeometricImageNet, a framework for building neural networks that operate on geometric images containing vectors, tensors, and other structured data while maintaining coordinate freedom. The method extends convolution operations to geometric objects using outer products and tensor contractions while preserving equivariance to translations, rotations, and reflections. Experiments on 2D compressible Navier-Stokes emulation show improved accuracy and stability compared to baseline models, particularly when training data is limited.

## Method Summary
The framework generalizes standard convolutions to geometric images by treating tensor components with their proper transformation rules under coordinate changes. It uses invariant convolutional filters constructed through group averaging over hypercube symmetry groups, combined with tensor contractions to manage computational complexity. The architecture maintains equivariance to discrete translations, rotations, and reflections while generalizing standard CNNs through strategic use of tensor operations and order management.

## Key Results
- Improved accuracy and stability in 2D compressible Navier-Stokes emulation compared to baseline CNN models
- Better performance with limited training data due to coordinate freedom enforcement
- Demonstrated ability to enforce coordinate freedom without major architectural changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Framework enforces coordinate freedom by generalizing convolution to geometric images through outer products and tensor contractions
- Mechanism: Instead of treating vector/tensor components as independent channels, uses tensor operations (outer products, contractions, permutations) that respect mathematical structure of geometric objects
- Core assumption: Laws of physics are relationships between scalars, vectors, and tensors that hold regardless of coordinate system
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement on geometric generalization of convolution; previous work on group-theoretic equivariances

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Achieves equivariance to discrete translations, rotations, and reflections through invariant convolutional filters and group averaging
- Mechanism: Constructs Bd-invariant convolutional filters using group averaging over hypercube symmetry group Bd, proving equivariance under larger group GN,d
- Core assumption: If convolutional filters are invariant under symmetry group Bd, resulting convolutions are equivariant under GN,d
- Evidence anchors: Theorem 1 on equivariance properties; section on Bd-invariant tensor filters

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generalizes standard CNNs while maintaining computational efficiency through strategic contractions and tensor order management
- Mechanism: Caps maximum tensor order and uses contractions to reduce tensor order when it grows too large, avoiding combinatorial explosion
- Core assumption: Expressive power maintained even when capping maximum tensor order, reductions don't lose critical information
- Evidence anchors: Discussion of memory issues and tensor order management; numerical demonstration challenges

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor operations and their transformation properties under coordinate changes
  - Why needed here: Entire framework relies on understanding how vectors, tensors, and operations transform under coordinate changes
  - Quick check question: If you rotate a 2D vector field by 90 degrees counterclockwise, how do the x and y components transform?

- Concept: Group theory and representation theory basics
  - Why needed here: Framework uses group actions and representation theory to construct equivariant operations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a group acting on a space (alias view) versus acting on objects within that space (alibi view)?

- Concept: Convolutional neural network fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Framework generalizes CNNs, so understanding standard convolution and operations is necessary
  - Quick check question: In standard CNN, how does convolutional layer with learned filters differ from geometric convolution layer with fixed invariant filters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Convolution layers (with dilations) -> Contractions (to manage tensor order) -> Non-linear activations -> Final contraction -> Output
- Critical path: Input → Convolution layers → Contractions → Non-linear activations → Final contraction → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tensor order vs. memory: Higher tensor orders increase expressive power but also memory requirements
  - Fixed filters vs. learned filters: Fixed invariant filters ensure equivariance but may limit flexibility
  - Discrete vs. continuous symmetries: Discrete symmetries simplify implementation but may be less physically accurate
- Failure signatures:
  - Loss of equivariance: Check if filters are truly Bd-invariant through group averaging
  - Memory overflow: Monitor tensor order growth and adjust maximum order or add more contractions
  - Poor generalization: Verify that symmetry group matches problem domain symmetries
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement simple GeometricImageNet to learn gravitational field from point masses, comparing to standard CNN baseline
  2. Test coordinate freedom property by applying random rotations/reflections to input data and verifying output transforms accordingly
  3. Benchmark memory usage and runtime as tensor order increases, finding practical limits for hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Computational constraints in handling high tensor orders due to exponential memory growth
- Restriction to discrete symmetries (90-degree rotations) may not capture all relevant physical symmetries
- Numerical verification of complete filter characterization remains incomplete

## Confidence
- High confidence: Mathematical framework for geometric convolutions and equivariance properties is rigorously defined
- Medium confidence: Empirical results on Navier-Stokes emulation show improvements, but synthetic physics problems are simpler than real-world applications
- Low confidence: Completeness of invariant filter characterization and numerical verification remain open questions

## Next Checks
1. Implement and verify group averaging procedure for Bd-invariant filter construction on simple test case
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying tensor order caps and contraction frequencies to find optimal tradeoffs
3. Test framework on continuous symmetry groups using interpolation methods to bridge discrete-continuous gap
