# Modeling Risk in Reinforcement Learning: A Literature Mapping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.05231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05231
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Proposes a domain-agnostic risk framework and systematically maps 178 risk factors across 72 safe RL papers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic literature mapping of risk in safe reinforcement learning, proposing a general definition of risk and identifying key attributes including source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency, and timing. The study characterizes 178 risk factors across 72 papers, finding that hazard states and death states are the most common risk types. The authors observe that most research focuses on toy problems and engineering domains, using constrained criteria and risk-directed exploration techniques. The work highlights the need for explicit risk modeling in RL experiments and suggests future research directions, including multi-domain studies and the use of worst-case criterion techniques.

## Method Summary
The authors performed a systematic literature mapping following Petersen et al. guidelines, searching for papers on safe reinforcement learning from 2017-2022 across major digital libraries. They selected 72 relevant papers from thousands of initial results and extracted data on risk factors, experiments, and techniques. The methodology involved characterizing identified risk factors using seven proposed attributes (source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency, timing) and classifying them into 13 risk factor types. Papers were mapped to a safe RL taxonomy and application domains were identified to analyze distribution patterns across the field.

## Key Results
- Identified 178 risk factors across 72 papers, categorized into 13 types with hazard states and death states being most common
- Found that 57.5% of experiments used toy problems and 61.1% focused on engineering domains
- Most common risk mitigation techniques were constrained criteria (22.2%) and risk-directed exploration (13.9%)
- Only 11.1% of papers explicitly characterized risk factors using any of the proposed attributes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The paper defines a domain-agnostic risk framework that unifies risk modeling across diverse RL application domains.
- Mechanism: By decomposing risk into external attributes (source, target, severity) and internal attributes (uncertainty, interference, frequency, timing), the framework allows researchers to systematically identify and characterize risk factors independent of the specific domain.
- Core assumption: All risk factors in RL can be represented as sets of transitions with shared external and internal characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present definitions, characteristics, and types of risk that hold on multiple application domains."
  - [section 4] Formal definitions of risk as outcomes and risk factors as externally defined outcomes that are either domain or exploration risks.
  - [corpus] Related papers focus on specific risk modeling approaches, but this paper provides a unified framework across domains.
- Break condition: If risk factors cannot be represented as transition sets or if external/internal attribute decomposition fails to capture important domain-specific nuances.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The systematic literature mapping identifies common risk factor types that recur across different RL domains.
- Mechanism: By categorizing 178 risk factors from 72 papers into 13 types (hazard states, death states, random transitions, etc.), the study reveals which risks are most prevalent and how they are characterized across domains.
- Core assumption: Risk factors can be meaningfully grouped into types that share common characteristics and domain distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1.2] "Table 3 shows the 13 proposed risk factor types, the number of risk factors labeled, and the most common (mode) value for each characteristic."
  - [section 6.3] Mapping of papers to safe RL taxonomy shows distribution of approaches across domains.
  - [corpus] Related survey papers focus on specific domains or techniques, while this paper provides cross-domain risk type analysis.
- Break condition: If risk factor types identified are too domain-specific to be generalized or if the categorization misses important risk types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The risk profiling methodology provides actionable guidance for designing safe RL experiments.
- Mechanism: By asking researchers 11 specific questions about goals, obstacles, constraints, and potential hazards, the framework helps identify relevant risk factors before experiment design.
- Core assumption: Researchers can anticipate relevant risks through systematic questioning before implementing RL experiments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.1] "We suggest using the following list of questions to identify potential risk factors in an environment"
  - [abstract] "We encourage researchers to include explicit and detailed accounts of risk in future safe RL research reports"
  - [corpus] Related work focuses on technical approaches but lacks systematic risk identification methodology.
- Break condition: If the questioning framework fails to capture novel or unexpected risk types that emerge during actual experimentation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their formal representation
  - Why needed here: The entire risk framework is built on MDP formalism, with risk factors defined as sets of transitions within an MDP.
  - Quick check question: Can you write the formal tuple notation for an MDP and explain what each component represents?

- Concept: Risk-sensitive vs risk-neutral optimization in reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between traditional risk-neutral RL and risk-sensitive approaches that explicitly model and mitigate risk.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between expected cumulative reward and risk-sensitive utility functions?

- Concept: Systematic literature mapping methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper follows structured mapping guidelines to ensure comprehensive coverage of safe RL literature.
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in a systematic literature mapping study, and how do they differ from a traditional literature review?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Risk definitions and formalisms -> Risk factor attributes (source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency, timing) -> Risk factor types -> Application domain classification -> Technique taxonomy mapping
- Critical path: Identify risk factors → Characterize using attributes → Classify into types → Map to application domains → Relate to safe RL techniques
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive attribute system vs. practical usability; domain-agnostic framework vs. domain-specific precision; systematic methodology vs. flexibility for novel risks
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent risk characterization across papers; inability to map certain risk factors to defined types; framework doesn't capture important domain-specific risk nuances
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Characterize risk factors in a simple grid-world RL experiment using all seven attributes.
  2. Map identified risk factors to the 13 proposed risk factor types and verify consistency with paper's categorization.
  3. Apply the 11-question risk profiling methodology to design a new safe RL experiment and compare results with existing approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can risk factors be systematically identified and characterized in novel reinforcement learning problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a list of 11 questions to identify potential risk factors in an environment and suggest characterizing them according to their proposed attributes.
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge that not all risk factors can be accurately represented in the simulation, and the risk profiling process is iterative, suggesting that a sound methodology for risk profiling in novel RL problems is still needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a standardized risk profiling methodology that can be applied to novel RL problems, with case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and characterizing risk factors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential benefits and limitations of using multi-objective reinforcement learning to address the problem of negative rewards in reinforcement learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors discuss the problem of negative rewards in traditional RL and mention that multi-objective RL proposes a framework for finding a preference as the agent learns, potentially relieving the designer from the trial-and-error process of reward shaping.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the potential benefits and limitations of using multi-objective RL for this specific problem, and further research is needed to understand its effectiveness and applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of multi-objective RL techniques against traditional RL approaches in various domains, considering factors such as safety, efficiency, and scalability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can reinforcement learning techniques be designed to be more effective across multiple application domains, rather than being specialized for a single domain?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors highlight the scarcity of multi-domain studies in safe RL and suggest that designing RL techniques that function in different contexts is a big challenge.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a clear solution to this challenge, and further research is needed to develop techniques that can generalize across different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of RL techniques that demonstrate good performance across multiple domains, with an analysis of the factors that contribute to their generalizability.

## Limitations
- The literature mapping may have incomplete coverage due to search string limitations and non-indexed venues
- Risk factor categorization may not capture emerging risk types or domain-specific nuances
- Classification of risk attributes relies heavily on subjective interpretation of paper descriptions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The formal MDP-based definitions of risk and risk factors - these are mathematically rigorous and clearly specified in the paper.
- **Medium confidence**: The identification of common risk factor types across domains - while the categorization appears systematic, some types may be over-generalized from limited examples.
- **Medium confidence**: The risk profiling methodology for experimental design - the 11-question framework is practical but may not capture all relevant risk considerations for novel domains.

## Next Checks

1. **Framework Coverage Test**: Apply the risk framework to a set of 10 recent safe RL papers not included in the original corpus and verify that all risk factors can be characterized using the proposed attribute system.

2. **Domain Generalization Test**: Implement the risk profiling methodology for designing experiments in a domain significantly different from those studied in the corpus (e.g., healthcare or autonomous driving) and assess whether the framework captures domain-specific risk considerations.

3. **Attribute Consistency Test**: Have multiple researchers independently characterize the same set of risk factors from the corpus using the proposed attributes and measure inter-rater agreement to assess the framework's consistency and objectivity.
