# Syllable-level lyrics generation from melody exploiting character-level language model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.00863
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00863
- **Reference count**: 1
- **Primary result**: Proposes fine-tuning character-level language model (CANINE) for syllable-level lyrics generation, achieving higher scores for naturalness, correctness, coherence, originality, and poetic value according to ChatGPT evaluations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to syllable-level lyrics generation from symbolic melody by leveraging a fine-tuned character-level language model. The method fine-tunes Google's CANINE model on syllable sequences from lyrics data and combines its probabilities with a syllable-level Transformer generator during beam search. This approach aims to incorporate linguistic knowledge from the character level into syllable-level generation without the need to train expensive new syllable-level language models. Experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms a baseline Transformer, achieving higher scores across multiple quality dimensions according to ChatGPT-based evaluations.

## Method Summary
The approach fine-tunes a character-level language model (CANINE) on syllable sequences from lyrics data using Next Sentence Prediction. During generation, the syllable-level Transformer and the fine-tuned CANINE model's probabilities are combined with weights (75% CANINE, 25% Transformer) during beam search. This allows the system to leverage character-level linguistic knowledge for syllable-level tasks. The method uses symbolic melodies of 20 notes as input and generates syllable-level lyrics.

## Key Results
- Proposed method outperforms baseline Transformer in naturalness, correctness, coherence, originality, and poetic value according to ChatGPT evaluations
- Achieves higher scores across all five evaluation dimensions on scale 1-10
- Demonstrates effectiveness of incorporating character-level linguistic knowledge into syllable-level generation
- Shows that fine-tuning existing character-level models can avoid expensive training of new syllable-level language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning a character-level language model on syllable sequences improves syllable-level lyrics generation by transferring linguistic patterns from character to syllable level. The CANINE model learns character-level patterns that are beneficial when adapted to syllable-level tasks.

### Mechanism 2
Combining probabilities from syllable-level Transformer and fine-tuned character-level model during beam search improves coherence and correctness. The Transformer generates candidates based on melody while CANINE evaluates them based on previously generated lyrics.

### Mechanism 3
ChatGPT-based evaluation provides nuanced assessment of generated lyrics quality compared to traditional metrics. By specifying lyrics characteristics to ChatGPT, more accurate evaluations are achieved.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer architecture**: Why needed - used as syllable-level generator for melody-to-lyrics task. Quick check - What are key components of Transformer and how do they contribute to sequence-to-sequence tasks?
- **Language model fine-tuning**: Why needed - fine-tunes CANINE on syllable sequences for better syllable-level generation. Quick check - What is purpose of fine-tuning pre-trained model vs training from scratch?
- **Beam search decoding**: Why needed - combines probabilities from Transformer and CANINE during generation. Quick check - How does beam search differ from greedy decoding and what are advantages in lyrics generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Melody encoder -> Syllable-level Transformer generator -> Fine-tuned CANINE model -> Beam search -> Generated lyrics -> ChatGPT evaluator
- **Critical path**: Melody encoder → Syllable-level Transformer generator → Fine-tuned character-level language model → Beam search → Generated lyrics → ChatGPT evaluator
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using pre-trained character-level model vs training new syllable-level model from scratch; balancing weights of Transformer and language model probabilities; ChatGPT evaluation vs traditional metrics or human evaluation
- **Failure signatures**: Generated lyrics lack coherence despite fine-tuned model; ChatGPT evaluation doesn't align with human judgment; model fails to capture complex syllable-word-sentence relationships
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Evaluate baseline Transformer without fine-tuned CANINE, 2) Fine-tune CANINE on syllable sequences and assess impact, 3) Experiment with different weights for combining Transformer and CANINE probabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does fine-tuning CANINE approach compare to training dedicated syllable-level language model in terms of performance and computational efficiency? The paper only compares to baseline Transformer, not to directly trained syllable-level model.

- **Open Question 2**: How do results vary when using different character-level pre-trained models other than CANINE? Only CANINE is used, so impact of model choice is unknown.

- **Open Question 3**: How robust are ChatGPT-based evaluations across different prompts and criteria? Paper mentions using two prompts but doesn't explore sensitivity to different evaluation approaches.

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on ChatGPT-based evaluations may introduce variability and subjectivity
- Specific architecture and hyperparameters of baseline Transformer generator not fully specified
- Claims based on automated evaluations rather than direct human judgments or objective metrics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of fine-tuning CANINE and combining probabilities during beam search is technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of outperforming baseline methods supported by results but ChatGPT evaluation introduces uncertainty
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion about avoiding expensive training may oversimplify computational costs of fine-tuning CANINE

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Validation**: Conduct small-scale human evaluation to verify if ChatGPT assessments align with human judgments on naturalness, coherence, and poetic value

2. **Architecture Replication**: Attempt to replicate baseline Transformer with varying architectures and hyperparameters to assess result robustness

3. **Alternative Fine-tuning Approaches**: Explore different fine-tuning strategies for character-level model to evaluate sensitivity to these choices
