# FREIDA: A Framework for developing quantitative agent based models based on qualitative expert knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00505
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: FREIDA enables validated agent-based modeling in data-sparse domains by systematically integrating qualitative expert knowledge through Expected System Behaviors

## Executive Summary
FREIDA is a novel framework that addresses the challenge of developing validated agent-based models (ABMs) in domains with limited quantitative data, particularly criminal networks. The framework introduces Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) - Calibration and Validation Statements that provide a unified quantitative scoring mechanism for both qualitative and quantitative data inputs. Through a structured four-phase process, FREIDA enables systematic model development, validation, and refinement using expert-derived statements rather than requiring extensive traditional datasets.

The framework was demonstrated through a criminal cocaine network case study, showing that ESBs enable effective model calibration and validation using expert knowledge. The approach achieves global optimization in parameter tuning and reveals sensitivity to key parameters like criminal capital thresholds. This methodology provides a validated pathway for computational modeling in domains where traditional data-driven approaches are insufficient, offering a practical solution for integrating qualitative insights into quantitative model development and assessment.

## Method Summary
FREIDA employs a four-phase iterative framework: Information Acquisition (defining research questions and sourcing data through ODD+D protocol, expert interviews, and case files), Application (developing conceptual and computational models using training statements), Validation (validating models with holdout data and validation statements), and Iteration (conducting sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification). The core innovation is the Expected System Behaviors mechanism, which translates qualitative expert knowledge into testable propositions scored as true/false or partially true, enabling unified calibration and validation without extensive quantitative datasets.

## Key Results
- Successfully developed and validated an ABM for criminal cocaine networks using only qualitative expert knowledge and limited quantitative data
- Achieved global optimization in parameter tuning through stochastic optimization of Expected System Behaviors
- Demonstrated sensitivity to key parameters including criminal capital thresholds that influence kingpin replacement dynamics
- Showed that ESBs enable systematic calibration and validation without requiring traditional large-scale quantitative datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FREIDA enables validated ABM development in data-sparse domains by systematically incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data through Expected System Behaviors (ESBs).
- Mechanism: The framework uses Calibration and Validation Statements derived from qualitative expert knowledge to create a unified scoring mechanism that can evaluate model performance on the same footing as quantitative data, enabling systematic training and validation of ABMs.
- Core assumption: Expert-derived statements can be formulated as testable propositions that capture expected system behaviors and can be quantitatively scored.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FREIDA introduces Expected System Behaviors (ESBs), divided into Calibration and Validation Statements, to provide a quantitative scoring mechanism for both qualitative and quantitative data"
  - [section] "Training statements are formed using the case file and database knowledge and are specific to the behaviour and agent design within an ABM"
- Break condition: If expert knowledge cannot be translated into testable statements, or if statements are too subjective to score consistently.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The iterative four-phase structure ensures systematic development and refinement of ABMs.
- Mechanism: Each phase builds upon the previous one - starting with knowledge acquisition and data sourcing, moving to conceptual and computational model development, followed by validation through holdout data and scenario testing, and finally sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification to inform iteration.
- Core assumption: A structured, phased approach can capture the complexity of ABM development while maintaining systematic validation and refinement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our framework heavily relies on the involvement of domain experts who, together with modellers, inform design decisions, serve as qualitative data sources themselves, or identify and interpret external qualitative data inputs"
  - [section] "The four phases are regarded as one loop of network simulation. After the fourth phase, the network should be evaluated as to whether more loops are necessary to update or change the model"
- Break condition: If the phases are not followed sequentially, or if iteration does not occur when validation fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The use of Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) as a unified scoring mechanism enables model calibration and validation without requiring extensive quantitative datasets.
- Mechanism: ESBs are formulated as testable statements that can be scored as true or false (or partially true), providing a quantitative measure of model performance that is independent of traditional data-driven validation approaches.
- Core assumption: Qualitative insights from experts can be translated into measurable expectations about system behavior that can be evaluated through simulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data"
  - [section] "Validation statements should thus be formulated concretely and concern measurable behaviour and model outcomes (such as statistical output) and statements should be fulfilled or not, creating a validation score"
- Break condition: If ESBs cannot be formulated in a way that allows for consistent scoring, or if expert expectations are too vague to test.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic structure and components of ABMs (agents, behavior, environment) is essential for implementing FREIDA
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the three main components of an ABM and explain how they interact?

- Concept: Expected System Behaviors (ESBs)
  - Why needed here: ESBs are the core innovation of FREIDA and are used for both model calibration and validation
  - Quick check question: How would you formulate an ESB for a criminal network model that predicts the replacement of a kingpin?

- Concept: Sensitivity Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification
  - Why needed here: These techniques are used in the final phase to assess model robustness and inform iteration decisions
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, and how would you apply each to an ABM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Information Acquisition Phase -> Application Phase -> Validation Phase -> Iteration Phase
- Critical path: The most critical path is the translation from qualitative data (case files, expert interviews) to Expected System Behaviors (ESBs), as this is the core innovation that enables validation without extensive quantitative data.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Qualitative vs Quantitative data: FREIDA prioritizes qualitative data from experts when quantitative data is sparse, which may reduce model precision but increases applicability in data-sparse domains
  - Expert involvement vs automation: The framework requires significant expert involvement, which increases validity but also increases time and resource requirements
- Failure signatures:
  - Validation scores significantly lower than training scores indicate overfitting to expert expectations
  - Inability to formulate testable ESBs indicates either insufficient expert knowledge or inappropriate model scope
  - Sensitivity analysis showing high sensitivity to many parameters indicates model instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the ODD+D protocol with a small group of domain experts to define model scope and research questions
  2. Create a simple conceptual model based on case file analysis and test formulation of training statements
  3. Run a basic simulation with initial parameters and evaluate performance against a single training statement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the FREIDA framework be effectively extended to incorporate quantitative data alongside qualitative data in domains beyond criminal networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the framework's applicability in data-sparse domains like criminal networks but does not explicitly explore its use in domains with more abundant quantitative data.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the criminal network case study and does not provide examples or guidelines for adapting FREIDA to domains with richer quantitative datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or simulations demonstrating FREIDA's application in domains with substantial quantitative data, such as epidemiology or climate science, would provide insights into its broader applicability and necessary adaptations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential biases introduced by relying on domain experts' qualitative insights, and how can these be mitigated within the FREIDA framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the involvement of domain experts but does not address potential biases in their qualitative insights.
- Why unresolved: While the framework incorporates expert knowledge, it does not explicitly discuss methods to identify or mitigate biases in expert-derived statements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research exploring the impact of expert biases on model outcomes and the effectiveness of bias mitigation techniques, such as cross-validation with diverse expert panels, would address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the FREIDA framework handle uncertainty in qualitative data, and what methods can be used to quantify this uncertainty?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions uncertainty quantification in the final phase but does not detail how it applies to qualitative data specifically.
- Why unresolved: The framework's approach to uncertainty in qualitative data is not explicitly outlined, leaving ambiguity about how qualitative uncertainties are incorporated into model predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies or methodologies that demonstrate how qualitative uncertainties are quantified and integrated into FREIDA's validation and iteration phases would provide clarity on this aspect.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on expert-derived Expected System Behaviors introduces subjectivity that may vary across different expert groups
- The translation process from qualitative case files to quantifiable model rules lacks detailed specification of natural language processing techniques
- The stochastic optimization approach (SPSA) for parameter tuning is mentioned but not fully specified in terms of convergence criteria or iteration limits

## Confidence

- High confidence in the four-phase framework structure and its logical progression
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of Expected System Behaviors as a unified scoring mechanism, based on the case study demonstration
- Medium confidence in the applicability to other criminal network domains beyond the cocaine case study presented
- Low confidence in the generalizability to non-criminal ABM domains without modification

## Next Checks

1. Apply FREIDA to a different criminal network domain (e.g., human trafficking) and compare ESB formulation success rates and validation scores against the cocaine network case study
2. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the expert selection process by having multiple expert groups formulate ESBs for the same case files and comparing the resulting model performance
3. Implement the natural language processing pipeline for case file translation separately and evaluate its consistency and accuracy in extracting quantifiable rules across different case file formats and qualities
