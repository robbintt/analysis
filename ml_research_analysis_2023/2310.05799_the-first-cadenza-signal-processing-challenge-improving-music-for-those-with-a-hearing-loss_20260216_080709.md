# The First Cadenza Signal Processing Challenge: Improving Music for Those With a Hearing Loss

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05799
- Reference count: 30
- One-line primary result: Baseline systems achieved HAAQI scores of 0.255 (Demucs) and 0.225 (OpenUnmix) for Task 1, and 0.126 for Task 2 in improving music quality for hearing-impaired listeners.

## Executive Summary
The Cadenza project addresses the challenge of improving music quality for people with hearing loss through two signal processing tasks. Task 1 focuses on demixing music into vocals, bass, drums, and other components for personalized remixing, while Task 2 addresses enhancing music in car environments to overcome noise masking effects. The evaluation combines objective metrics using HAAQI and subjective ratings from hearing-impaired listeners. Baseline systems using Demucs and OpenUnmix models demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, with the project aiming to foster inclusive music technologies through signal processing and machine learning challenges.

## Method Summary
The challenge employs a two-task approach to improve music quality for hearing-impaired listeners. Task 1 uses demixing models (Demucs, OpenUnmix) to separate music into VDBO components from the MUSDB18-HQ dataset, which are then remixed based on listener audiograms and NAL-R hearing aid prescription. Task 2 processes car music by simulating noise conditions using FMA-Small and MTG-Jamendo datasets, accounting for car speed and gear. Audio quality is evaluated using the intrusive HAAQI metric with NAL-R amplification and subjective ratings from a panel of hearing-impaired listeners on clarity, harshness, distortion, and overall quality.

## Key Results
- Baseline demixing systems achieved HAAQI scores of 0.255 (Demucs) and 0.225 (OpenUnmix) for Task 1
- Task 2 baseline system achieved HAAQI score of 0.126 for car music enhancement
- Evaluation combines objective HAAQI metrics with subjective ratings from hearing-impaired listeners
- MUSDB18-HQ dataset used for Task 1, FMA-Small and MTG-Jamendo for Task 2
- Listener characterization data includes audiograms from Clarity and Scottish Section of Hearing Sciences datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating music into vocals, bass, drums, and other components enables personalized remixing that can improve audio quality for hearing-impaired listeners.
- Mechanism: The demixing process isolates different musical elements, allowing selective amplification of components that may be harder to hear due to hearing loss (e.g., vocals for lyrics clarity, high frequencies for richness).
- Core assumption: Hearing-impaired listeners have specific frequency or component deficits that can be addressed through selective amplification of demixed components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "where the music is decomposed into vocals, bass, drums and other components. These can then be intelligently remixed in a personalized way, to increase the audio quality for a person who has a hearing loss."
  - [section] "The first scenario (Task 1), a person with hearing loss listens to music through headphones without using their hearing aids. In the second scenario (Task 2), the listener is inside a moving car, listening to the music that is coming from the car stereo in the presence of noise, while wearing their hearing aids. Entrants to the challenges are tasked with personalizing the music signals to improve the audio quality."
- Break condition: If hearing loss patterns are too complex or varied for simple component-based remixing to address effectively, or if the demixing process introduces artifacts that degrade overall audio quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) provides an objective evaluation metric that correlates with subjective audio quality improvements for hearing aid users.
- Mechanism: HAAQI compares processed and reference signals, applying NAL-R hearing aid prescription amplification to ensure all frequency bands contribute equally to loudness, which improves audibility for hearing-impaired listeners.
- Core assumption: HAAQI's objective measurements align well with subjective experiences of hearing aid users when evaluating music quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The audio quality of the submissions will be evaluated using the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) for objective assessment and by a panel of people with hearing loss for subjective evaluation."
  - [section] "This is an intrusive metric in which the processed and reference signals are compared. In the evaluation, the HAAQI function is configured so that the reference signal has an amplification applied to it, so that all frequency bands contribute equally to its loudness. This amplification is the NAL-R hearing aid prescription [16]."
- Break condition: If HAAQI fails to capture important subjective aspects of music listening experience, or if the NAL-R prescription doesn't adequately address the diverse needs of hearing-impaired listeners.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Addressing car noise masking effects through signal processing can significantly improve music listening experience for hearing aid users in vehicles.
- Mechanism: By accounting for car noise, hearing aid processing, and car speed, the system can enhance music signals to overcome masking effects and improve audibility.
- Core assumption: Car noise significantly masks music components, and processing can effectively compensate for this masking to improve listening experience.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the second scenario, music is coming from car loudspeakers, and the music has to be enhanced to overcome the masking effect of the car noise. This is done by taking into account the music, the hearing ability of the listener, the hearing aid and the speed of the car."
  - [section] "The goal is to process music emitted by a car stereo, while accounting for the presence of simulated car noise. However, this is not a denoising problem, as participants do not have access to the exact noise signal."
- Break condition: If car noise characteristics are too variable or complex for the processing to effectively compensate, or if the processing introduces artifacts that degrade music quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal separation and source separation techniques
  - Why needed here: The challenge requires decomposing music into vocals, bass, drums, and other components, which is a fundamental signal separation problem.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in separating musical sources, and how do techniques like Demucs and OpenUnmix address these challenges?

- Concept: Hearing aid signal processing and NAL-R prescription
  - Why needed here: The challenge involves applying hearing aid processing algorithms and the NAL-R prescription to improve music audibility for hearing-impaired listeners.
  - Quick check question: How does the NAL-R hearing aid prescription work, and what are its limitations when applied to music rather than speech signals?

- Concept: Audio quality assessment metrics
  - Why needed here: The challenge uses HAAQI for objective evaluation and relies on subjective ratings from hearing-impaired listeners, requiring understanding of audio quality assessment.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between intrusive and non-intrusive audio quality assessment metrics, and why is HAAQI considered intrusive?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Music Enhancer -> Evaluation Processor -> HAAQI Calculator -> Listener Panel Ratings
- Critical path: Music Enhancer → Evaluation Processor → HAAQI Calculation → Listener Panel Ratings
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Demixing accuracy vs. processing latency: More accurate demixing may require more complex models and increase latency
  - Objective vs. subjective evaluation: Balancing HAAQI scores with subjective listener experiences
  - Generalization vs. personalization: Creating systems that work well across diverse hearing loss profiles while allowing for individual customization
- Failure signatures:
  - Low HAAQI scores despite good subjective ratings (or vice versa)
  - Inconsistent performance across different music genres or listening scenarios
  - Artifacts introduced by demixing or remixing processes that degrade overall audio quality
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline demixing systems (Demucs vs. OpenUnmix) on a subset of the MUSDB18-HQ dataset using HAAQI
  2. Test the effect of different NAL-R amplification levels on HAAQI scores and subjective ratings
  3. Evaluate the impact of car noise simulation parameters (speed, gear) on the effectiveness of music enhancement for hearing aid users

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between speech and music optimization in hearing aids to maximize overall user satisfaction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that hearing aids have historically focused on speech communication, but music listening is also important. It mentions that hearing aids optimized for speech perform poorly for music.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific data or recommendations on how to balance speech and music optimization in hearing aids. It only highlights the need for better technology to enhance music accessibility for people with hearing loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: User satisfaction studies comparing hearing aids optimized for speech versus those optimized for music, or a combination of both, would provide evidence to determine the optimal balance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different genres of music affect the perceived audio quality for hearing aid users, and how can this be accounted for in signal processing algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that for Task 2, only certain genres (Hip-Hop, Instrumental, International, Pop, Rock, classical, and orchestral) were included in the evaluation, as they are the most likely to be found in a car listening environment for the target listeners.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific data on how different genres of music affect the perceived audio quality for hearing aid users. It only mentions the selection of genres for the evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing the perceived audio quality of different music genres for hearing aid users, and how this information can be incorporated into signal processing algorithms, would provide evidence to address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of car noise on music listening for people with hearing loss, and how can this be effectively mitigated in signal processing algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes Task 2 as a scenario where music is coming from car loudspeakers, and the music has to be enhanced to overcome the masking effect of the car noise.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific data on the impact of car noise on music listening for people with hearing loss. It only mentions the need to enhance music to overcome the masking effect of car noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies measuring the impact of car noise on music listening for people with hearing loss, and the effectiveness of signal processing algorithms in mitigating this impact, would provide evidence to address this question.

## Limitations

- The study relies heavily on objective metrics (HAAQI) that may not fully capture subjective listening experiences of hearing-impaired individuals
- The generalizability of results is limited by the relatively small number of participants (24) in subjective evaluations
- The car noise simulation approach may not capture all real-world variability in vehicle acoustics and environmental conditions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The effectiveness of demixing techniques (Demucs, OpenUnmix) in separating musical components, as supported by established results in the audio source separation literature
- **Medium confidence**: The correlation between HAAQI scores and subjective listening experiences of hearing-impaired individuals, given the limited number of participants and potential individual variations in hearing loss profiles
- **Medium confidence**: The car noise simulation approach's ability to realistically represent real-world listening conditions, as the simulation parameters are based on measurements but may not capture all acoustic variations

## Next Checks

1. Expand subjective evaluation sample size: Conduct listening tests with a larger and more diverse group of hearing-impaired individuals to validate HAAQI's correlation with subjective experiences across different hearing loss profiles and music preferences

2. Test real-world car noise conditions: Compare the effectiveness of music enhancement algorithms in real vehicles with varying noise profiles against the simulated conditions to assess the practical applicability of the developed systems

3. Evaluate across music genres and styles: Assess the performance of demixing and enhancement algorithms on a wider variety of music genres and styles to ensure generalizability and identify any genre-specific challenges or artifacts
