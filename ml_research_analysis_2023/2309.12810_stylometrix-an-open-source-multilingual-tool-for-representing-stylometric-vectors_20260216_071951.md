# StyloMetrix: An Open-Source Multilingual Tool for Representing Stylometric Vectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.12810
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12810
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Open-source tool providing interpretable stylometric vectors for four languages with improved hate speech classification when combined with Transformer embeddings

## Executive Summary
StyloMetrix is an open-source tool that generates interpretable stylometric vectors for Polish, English, Ukrainian, and Russian texts. It computes 172-196 linguistic metrics covering grammar, syntax, and lexicon, providing fixed-length normalized vectors suitable for machine learning and deep learning applications. The tool has demonstrated effectiveness in content classification tasks, particularly when combined with Transformer embeddings like RoBERTa and HateBERT, improving classification performance across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The tool uses spaCy language models to parse text and extract linguistic features through rule-based counting of specific constructions (POS tags, dependencies, morphological features). Each metric is normalized by total token count to produce values in [0,1], creating fixed-length interpretable vectors. For classification tasks, StyloMetrix vectors can be used directly with simple algorithms like Random Forest or combined with Transformer embeddings by concatenation before fine-tuning with BCEWITHLOGITSLOSS.

## Key Results
- StyloMetrix vectors effectively classify content across four languages with simple algorithms achieving F1 scores up to 0.84
- Combining StyloMetrix vectors with RoBERTa/HateBERT embeddings improves hate speech classification F1 scores by 0.03-0.04
- The tool provides normalized, fixed-length vectors making it suitable for small datasets and enabling explainable AI through interpretable features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Stylometric vectors capture grammatical and syntactic patterns that correlate with text genre or author style. Each metric counts specific linguistic constructions and normalizes by token count, creating fixed-length interpretable features. Core assumption: Linguistic patterns differ systematically between genres/authors and are detectable via rule-based counting. Break condition: Heavy noise in text confuses the spaCy parser, making metric counts unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
Combining stylometric vectors with Transformer embeddings improves hate speech classification accuracy. StyloMetrix vectors provide interpretable syntactic cues that complement semantic embeddings, enabling better discrimination of abusive content. Core assumption: Stylometric cues are orthogonal to semantic embeddings and capture complementary signals for content moderation. Break condition: If semantic embeddings already capture all syntactic patterns, adding stylometric vectors yields diminishing returns.

### Mechanism 3
Fixed-length normalized vectors enable effective classification on small datasets without overfitting. Normalization by token count removes document-length bias; fixed length allows use of simple models that are less prone to overfitting than deep models on small data. Core assumption: Document length variation is the main source of bias in stylometric features for small corpora. Break condition: If class imbalance or feature collinearity dominates, normalization alone may not prevent poor generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: spaCy pipeline and tokenization
  - Why needed here: StyloMetrix relies on spaCy models for POS tagging, dependency parsing, and morphological analysis to compute metrics
  - Quick check question: Can you list the spaCy components used for Polish vs. English StyloMetrix pipelines?

- Concept: Linguistic feature engineering
  - Why needed here: Metrics are handcrafted rules over spaCy outputs; understanding POS tags, dependency labels, and morphological features is essential to modify or extend metrics
  - Quick check question: How would you create a metric that counts passive voice constructions in Polish using spaCy tags?

- Concept: Normalization and fixed-length representation
  - Why needed here: Each metric is divided by total token count to produce values in [0,1], enabling comparison across texts of different lengths
  - Quick check question: What happens to a metric value if a document has zero tokens matching the rule?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: spaCy language model → POS tagger, dependency parser, morphological analyzer → custom metric functions → CSV output
- Critical path:
  1. Load spaCy model for target language
  2. Run text through pipeline
  3. Apply each metric's rule over tokens
  4. Normalize counts by total tokens
  5. Write CSV with metric names and values
- Design tradeoffs: Rule-based metrics are interpretable but may miss unseen patterns; statistical embeddings are powerful but opaque. Fixed-length vectors simplify ML integration but lose sequential information.
- Failure signatures: Parser errors → zero or incorrect metric counts; Empty input folder → no CSV output; Mixed-language text → noisy metric values
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run StyloMetrix on a small Polish corpus and inspect CSV to verify metric ranges [0,1]
  2. Train a Random Forest classifier on StyloMetrix vectors to separate two Polish text genres; evaluate accuracy
  3. Concatenate StyloMetrix vectors with RoBERTa embeddings for hate speech detection; compare F1 to RoBERTa-only baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does StyloMetrix handle the challenge of maintaining consistency and accuracy when expanding to new languages beyond the current four? The paper mentions that StyloMetrix's design allows for rapid and convenient expansion to include additional languages, but does not provide details on the specific challenges or strategies for ensuring consistency and accuracy across different languages.

### Open Question 2
What is the long-term impact of using StyloMetrix vectors in combination with deep learning embeddings on the interpretability of AI models, particularly in sensitive applications? The paper discusses the potential of StyloMetrix vectors to enhance the performance of deep learning models and provide interpretability, but does not explore the long-term implications or potential limitations of this approach in sensitive domains.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of StyloMetrix compare to other state-of-the-art stylometric tools in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability? The paper presents the performance of StyloMetrix on specific tasks and datasets, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other leading stylometric tools.

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends heavily on quality and coverage of spaCy language models for each target language
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate contribution of individual metric categories to classification performance
- Fixed-length normalized vectors inherently lose sequential and contextual information present in original text

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: StyloMetrix successfully generates interpretable stylometric vectors for four target languages and provides fixed-length normalized representations suitable for ML model input.

**Medium Confidence**: StyloMetrix vectors improve hate speech classification accuracy when combined with Transformer embeddings, based on results from specific datasets without broader validation.

**Low Confidence**: Stylometric features capture orthogonal signals to semantic embeddings and are particularly effective for small datasets, lacking statistical proof of orthogonality and comparative studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Metric Categories**: Run classification experiments with subsets of StyloMetrix metrics (grammar-only, syntax-only, lexicon-only) to determine which categories contribute most to performance improvements, and measure correlation between stylometric and Transformer embeddings to assess orthogonality claims.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate StyloMetrix performance on out-of-domain datasets (e.g., legal documents, scientific abstracts, social media) for the same classification tasks to assess robustness beyond the training domains.

3. **Parser Error Impact Analysis**: Systematically introduce controlled noise (typos, grammatical errors, mixed languages) into test texts and measure degradation in metric accuracy and downstream classification performance to quantify sensitivity to parser quality and text cleanliness.
