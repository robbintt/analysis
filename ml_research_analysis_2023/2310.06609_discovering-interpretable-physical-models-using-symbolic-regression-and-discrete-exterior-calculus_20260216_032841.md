# Discovering Interpretable Physical Models using Symbolic Regression and Discrete Exterior Calculus

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06609
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06609
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Method combining SR and DEC discovers interpretable physical models from data with high recovery rates (up to 76%) and good generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to discover interpretable physical models from experimental data by integrating Symbolic Regression (SR) and Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). The method uses DEC as a mathematical language for physical theories, providing a type system for SR primitives that ensures mathematical consistency and reduces the search space. By encoding differential operators in a minimal set and leveraging the inherent discrete nature of DEC, the framework bypasses discretization schemes and improves model interpretability. The approach is validated on synthetic experimental data for three Continuum Physics models, demonstrating high recovery rates and good generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The method combines SR and DEC to discover interpretable physical models from experimental data. DEC provides a type system that enforces mathematical and physical consistency in symbolic expressions by assigning cochains to different dimensional simplices. The discrete Hodge star and coboundary operators are used to represent constitutive equations and encode differential operators in a minimal set. A genetic programming approach with strongly-typed genetic programming (STGP) is employed to evolve candidate models, which are evaluated by minimizing their energy functionals on the simplicial complex. The framework is implemented using the dctkit library for DEC and the alpine library for SR, with a simulation loop that iterates through generation, evaluation, and evolution phases.

## Key Results
- High recovery rates (up to 76%) for rediscovering Poisson equation, Euler's Elastica, and Linear Elasticity models from synthetic data
- Good generalization capabilities demonstrated by low mean-square error on test sets
- Compact and expressive symbolic representations achieved by encoding differential operators in a minimal set using DEC

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DEC provides a type system that enforces mathematical and physical consistency in symbolic expressions.
- Mechanism: By assigning cochains to different dimensional simplices (0-cochains for points, 1-cochains for lines, etc.), DEC ensures that operations like addition or multiplication only occur between compatible quantities, preventing nonsensical combinations.
- Core assumption: The simplicial complex structure accurately captures the geometry of the physical system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it allows to distinguish physical variables based on their spatial localization and thus guarantees that the generated symbolic expressions are mathematically and physically consistent;"
  - [section] "a type system for the mathematical operators and physical variables"
- Break condition: If the geometry is not well represented by a simplicial complex, the type system may fail to enforce correct constraints.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DEC encodes differential operators in a minimal set, leading to more compact and expressive symbolic models.
- Mechanism: Instead of using separate gradient, divergence, and curl operators, DEC uses coboundary and codifferential operators that work on cochains of various dimensions, reducing redundancy in the symbolic expression space.
- Core assumption: The discrete Hodge star and boundary/coboundary operators correctly approximate their continuous counterparts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it encodes the discrete counterpart of several differential operators (such as divergence, gradient and curl) in a minimal set of operators, thus making the symbolic representations more compact and expressive."
  - [section] "several differential operators (such as divergence, gradient and curl) in a minimal set of operators"
- Break condition: If the discrete Hodge star is not properly defined for the mesh, the differential operators may not behave as expected.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using DEC bypasses the need for discretization schemes when implementing physical models.
- Mechanism: Since DEC is inherently discrete, the governing equations can be directly represented and solved on the simplicial complex without converting from a continuous formulation.
- Core assumption: The physical system can be accurately represented by a discrete simplicial complex.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "being DEC a discrete theory, it bypasses the differential formulation, so that the governing equations can be readily implemented in computations, without the need for discretization schemes;"
  - [section] "being DEC a discrete theory, it bypasses the differential formulation"
- Break condition: If the continuous model requires high-order derivatives not well-represented in the discrete setting, the bypass may introduce errors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Simplicial Complex and Chains/Cochains
  - Why needed here: These form the basis of the discrete geometric representation of physical systems in DEC.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a p-chain and a p-cochain in the context of a 2D mesh?

- Concept: Boundary and Coboundary Operators
  - Why needed here: These operators encode topological relationships and allow the expression of physical laws in a coordinate-independent manner.
  - Quick check question: How does the coboundary operator relate to the gradient in classical vector calculus?

- Concept: Discrete Hodge Star
  - Why needed here: This operator maps primal cochains to dual cochains and is essential for representing constitutive equations.
  - Quick check question: What role does the discrete Hodge star play in relating a primal 0-cochain to a dual 2-cochain in a 2D mesh?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset generation -> SR evolution (generate, evaluate, evolve) -> Model selection -> Validation on test set
- Critical path: Problem setting → Dataset generation → SR evolution (generate, evaluate, evolve) → Model selection → Validation on test set
- Design tradeoffs: Using DEC provides mathematical consistency but may limit the search space compared to unconstrained SR; regularization helps prevent overfitting but may slow convergence.
- Failure signatures: Low recovery rate indicates either poor initial population diversity, inadequate regularization, or mismatch between the discrete model and the data generation process.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the Poisson equation recovery with a simple 2D grid to verify the basic DEC-SR integration.
  2. Test the effect of different regularization strengths (η) on model complexity and recovery rate.
  3. Apply the framework to a simple time-independent variational problem (e.g., linear elasticity in 1D) to validate vector-valued cochain handling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method scale with increasing problem complexity, such as higher-dimensional problems or systems with more complex boundary conditions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the method on three relatively simple continuum physics problems (Poisson equation, Euler's Elastica, Linear Elasticity) in 2D. There is no discussion of scaling to more complex problems or higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any analysis or experiments on how the method would perform with increasing problem complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the method to higher-dimensional problems (3D+) or problems with more complex geometries and boundary conditions would demonstrate the scalability of the approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches for symbolic regression and model discovery in physics, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) or sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions these methods in the introduction but does not provide any direct comparison of their performance to the proposed method.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method but does not benchmark it against other state-of-the-art approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of the proposed method with PINNs, SINDy, and other state-of-the-art approaches on a common set of problems would provide insights into the relative performance and advantages of each method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the method to noise and measurement errors in experimental data, and what is the impact of these errors on the accuracy of the discovered models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the use of synthetic experimental data with limited noise in the Poisson problem but does not discuss the impact of noise on the accuracy of the discovered models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any analysis of the robustness of the method to noise or measurement errors in experimental data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the method to datasets with varying levels of noise and measurement errors would demonstrate the robustness of the approach and its sensitivity to data quality.

## Limitations
- Recovery rates, while encouraging, indicate that exact model discovery remains challenging, particularly for complex systems like Euler's Elastica (56% recovery)
- Synthetic datasets used contain limited noise, and performance may degrade with real-world experimental data
- Current implementation is restricted to scalar fields, with vector-valued fields requiring additional handling

## Confidence
- Claim: Integration of DEC and SR effectively constrains the search space and improves mathematical consistency -> Medium
- Claim: The method discovers interpretable physical models with high recovery rates and good generalization -> Medium
- Claim: DEC encodes differential operators in a minimal set leading to more compact and expressive symbolic models -> High

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on experimental datasets with realistic noise levels and measurement uncertainties.
2. Extend the framework to discover time-dependent models and systems with vector fields.
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each DEC primitive to the overall recovery performance.
