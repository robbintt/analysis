# EduGym: An Environment and Notebook Suite for Reinforcement Learning Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10590
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10590
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: 86% of participants found EduGym useful for learning RL, with 89% reporting improved conceptual understanding and 77% reporting better practical understanding

## Executive Summary
EduGym is an educational suite designed to help students learn reinforcement learning by providing a set of environments and interactive notebooks. Each environment is tailored to illustrate a specific challenge in RL, such as exploration, partial observability, or stochasticity, and includes adjustable parameters to vary the difficulty. The interactive notebooks connect theoretical concepts with practical code, allowing students to experiment and better understand RL fundamentals. An evaluation showed that 86% of participants found EduGym useful for learning RL, with 89% reporting improved conceptual understanding and 77% reporting better practical understanding.

## Method Summary
EduGym provides a suite of environments and interactive notebooks specifically designed for reinforcement learning education. Each environment isolates a single RL challenge (like exploration, partial observability, or stochasticity) with tunable parameters to adjust difficulty. The associated Jupyter notebooks combine theoretical explanations with runnable code cells, allowing students to experiment with parameters and immediately observe the effects. The environments are low-dimensional to enable fast experimentation cycles, bridging the gap between theoretical textbooks and complex research codebases.

## Key Results
- 86% of participants found EduGym useful for learning RL
- 89% reported improved conceptual understanding of RL fundamentals
- 77% reported better practical understanding of RL implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EduGym bridges the gap between theoretical RL equations and practical implementation by providing interactive notebooks that directly connect mathematical concepts to executable code.
- Mechanism: The notebooks combine theoretical explanations with runnable code cells, allowing students to experiment with parameters and immediately observe the effects. This interactive approach helps students translate abstract mathematical formulations into concrete implementations.
- Core assumption: Students learn more effectively when they can actively experiment with code rather than just passively reading about concepts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: EduGym's specialized environments isolate specific RL challenges, making it easier for students to understand individual concepts without the confounding complexity of real-world research environments.
- Mechanism: Each environment is designed to highlight a single RL challenge (like exploration, partial observability, or stochasticity) with tunable parameters. This focused design allows students to systematically vary the difficulty of one challenge at a time.
- Core assumption: Students benefit from understanding individual RL challenges in isolation before tackling combined, real-world scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EduGym provides faster experimentation cycles through low-dimensional environments, enabling students to quickly test hypotheses and observe outcomes.
- Mechanism: By using simplified, low-dimensional environments instead of high-dimensional research environments, EduGym reduces computational overhead and allows for rapid iteration. Students can run experiments in seconds rather than minutes or hours.
- Core assumption: Faster experimentation leads to more learning iterations, which improves understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: All RL algorithms are built on MDP foundations. Understanding states, actions, rewards, and transitions is essential before tackling specific challenges.
  - Quick check question: What are the five components of an MDP tuple (S, A, p, r, γ) and what does each represent?

- Concept: Exploration vs Exploitation Trade-off
  - Why needed here: The Boulder environment specifically illustrates this fundamental RL challenge. Students need to understand why balancing these competing needs is essential.
  - Quick check question: In the context of the Boulder environment, why would a purely greedy policy fail to find the sparse reward at the top?

- Concept: On-policy vs Off-policy Learning
  - Why needed here: The Roadrunner environment demonstrates the practical differences between these update strategies. Understanding this distinction is crucial for choosing appropriate algorithms.
  - Quick check question: How would an on-policy method's solution differ from an off-policy method's solution in the Roadrunner environment, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environments -> Notebooks -> Documentation -> Evaluation framework -> Repository
- Critical path: Student clones repository and installs dependencies -> Student selects environment and opens associated notebook -> Student runs theoretical explanations and code cells -> Student experiments with parameters and observes outcomes -> Student completes exercises and assessments
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs Realism: Low-dimensional environments enable faster learning but may oversimplify real challenges
  - Abstraction vs Transparency: High-level implementations are easier to use but hide implementation details
  - Standardization vs Flexibility: Consistent interface across environments aids learning but may limit specialized features
- Failure signatures:
  - Notebooks fail to execute due to missing dependencies
  - Environments don't properly illustrate the intended challenges
  - Parameter tuning doesn't meaningfully change difficulty
  - Student evaluation shows no improvement in understanding
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the Boulder environment notebook with default parameters, observe exploration behavior, then modify the height parameter and note the change in learning difficulty.
  2. Compare on-policy (SARSA) and off-policy (Q-learning) implementations in the Roadrunner notebook, observing how their policies differ near the cliff edge.
  3. Use the Tamagotchi environment with varying message noise levels to observe how state signal quality affects learning performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is EduGym in bridging the gap between theoretical RL concepts and practical implementation for students with varying levels of prior knowledge?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that EduGym aims to connect equations and code in a single document and allows for interactive experimentation, which is known to be a key requirement for fast learning progress. The evaluation showed that 89% of participants reported improved conceptual understanding and 77% reported improved practical understanding.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis on how EduGym performs for students with different levels of prior knowledge in RL. It would be interesting to see if the tool is equally effective for beginners and those with some background in the field.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study comparing the learning outcomes of students with different levels of prior RL knowledge using EduGym, including pre- and post-assessments of both conceptual and practical understanding.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term retention and application benefits of using EduGym for learning RL concepts compared to traditional teaching methods?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that EduGym is intended as an interactive companion to other RL teaching material and that 86% of participants found it useful. However, it does not discuss the long-term impact on knowledge retention or the ability to apply learned concepts to new problems.
- Why unresolved: While the immediate feedback from participants is positive, there is no information on how well the knowledge and skills acquired through EduGym are retained over time or how they translate to solving real-world RL problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking the performance of students who used EduGym in subsequent RL courses or research projects, compared to those who learned through traditional methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can EduGym be further improved or expanded to cover more advanced RL topics and challenges?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that there are several RL challenges not included in EduGym, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, multi-objective reinforcement learning, and goal-based reinforcement learning. It mentions that the authors intentionally focused on standard single-agent RL to let students get familiar with this setting.
- Why unresolved: While the current version of EduGym covers fundamental RL concepts, there is potential for expanding the suite to include more advanced topics and challenges. It is unclear how these additions would impact the tool's effectiveness and usability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new EduGym environments and notebooks covering advanced RL topics, along with user feedback and learning outcome assessments to determine the effectiveness of the expanded content.

## Limitations

- The evaluation results come from a relatively small sample (N=18 participants), which limits statistical power and generalizability
- The study lacks a control group or comparison against alternative teaching methods, making it difficult to attribute learning improvements specifically to EduGym
- The paper lacks details on participant demographics and their prior RL experience, making it difficult to assess generalizability to different learner populations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of environments and notebooks is sound, as evidenced by the open-source release and positive user feedback about usability
- **Medium confidence**: The pedagogical approach of isolating RL challenges is theoretically sound, though empirical evidence for its superiority over integrated approaches is limited
- **Medium confidence**: The evaluation shows positive results, but sample size and study design limitations prevent strong causal conclusions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing EduGym against traditional textbook learning with the same assessment metrics to isolate EduGym's specific impact on learning outcomes
2. Replicate the evaluation with a larger, more diverse participant pool including complete beginners, intermediate learners, and advanced researchers to assess effectiveness across skill levels
3. Perform a longitudinal study tracking knowledge retention and application 3-6 months after EduGym use to determine if the learning gains are sustained over time
