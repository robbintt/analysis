# MUST&P-SRL: Multi-lingual and Unified Syllabification in Text and Phonetic Domains for Speech Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.11541
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11541
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Multi-lingual syllabification methodology achieving word accuracy over 94% in English and 89% in French/Spanish using DTW alignment of sonority sequences

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a multilingual methodology for automatic syllabification of text in English, French, and Spanish, generating linguistic features for speech representation learning. The approach combines pronunciation dictionaries with machine learning models and leverages Dynamic Time Warping on sonority sequences to transfer accurate syllable boundaries from phonetic to text domains. Through systematic ablation studies, the methodology demonstrates improved syllabification accuracy by integrating corpus lookup with algorithmic approaches, achieving high word accuracy rates. The system was applied to the CMU ARCTIC dataset, producing valuable annotations for downstream speech processing tasks.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs a multi-step pipeline: text normalization followed by grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using dictionary lookup with machine learning fallback for out-of-vocabulary words. Syllabification occurs in two domains - phonetic domain using the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP), and text domain using a combination of corpus lookup, SSP, and DTW alignment between sonority sequences. The DTW alignment maps reliable phonetic syllabification to the text domain, overcoming limitations of direct SSP application to text. A consensus mechanism combines multiple syllabification resources to improve accuracy, with consistency analysis identifying discrepancies across different approaches.

## Key Results
- Word accuracy exceeding 94% in English and 89% in French and Spanish through DTW-based sonority sequence alignment
- Application to CMU ARCTIC dataset achieving word accuracy over 99.8% for speech representation learning
- Ablation study demonstrating improved performance when combining corpus lookup with DTW alignment versus SSP alone
- Public release of generated annotations to support speech technology research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DTW alignment between sonority sequences in pronunciation and spelling domains improves syllabification accuracy.
- Mechanism: By mapping the reliably segmented phonetic sonority sequence to the text domain using DTW, the method transfers accurate syllable boundaries from the phonetic domain to the text domain, overcoming limitations of direct SSP application to text.
- Core assumption: The sonority sequence structure is preserved between phonetic and orthographic representations such that DTW can find a meaningful alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through an ablation study, the methodology demonstrates improved syllabification accuracy by combining corpus lookup with Dynamic Time Warping on sonority sequences"
  - [section 3.4] "we propose an approach that aligns sonority sequences in the pronunciation domain and the spelling domain using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)"
- Break condition: When the orthographic-to-phonetic mapping is highly irregular (e.g., silent letters, digraphs), DTW alignment may fail to capture syllable boundaries accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Consensus mechanism using lookup in syllabified word datasets improves accuracy over direct SSP application.
- Mechanism: The method first checks if a word exists in a pre-existing syllabified dataset, using that syllabification if available; otherwise, it falls back to SSP or DTW. This reduces errors from pure rule-based approaches.
- Core assumption: Manually syllabified datasets contain accurate syllabifications that are more reliable than algorithmic predictions for most words.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "we propose matching the number of syllables in text with the number of syllables in the pronunciation dictionary... This is consistent with the use of consensus as a valid mechanism"
  - [section 4.2] "look-up in the syllabified words dataset has a positive effect over SSP (text only) for both French and English"
- Break condition: When the lookup dataset is incomplete or contains errors, the method may propagate those errors or unnecessarily fall back to less accurate algorithms.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using G2P with dictionary lookup followed by fallback model handles out-of-vocabulary words while maintaining high-quality phonetic transcriptions.
- Mechanism: First attempts to find the word in a pronunciation dictionary; if not found, uses a machine learning G2P model to estimate pronunciation. This balances quality and coverage.
- Core assumption: Pronunciation dictionaries contain high-quality transcriptions for known words, and fallback G2P models can reasonably approximate pronunciations for unknown words.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "First, it looks up the word in a pronunciation dictionary. If the word is not found, the system estimates its pronunciation using a machine learning model"
  - [section 3.2] "This two-step methodology allows the system to use high-quality transcriptions from available dictionaries while handling the problem of out-of-vocabulary words with a machine learning model"
- Break condition: When neither the dictionary nor the fallback model provides an accurate phonetic transcription, especially for rare or novel words, subsequent syllabification will be incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)
  - Why needed here: SSP is the core rule used for syllabification in the phonetic domain, defining syllable boundaries based on sonority peaks and valleys.
  - Quick check question: What is the sonority value of vowels in the sonority hierarchy used by this system?

- **Concept**: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
  - Why needed here: DTW is used to align sonority sequences between phonetic and orthographic domains, enabling transfer of accurate syllable boundaries.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary purpose of using DTW in this syllabification system?

- **Concept**: Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion
  - Why needed here: G2P is necessary to convert text to phonetic transcriptions before syllabification can occur in the phonetic domain.
  - Quick check question: What are the two-step components of the G2P approach used in this system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text Normalization → G2P Conversion (Dict lookup → Model fallback) → Phonetic Syllabification (SSP) → Text Syllabification (Lookup → SSP → SSP-DTW) → Consistency Analysis
- **Critical path**: G2P Conversion → Phonetic Syllabification → Text Syllabification (SSP-DTW path)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. coverage (dictionary lookup vs. model fallback), complexity vs. performance (simple SSP vs. SSP-DTW)
- **Failure signatures**: Low word accuracy indicates problems in G2P or syllabification; inconsistent syllable counts suggest issues in DTW alignment or lookup dataset quality
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run the system on a small test set of known words and verify that dictionary lookup returns correct pronunciations
  2. Test SSP syllabification on phonetic transcriptions of simple words to confirm basic functionality
  3. Apply the complete pipeline to a mixed set of known and unknown words, checking word accuracy and identifying failure cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How does the proposed methodology perform on languages with vastly different phonetic structures beyond English, French, and Spanish?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the current implementation and evaluations were focused mainly on English, French, and Spanish, and extending and evaluating the methodology across other languages remains a future challenge.
  - Why unresolved: The study did not include languages with significantly different phonetic structures, and the performance on such languages is unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the methodology on a diverse set of languages with different phonetic structures and comparing the results to the current implementation.

- **Question**: How can the system handle out-of-vocabulary words or model pronunciation dependencies based on context more effectively?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the system heavily relies on the availability and quality of pronunciation dictionaries for its grapheme-to-phoneme conversion process, and issues like handling out-of-vocabulary words or modeling pronunciation dependencies based on context heavily depend on manual correction.
  - Why unresolved: The current system's scalability is limited due to its reliance on manual correction for out-of-vocabulary words and context-based pronunciation modeling.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating an improved grapheme-to-phoneme conversion process that can handle out-of-vocabulary words and context-based pronunciation modeling without manual intervention.

- **Question**: How can the consensus mechanism be improved to further reduce inaccuracies in syllabification?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the consensus mechanism used to identify inconsistencies between different syllabification resources may still retain inaccuracies inherent in these resources.
  - Why unresolved: The current consensus mechanism may not fully address the inaccuracies present in the syllabification resources used.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating an improved consensus mechanism that can more effectively identify and correct inaccuracies in syllabification resources.

## Limitations

- Reliance on pre-existing syllabified datasets and pronunciation dictionaries, which may not cover specialized vocabulary or domain-specific terminology
- DTW alignment assumes consistent sonority patterns between phonetic and orthographic representations, which may break down for highly irregular spellings
- System performance in Spanish is not directly evaluated, only inferred from the similar methodology applied to English and French
- Sonority hierarchy values for different phone sets are not explicitly specified, which could affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using DTW alignment between sonority sequences (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the ablation study results showing improved accuracy over pure SSP methods
- **Medium confidence**: The consensus mechanism combining lookup with algorithmic methods (Mechanism 2) is supported by results, but the completeness and quality of the lookup datasets are not fully characterized
- **Medium confidence**: The two-step G2P approach with dictionary lookup and model fallback (Mechanism 3) is theoretically sound, but the specific fallback model performance is not detailed

## Next Checks

1. Validate DTW alignment accuracy by visualizing sonority sequence alignments for a diverse set of words with varying orthographic-phonetic regularity, checking whether syllable boundaries are correctly transferred from phonetic to text domain
2. Test system robustness on out-of-vocabulary words by creating a test set of rare, technical, and novel words not present in any lookup datasets, measuring G2P accuracy and subsequent syllabification performance
3. Conduct cross-linguistic validation by applying the system to additional languages beyond the three studied, particularly languages with different orthographic transparency levels (e.g., German, Italian) to assess generalizability of the DTW-based approach
