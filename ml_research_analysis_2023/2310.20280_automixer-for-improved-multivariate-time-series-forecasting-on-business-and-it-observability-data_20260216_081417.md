# AutoMixer for Improved Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting on Business and IT Observability Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20280
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20280
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: AutoMixer achieves 11-15% MSE reduction and 1-2X PCC improvement on BizITOps datasets through channel compression before TSMixer forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting business key performance indicators (Biz-KPIs) in the presence of noisy inter-channel interactions with IT events. The authors propose AutoMixer, a time-series foundation model that combines an autoencoder for channel compression with a TSMixer model for forecasting. By compressing channels before forecasting, AutoMixer reduces noise and simplifies the correlation modeling task, leading to significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on four proprietary BizITOps datasets.

## Method Summary
AutoMixer is a time-series foundation model that uses channel compression via autoencoders followed by TSMixer forecasting. The method involves two stages: first, pretraining an autoencoder to learn compressed channel representations that preserve important correlations while reducing noise; second, fine-tuning the full AutoMixer framework for specific forecasting tasks. The compressed representation is fed to TSMixer, which treats multivariate modeling as a global univariate approach with shared weights. The framework can use either LSTM or GRU autoencoders and supports various compression ratios (40-80% compression achieved best results).

## Key Results
- 11-15% reduction in mean squared error compared to state-of-the-art methods on four BizITOps datasets
- 1-2X improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for capturing trends and patterns
- Pretraining autoencoder reduces MSE by 2.3% compared to random initialization
- Generalizes well to downstream tasks including classification and regression
- Best performance achieved with 40-80% channel compression ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Channel compression via AutoEncoder reduces noisy inter-channel interactions while preserving important correlations.
- Mechanism: The AutoEncoder learns to project raw channels into a compressed space where irrelevant correlations are pruned and important ones are retained. This creates a cleaner signal for the TSMixer model to process.
- Core assumption: The AutoEncoder can distinguish between "important" and "noisy" correlations through reconstruction loss optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Rather than feeding raw channels directly to TSMixer, we harness the power of compressed channels (via AutoEncoders) where unwanted noisy channel interactions are reduced."
  - [section 2.3]: "The decoder's output ˆx = h(z) ∈ RT ×C is compared with the original input x, and the mean squared error (MSE) objective ||x− ˆx||2 2 is employed to train the AE. Intuitively, if x can be reconstructed with low MSE, then, the original input data possibly has latent correlations between the channels which was essentially leveraged by the AE for a successful channel compression task."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Foundation model workflow (pretrain-then-finetune) improves generalization across downstream tasks.
- Mechanism: The AutoEncoder is first trained on a reconstruction task to learn generic data representations, then these weights are transferred and fine-tuned for specific forecasting tasks with TSMixer.
- Core assumption: Pretraining captures general structure in BizITOps data that benefits multiple task types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This comprehensive two-step training process (i.e. pretrain and finetune) allows the framework to unlock the full potential of both AutoEncoder and TSMixer."
  - [section 3.3]: "Table 3 highlights that utilizing pretraining (PT) of AE reduces the MSE by 2.3% as compared to direct AutoMixer training with randomly initialized AE weights (NPT)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Channel-independence strategy in TSMixer simplifies correlation modeling when applied to compressed channels.
- Mechanism: TSMixer treats multivariate modeling as a global univariate approach with shared weights. When applied to compressed channels (with fewer, cleaner signals), this approach becomes more effective.
- Core assumption: Channel-independence works better when the input space has reduced noise and irrelevant interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4]: "The backbone of the TSMixer takes the compressed representation z ∈ RT ×C′ and converts it into z′ ∈ RC′×n×l by a series of transformations."
  - [section 2.2]: "TSMixer adopts a channel-independent strategy, modeling all channels globally in a univariate manner, with shared model weights across channels to implicitly account for channel correlations."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: AutoEncoder architecture and training objectives
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the encoder-decoder structure learns compressed representations is crucial for tuning compression ratios and interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What loss function ensures the AutoEncoder learns meaningful compressed representations?

- Concept: Channel correlation vs. temporal correlation in time series
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between these two types of dependencies is key to understanding why channel compression helps.
  - Quick check question: How does channel correlation differ from temporal correlation in multivariate time series?

- Concept: Foundation model pretraining workflow
  - Why needed here: Knowing why and how pretraining benefits downstream tasks helps in deciding when to use this approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary benefit of pretraining an AutoEncoder before finetuning for forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data -> AutoEncoder encoder -> Compressed representation -> TSMixer backbone -> Output head -> (optional) AutoEncoder decoder
- Critical path: Input -> AutoEncoder encoder -> Compressed representation -> TSMixer -> Output head -> (optional) AutoEncoder decoder
  - Data flows: (1) Pretraining path: full AutoEncoder, (2) Finetuning path: encoder only + TSMixer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Compression ratio: Higher compression reduces noise but risks losing important information
  - AutoEncoder architecture: LSTM vs GRU affects sequence modeling capabilities
  - TSMixer variant: With or without explicit cross-channel reconciliation heads
- Failure signatures:
  - High reconstruction error: AutoEncoder isn't learning useful compression
  - Validation loss increases during finetuning: Overfitting or poor initialization
  - Forecast accuracy worse than baseline: Compression removed too much signal
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train AutoEncoder alone with varying compression ratios (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) and measure reconstruction MSE
  2. Compare TSMixer performance on raw vs compressed channels for a single dataset
  3. Test pretraining vs random initialization by training two AutoMixer variants and comparing validation MSE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal channel compression ratio for different types of BizITOps data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the best compression ratios mostly lie in the range between 40-80% but it varies across datasets and needs to be chosen based on validation metrics.
- Why unresolved: The optimal compression ratio is likely data-dependent and needs to be determined empirically for each dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the compression ratio across different types of BizITOps data and measuring the impact on forecasting accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does AutoMixer perform on datasets with longer time series or higher forecast horizons?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates AutoMixer on datasets with a context length and forecast horizon of 24. It's unclear how the model would perform with longer time series or higher forecast horizons.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide results for longer time series or higher forecast horizons.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating AutoMixer on datasets with varying time series lengths and forecast horizons.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AutoMixer handle missing data or irregular sampling in BizITOps data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes regular sampling and does not mention how the model handles missing data. In real-world BizITOps data, missing data or irregular sampling could be common.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the model's robustness to missing data or irregular sampling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating AutoMixer's performance on datasets with missing data or irregular sampling, and comparing it to other models.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on only four proprietary Microsoft datasets that cannot be independently verified or compared against other methods
- Claims of 11-15% MSE reduction and 1-2X PCC improvement lack statistical significance testing with confidence intervals or p-values
- No ablation studies to isolate contribution of channel compression versus TSMixer backbone for performance gains
- Computational cost comparisons are incomplete without concrete benchmarks against existing methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core architectural framework of AutoMixer (AutoEncoder + TSMixer) is technically sound and follows established principles in time series modeling. The mechanism by which channel compression can reduce noise is well-established in the literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements on the four BizITOps datasets are likely valid but cannot be independently verified due to proprietary data. The generalization claims to downstream tasks are plausible given the foundation model pretraining approach but lack extensive validation.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about AutoMixer's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets are difficult to assess given the limited evaluation scope. The paper's assertions about practical business utility lack quantitative validation.

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical significance testing**: Re-analyze the reported MSE and PCC improvements using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to determine if performance gains are statistically significant rather than due to random variation.

2. **Ablation study design**: Implement a comprehensive ablation study that isolates the contribution of channel compression by comparing AutoMixer variants with different compression ratios against TSMixer with raw channels, controlling for all other variables.

3. **External validation**: Apply AutoMixer to at least one publicly available multivariate time series forecasting dataset (such as ETT or Exchange Rate datasets) to assess performance outside the proprietary BizITOps environment and enable comparison with published benchmarks.
