# Cognate Transformer for Automated Phonological Reconstruction and Cognate Reflex Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.07487
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07487
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Primary result**: Cognate Transformer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on both phonological reconstruction tasks, especially on harder test-train splits when pre-trained on masked word prediction.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Cognate Transformer, an adaptation of MSA Transformer for automated phonological reconstruction tasks including proto-language reconstruction and cognate reflex prediction. The model uses 2D attention to handle aligned cognate words, treating language information as a separate token rather than through concatenation. When pre-trained on masked word prediction across multiple language families, the Cognate Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling on challenging test-train splits where it demonstrates superior generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The Cognate Transformer adapts MSA Transformer architecture for phonological reconstruction by employing 2D attention mechanisms that model both row (language) and column (phoneme position) relationships simultaneously. The model treats language identity as a separate token prepended to phoneme sequences, enabling explicit conditioning on source language. Training involves two stages: pre-training on masked word prediction across cognate sets from multiple language families to learn general sound change patterns, followed by fine-tuning on specific reconstruction tasks. The model uses column-wise summation and normalization layers for token classification, optimized with Adam (learning rate 1e-3, batch size 64) and evaluated using edit distance, normalized edit distance, and B-Cubed F1 scores.

## Key Results
- Cognate Transformer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on both cognate reflex prediction and proto-language reconstruction tasks
- Pre-training on masked word prediction provides substantial performance gains, especially for harder test-train splits
- The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across multiple language families when pre-trained on diverse data
- Language token approach shows advantages over concatenation methods for incorporating language information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: 2D Attention for Aligned Cognate Words
The MSA Transformer's 2D attention structure is well-suited for aligned cognate words because it models row (language) and column (phoneme position) relationships simultaneously. Column attention captures dependencies across phoneme positions in aligned words while row attention captures cross-language dependencies, allowing the model to learn both sound correspondences within positions and patterns across languages. This design assumes properly aligned cognate words as input, with alignment quality being critical for meaningful pattern learning.

### Mechanism 2: Explicit Language Token Representation
Treating language information as a separate token (rather than concatenation) improves performance by making language identity explicit and directly conditioning phoneme predictions on source language identity. This approach provides clearer separation between language and phoneme information compared to concatenation methods. The design assumes language identity is a relevant conditioning factor for phoneme prediction, though the model could potentially infer language from phoneme sequences alone.

### Mechanism 3: Pre-training on Cross-Family Sound Patterns
Pre-training on cognate reflex prediction improves proto-language reconstruction by learning general sound change patterns across language families. The model first learns to predict masked words in daughter languages across multiple families, capturing common sound change patterns that transfer to the proto-language reconstruction task through fine-tuning. This assumes sound changes follow systematic patterns shared across language families, though transfer benefits may diminish if sound changes are too language-specific or pre-training data differs significantly from target tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**: Why needed: The model expects aligned cognate words as input, where corresponding phonemes across languages are aligned in the same columns. Quick check: What algorithm is used to align the phoneme sequences before feeding them to the model?
- **Masked Language Modeling**: Why needed: Pre-training uses a masked word prediction objective where one language's word is masked and the model learns to predict it from other languages. Quick check: How does the pre-training objective differ from standard BERT-style masking?
- **Token Classification**: Why needed: The model performs token classification where each output position predicts the corresponding phoneme in the proto-language. Quick check: What is the final layer architecture that converts MSA Transformer outputs to token predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input alignment → MSA Transformer → Column summation → Normalization → Classification → Loss computation
- **Critical path**: Input alignment → MSA Transformer → Column summation → Normalization → Classification → Loss computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: 2D attention allows modeling cross-language dependencies but increases computational complexity; treating language as separate token is more explicit but adds vocabulary size; pre-training requires additional data and computation but improves final performance
- **Failure signatures**: Poor alignment quality → Random or nonsensical predictions; insufficient vocabulary size → High frequency of unknown token predictions; overfitting on small datasets → Excellent performance on training data but poor generalization
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test with perfect alignments (gold alignments) to establish upper bound performance; 2) Test with varying test-train proportions (0.1, 0.5, 0.8) to measure scalability; 3) Test with and without pre-training to measure transfer learning benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Handling Complex Sound Changes
The paper mentions that metathesis is a hard sound change for the model to learn, as it doesn't fit naturally into sequence alignment approaches, but doesn't provide solutions or further investigation. Testing the model on language families that exhibit systematic metathesis would provide insights into its ability to handle such sound changes.

### Open Question 2: Orthographic Representation Performance
While the paper mentions the model can be adapted to work with orthographic representations as long as words can be aligned with properly defined sound classes, it doesn't provide experimental results. Training and evaluating the model on datasets with orthographic representations would provide evidence of its effectiveness in this setting.

### Open Question 3: Dataset Size Scaling
The paper suggests that pre-training with more data would likely improve performance but doesn't provide experimental results on how performance scales with dataset size. Training and evaluating the model with varying dataset sizes would provide insights into how the model scales with increasing data.

## Limitations
- The paper assumes pre-aligned cognate words but doesn't address how alignment quality affects performance
- No ablation studies compare the language token approach versus concatenation, making it unclear if the improvement is due to this design choice
- The sound-class-based alignment algorithm is referenced but not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The model architecture and training procedure are clearly specified, and the quantitative results show consistent improvements over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed mechanisms (2D attention benefits, language token advantages, pre-training transfer) are plausible but lack direct empirical validation through ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: The claim that the model can handle metathesis and other complex sound changes is not directly tested, as the evaluation focuses on edit distance metrics

## Next Checks
1. **Alignment quality sensitivity test**: Evaluate model performance using gold alignments versus automatically generated alignments to quantify the impact of alignment quality on reconstruction accuracy
2. **Ablation study on language representation**: Compare the language token approach against concatenation and other language encoding methods to isolate the contribution of this design choice
3. **Complex sound change analysis**: Manually examine model predictions on language families known for metathesis and other non-sequential sound changes to assess whether the model truly captures these phenomena or simply averages across aligned positions
