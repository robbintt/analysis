# A Comprehensive Survey of Forgetting in Deep Learning Beyond Continual Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.09218
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09218
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of forgetting phenomena across multiple deep learning domains beyond continual learning, categorizing both harmful and beneficial forgetting scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines forgetting as a fundamental challenge across multiple deep learning domains including generative models, federated learning, foundation models, domain adaptation, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning. The paper argues that forgetting is not limited to continual learning but manifests as a double-edged sword—harmful when it causes loss of previously acquired knowledge, yet beneficial when it protects privacy or improves generalization by removing irrelevant information. The survey categorizes existing mitigation methods into memory-based, architecture-based, regularization-based, subspace-based, and Bayesian-based approaches, while identifying significant opportunities for cross-disciplinary research and theoretical analysis to better understand and address forgetting in deep learning.

## Method Summary
This is a comprehensive survey paper that collects and synthesizes existing literature across nine research domains to understand forgetting phenomena in deep learning. The methodology involves systematically gathering papers from each domain (continual learning, foundation models, domain adaptation, test-time adaptation, meta-learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, federated learning, and machine unlearning) using relevant keywords, classifying each according to harmful versus beneficial forgetting, and categorizing methods by type (memory-based, architecture-based, regularization-based, subspace-based, Bayesian-based). The survey then analyzes cross-domain connections and synthesizes findings into a unified taxonomy, identifying patterns, opportunities, and open research questions.

## Key Results
- Forgetting occurs as a prevalent phenomenon across multiple deep learning domains beyond continual learning, including federated learning, foundation models, and generative models
- Forgetting can be both harmful (loss of previously acquired knowledge) and beneficial (privacy protection, improved generalization)
- Existing mitigation methods can be categorized into five main approaches: memory-based, architecture-based, regularization-based, subspace-based, and Bayesian-based
- Cross-disciplinary research offers significant potential for advancing forgetting mitigation strategies across different domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental challenge across multiple deep learning domains, not limited to continual learning.
- Mechanism: The survey identifies forgetting as arising from shifts in data/task distributions across various research areas including generative models, federated learning, foundation models, domain adaptation, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning.
- Core assumption: Forgetting occurs when the learned model encounters distribution shifts that invalidate previously learned knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "forgetting is a prevalent phenomenon observed in various other research domains within deep learning"
  - [section]: "In continual learning, forgetting occurs due to the shift in data distribution across different tasks. In meta-learning, forgetting is a consequence of the shift in task distribution. In federated learning, forgetting is caused by the heterogeneity of data distribution among different clients"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on specific forgetting scenarios but don't provide comprehensive evidence of the cross-domain prevalence claim.
- Break condition: If the model encounters stationary distributions without shifts, forgetting would not manifest.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Forgetting can be both harmful and beneficial depending on the application context.
- Mechanism: The survey argues that harmful forgetting occurs when retention of old knowledge is desired, while beneficial forgetting is desirable for privacy protection and improving generalization by removing irrelevant information.
- Core assumption: The utility of forgetting depends on whether the application requires preserving old knowledge or protecting privacy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our survey argues that forgetting is a double-edged sword and can be beneficial and desirable in certain cases, such as privacy-preserving scenarios"
  - [section]: "beneficial forgetting arises when the model contains private information that could lead to privacy breaches or when irrelevant information hinders the learning of new tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on specific forgetting scenarios but don't provide comprehensive evidence of the beneficial forgetting claim.
- Break condition: If the application requires strict knowledge retention without privacy concerns, beneficial forgetting would be counterproductive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-disciplinary research is essential for advancing forgetting mitigation strategies.
- Mechanism: The survey highlights that techniques developed in one research area (e.g., continual learning) can be applied to address forgetting in other domains, and vice versa.
- Core assumption: Similar forgetting mechanisms across domains allow for transfer of solutions between fields.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we aspire to uncover potential solutions by drawing upon ideas and approaches from various fields that have dealt with forgetting"
  - [section]: "Cross-discipline research is vital for advancing machine learning disciplines. Various fields offer valuable insights and innovations through cross-disciplinary research"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on specific forgetting scenarios but don't provide comprehensive evidence of the cross-disciplinary benefit claim.
- Break condition: If forgetting mechanisms are fundamentally different across domains, cross-disciplinary solutions may not transfer effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distribution shift
  - Why needed here: Understanding distribution shift is fundamental to understanding why forgetting occurs across all mentioned domains
  - Quick check question: What happens to a model's performance when the test data distribution differs from the training data distribution?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting
  - Why needed here: This is the core phenomenon being surveyed across all research areas
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between catastrophic forgetting and regular forgetting in machine learning?

- Concept: Privacy-preserving machine learning
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding beneficial forgetting scenarios where private data must be forgotten
  - Quick check question: How does machine unlearning relate to the concept of forgetting in machine learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Introduction -> Harmful forgetting overview -> Beneficial forgetting overview -> Discussion -> Cross-disciplinary opportunities
- Critical path: 1) Understand the dual nature of forgetting (harmful vs beneficial) 2) Map forgetting scenarios across domains using Table 1 and Table 2 3) Study categorized methods for each domain 4) Identify cross-disciplinary opportunities
- Design tradeoffs: Breadth vs depth (covers many domains but may lack deep technical details for each), harmful vs beneficial focus (balances traditional CL focus with emerging privacy-related applications), theoretical vs empirical (emphasizes empirical observations over theoretical guarantees)
- Failure signatures: Incomplete understanding of distribution shift concepts, confusion between harmful and beneficial forgetting scenarios, overlooking cross-disciplinary connections between research areas
- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement a simple CL benchmark and observe catastrophic forgetting when switching tasks 2) Create a federated learning setup with non-IID data and observe client drift 3) Implement a privacy-preserving model and test its ability to forget specific training data (machine unlearning)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we theoretically analyze and bound the trade-off between memorization and forgetting in machine learning models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "there is a pressing need for more thorough theoretical analysis across different learning domains" and discusses the importance of striking a balance between remembering previous knowledge and protecting privacy.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods are mostly empirical, lacking theoretical guarantees and comprehensive analysis of the memorization-forgetting trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework that quantifies the relationship between memorization, forgetting, and model performance/privacy, with provable bounds on the trade-offs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does forgetting impact the trustworthiness properties of machine learning models, such as robustness, fairness, and transparency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "most existing studies on forgetting primarily concentrate on its impact on model performance while overlooking other crucial aspects such as robustness, fairness, transparency, etc."
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of research investigating the effects of forgetting on trustworthiness properties beyond model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies and theoretical analyses that systematically evaluate how forgetting affects robustness, fairness, and transparency in various machine learning tasks and domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can foundation models be effectively leveraged to address forgetting in various research fields?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of foundation models in tackling forgetting across different research fields and mentions that "the foundation model has demonstrated promising potential in tackling forgetting across various research fields, making it an active and promising area of research."
- Why unresolved: While foundation models show promise, there is a need for further research to understand their effectiveness and limitations in addressing forgetting in different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive empirical studies and theoretical analyses that evaluate the performance of foundation models in mitigating forgetting across various research domains, along with insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations

- Evidence supporting the prevalence of forgetting beyond continual learning is primarily observational, based on existing literature rather than systematic empirical validation across domains
- The categorization of forgetting as harmful or beneficial lacks formal definitions that would allow for consistent application across different research areas
- Cross-disciplinary insights are promising but remain largely theoretical, with limited concrete examples of successful knowledge transfer between fields

## Confidence

- High confidence: Forgetting is a fundamental challenge in continual learning and federated learning
- Medium confidence: Forgetting occurs across multiple deep learning domains as described
- Low confidence: Specific cross-disciplinary solutions and their effectiveness are well-established

## Next Checks

1. Implement and compare forgetting mitigation techniques from continual learning in a federated learning setup to empirically validate cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct a systematic literature review with defined inclusion criteria to quantify the prevalence of forgetting across surveyed domains
3. Design experiments to formally distinguish between harmful and beneficial forgetting in privacy-preserving scenarios
