# Forecasting Auxiliary Energy Consumption for Electric Heavy-Duty Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.16003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16003
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: Fleet-based Regression improves prediction accuracy by 34-48% and provides more consistent explanations for electric truck auxiliary energy consumption

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate energy consumption prediction for electric heavy-duty vehicles, focusing on auxiliary systems like heaters. The key insight is that commercial vehicle operations exhibit heterogeneous patterns where feature-target relationships vary across sub-populations. The authors propose Fleet-based Regression (FBR), which clusters data to identify relevant sub-populations and trains local regression models on each cluster. This approach significantly outperforms traditional global regression models, reducing mean absolute error by 34-48% for heater energy consumption prediction while also providing more consistent LIME explanations.

## Method Summary
Fleet-based Regression (FBR) addresses heterogeneous data by first clustering the dataset into meaningful sub-populations, then training separate regression models on each cluster. The method begins with data preprocessing and standardization, followed by k-means clustering to group similar trips. Multiple regression models (Random Forest, Ridge, kNN, MLP) are trained on each cluster independently. During prediction, new samples are assigned to clusters and predictions are made using the corresponding local model. The approach also leverages local LIME explanations for interpretability, which are more consistent within clusters due to stable feature-target relationships.

## Key Results
- FBR reduces mean absolute error by 34-48% compared to global models for heater energy consumption prediction
- The approach provides more consistent LIME explanations within clusters, with lower pairwise distance between feature importance vectors
- FBR outperforms global models across all tested regression algorithms (Random Forest, Ridge, kNN, MLP) in both synthetic and real-world experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Clustering sub-populations before training local regression models reduces heterogeneity within each cluster, leading to more consistent feature importance patterns. When the dataset is divided into clusters based on relevant features, the conditional distribution P(Y|X) becomes more stable within each cluster, reducing the impact of Simpson's paradox where feature correlations reverse across sub-populations.

### Mechanism 2
Training multiple regression models on subsets of data improves prediction accuracy by fitting simpler models to less complex local patterns. Instead of fitting a single global model to capture all variations in a heterogeneous dataset, FBR trains separate models for each cluster. Each local model only needs to learn the simpler relationship within its cluster, reducing model complexity and overfitting risk.

### Mechanism 3
Local LIME explanations are more consistent within clusters because they are based on models trained on peers with similar feature-target relationships. When LIME generates feature importance explanations using a local model trained on similar samples, the explanations are less likely to be influenced by contradictory patterns from other sub-populations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Simpson's Paradox
  - Why needed here: Understanding how correlations can reverse when data is aggregated is crucial for grasping why global models fail in heterogeneous settings.
  - Quick check question: If variable A is positively correlated with B in the entire dataset, but negatively correlated in each sub-population, what statistical phenomenon is this?

- Concept: Clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means)
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of FBR depends on correctly identifying sub-populations that exhibit stable feature-target relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of clustering in the context of FBR?

- Concept: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)
  - Why needed here: LIME is used to generate feature importance explanations, and understanding how it works helps explain why local models produce more consistent explanations.
  - Quick check question: How does LIME generate feature importance explanations for a specific prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Clustering (k-means) -> Train local regression models -> Prediction (cluster assignment + local model) -> Explanation (LIME on local models)
- Critical path: Data → Clustering → Train local models → Predict → Explain
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of clusters: Too few → high heterogeneity; Too many → overfitting
  - Choice of regression model: Simpler models → faster but less accurate; Complex models → slower but potentially more accurate
  - Feature selection: More features → more information but risk of noise; Fewer features → faster but risk of missing important patterns
- Failure signatures: High variance in cluster sizes, poor clustering quality (low silhouette score), inconsistent LIME explanations within clusters, performance worse than global model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test clustering quality on a synthetic dataset with known sub-populations
  2. Compare global vs. local model performance on a real-world dataset
  3. Evaluate LIME explanation consistency within and across clusters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the clustering quality affect the performance of FBR when using k-means versus domain expert groupings? The paper compares FBR with k-means clustering and FBR with domain expert groupings, noting that both approaches yield similar performance, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how clustering quality impacts FBR performance.

### Open Question 2
Can the FBR approach be extended to handle time series data effectively? The paper suggests extending experiments to time series data as future work, indicating this is an unresolved question since current experiments focus on aggregated features.

### Open Question 3
Do different types of explanations exhibit varying resiliency to the issues presented by Simpson's paradox? The paper mentions exploring whether different types of explanations exhibit varying resiliency to the issues presented as a future direction, focusing currently only on LIME explanations.

## Limitations
- FBR effectiveness depends heavily on successful clustering of meaningful sub-populations
- Real-world evaluation uses heater energy consumption as a proxy, which may not generalize to other auxiliary systems
- Computational overhead of training multiple models and performing clustering may be prohibitive for some deployment scenarios

## Confidence

High confidence in synthetic experiment results demonstrating Simpson's paradox resolution
Medium confidence in real-world results based on single auxiliary system (heaters)
Low confidence in generalizability across different auxiliary systems and operational contexts

## Next Checks

1. Test FBR on auxiliary systems with fundamentally different usage patterns (e.g., air conditioning vs. heating) to assess generalizability across different energy consumption behaviors.

2. Evaluate clustering quality using established metrics (silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index) to ensure meaningful sub-population identification rather than arbitrary groupings.

3. Perform ablation studies to determine the sensitivity of FBR performance to the number of clusters and the choice of clustering algorithm.
