# Generative Recommendation: Towards Next-generation Recommender Paradigm

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2304.03516
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03516
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Proposes GeneRec, a generative recommender paradigm using AIGC to overcome limitations of traditional retrieval-based recommenders, with promising results on micro-video generation tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Generative Recommendation (GeneRec), a new paradigm that leverages AI-Generated Content to address the limitations of traditional retrieval-based recommender systems. The core innovation is integrating an AI generator that can both repurpose existing items and create entirely new items to supplement users' diverse information needs. The framework consists of three key modules: an instructor that processes multimodal user instructions and feedback to determine when generation is needed, an AI editor that refines and repurposes existing items, and an AI creator that generates new items from scratch. The paper demonstrates promising results on micro-video generation tasks, showing that generative approaches can effectively address long-tail and novel user requests that traditional recommenders struggle with.

## Method Summary
GeneRec introduces a novel generative recommender paradigm that combines traditional retrieval with AI-generated content to address diverse user information needs. The system uses an instructor module to analyze multimodal user instructions and feedback, determining when the existing item corpus is insufficient and generation is required. When triggered, the system employs an AI editor to repurpose existing items based on user preferences, or an AI creator to generate entirely new items from scratch. The approach leverages diffusion models and other generative techniques for content transformation and creation, with fidelity checkers ensuring generated content meets safety and quality standards. The paper implements and evaluates this framework on micro-video generation tasks using CLIP, diffusion models, and micro-video generation methods.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates the instructor module can effectively determine when to activate the AI generator based on multimodal user instructions and feedback
- Shows the AI editor can successfully repurpose existing micro-videos through thumbnail selection, clip generation, and content editing
- Presents initial results for the AI creator in generating new micro-videos, though quality remains lower than human-generated content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The instructor module can effectively determine when to activate the AI generator by analyzing multimodal user instructions and feedback.
- Mechanism: The instructor processes user instructions (textual or multimodal) and historical feedback to decide whether to initiate content generation. It extracts guidance signals from these inputs for the AI generator.
- Core assumption: User instructions and feedback contain sufficient information to infer whether the existing item corpus can meet user needs or if generation is required.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an instructor to output the generation guidance" and "pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback"; [section] "the instructor analyzes the multimodal instructions and user feedback to determine whether there is a need to initiate the AI generator"; [corpus] Weak evidence - the paper does not empirically validate the instructor's decision-making accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The AI editor can repurpose existing items to better match personalized user preferences by leveraging diffusion models and other generative techniques.
- Mechanism: The AI editor takes an existing item, user guidance signals, and optionally web facts/knowledge to transform the item (e.g., changing style, clipping to preferred segments).
- Core assumption: Generative models can meaningfully transform items while preserving core content and aligning with user preference signals.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items"; [section] "the AI editor intends to refine and repurpose existing items... according to personalized user instructions and feedback"; [corpus] Moderate evidence - experiments show CLIP and diffusion models can select clips and generate thumbnails matching user preference, but quality varies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The AI creator can generate entirely new items from scratch that satisfy personalized user needs when the corpus is insufficient.
- Mechanism: The AI creator uses user instructions, feedback, and optionally external knowledge to synthesize new content (e.g., creating a new micro-video on a requested topic).
- Core assumption: Generative models have sufficient capacity and training data to produce coherent, high-quality items for diverse user needs.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "create new items to supplement users' diverse information needs"; [section] "the AI creator learns the users' information needs, and creates new items to fulfill users' needs"; [corpus] Weak evidence - experiments show image generation via Stable Diffusion works well, but micro-video creation via MCVD yields low quality and fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal instruction processing
  - Why needed here: Users express needs through text, images, video, and audio; the system must understand and fuse these modalities to guide generation.
  - Quick check question: How would you encode a user instruction that includes both a video example and a textual description of the desired style?

- Concept: Diffusion model conditioning
  - Why needed here: The AI editor and creator rely on diffusion models to transform or generate content; understanding how to condition these models on user signals is critical.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between conditioning a diffusion model on text embeddings versus conditioning it on user feedback embeddings?

- Concept: Fidelity and safety checks for generated content
  - Why needed here: Generated items must be accurate, unbiased, private, safe, authentic, legal, and identifiable to ensure trust and compliance.
  - Quick check question: Which fidelity check would be most challenging to automate for a generated micro-video that includes user-provided data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User instruction → Instructor → (AI Editor or AI Creator) → Fidelity Checks → Recommendation

- Critical path: User instruction → Instructor → (AI Editor or AI Creator) → Fidelity Checks → Recommendation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. Quality: Real-time generation may sacrifice quality; pre-generation increases latency but improves consistency.
  - Control vs. Autonomy: More user control over generation increases satisfaction but may reduce system efficiency.
  - Generation vs. Retrieval: Balancing when to generate new items versus retrieving from the corpus affects cost and relevance.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low user engagement with generated items indicates poor preference alignment.
  - High rate of failed fidelity checks suggests model misalignment or inadequate constraints.
  - Frequent instructor misfires (unnecessary generation or missed opportunities) reveal poor instruction understanding.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate instructor decision accuracy by simulating user instructions and measuring whether it correctly triggers generation for corpus-insufficient needs.
  2. Test AI editor quality by having users rate repurposed items against original items and baseline transformations.
  3. Benchmark AI creator output quality and relevance by comparing generated items to human-generated items on the same need.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the instructor effectively combine user feedback and multimodal instructions to infer users' information needs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the instructor should "well capture users' information needs and personalized preference from the multimodal instructions and user feedback" and "utilize user feedback to complement instructions for better generation guidance."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methods for combining user feedback and multimodal instructions to infer users' information needs. It only highlights the importance of this task.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed method that demonstrates how to effectively combine user feedback and multimodal instructions to infer users' information needs, along with empirical results showing its effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can GeneRec ensure the trustworthiness of generated content through fidelity checks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of "various fidelity checks" to ensure the trustworthiness of generated content, including bias, privacy, safety, authenticity, and legality checks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methods for conducting these fidelity checks. It only highlights the importance of these checks and mentions that it is challenging to conduct valid checks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed method that demonstrates how to effectively conduct fidelity checks for generated content, along with empirical results showing its effectiveness in ensuring trustworthiness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can GeneRec be evaluated to measure the quality of generated content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes two kinds of evaluation setups: item-side evaluation and user-side evaluation. However, it does not provide specific metrics or methods for evaluating the quality of generated content.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific evaluation metrics or methods for measuring the quality of generated content. It only highlights the importance of evaluation and mentions some general evaluation setups.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed evaluation framework that demonstrates how to effectively measure the quality of generated content, along with empirical results showing its effectiveness in evaluating GeneRec.

## Limitations

- The instructor module's decision accuracy for triggering generation remains unvalidated with precision/recall metrics
- The AI creator shows significant quality limitations in micro-video generation, with low fidelity outputs compared to human content
- Comprehensive safety and fidelity validation is lacking, with only brief mentions of bias, privacy, and authenticity checks without implementation details

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework of integrating AIGC into recommender systems is sound and addresses genuine limitations of retrieval-only approaches. The instructor module design for processing multimodal instructions follows established patterns in multimodal learning.
- **Medium confidence**: The AI editor's capability to repurpose existing items using diffusion models and CLIP is moderately supported by the experimental results, though quality varies significantly across tasks. The overall architecture design and component interactions are logically coherent.
- **Low confidence**: The AI creator's ability to generate high-quality, relevant micro-videos from scratch is poorly supported, with experimental results showing substantial quality gaps compared to human-generated content. The instructor's decision accuracy and the effectiveness of fidelity checks remain largely unvalidated.

## Next Checks

1. **Instructor Decision Accuracy Validation**: Conduct a controlled experiment where simulated user instructions spanning various complexity levels are processed by the instructor module. Measure precision (correctly identifying when generation is needed) and recall (not missing corpus-insufficient needs) across different instruction types and compare against human judgments.

2. **End-to-End User Preference Alignment**: Implement an A/B test where users interact with both GeneRec-generated content and traditional retrieval-based recommendations. Measure engagement metrics (click-through rate, watch time, completion rate) and user satisfaction surveys to quantify the actual preference alignment achieved by the generative approach.

3. **Safety and Fidelity Stress Testing**: Systematically test generated content against the six fidelity dimensions (bias, privacy, safety, authenticity, legality, identifiability) using both automated detection tools and human evaluation panels. Identify failure patterns and establish threshold metrics for acceptable generation quality before deployment.
