# UNSSOR: Unsupervised Neural Speech Separation by Leveraging Over-determined Training Mixtures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.20054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20054
- Authors: Multiple authors
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: UNSSOR achieves strong separation performance for two-speaker mixtures in reverberant conditions using unsupervised training with over-determined microphone configurations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UNSSOR, an algorithm for unsupervised neural speech separation that leverages over-determined microphone configurations to transform an ill-posed problem into a well-posed one. By enforcing linear-filter constraints between each speaker's reverberant images at different microphones, the method enables separation without access to clean training targets. The approach formulates the problem as blind deconvolution, where both speaker images and linear filters must be estimated simultaneously using deep neural networks and the forward convolutive prediction algorithm.

## Method Summary
UNSSOR addresses unsupervised neural speech separation by formulating it as a blind deconvolution problem in over-determined microphone conditions. The method uses a deep neural network to estimate speaker images from multi-microphone mixtures, while relative room impulse responses (RIRs) are estimated via the forward convolutive prediction (FCP) algorithm. The training objective combines mixture consistency loss with an intra-source magnitude scattering loss to handle frequency permutation. The algorithm operates in the time-frequency domain using STFT, with losses computed across all frequency bins to ensure proper alignment and separation of sources.

## Key Results
- UNSSOR achieves strong separation performance for two-speaker mixtures in reverberant conditions
- The method enables unsupervised training without requiring clean speech targets
- Evaluation on the SMS-WSJ dataset shows competitive results compared to supervised baselines and prior unsupervised methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Over-determined microphone conditions transform an ill-posed speech separation problem into a well-posed one by constraining solutions with multiple microphone observations.
- Mechanism: Each microphone captures a different reverberant image of each speaker. When the number of microphones exceeds the number of speakers (P > C), the system of linear equations becomes over-determined, providing enough constraints to uniquely determine speaker images (up to permutation).
- Core assumption: Linear filtering relationship exists between each speaker's reverberant images at different microphones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In over-determined conditions where the microphones out-number speakers, we can narrow down the solutions to speaker images and realize unsupervised speech separation by leveraging each mixture signal as a constraint"
  - [section 3] "Our insight is that, in multi-microphone over-determined conditions where the microphones out-number speakers, the ill-posed problem can be turned into a well-posed one, where a unique solution to the speakers exists"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors discuss general speech separation but don't specifically address the over-determined constraint property
- Break condition: If microphones are not well-separated spatially, the linear filtering relationships become unreliable and the constraint property weakens.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mixture consistency loss promotes separation by enforcing that filtered DNN estimates must reconstruct all microphone mixtures.
- Mechanism: The loss function computes the difference between each microphone's mixture and the sum of FCP-filtered DNN estimates for all speakers. Minimizing this loss forces the DNN to produce estimates that, when filtered appropriately, sum to the observed mixtures, thereby separating speakers.
- Core assumption: The DNN can learn to produce intermediate estimates that, when properly filtered, approximate the true reverberant images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "Following (3), we propose mixture consistency (MC) loss, which is computed by filtering the DNN estimate ˆZ(c) of each speaker c to approximate the P -channel input mixture"
  - [section 4.3] "Although in (6) we linearly filter ˆZ(c) to approximate Yp, earlier studies [17] suggest that the resulting ˆgp(c, f)HeˆZ(c, t, f) would be an estimate ofXp(c, t, f)"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus neighbors discuss mixture consistency in supervised settings but not the unsupervised multi-microphone formulation
- Break condition: If the FCP filtering is too long or too short, it cannot accurately model the true reverberant relationships, weakening the loss signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intra-source magnitude scattering loss addresses frequency permutation by encouraging frequency-aligned speaker estimates.
- Mechanism: The loss measures variance of log magnitudes across frequencies for each estimated speaker. When frequency permutation occurs, estimates contain multiple sources causing higher variance. Minimizing this variance encourages frequency-aligned estimates.
- Core assumption: When frequency permutation occurs, the magnitudes of incorrectly grouped frequencies will show higher variance than correctly grouped ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.5] "LISMS = PX p=1 αp LISMS,p = PX p=1 αp P t 1 C PC c=1 var(log(| ˆXFCP p (c, t, ·)|)) P t var(log(|Yp(t, ·)|))"
  - [section 4.5] "Motivated by IV A, we design the following loss term, named intra-source magnitude scattering (ISMS), to alleviate the frequency permutation problem"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss frequency permutation in the context of unsupervised learning with this specific loss formulation
- Break condition: If sources have very similar spectral characteristics, variance-based frequency alignment may fail to distinguish them.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear filtering and convolution in the time domain
  - Why needed here: Understanding how microphone signals relate through linear filtering is fundamental to grasping the over-determined constraint mechanism
  - Quick check question: If microphone 1 captures X1(c) and microphone 2 captures X2(c) for speaker c, what mathematical operation relates these two signals?

- Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and frequency-domain processing
  - Why needed here: The algorithm operates in the frequency domain using STFT coefficients for mixture modeling and filtering
  - Quick check question: How many complex coefficients are extracted per frame for 8 kHz sampling with a 256-point DFT?

- Concept: Blind deconvolution and its non-convex nature
  - Why needed here: The problem formulation as blind deconvolution explains why prior knowledge (through DNN) is necessary for tractable solution
  - Quick check question: What makes blind deconvolution more challenging than standard deconvolution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input mixtures → TF-GridNet → Speaker estimates → FCP filtering → Mixture consistency loss + ISMS loss → Backpropagation
- Critical path: Mixture → DNN → FCP → Loss computation → Parameter updates
- Design tradeoffs: Causal vs non-causal filtering (causal prevents future information leakage but may reduce accuracy for closer microphones), filter length selection (too short misses reverberation, too long overfits)
- Failure signatures: Frequency permutation in outputs (high ISMS loss), poor separation despite low MC loss (incorrect filter length or DNN architecture issues)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known to verify the over-determined constraint works
  2. Vary filter length (I,J parameters) to find optimal setting for reverberation characteristics
  3. Compare causal vs non-causal filtering performance to understand the tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can UNSSOR handle moving sources within an utterance?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes non-moving sources and uses time-invariant FCP filters, which is a limitation.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or theoretical analysis on how the algorithm would perform with moving sources.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing UNSSOR's performance on datasets with moving sources versus non-moving sources would demonstrate whether the algorithm can handle source motion or if it degrades significantly.

- How does UNSSOR perform on diffuse sources compared to directional point sources?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that diffuse sources are not considered and only directional point sources are assumed.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not include diffuse sources in their experimental setup or provide analysis of how the algorithm would handle them.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing UNSSOR's performance on datasets containing diffuse sources versus datasets with only directional sources would reveal whether the algorithm is effective for diffuse sources.

- Can UNSSOR be extended to estimate the number of sources in under-determined cases?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes the number of sources is known and does not discuss how to estimate it.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any method or discussion on source number estimation, focusing instead on cases where the number of sources is given.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating UNSSOR's performance when the source number is estimated versus known would show whether source number estimation is necessary for practical applications.

## Limitations

- The method requires over-determined microphone configurations (more microphones than speakers), limiting applicability in scenarios with fixed microphone arrays and unpredictable speaker counts
- Performance is sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly FCP filter length and ISMS loss weighting, which may require careful tuning for different acoustic conditions
- The algorithm assumes stationary sources and does not address challenges with moving sources or diffuse sound fields

## Confidence

- High: The over-determined constraint principle and its mathematical formulation are well-established in signal processing literature
- Medium: The blind deconvolution formulation and mixture consistency loss effectiveness are supported by theoretical analysis but require more extensive empirical validation
- Low: The frequency permutation problem resolution through ISMS loss lacks direct empirical evidence and depends heavily on hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks

1. Test UNSSOR with varying microphone counts (P=3, P=4) with fixed speaker count (C=2) to quantify performance degradation as P approaches C
2. Implement ablation studies removing the ISMS loss term to measure its actual contribution to separation quality
3. Evaluate separation performance when speakers have overlapping spectral characteristics to test ISMS robustness limits
