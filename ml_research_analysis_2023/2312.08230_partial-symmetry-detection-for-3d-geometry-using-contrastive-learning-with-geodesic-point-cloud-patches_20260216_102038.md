# Partial Symmetry Detection for 3D Geometry using Contrastive Learning with Geodesic Point Cloud Patches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.08230
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08230
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for detecting partial extrinsic symmetries in 3D shapes.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting partial extrinsic symmetries in 3D shapes using contrastive learning with geodesic point cloud patches. The method learns rotation, reflection, translation, and scale invariant features that enable efficient comparison of regions in latent space to identify symmetries. A key contribution is the introduction of a benchmark test for partial extrinsic symmetry detection. The detected symmetries are used with a region growing algorithm to compute symmetry-aware partitions of 3D shapes, demonstrating strong qualitative and quantitative results that outperform previous methods.

## Method Summary
The method learns invariant local shape features for geodesic point cloud patches via contrastive learning. Patches are extracted using geodesic distances to respect the intrinsic metric of the surface. A Vector Neurons DGCNN encoder is trained to embed these patches into a latent space where similar patches are close together. Clustering in latent space identifies potential symmetric regions, which are then expanded using a region growing algorithm to create maximal symmetric partitions. The approach can detect multiple valid symmetry solutions and generalizes well to unseen shape classes.

## Key Results
- Outperforms previous methods on partial extrinsic symmetry detection benchmark
- Successfully detects multiple valid symmetry solutions for complex 3D shapes
- Demonstrates strong generalization across 8 shape classes from PartNet dataset
- Introduces novel benchmark test for partial extrinsic symmetry detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Geodesic point cloud patches preserve local surface connectivity better than Euclidean patches, leading to more accurate symmetry detection.
- Mechanism: By using geodesic distances instead of Euclidean distances to extract local patches, the method respects the intrinsic metric of the 3D surface. This ensures that patches capture the true local geometry and connectivity of the surface, avoiding the inclusion of disconnected regions that can occur with Euclidean patches.
- Core assumption: Geodesic distance calculation accurately represents the intrinsic metric of the 3D surface.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The method proposes to learn features for "geodesic point cloud patches" which are robust and generalize well.
  - [section 3.1] The paper explicitly states that Euclidean distance extraction "fails to respect the intrinsic metric of the input surface" and proposes using geodesic distances.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in the corpus related to geodesic vs. Euclidean patch extraction for symmetry detection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive learning with geodesic patches enables the model to learn rotation, reflection, translation, and scale invariant features for partial symmetry detection.
- Mechanism: The contrastive learning framework trains the model to map similar patches (augmented versions of the same patch) close together and dissimilar patches far apart in the latent space. By applying data augmentations that include random rotations, reflections, translations, and scaling, the model learns features that are invariant to these transformations. This allows the model to compare patches in latent space regardless of their orientation, position, or size, which is crucial for detecting partial symmetries.
- Core assumption: The contrastive learning framework effectively learns invariant features when provided with appropriate data augmentations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The method learns "rotation, reflection, translation and scale invariant local shape features for geodesic point cloud patches via contrastive learning."
  - [section 3.3] The paper describes the use of Vector Neurons for rotation invariance, data normalization for translation and scale invariance, and random reflections during training to achieve reflection invariance.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in the corpus related to contrastive learning for symmetry detection with geodesic patches.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Clustering in the latent space and region growing algorithm allow for the extraction of maximal symmetric regions from the detected partial symmetries.
- Mechanism: After embedding patches into the latent space, clustering algorithms like HDBSCAN are used to group similar patches together. Each cluster represents a hypothesis of symmetric regions. The region growing algorithm then expands these partial symmetries by assigning nearby points to the closest symmetric region based on geodesic distance, creating maximally symmetric partitions of the 3D shape. This approach allows for the detection of multiple valid symmetry solutions and the generation of larger symmetric regions.
- Core assumption: The clustering algorithm effectively groups similar patches, and the region growing algorithm accurately expands partial symmetries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The method incorporates "detected symmetries together with a region growing algorithm to demonstrate a downstream task with the goal of computing symmetry-aware partitions of 3D shapes."
  - [section 3.4] The paper describes the use of HDBSCAN for clustering and the region growing algorithm for expanding symmetric regions.
  - [section 3.5] The region growing algorithm is detailed, including the use of geodesic distance and ICP distance for refining the symmetric regions.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in the corpus related to clustering and region growing for symmetry detection.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Geodesic patch extraction -> Contrastive learning feature encoder (SymCL or SymML) -> Clustering module (HDBSCAN) -> Region growing algorithm -> Symmetry detection and evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Extract geodesic patches from the input 3D shape
  2. Embed patches into the latent space using the trained feature encoder
  3. Cluster embedded patches to identify potential symmetric regions
  4. Apply region growing algorithm to expand partial symmetries
  5. Evaluate the detected symmetries using ICP distance and other metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Geodesic vs. Euclidean patch extraction: Geodesic patches better capture local surface connectivity but are computationally more expensive.
  - Self-supervised (SymCL) vs. supervised (SymML) learning: Self-supervised learning does not require labeled data but may be less accurate, while supervised learning can leverage ground truth symmetry information but requires additional annotation effort.
  - Number of patches and patch sizes: More patches and larger patch sizes can improve symmetry detection but increase computational cost.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor symmetry detection performance: May indicate issues with geodesic patch extraction, feature learning, or clustering.
  - Inaccurate or incomplete symmetric regions: May suggest problems with the region growing algorithm or the ICP distance evaluation.
  - Slow runtime: Could be due to inefficient geodesic distance computation, large number of patches, or complex clustering and region growing processes.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of using geodesic vs. Euclidean patches on symmetry detection performance using a simple 3D shape (e.g., a cube or sphere).
  2. Compare the self-supervised (SymCL) and supervised (SymML) learning approaches on a small dataset with ground truth symmetry annotations.
  3. Test the effect of different clustering algorithms (e.g., HDBSCAN, DBSCAN, K-means) on the accuracy and efficiency of symmetry detection.

## Limitations

- Computational complexity of geodesic distance calculations becomes prohibitive for high-resolution meshes
- Reliance on careful hyperparameter tuning without comprehensive ablation studies
- Limited benchmark scope covering only 8 shape classes from PartNet

## Confidence

*High Confidence*: The core mechanism of using geodesic patches for symmetry detection is well-supported by the evidence provided. The claim that geodesic patches preserve local surface connectivity better than Euclidean patches is directly stated in the paper and logically follows from the definition of geodesic distance.

*Medium Confidence*: The effectiveness of contrastive learning for learning invariant features is supported by the paper's results, but lacks direct comparison with alternative feature learning approaches. The claim about clustering and region growing producing maximal symmetric regions is demonstrated but could benefit from more extensive quantitative analysis.

*Low Confidence*: The paper claims strong generalization to unseen shape classes, but this is based on limited testing across 8 PartNet categories. The scalability of the approach to more diverse shape collections remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Runtime Complexity Analysis**: Measure the computational cost of geodesic distance calculations versus Euclidean distance extraction across varying mesh resolutions to quantify the practical impact of the proposed approach.

2. **Feature Learning Ablation**: Systematically vary contrastive learning hyperparameters (temperature, patch size, number of patches) and compare against alternative feature learning methods like supervised classification or autoencoders.

3. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate the method on additional shape datasets beyond PartNet (e.g., ShapeNet, ABC dataset) to assess performance across more diverse geometry types and complexity levels.
