# Cross-Lingual Constituency Parsing for Middle High German: A Delexicalized Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2308.04645
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04645
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Delexicalized parser achieves 67.3 F1-score on MHG test set, outperforming zero-shot baselines by 28.6 points

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of syntactic parsing for Middle High German (MHG), a low-resource ancient language, by leveraging the structural similarity with Modern German (MG) through a delexicalized cross-lingual transfer approach. The method involves training a constituency parser on delexicalized MG treebank data, mapping MHG POS tags to MG tags, and applying the trained parser to MHG sentences. The approach demonstrates that delexicalization effectively transfers syntactic knowledge across language stages while avoiding the need for extensive MHG annotation resources. The resulting parser achieves strong performance on the MHG test set, establishing a viable method for automatic syntactic analysis of historical languages.

## Method Summary
The approach employs delexicalization to transfer syntactic knowledge from MG to MHG by removing lexical information while preserving POS tags and morphological features. The process involves training the Berkeley Neural Parser (Benepar) on delexicalized MG Tiger Treebank data, then applying it to MHG sentences after mapping MHG POS tags (HiTS) to MG tags (STTS). An RNNTagger trained on the ReM corpus provides MHG POS tagging, and a custom tag mapping dictionary handles the conversion between tag sets. The trained parser is evaluated on the DDB treebank using standard constituency parsing metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).

## Key Results
- Delexicalized parser achieves 67.3 F1-score on MHG test set
- Outperforms best zero-shot cross-lingual baseline by 28.6 percentage points
- Ablation studies show morphological features contribute ~1.5 F1 points and tag mapping adds ~3 F1 points
- Performance remains stable across different proportions of training data (10-100%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Delexicalization removes lexical surface variation while preserving syntactic structure across languages
- Mechanism: Training on POS sequences instead of word forms allows the parser to focus on shared abstract syntactic categories between MHG and MG
- Core assumption: POS tag sets for MHG and MG are sufficiently aligned to capture relevant syntactic patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "by employing the delexicalization method, we train a constituency parser on MG parse datasets and perform cross-lingual transfer to MHG parsing"
  - [section 4.1] "Benepar exhibits two key features which are advantageous for cross-lingual transfer. Firstly, it employs a self-attentive encoder that effectively captures global context information and exhibits less sensitivity to word order."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structural similarity between MHG and MG enables direct application of a delexicalized parser
- Mechanism: Similar syntactic patterns (word order, case marking) in MHG and MG allow MG-trained parsers to correctly parse MHG POS sequences
- Core assumption: MHG and MG are stages of the same Germanic language family with similar word formation and grammatical features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "MHG and MG are stages of the same Germanic language family, representing different historical periods. Both languages have many similarities in word formation and grammatical features, e.g., similar word order patterns and inflectional systems."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combination of delexicalization and tag mapping preserves sufficient information for accurate parsing
- Mechanism: Delexicalization keeps POS tags with morphological features, while tag mapping ensures MHG tags convert to MG tag set for correct processing
- Core assumption: Morphological features in MHG can map to equivalent features in MG without significant information loss
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "The mapping process involves two dimensions. Firstly, we map the morphological features of MHG to those of MG. Secondly, we map the POS tags of MHG to those of MG primarily based on a mapping dictionary."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: POS tagging and morphological annotation**
  - Why needed here: Delexicalization approach requires accurate POS tags for both languages to work effectively
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a POS tag and a morphological feature, and why are both needed in this approach?

- **Concept: Cross-lingual transfer learning**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how knowledge transfers from high-resource (MG) to low-resource (MHG) language is fundamental
  - Quick check question: What are the key requirements for successful cross-lingual transfer in NLP tasks?

- **Concept: Constituency parsing**
  - Why needed here: Goal is to build constituency parser for MHG, so understanding parsing task and evaluation metrics is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between constituency parsing and dependency parsing, and why might constituency parsing be preferred for historical languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: MHG text -> RNNTagger (POS tagging) -> Tag Mapper (HiTS to STTS) -> Delexicalized Benepar parser -> MHG parse tree

- **Critical path**:
  1. Train delexicalized parser on delexicalized Tiger Treebank
  2. Train MHG POS tagger on ReM corpus
  3. Map MHG POS tags to MG tags using tag mapper
  4. Parse MHG sentences with delexicalized parser
  5. Evaluate using DDB treebank

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Delexicalization vs. lexicalized approaches: Sacrifices semantic information for cross-lingual transfer capability
  - Use of morphological features: Including morphological information improves accuracy but adds complexity to tag mapping
  - Tag set mapping: More comprehensive mapping dictionary could improve accuracy but requires more manual effort

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low parsing accuracy despite good MG performance: Likely indicates tag mapping issues or insufficient structural similarity
  - High variance in parsing results: Could indicate instability in POS tagger or parser training
  - Systematic errors on specific constructions: May indicate gaps in tag mapping or parser's ability to handle those structures

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Parse small set of MHG sentences and manually inspect results to identify error patterns
  2. Evaluate MHG POS tagger on held-out test set to ensure accurate tags before parsing
  3. Test tag mapper on sample of MHG POS tags to verify mapping is correct and complete

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several arise from the work:
- How well would this approach generalize to other ancient languages structurally similar to their modern counterparts?
- What impact would more advanced or MHG-specific POS taggers have on overall performance?
- How does delexicalization compare to other cross-lingual transfer methods like continuous representations or multilingual knowledge bases?

## Limitations
- The complete HiTS-to-STTS tag mapping dictionary is not provided, making exact reproduction difficult
- Limited evaluation on only 96 test sentences may not fully capture parser robustness
- No comparison to lexicalized cross-lingual baselines or supervised MHG parsers

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of delexicalization for cross-lingual transfer is sound and well-established in NLP
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details (tag mapping, parser training) are likely correct given the results, but exact reproducibility is limited
- **Low confidence**: The claim of "best performance" is difficult to verify without baseline comparisons to other MHG parsing approaches

## Next Checks

1. Manually verify the HiTS-to-STTS tag mapping dictionary on a sample of MHG sentences to ensure accuracy and completeness
2. Replicate the parser training and evaluation using a held-out subset of the Tiger Treebank to confirm the delexicalization approach works as claimed
3. Test the trained parser on a larger sample of MHG sentences (beyond the DDB Treebank) to assess generalization to unseen MHG text
