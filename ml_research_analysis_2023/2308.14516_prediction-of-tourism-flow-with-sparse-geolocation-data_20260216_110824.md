# Prediction of Tourism Flow with Sparse Geolocation Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14516
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Deep learning models (RNNs, GNNs, Transformers) outperform ARIMA for tourism flow prediction using sparse geolocation data

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates deep learning models for predicting tourism flow using sparse geolocation data in Salzburg, Austria. The authors compare RNN variants, GNNs, and Transformers against the traditional ARIMA method on a real-world dataset incorporating Salzburg Card entry data, weather, holidays, and anonymized tourist trajectories. Deep learning models consistently outperformed ARIMA, achieving lower prediction errors and faster inference times. Notably, GNNs effectively leveraged sparse geolocation data by mapping trajectories to a street graph structure, demonstrating their potential for spatial-temporal forecasting tasks.

## Method Summary
The study used Salzburg Card entry data, weather data, holiday information, and anonymized tourist geolocation trajectories mapped to an OpenStreetMap street graph. The data was preprocessed with normalization and sine-cosine transformations for months, then split into 30-sequence chunks. Models trained included ARIMA, RNN variants (LSTM, GRU-D, phased-LSTM, CT-RNN, CT-LSTM, NeuralODE, vanilla RNN), Transformer, and GNN (CT-GRN) using Adam optimizer with BPTT, MSE/MAE/Huber loss, 16 batch size, 300 epochs, and 1e-3 learning rate. Performance was evaluated using MAE and RMSE metrics across 32 POIs.

## Key Results
- Deep learning models consistently outperformed ARIMA on tourism flow prediction
- GNNs effectively leveraged sparse geolocation data through street graph mapping
- Including external features (weather, holidays) improved prediction accuracy
- Models showed lower prediction errors and faster inference times compared to ARIMA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph Neural Networks effectively leverage sparse geolocation data by mapping individual trajectories to a street graph structure.
- Mechanism: The GNN approach uses OpenStreetMap data to create a graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent street segments. Individual tourist trajectories are mapped to the nearest graph nodes and aggregated hourly, allowing the model to incorporate spatial relationships despite sparse data.
- Core assumption: The spatial proximity of trajectory points to graph nodes preserves meaningful relationships between locations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GNNs effectively leveraged sparse geolocation data, demonstrating their potential for spatial-temporal forecasting tasks."
  - [section]: "We utilized mobile phone location data... The resulting graph contains 2064 nodes and 5359 edges... We then mapped the location data to the graph by assigning each location to the nearest node and aggregating the total number per hour."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus papers directly address GNN approaches to sparse geolocation data in tourism.
- Break condition: If the mapping between trajectory points and graph nodes becomes too sparse or if the graph structure doesn't capture relevant spatial relationships, the GNN approach loses effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deep learning models outperform ARIMA because they can learn complex temporal patterns and handle multivariate inputs.
- Mechanism: DL models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers process sequences of multiple features simultaneously, capturing both temporal dependencies and correlations between different variables (e.g., weather, holidays, POI visits).
- Core assumption: The temporal and cross-feature relationships in the tourism data are sufficiently complex to benefit from deep learning architectures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Deep learning models outperformed ARIMA, achieving lower prediction errors and faster inference times."
  - [section]: "Our DL models outperformed ARIMA in both metrics, with and without additional features... ARIMA does not have a dedicated training step, and its calculations are time-consuming since it makes predictions for each POI separately."
  - [corpus]: Weak - while related papers discuss DL for tourism, none provide direct comparison with ARIMA on sparse geolocation data.
- Break condition: If the data lacks sufficient complexity or the relationships are primarily linear, ARIMA or simpler models might perform equally well.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating external features (weather, holidays) improves prediction accuracy by providing context for tourism patterns.
- Mechanism: The models use additional features as input alongside historical visitor counts, allowing them to learn how external factors influence tourism flow.
- Core assumption: Weather and holiday data have meaningful correlations with tourism patterns that the model can learn.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "They incorporate additional features like weather, holidays, and anonymized tourist trajectories to improve predictions."
  - [section]: "We added additional features to the dataset: Year, Month, Day of month, Day of week, Holidays and Weather data."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus papers directly test the impact of external features on tourism prediction accuracy.
- Break condition: If the external features don't have significant predictive power or if they introduce noise that confuses the model.

## Foundational Learning

  - Why needed here: Understanding temporal dependencies and forecasting techniques is crucial for building and evaluating tourism flow prediction models.
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between autoregressive and moving average components in ARIMA models?

- Concept: Graph neural networks and their applications
  - Why needed here: The paper uses GNNs to incorporate spatial information from geolocation data, requiring understanding of how GNNs process graph-structured data.
  - Quick check question: How does a Graph Convolutional Network differ from a standard Convolutional Neural Network?

- Concept: Deep learning architectures for sequential data
  - Why needed here: The paper compares multiple DL models (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) for time series prediction, requiring understanding of their strengths and limitations.
  - Quick check question: What's the main advantage of using LSTM over vanilla RNN for long sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing pipeline -> Graph construction module -> Model training and evaluation framework -> Prediction and inference system

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and preprocessing
  2. Graph construction and geolocation mapping
  3. Model training with cross-validation
  4. Performance evaluation and comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GNNs adds complexity but enables spatial feature incorporation
  - Including external features increases model complexity but may improve accuracy
  - Normalizing visitor counts helps convergence but may lose interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on POIs with sparse data (e.g., special events, irregular schedules)
  - Overfitting when including too many external features
  - Computational inefficiency when scaling to larger graphs or more POIs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline ARIMA vs simple RNN on POI visitor counts without external features
  2. Same models with external features (weather, holidays) added
  3. GNN model with sparse geolocation data compared to other DL models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of deep learning models for tourism flow prediction change with different sequence lengths during training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using sequences of length 30 for training but does not explore the impact of varying sequence lengths on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The authors did not conduct experiments with different sequence lengths to determine the optimal length for training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying sequence lengths (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100) and comparing the performance of deep learning models would provide insights into the optimal sequence length for training.

### Open Question 2

- Why unresolved: The authors did not implement or evaluate any regularization techniques, such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, or early stopping, to determine their impact on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating various regularization techniques on the tourism flow prediction task would provide insights into their effectiveness in improving model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional exogenous data sources, such as social media trends or event information, impact the performance of deep learning models for tourism flow prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper incorporates weather and holiday data as exogenous features but does not explore the impact of other potential data sources on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The authors did not incorporate or evaluate the impact of additional exogenous data sources, such as social media trends or event information, on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Incorporating and evaluating the impact of additional exogenous data sources on the tourism flow prediction task would provide insights into their potential to improve model performance.

## Limitations

- Evaluation based on single city dataset (Salzburg, Austria) with 32 POIs, limiting generalizability
- Geolocation data mapping process (nearest-node assignment) not fully specified, potentially impacting GNN performance
- Does not address privacy concerns associated with using anonymized but detailed tourist trajectories
- Computational complexity comparison between deep learning models and ARIMA not thoroughly quantified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that deep learning models outperform ARIMA on this specific dataset and task is well-supported by the presented results. The MAE and RMSE metrics consistently show lower prediction errors for DL models across multiple POI types.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of GNNs in leveraging sparse geolocation data is demonstrated but could benefit from additional validation on datasets with varying levels of sparsity. The specific advantage of GNNs over other DL architectures is not fully isolated in the experiments.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of these results to other tourism contexts (different cities, countries, or types of attractions) remains uncertain without additional validation studies. The impact of different preprocessing choices on model performance is not explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-city validation**: Test the models on tourism data from a different city with distinct urban characteristics to evaluate generalizability. Compare performance when using city-specific versus cross-city trained models.

2. **Sparsity sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the density of geolocation data and measure how GNN performance degrades compared to other DL models. This would clarify the practical limits of the GNN approach.

3. **Feature importance ablation**: Conduct a systematic ablation study removing different feature sets (weather, holidays, trajectories) to quantify their individual contributions to prediction accuracy and identify which features provide the most value.
