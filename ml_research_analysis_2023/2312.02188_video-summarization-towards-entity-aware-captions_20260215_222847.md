# Video Summarization: Towards Entity-Aware Captions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02188
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02188
- Reference count: 40

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new task of summarizing news videos into entity-aware captions that require specific named entities (people, places, organizations) for meaningful summarization. The authors propose a large-scale dataset, VIEWS, containing 144K news videos with highly aligned captions, and develop a method that leverages an Entity-Perceiver to detect named entities from videos, retrieves contextual knowledge using a large language model, and generates entity-aware captions using state-of-the-art video captioning models. Extensive experiments show that their approach improves the performance of three video captioning models on the new task, and also generalizes to an existing news image captioning dataset.

## Method Summary
The method consists of three main components: an Entity-Perceiver that recognizes named entities directly from video frames without relying on ASR, a Knowledge-Retriever that uses detected entities to retrieve relevant news context from an LLM, and a captioning model that integrates video, entities, and retrieved knowledge through transformer attention mechanisms. The approach is trained end-to-end on the VIEWS dataset with ground-truth entities extracted from bullet summaries using a LLM, and evaluated on multiple video captioning models including GIT, BLIP-2, and ViT-T5.

## Key Results
- The proposed method improves performance of three video captioning models on the entity-aware captioning task
- Entity-aware captions generated by the method achieve higher BLEU-4, Rouge-L, CIDEr, and Entity F1 scores compared to baselines
- The approach generalizes to an existing news image captioning dataset, demonstrating its broader applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Entity-Perceiver learns to recognize named entities directly from visual data without relying on ASR.
- Mechanism: The model is trained on ground-truth entities extracted from bullet summaries using a LLM, learning to map visual features to named entities like people, places, and organizations.
- Core assumption: Visual cues such as landmarks, cultural attire, and scene context are sufficient to recognize named entities in news videos.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Firstly, it requires models to explicitly use visual cues to recognize people, place, event, organization etc. (named entities) depicted in the video."
  - [section 4] "We first train an Entity Perciever to recognize named entities from video."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence in corpus that visual-only recognition works well without ASR.
- Break condition: If visual cues are ambiguous or missing (e.g., unfamiliar locations, non-distinctive scenes), the model fails to recognize entities accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Knowledge-Retriever uses detected entities to retrieve relevant news context from an LLM, improving caption informativeness.
- Mechanism: Entities are fed to an LLM with a prompt to retrieve related news articles, providing context that is integrated into the captioning process.
- Core assumption: The LLM has sufficient world knowledge to retrieve relevant context based on the detected entities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Then, it utilizes a Knowledge-Retriever(KR) to retrieve the context of the video by utilizing the predicted entities."
  - [section 4] "We input the entities to the LLM with the prompt 'Retrieve the most relevant news articles involving these entities' and then gather the output from the LLM as the knowledge about these entities."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence directly supports the effectiveness of LLM-based knowledge retrieval for this task.
- Break condition: If the detected entities are incorrect or insufficient, the retrieved knowledge may be irrelevant or misleading.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integrating video, entities, and retrieved knowledge through transformer attention improves entity-aware captioning.
- Mechanism: The captioning model uses transformer-based attention to combine visual features, entity tokens, and knowledge tokens, generating captions that incorporate specific named entities and context.
- Core assumption: The transformer architecture can effectively fuse multimodal inputs to produce coherent and informative captions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, we leverage recent transformer-attention based video captioning models to integrate the video, the entities and the context into informative entity-aware captions."
  - [section 4] "We aim to utilize the inbuilt transformer based attention mechanism in the model’s architecture to seamlessly integrate different inputs."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence on the specific attention-based integration mechanism.
- Break condition: If the attention mechanism fails to align or prioritize the correct information from the multimodal inputs, the generated captions may be incoherent or miss key entities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Why needed here: To identify and classify named entities (people, places, organizations) from the video content.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between recognizing "Bush" as a person versus recognizing "Bush" as a location?
- Concept: Transformer-based Attention Mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To integrate visual, entity, and knowledge information effectively for generating informative captions.
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention differ from cross-attention in a multimodal transformer model?
- Concept: Knowledge Retrieval from Large Language Models
  - Why needed here: To obtain contextual information related to the detected entities to enhance caption informativeness.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of using LLMs for knowledge retrieval in specialized domains like news?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video → Entity-Perceiver → Detected Entities → Knowledge-Retriever → Retrieved Knowledge → Captioning Model → Entity-Aware Captions
- Critical path: The complete pipeline from video input through entity detection, knowledge retrieval, and final caption generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using visual-only entity detection avoids dependency on ASR but may miss audio-based entities
  - Relying on LLM for knowledge retrieval leverages external knowledge but introduces potential for irrelevant or incorrect context
  - Fine-tuning the captioning model allows adaptation but increases training complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor entity detection: Captions lack specific named entities or include incorrect ones
  - Irrelevant knowledge retrieval: Captions contain unrelated or misleading information
  - Attention misalignment: Captions are incoherent or fail to integrate multimodal information effectively
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the Entity-Perceiver's entity detection accuracy on a validation set with ground-truth entities
  2. Assess the Knowledge-Retriever's relevance by comparing retrieved knowledge to ground-truth captions using metrics like Bert-Score
  3. Test the full pipeline's performance by generating captions on a subset of the dataset and evaluating entity F1 and caption quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Entity-Perceiver (EP) model vary when trained on different types of news video datasets, such as those with varying levels of video quality, diversity in content, or alignment between video and captions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the training of the EP model on a large-scale dataset, VIEWS, which contains news videos with highly aligned captions. However, it does not explore how the EP model performs on datasets with different characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments or analysis on the performance of the EP model on datasets with varying characteristics. This leaves uncertainty about the model's robustness and generalizability across different types of news video datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to train and evaluate the EP model on various news video datasets with different characteristics, such as video quality, content diversity, and caption alignment, would provide insights into the model's performance and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different types of knowledge retrieval methods, such as direct search versus using a large language model (LLM), on the quality and relevance of the retrieved knowledge for entity-aware captioning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes the use of an LLM for knowledge retrieval in the proposed method, but it does not compare this approach with other knowledge retrieval methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of different knowledge retrieval methods, leaving uncertainty about the effectiveness and efficiency of using an LLM for knowledge retrieval in the context of entity-aware captioning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the performance of the proposed method using an LLM for knowledge retrieval with other methods, such as direct search or different types of LLMs, would provide insights into the most effective approach for retrieving relevant knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional contextual information, such as historical or social context, affect the quality and informativeness of the generated entity-aware captions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the use of contextual information, such as retrieved knowledge, to improve the quality of entity-aware captions. However, it does not explore the impact of including additional types of contextual information, such as historical or social context.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments or analysis on the impact of including additional contextual information beyond the retrieved knowledge. This leaves uncertainty about the potential benefits of incorporating more diverse contextual information into the captioning process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with the inclusion of additional contextual information, such as historical or social context, would provide insights into the potential improvements in caption quality and informativeness.

## Limitations

- The approach relies heavily on visual-only entity recognition without ASR input, which may miss critical entity information present in speech
- Knowledge retrieval effectiveness is not empirically validated, with no evidence demonstrating the quality or relevance of retrieved information
- The evaluation methodology lacks component ablation studies, making it difficult to isolate which parts of the pipeline drive performance improvements

## Confidence

- Entity Recognition Claims: Low confidence - Visual-only entity recognition is claimed but not directly validated with empirical evidence
- Knowledge Retrieval Claims: Medium confidence - Retrieval mechanism is described but effectiveness is not demonstrated in the paper
- Integration and Performance Claims: Medium confidence - Overall performance improvements are shown but component contributions are not isolated through ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Entity Detection Validation**: Run the Entity-Perceiver on a held-out validation set with ground-truth entity annotations to measure detection accuracy. This will establish whether the visual-only entity recognition approach actually works before evaluating the full pipeline.

2. **Knowledge Relevance Assessment**: Compare the knowledge retrieved by the LLM against ground-truth captions using semantic similarity metrics (BERTScore, ROUGE) to quantify how often the retrieved information is actually relevant and useful for caption generation.

3. **Component Ablation Study**: Evaluate the full pipeline with and without each component (Entity-Perceiver, Knowledge-Retriever) to isolate their individual contributions to performance improvements. This will clarify whether the gains come from better entity detection, knowledge retrieval, or their integration.
