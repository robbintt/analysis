# Federated Hyperdimensional Computing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.15966
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15966
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 3× faster convergence, 66× lower communication, and 1.5-6× less local computation than CNN-based FL

## Executive Summary
FHDnn introduces a federated learning framework that combines hyperdimensional computing with CNNs to enable efficient, accurate, and robust learning on edge devices. By using a pre-trained CNN feature extractor with an HDC learner, the method achieves fast convergence and communication efficiency while maintaining resilience to network errors. The approach addresses key challenges in federated learning including high computational costs, communication overhead, and unreliable wireless networks.

## Method Summary
FHDnn combines a fixed pre-trained CNN (SimCLR ResNet) feature extractor with federated HDC learning. Only the HDC model is updated and transmitted during training, while the CNN remains unchanged. Local training uses one-shot encoding and retraining, with global aggregation averaging class hypervectors. The method employs communication efficiency strategies including binarized differential transmission, subsampling, and sparsification to further reduce bandwidth requirements.

## Key Results
- Converges 3× faster than traditional CNN-based federated learning
- Reduces communication costs by 66× through transmitting only HDC models
- Decreases local computation and energy consumption by 1.5-6×
- Maintains high accuracy under noisy and lossy network conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** FHDnn converges 3× faster than CNNs due to linearizing non-linear learning tasks in hyperdimensional space
- **Mechanism:** HDC encoding maps data into a high-dimensional space where dimensions are uncorrelated (Σij ≈ 0, i ≠ j), enabling linear methods to solve non-linear problems
- **Core assumption:** The encoding preserves separability while enabling linear methods to capture non-linear boundaries
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "converges 3× faster vs. DNNs"; section explains HD encoding creates uncorrelated dimensions
- **Break condition:** If the embedding loses critical class separability, convergence gains vanish

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** HDC's holographic properties provide robustness to packet loss
- **Mechanism:** Any subset of hypervector dimensions retains partial information about original data, degrading but not eliminating classification capability
- **Core assumption:** The encoding is sufficiently redundant that partial retrieval still yields usable similarity scores
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "highly robust to network errors"; section describes holographic representation benefits for packet losses
- **Break condition:** If too many dimensions are lost, similarity scores become indistinguishable across classes

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Reduces communication costs by 66× by transmitting only small HDC model
- **Mechanism:** Only the HDC learner (few thousand parameters) is updated and transmitted, replacing large CNN weight matrices with compact hypervectors
- **Core assumption:** Fixed CNN features are sufficiently general for target tasks
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "reduces communication costs by 66× vs. DNNs"; section explains avoiding CNN transmission
- **Break condition:** If feature extractor becomes task-specific, retraining it may be necessary, breaking the 66× savings

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hyperdimensional Computing encoding**
  - Why needed here: HDC transforms high-dimensional vectors into a space where linear methods can solve non-linear problems; core to FHDnn's speed and robustness
  - Quick check question: What property of HDC vectors makes them nearly orthogonal in high dimensions?

- **Concept: Federated averaging convergence**
  - Why needed here: Understanding FedAvg guarantees (O(1/T) rate) helps reason about FHDnn's convergence proof and client selection
  - Quick check question: What condition on local functions enables O(1/T) convergence in FedAvg?

- **Concept: Signal-to-noise ratio in distributed learning**
  - Why needed here: SNR analysis explains why bundling client models suppresses noise and why HDC's linear updates further amplify this effect
  - Quick check question: How does the SNR of the global model scale with the number of clients in FHDnn?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pre-trained CNN (SimCLR ResNet) -> Feature extractor (fixed weights) -> Hyperdimensional encoder (random projection) -> HDC learner (class prototypes, bundling, retraining) -> Communication (only prototypes transmitted) -> Server -> Aggregation (sum of prototypes)

- **Critical path:** 1. Server broadcasts global HDC model to clients. 2. Each client encodes local data via CNN + HDC encoder. 3. Client trains HDC learner locally (one-shot + perceptron updates). 4. Clients send updated prototypes to server. 5. Server aggregates and broadcasts new global model.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. communication (general CNN vs. task-specific fine-tuning); Robustness vs. efficiency (full hypervectors vs. sparsification/subsampling); Speed vs. noise tolerance (more epochs vs. packet loss resilience)

- **Failure signatures:** Convergence stalls (check if HDC encoding dimension is too low or if class prototypes are too similar); Accuracy drops sharply under packet loss (verify subsampling rate or sparsity is not too aggressive); High communication cost (confirm binarization/quantization is applied)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Run FHDnn with CIFAR-10 IID data, vary E (epochs) from 1 to 5, observe convergence curves. 2. Simulate 20% packet loss; measure accuracy drop vs. full model baseline. 3. Apply 50% sparsification; compare communication bytes and accuracy to un-sparsified model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the dimensionality of hypervectors affect the accuracy of FHDnn across different datasets and problem complexities?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Table II and discussion on dimensionality trade-offs
- **Why unresolved:** The paper shows accuracy increases with dimensionality but doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between dimensionality and performance across diverse datasets or problem complexities
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic experiments varying dimensionality across multiple datasets with different characteristics (e.g., simple vs. complex classification tasks) while measuring accuracy and resource usage

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the optimal balance between communication efficiency strategies (e.g., binarization, sparsification) and model accuracy in FHDnn?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V-D discusses various strategies but doesn't provide comprehensive trade-off analysis
- **Why unresolved:** The paper mentions different strategies but doesn't provide a unified framework or guidelines for selecting optimal combinations based on network conditions, resource constraints, or accuracy requirements
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of different strategy combinations under various conditions (network reliability, device capabilities) with clear accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does FHDnn perform under extreme network conditions such as high packet loss (>50%) or very low SNR (<0dB)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI-D discusses unreliable communication but only tests up to 20% packet loss and -10dB SNR
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates robustness but doesn't explore the limits of FHDnn's resilience or identify breaking points where performance degrades significantly
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments testing FHDnn under progressively worse network conditions to determine performance thresholds and failure modes

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can FHDnn be extended to support continuous learning or incremental updates without retraining from scratch?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper focuses on batch learning but doesn't address scenarios where data distributions change over time or new classes need to be added
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework assumes static datasets and fixed class sets, which may not be practical for real-world applications with evolving data
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments demonstrating FHDnn's ability to adapt to new data or classes while maintaining accuracy on previously learned information without full retraining

## Limitations

- The 66× communication reduction assumes fixed CNN features are sufficient for all tasks - if domain adaptation becomes necessary, this advantage diminishes
- Packet loss robustness claims lack quantitative analysis of the trade-off between dimension reduction and classification accuracy under various loss rates
- Convergence speedup (3×) relies heavily on HDC's ability to linearize non-linear decision boundaries, which has limited validation across diverse datasets

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Communication cost reduction mechanism (66×) and computational efficiency gains (1.5-6×), as these are straightforward consequences of transmitting only the HDC model versus full CNN weights
- **Medium confidence:** Convergence speedup claim (3×), as it depends on the specific interplay between HDC encoding and classification task complexity
- **Low confidence:** Packet loss robustness claims, due to limited empirical validation and lack of systematic study on the robustness-accuracy trade-off under different network conditions

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence validation:** Test FHDnn on a non-IID federated split of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance across clients to verify the 3× convergence speedup holds under realistic federated conditions
2. **Communication-accuracy trade-off:** Systematically measure accuracy degradation as communication bandwidth is reduced through sparsification and subsampling under different packet loss rates (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%)
3. **Generalization test:** Evaluate FHDnn's accuracy when the pre-trained CNN features are extracted from a different domain (e.g., using ImageNet-pretrained ResNet for a medical imaging dataset) to assess the limits of the fixed feature extractor assumption
