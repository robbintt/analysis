# Towards dialect-inclusive recognition in a low-resource language: are balanced corpora the answer?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07295
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07295
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Dialect-balanced corpora do not yield equal ASR performance across Irish dialects; Ulster underperforms while Munster achieves lowest WERs, suggesting differential dialect weightings may be needed for equitable recognition.

## Executive Summary
This diagnostic study investigates how dialect composition in training corpora affects automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance for Irish, a low-resource language with three major dialects. The researchers systematically modified a baseline dialect-balanced corpus by adding or removing dialect-specific materials to create 12 training sets, which were used to finetune an XLS-R wav2vec 2.0 model. The results demonstrate that balanced corpora do not produce equitable performance across dialects, with Ulster consistently underperforming and Munster achieving the lowest word error rates (WERs). The study reveals an asymmetric relationship between Connacht and Munster dialects, where performance for Munster speakers is more severely affected by removal of its dataset than by removal of Connacht's. These findings suggest that differential dialect weightings at the point of corpus collection could be an effective bias-mitigating strategy for achieving more equitable cross-dialect recognition performance.

## Method Summary
The study created 12 training corpora by systematically modifying a baseline 48-hour dialect-balanced corpus through subtraction or supplementation of 30 hours of dialect-specific materials per dialect (Ulster, Connacht, Munster), plus 5 hours of non-native speech. An XLS-R wav2vec 2.0 model was fine-tuned with CTC on each training set without external language models. Performance was evaluated on dialect-balanced development (1.5h) and evaluation (2.5h) test sets. WERs were calculated for each dialect across all training conditions to analyze how corpus composition affects recognition performance and identify bias-mitigating strategies.

## Key Results
- Dialect-balanced corpora do not yield equal performance across Irish dialects, with Ulster consistently underperforming and Munster achieving lowest WERs
- Removing an entire dialect's dataset disproportionately harms recognition performance for that dialect
- Munster dialect data is most beneficial for both Munster and Connacht speakers, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between these dialects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing an entire dialect dataset disproportionately harms recognition performance for that dialect.
- Mechanism: When a dialect's acoustic-phonetic patterns are absent from training, the model loses exposure to those features, leading to increased confusion and errors during recognition.
- Core assumption: Acoustic-phonetic patterns for each dialect are sufficiently distinct that their absence creates a measurable gap in model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Ul dialect consistently underperforms, whereas Mu yields lowest WERs."
  - [section] "For Co speakers, there is relatively little degradation in performance by the removal of its dataset... in stark contrast to the effects in the other dialects."
  - [corpus] Corpus analysis confirms Ulster has the least overlap in acoustic patterns with other dialects; however, explicit acoustic feature overlap data is not provided.
- Break condition: If dialects are not acoustically distinct, or if the model can generalize across dialects without explicit exposure, this mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding dialect-specific data improves performance more for that dialect than for others.
- Mechanism: Increasing the proportion of a dialect's data in training strengthens the model's ability to recognize that dialect's unique acoustic-phonetic features, leading to improved recognition accuracy.
- Core assumption: The model can leverage additional data to refine its internal representations of dialect-specific features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Performance for Ul and Mu speakers is however more enhanced when the supplemented data is dialect appropriate."
  - [section] "Performance for Co speakers (green) is improved roughly equally regardless of the dataset that is added. Performance for Ul and Mu speakers is however more enhanced when the supplemented data is dialect appropriate."
  - [corpus] Spontaneous speech data shows clear dialect-specific acoustic patterns, but quantitative overlap analysis is missing.
- Break condition: If the model cannot effectively utilize additional dialect-specific data, or if the added data is too noisy or inconsistent, this mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Munster (Mu) dialect data is most beneficial for both Munster and Connacht (Co) speakers.
- Mechanism: Munster dialect features may represent a "mid-dialect" position that shares acoustic-phonetic characteristics with both Ulster and Connacht, making it broadly useful for cross-dialect recognition.
- Core assumption: Munster dialect occupies a central position in the dialect continuum, sharing features with both extremes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "There is a close relationship between Co and Mu dialects, but one that is not symmetrical."
  - [section] "Curiously, while one might have expected that adding data from a 'mid' dialect might confer the most benefit overall, the results here suggest the opposite."
  - [corpus] Linguistic literature supports a north-south dialect divide, but explicit acoustic evidence for Munster's central position is not provided.
- Break condition: If Munster does not share significant features with both other dialects, or if the acoustic-phonetic space is not linear, this mechanism would fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dialect continuum and acoustic-phonetic variation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how dialects differ acoustically is crucial for interpreting the results and designing effective mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: How do dialect-specific acoustic-phonetic features impact ASR performance, and what evidence supports the notion of a dialect continuum?

- Concept: Corpus composition and bias
  - Why needed here: The study investigates how the balance of dialect data in training corpora affects recognition performance, highlighting the importance of corpus composition.
  - Quick check question: How does the proportion of dialect data in a training corpus influence ASR performance, and what are the implications for corpus collection strategies?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The ASR system uses a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model fine-tuned with CTC, requiring an understanding of these techniques.
  - Quick check question: How do self-supervised learning and fine-tuning contribute to ASR performance, and what are the limitations of these approaches in low-resource settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model (XLS-R) -> Fine-tuning with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -> Training corpora (dialect-specific and balanced) -> Evaluation corpora (dialect-balanced) -> WER calculation and analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare training corpora (balanced and modified versions)
  2. Fine-tune pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model with CTC
  3. Evaluate performance on dialect-balanced test sets
  4. Analyze WER results and cross-dialect performance trends

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing dialect representation in training corpora vs. focusing on underrepresented dialects
  - Using external language models for improved performance vs. potential dialect bias
  - Collecting more data for each dialect vs. limited resources in low-resource settings

- Failure signatures:
  - High WERs across all dialects, indicating poor overall model performance
  - Consistent underperformance of one dialect, suggesting bias in training data or model architecture
  - Unexpected performance trends that contradict linguistic or acoustic-phonetic expectations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a baseline model using a dialect-balanced corpus and evaluate WERs for each dialect.
  2. Train models using modified corpora where one dialect's data is removed and compare WERs to the baseline.
  3. Train models using modified corpora where one dialect's data is supplemented and compare WERs to the baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the addition of non-native speech to training sets systematically bias ASR performance towards specific dialects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that 5 hours of non-native speech was added to training sets to increase data size, but acknowledges this could introduce inadvertent bias since non-native speech can approximate dialects to varying degrees.
- Why unresolved: The experiments don't systematically vary or analyze the effect of non-native speech proportions, making it unclear whether this addition affects dialect-specific performance patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments with different proportions of non-native speech and analysis of its dialect distribution effects on recognition performance across the three Irish dialects.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal weighting strategy for dialect representation in training corpora to achieve equal cross-dialect performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that differential dialect weightings at corpus collection could be a bias-mitigating strategy, noting that balanced corpora yield worse results for Ulster and better for Munster speakers.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies performance disparities but doesn't experimentally test different dialect weighting schemes to determine optimal proportions for equal performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying dialect representation ratios in training data to find configurations that minimize performance gaps across all three dialects.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do prosodic, morphological, and syntactic dialect features affect ASR performance compared to segmental differences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the models capture largely segmental aspects while excluding dialect markers like prosody, morphology, and syntax, suggesting these could contribute to performance differences.
- Why unresolved: The wav2vec 2.0 models used focus on acoustic features without explicitly modeling higher-level dialect features that the paper identifies as important dialect markers.
- What evidence would resolve it: ASR experiments using models that explicitly incorporate prosodic, morphological, and syntactic dialect features, comparing their performance to the segmental-only approach.

## Limitations

- The study cannot definitively explain the underlying linguistic or acoustic reasons for the asymmetric performance patterns observed across dialects.
- The evaluation relies on WER without external language models, limiting absolute performance comparisons to state-of-the-art systems.
- The corpus size (48 hours total) may be too limited to draw definitive conclusions about optimal corpus balancing strategies for production systems.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical finding that dialect-balanced corpora do not yield equal performance across all dialects; the systematic methodology and clear results support this conclusion.
- Medium confidence: The specific recommendations about differential dialect weightings at corpus collection time; while supported by results, the optimal weighting strategy requires further validation.
- Medium confidence: The characterization of Munster as having asymmetric benefits for Connacht speakers; supported by data but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct detailed acoustic-phonetic analysis comparing the three dialects to identify specific features driving the performance asymmetries observed in the WER results.
2. Test whether adding external language models changes the relative dialect performance patterns or simply improves absolute performance across all dialects equally.
3. Expand the corpus size and test whether the observed effects scale proportionally or whether different dialect weighting strategies become optimal at larger data volumes.
