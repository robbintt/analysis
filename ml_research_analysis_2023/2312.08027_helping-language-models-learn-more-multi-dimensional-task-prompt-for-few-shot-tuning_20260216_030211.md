# Helping Language Models Learn More: Multi-dimensional Task Prompt for Few-shot Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.08027
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08027
- Reference count: 28
- MTPrompt improves few-shot learning accuracy by 1-5% compared to strong baselines like LMBFF

## Executive Summary
MTPrompt introduces a novel approach to few-shot learning by constructing prompts that combine three types of task-related information: object description, summary description, and task description. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five few-shot learning tasks including sentiment classification, question classification, and natural language inference. Through ablation studies, the authors show that each type of task description contributes to the performance gains, and the approach is stable across different experimental settings.

## Method Summary
MTPrompt generates prompts by combining three types of task descriptions (object, summary, and task descriptions) with input data. The method uses RoBERTa-large as the base model and employs cross-entropy loss for token prediction. For each dataset, multiple prompt templates are constructed by combining the three description types in different ways, and the best template is selected through evaluation. The approach is tested on five datasets (SST-2, SST-5, TREC-6, SNLI, QNLI) with K=16 examples per class across five different data splits.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art few-shot learning performance across five different NLP tasks
- Improves accuracy by 1-5% compared to strong baselines like LMBFF
- Ablation studies demonstrate that each type of task description contributes to performance gains
- Shows stable performance across different experimental settings and batch sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task-related tokens act as initialization vectors that steer the model's representation space toward task-relevant regions
- Mechanism: The MTPrompt method adds metadata descriptions (object, summary, task descriptions) as additional tokens before the input. These tokens shift the initial position of the sentence representation in the model's semantic space closer to the task's decision boundary
- Core assumption: The pre-trained language model's semantic space contains task-relevant knowledge that can be activated through appropriate positioning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "embedding more task-related information into prompts will make it easier to stimulate knowledge embedded in large language models"
  - [section III.A] "the metadata description could help the PLMs fine-tune in more narrow and similar semantic space"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations supporting this specific mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-dimensional task descriptions provide complementary semantic cues that help the model disambiguate task requirements
- Mechanism: Different types of descriptions (object, summary, task) capture different aspects of the task. Together they provide a richer semantic context that helps the model understand what is being asked
- Core assumption: The model can effectively integrate multiple complementary semantic cues
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.A] "We aim to design more instructive prompts from the degree of meta-description of the task"
  - [section IV.E] "it reviews that these three description types can motivate the PLMs to generate more suitable predictions"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations supporting this specific mechanism

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Appropriate task-related tokens reduce the effective distance between the input representation and the task-relevant decision boundary
- Mechanism: By adding task-related tokens, the initial representation of the input sentence is positioned closer to where the model would need to be for accurate classification, reducing the amount of fine-tuning needed
- Core assumption: The model's parameter space is smooth enough that small changes in input representation lead to small changes in output
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.C] "the position of the sentence 'I like to move' is influenced by the adding token 'emotion', which brings a new initialization position closer to the emotional surface"
  - [section IV.E] "the accuracy and median value of the current task could be improved, and its variance is decreased"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations supporting this specific mechanism

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt-based fine-tuning vs traditional fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental difference between these approaches is crucial for grasping why MTPrompt works
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how traditional fine-tuning and prompt-based fine-tuning position the input representation in the model's semantic space?

- Concept: Semantic representation in transformer models
  - Why needed here: MTPrompt relies on the idea that inputs have positions in a semantic space that can be influenced by added tokens
  - Quick check question: How do transformer models represent the meaning of sentences in their internal representations?

- Concept: Multi-task learning and knowledge transfer
  - Why needed here: MTPrompt leverages the idea that pre-trained models contain knowledge for multiple tasks that can be activated through appropriate prompts
  - Quick check question: Why might a model pre-trained on general text contain knowledge relevant to specific downstream tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MTPrompt generator -> Template selector -> Label mapper -> PLM adapter

- Critical path:
  1. Generate task descriptions from metadata
  2. Combine with input to form prompt
  3. Select template if using multiple candidates
  4. Feed to PLM and get output
  5. Map output to final prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. effectiveness: Longer prompts may provide more context but risk diluting the original input
  - Template complexity vs. search space: More complex templates may be more effective but harder to find
  - Metadata richness vs. noise: More detailed descriptions may help or hurt depending on relevance

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drops significantly with certain templates
  - Results become unstable across different random seeds
  - Improvement is minimal compared to simpler prompt methods

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic version with just object descriptions and test on SST-2
  2. Add summary descriptions and compare performance
  3. Implement the full MTPrompt with all three description types and test on multiple datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of MTPrompt vary across different types of language models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3, RoBERTa) when using the same task descriptions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates MTPrompt's effectiveness using RoBERTa-large, but does not compare its performance across different pre-trained language models with the same task descriptions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide comparative results for different language models using MTPrompt, leaving the question of whether MTPrompt's effectiveness is model-dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with MTPrompt across various language models (BERT, GPT-3, RoBERTa) on the same tasks and comparing the results would provide insights into its model dependency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the length and complexity of task descriptions (OD, SD, TD) on the performance of MTPrompt, and is there an optimal length?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that using more types of descriptions can improve accuracy but also notes that combining all three descriptions might bring interference. However, it does not explore the optimal length or complexity of these descriptions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the relationship between the length/complexity of task descriptions and the performance of MTPrompt, leaving the question of an optimal description length unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying lengths and complexities of task descriptions while measuring MTPrompt's performance would help identify the optimal description length.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MTPrompt perform on tasks outside of the text classification domain, such as named entity recognition or machine translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates MTPrompt on sentiment classification, question classification, and natural language inference tasks, which are all text classification tasks. It does not explore MTPrompt's performance on other NLP tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on text classification tasks, leaving the question of MTPrompt's generalizability to other NLP tasks unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying MTPrompt to other NLP tasks like named entity recognition or machine translation and comparing its performance to existing methods would demonstrate its generalizability.

## Limitations

- The exact prompt templates and label mappings for each dataset are only partially specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The method's performance across different domains and task types beyond the five tested datasets remains unknown
- The computational cost of generating and searching through multiple prompt templates may be prohibitive for some applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core claim that MTPrompt improves few-shot learning performance compared to baselines like LMBFF is well-supported by experimental results across five different datasets, with consistent accuracy improvements of 1-5%. The ablation study showing that each description type contributes to performance is also well-supported.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that task-related tokens shift the model's representation space toward task-relevant regions is theoretically plausible but lacks direct empirical evidence. The assumption that pre-trained models contain task-relevant knowledge that can be activated through appropriate prompts is reasonable but not conclusively proven in this work.

**Low confidence**: The specific mechanisms by which multi-dimensional task descriptions disambiguate task requirements and reduce the effective distance to decision boundaries are largely speculative and not directly tested or measured in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce the exact template performance**: Implement the full MTPrompt method using the specified datasets (SST-2, SST-5, TREC-6, SNLI, QNLI) with K=16 examples per class and RoBERTa-large, ensuring the exact prompt templates and label mappings match those in the paper. Compare results with the published numbers to verify the claimed 1-5% accuracy improvements.

2. **Test prompt length sensitivity**: Systematically vary the number of task description tokens (using only object description, then adding summary, then adding task description) while keeping all other factors constant. Measure how performance changes with prompt length to determine if there's an optimal balance and to identify potential diminishing returns or interference effects.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Take the optimal prompt templates learned from one dataset (e.g., SST-2) and apply them directly to a different but related dataset (e.g., IMDB sentiment) without any additional fine-tuning. Measure whether the learned prompt constructions transfer effectively to new data, which would provide evidence for the generalizability of the MTPrompt approach.
