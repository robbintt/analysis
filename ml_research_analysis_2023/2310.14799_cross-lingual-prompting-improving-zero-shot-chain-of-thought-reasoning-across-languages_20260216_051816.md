# Cross-lingual Prompting: Improving Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning across Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14799
- Reference count: 19
- Over 1.8% improvement in average accuracy across benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Cross-lingual Prompting (CLP), a method to improve zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning across languages. CLP consists of two components: cross-lingual alignment prompting and task-specific solver prompting. The approach first aligns representations between different languages, then generates reasoning paths and results for the reasoning task. Additionally, cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) is introduced to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages. Experiments on several benchmarks show that CLP and CLSP significantly outperform existing prompting methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 1.8% improvement in average accuracy.

## Method Summary
Cross-lingual Prompting (CLP) is a two-stage framework designed to improve zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning across multiple languages. The first stage, cross-lingual alignment prompting, aligns source language representations with English by prompting the model to understand the task in English step-by-step. The second stage, task-specific solver prompting, generates step-by-step reasoning in the target language based on the established alignment. Additionally, cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) is introduced to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages through a voting mechanism, improving overall performance and robustness.

## Key Results
- CLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual reasoning benchmarks
- Over 1.8% improvement in average accuracy compared to existing prompting methods
- CLSP further improves performance by integrating diverse reasoning paths across languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-lingual alignment prompting enables the model to explicitly align source language representations with English before attempting reasoning
- Mechanism: By prompting the model to understand the task in English step-by-step, it first establishes semantic alignment between the source language and English, ensuring the model correctly interprets the problem before reasoning
- Core assumption: The model's multilingual understanding capability can be triggered through explicit alignment prompts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The cross-lingual alignment prompting is responsible for aligning representations across different languages"
  - [section] "Instead of the traditional 'Let's think step by step', we use 'Let's understand the task in English step-by-step'"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average FMR=0.412, suggesting active research community but limited direct citation evidence
- Break condition: If the model cannot perform accurate semantic alignment between languages, the reasoning will fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task-specific solver prompting generates more accurate reasoning paths by building on established cross-lingual alignment
- Mechanism: After alignment, the model is prompted to resolve the task in English, leveraging the established semantic connections to generate step-by-step reasoning in the target language
- Core assumption: The model's reasoning capability is enhanced when the task is properly understood in the target language first
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "task-specific solver prompting is used to generate the final chain of thoughts and results for the reasoning task"
  - [section] "After aligning the representations between different languages, we further utilize a task-specific solve prompting to complete the final task"
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence in corpus for this specific two-stage approach
- Break condition: If the alignment stage fails, the solver stage will operate on misunderstood input

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual self-consistent prompting improves performance by integrating diverse reasoning paths across languages
- Mechanism: By generating reasoning paths in multiple target languages and using voting to select consistent answers, the model leverages cross-lingual knowledge diversity
- Core assumption: Different languages provide complementary reasoning perspectives that can be integrated through consistency checking
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages"
  - [section] "we propose cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) to integrate reasoning knowledge across different languages"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work but limited specific validation
- Break condition: If language-specific reasoning patterns are too divergent, voting may not produce consistent results

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding CoT is essential as CLP builds upon this foundation by extending it across languages
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of appending "Let's think step by step!" in traditional CoT?

- Concept: Cross-lingual representation alignment
  - Why needed here: Core to CLP's first stage - the model must map meaning between languages before reasoning
  - Quick check question: How does the model establish semantic connections between source and target languages?

- Concept: Self-consistency in reasoning
  - Why needed here: CLSP uses this principle across languages rather than within a single language
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of ensembling multiple reasoning paths through voting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Cross-lingual alignment prompting -> Task-specific solver prompting -> (Optional) Cross-lingual self-consistent prompting
- Critical path: Alignment → Understanding → Reasoning → Answer extraction
- Design tradeoffs: Two-stage approach adds latency but improves accuracy; CLSP adds complexity but improves robustness
- Failure signatures: Misalignment leading to incorrect reasoning; inconsistent paths across languages; performance degradation with too many low-resource languages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline CoT vs. CLP on a single language pair to measure alignment impact
  2. Vary the number of target languages in CLSP to find optimal balance
  3. Compare different alignment prompt formulations to find most robust version

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Cross-lingual Prompting (CLP) compare to other cross-lingual transfer methods beyond the scope of this paper, such as multilingual pre-training or translation-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that CLP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing prompting methods, but does not directly compare it to other cross-lingual transfer methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating CLP against other prompting methods, leaving a gap in understanding its relative effectiveness compared to broader cross-lingual transfer techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating CLP against multilingual pre-training, translation-based approaches, and other cross-lingual transfer methods on the same benchmarks would provide insights into its relative performance and advantages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific factors that contribute to the varying performance of CLP across different languages, particularly for low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CLP's performance can be affected by the amount of pretraining data available for each language, with high-resource languages showing better performance. However, the specific factors influencing performance across different languages are not explicitly discussed.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides some insights into the role of pretraining data, but does not delve into the specific linguistic or cultural factors that may impact CLP's effectiveness across different languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis investigating the relationship between language characteristics (e.g., linguistic distance, cultural context) and CLP performance, along with experiments exploring the impact of different pre-training data distributions, would help identify the key factors influencing performance across languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of target language in Cross-lingual Self-consistent Prompting (CLSP) affect the overall performance and the diversity of reasoning paths?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CLSP integrates reasoning knowledge across different languages, but does not explicitly discuss the impact of target language selection on performance and reasoning path diversity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how the choice of target language influences the effectiveness of CLSP and the variety of reasoning paths generated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying the target language in CLSP and analyzing the resulting performance and reasoning path diversity would reveal the impact of target language selection on the effectiveness of the approach.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of CLP heavily depends on the specific phrasing of alignment prompts, which is not fully specified in the paper.
- The experiments focus on mathematical reasoning and commonsense reasoning tasks, but the method's generalizability to other reasoning domains remains untested.
- The computational overhead introduced by the two-stage pipeline and cross-lingual self-consistency mechanism is not quantified.

## Confidence

- Cross-lingual alignment effectiveness: Medium
- CLSP improvement: Low-Medium
- 1.8% average accuracy improvement: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying the exact phrasing of alignment prompts across multiple languages to determine which formulations are critical versus interchangeable.
2. Evaluate CLP performance on truly low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili, Welsh, Basque) that were unlikely to be well-represented in the base model's training data, measuring degradation patterns to understand the method's practical limits.
3. Measure and compare inference time and token usage between standard CoT, Translate-En, and CLP approaches across different batch sizes and language combinations to quantify the practical trade-offs between accuracy gains and computational overhead.
