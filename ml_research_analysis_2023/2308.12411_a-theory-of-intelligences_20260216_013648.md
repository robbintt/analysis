# A Theory of Intelligences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.12411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12411
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This paper develops a first-principles Theory of Intelligences (TIS) that unifies intelligence across physical, biological, and artificial systems by partitioning intelligence into two fundamental processes: reducing information uncertainty ("solving") and attaining goal accuracy ("understanding").

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel first-principles Theory of Intelligences (TIS) that provides a unified framework for understanding intelligence across diverse systems. The theory partitions intelligence into two fundamental processes: reducing information uncertainty through path optimization ("solving") and attaining goal accuracy through understanding ("understanding"). By developing compact mathematical expressions for intelligence and its components, the theory introduces an evolutionary intelligence index that quantifies selection potential for intelligence traits, demonstrating how intelligence drives both efficiency gains and exploration of new goal spaces.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a theoretical framework for intelligence by partitioning it into two fundamental processes: reducing information uncertainty and attaining goal accuracy. The authors propose mathematical expressions for intelligence and its components, including a novel formulation of goal difficulty that integrates complexity, environment, and agent ability. The framework is applied across physical, biological, and artificial systems, with examples ranging from crystal formation to human endeavors.

## Key Results
- Introduces a dual-process partition of intelligence into uncertainty reduction ("solving") and goal accuracy ("understanding")
- Develops an evolutionary intelligence index that quantifies selection potential for intelligence traits
- Demonstrates how intelligence drives both efficiency gains and exploration of new goal spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intelligence is fundamentally partitioned into two processes—uncertainty reduction ("solving") and goal accuracy ("understanding").
- Mechanism: The theory proposes that intelligence operates by first reducing information uncertainty through path optimization, then ensuring that the reduced uncertainty leads to accurate goal resolution. This dual-process model unifies how intelligence manifests across physical, biological, and artificial systems.
- Core assumption: Path efficiency (minimizing time and energy) correlates with uncertainty reduction, and accurate goal resolution requires understanding the causal link between solving and the goal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core idea is to partition intelligence into two fundamental processes: reducing information uncertainty ('solving') and attaining goal accuracy ('understanding')."
  - [section] "Intelligence integrates two fundamental processes: reducing information uncertainty (identifying and solving) and attaining goal accuracy (understanding)."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus papers focus on AI, education, and psychometric evaluations but do not directly address the dual-process partition of intelligence.
- Break condition: If path efficiency does not correlate with uncertainty reduction, or if accurate goal resolution can occur without understanding, the model fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intelligence can be quantified using an evolutionary index that captures selection potential for intelligence traits.
- Mechanism: The evolutionary index combines the efficiency of uncertainty reduction and the accuracy of goal resolution, normalized by a reference or benchmark. This index predicts that traits underlying high intelligence are positively selected when both solving and understanding are optimized.
- Core assumption: Intelligence traits are heritable and subject to evolutionary selection, and the index accurately reflects the fitness contribution of these traits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A key outcome is the introduction of an evolutionary intelligence index that quantifies selection potential for intelligence traits..."
  - [section] "We can partition the universe into approximate domains, whereby low U, low A corresponds to a random guess... and finally high U, high A being the direction of intelligence."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus papers do not discuss evolutionary selection of intelligence traits or provide quantitative models of intelligence as an evolutionary index.
- Break condition: If intelligence traits are not heritable or not under selection, or if the index does not correlate with fitness, the model fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intelligence drives both efficiency gains and exploration of new goal spaces through cumulative learning and environmental interaction.
- Mechanism: Intelligence systems accumulate knowledge and skills over time, enabling more efficient problem-solving and the ability to tackle increasingly complex goals. Proxies such as social interactions and technology extend individual capabilities, fostering collective intelligence and innovation.
- Core assumption: Cumulative learning leads to both efficiency gains and the capacity to explore novel goals, and proxies meaningfully extend individual intelligence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...demonstrating how intelligence drives both efficiency gains and exploration of new goal spaces."
  - [section] "Intelligence progressively builds on existing information and novel substrates... Greater capacity permits successful encounters with new, more complex goals..."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus papers focus on AI and education but do not provide direct evidence for cumulative learning driving exploration of new goal spaces.
- Break condition: If cumulative learning does not lead to efficiency gains or exploration, or if proxies do not meaningfully extend individual intelligence, the model fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partitioning of intelligence into solving and understanding
  - Why needed here: This is the core theoretical contribution and underpins all subsequent analysis and quantification.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between reducing uncertainty and attaining goal accuracy in the context of intelligence?

- Concept: Evolutionary intelligence index
  - Why needed here: This provides a quantitative framework for evaluating and comparing intelligence across systems and contexts.
  - Quick check question: How does the evolutionary index combine solving efficiency and understanding accuracy to predict selection potential?

- Concept: Role of proxies (social interactions, technology) in extending intelligence
  - Why needed here: Understanding how collective and technological systems contribute to intelligence is crucial for applying the theory to human and artificial systems.
  - Quick check question: In what ways do proxies like social interactions and technology extend individual intelligence, and how does this affect the evolutionary index?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Core system: The individual or entity solving the problem (controller, processor, memory)
  - Proxies: Social interactions, technology, culture, institutions
  - Environment: Contexts, settings, structures, and conditions interacting with the system
  - Goals: Objectives to be achieved, with associated difficulty and surprisal

- Critical path:
  1. Identify the goal and its complexity
  2. Assess the system's ability and available proxies
  3. Reduce information uncertainty through path optimization
  4. Ensure goal accuracy through understanding
  5. Evaluate intelligence using the evolutionary index

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Specialization vs. generality: Narrow intelligence excels in specific domains but lacks flexibility; general intelligence is flexible but may be less efficient in specialized tasks.
  - Efficiency vs. exploration: Efficient problem-solving may limit exploration of novel goals; exploration requires tolerance for uncertainty and inefficiency.
  - Individual vs. collective intelligence: Individual intelligence is limited by personal capacity; collective intelligence leverages proxies but introduces coordination challenges.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low uncertainty reduction with high goal accuracy: Indicates reliance on understanding without efficient problem-solving (e.g., educated guessing).
  - High uncertainty reduction with low goal accuracy: Indicates efficient problem-solving but lack of understanding (e.g., process errors or random guessing).
  - Both low uncertainty reduction and low goal accuracy: Indicates random or ineffective problem-solving.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the evolutionary index for systems with varying levels of solving efficiency and understanding accuracy to test its predictive power for selection.
  2. Evaluate the role of proxies in extending individual intelligence by comparing problem-solving performance with and without access to social or technological resources.
  3. Test the tradeoff between efficiency and exploration by measuring performance on novel vs. familiar goals across systems with different intelligence profiles.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do microscopic processes necessary to understand macroscopic patterns in intelligences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author explicitly states "TIS is a macroscopic framework that omits explicit consideration of uncertainty and information entropy dynamics as well as the dynamics of system components, controller strategies and interactions with proxies and the environment" and asks "To what extent are microscopic processes necessary to understand macroscopic patterns in intelligences?"
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that while TIS provides a macroscopic framework, it does not explicitly integrate the causal roles of more microscopic levels. The author suggests that incorporating these features is a daunting challenge and it is not clear how they will significantly change our understanding of intelligence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies that demonstrate the necessity or lack thereof of microscopic processes in understanding macroscopic patterns of intelligence, possibly through computational models or experimental data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can we identify a core set of phenotypic traits explaining the main effects and variances in intelligences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author poses the question "Can we identify a core set of phenotypic traits explaining the main effects and variances in intelligences?"
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the partitioning of intelligence into solving and understanding, but does not delve into the specific phenotypic traits that underlie these processes. The complexity and multi-dimensional nature of intelligence make it challenging to identify a core set of traits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Genetic studies or phenotypic analyses that identify specific traits associated with intelligence, potentially through twin studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or comprehensive phenotypic assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are minimally intelligent life systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author asks "What are minimally intelligent life systems?"
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses intelligence in various contexts, from physical systems to biological and artificial systems, but does not define a clear threshold for what constitutes a minimally intelligent life system. This question touches on the fundamental nature of intelligence and its emergence in life forms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies that identify and characterize life systems with minimal intelligence, possibly through comparative analyses of different organisms or artificial life simulations.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework is presented at a high level without detailed mathematical derivations or empirical validation protocols.
- The evolutionary intelligence index, while conceptually appealing, lacks concrete implementation details and validation across diverse systems.
- The paper assumes that intelligence traits are heritable and subject to selection, which may not hold for all forms of intelligence (e.g., artificial or collective intelligence).

## Confidence
- High confidence: The dual-process partition of intelligence into uncertainty reduction and goal accuracy is conceptually sound and aligns with established theories in information theory and cognitive science.
- Medium confidence: The evolutionary intelligence index as a quantitative measure of selection potential is promising but requires empirical validation and refinement.
- Low confidence: The application of the framework to explain phenomena ranging from crystal formation to human intelligence is speculative and needs rigorous testing.

## Next Checks
1. Develop operational definitions and measurable proxies for the "solving" and "understanding" processes, and test their predictive power for intelligence across different systems (physical, biological, artificial).
2. Design and conduct experiments to validate the evolutionary intelligence index by comparing its predictions with observed selection patterns in systems with varying levels of uncertainty reduction and goal accuracy.
3. Apply the framework to a specific case study (e.g., crystal formation or human problem-solving) and test its explanatory power by comparing predicted outcomes with empirical observations.
