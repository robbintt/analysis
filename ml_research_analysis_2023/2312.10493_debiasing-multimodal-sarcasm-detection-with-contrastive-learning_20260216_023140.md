# Debiasing Multimodal Sarcasm Detection with Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10493
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10493
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Proposed framework outperforms baselines on both IID and OOD testing sets for multimodal sarcasm detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal sarcasm detection by proposing a debiasing framework that mitigates spurious correlations between textual words and labels. The authors introduce a novel approach combining counterfactual data augmentation with adapted debiasing contrastive learning. Their framework constructs positive and negative sample pairs based on word bias similarity, then learns robust task-relevant features through a weighted contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets.

## Method Summary
The framework generates counterfactual samples using ChatGPT for emotion-aware and entity-driven rewriting, creating pairs with same labels but different word biases (positive pairs) and pairs with opposite labels but similar word biases (negative pairs). A multimodal model with RoBERTa text encoder, ViT image encoder, and cross-attention fusion processes these samples. The contrastive loss is adapted with sample weights based on word bias similarity, encouraging the model to learn representations that are robust to textual bias while leveraging multimodal incongruity cues.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing baselines on both IID and OOD testing sets
- Achieves higher accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall than comparison methods
- Case study demonstrates effectiveness in debiasing multimodal sarcasm detection
- Shows improved generalization capability compared to non-debiased approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Counterfactual data augmentation reduces reliance on biased textual words by exposing the model to rewritten samples that flip sentiment polarity or inject sarcasm while preserving visual context. This forces the model to learn alternative paths to sarcasm detection beyond specific word choices.

### Mechanism 2
Adapted debiasing contrastive learning improves generalization by weighting contrastive samples based on word bias similarity. The contrastive loss is modified to emphasize distinguishing samples with similar biased words but opposite labels, and encouraging similarity for samples with dissimilar biased words but same labels.

### Mechanism 3
Multimodal encoders with cross-attention fusion capture inter-modal incongruity cues that are less susceptible to textual bias. The model uses visual features as queries and textual features as keys/values to focus on text-image mismatches indicative of sarcasm, which can be detected even when textual words are misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- **Spurious correlations**: Why needed - identifies that textual words can correlate with sarcasm labels without being causally related, misleading models. Quick check - What is the difference between a spurious correlation and a genuine causal relationship in the context of sarcasm detection?

- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed - the framework relies on contrasting positive and negative sample pairs to learn representations robust to biased features. Quick check - How does contrastive learning differ from standard supervised classification in terms of the learning objective?

- **Counterfactual reasoning**: Why needed - generating counterfactual samples (e.g., same visual but opposite label) is central to exposing and mitigating textual bias. Quick check - What distinguishes a counterfactual sample from a simple data augmentation like synonym replacement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → RoBERTa (text) + ViT (image) → Cross-Attention fusion → MLP projection head → Classification + Contrastive loss
- **Critical path**: Text/image encoding → cross-attention fusion → contrastive loss computation → classification loss → backpropagation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using ChatGPT for counterfactuals provides high-quality rewrites but introduces dependency on external API; simpler EDA might be faster but less effective at preserving semantics
- **Failure signatures**: High accuracy on IID but poor on OOD indicates bias overfitting; low contrastive loss improvement suggests weighting scheme not effective
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train baseline without counterfactuals or contrastive loss to establish performance ceiling; 2) Add counterfactual data augmentation but keep standard contrastive loss to measure impact of sample construction alone; 3) Add adapted debiasing weighting to the contrastive loss to evaluate the importance of sample prioritization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How effective is the proposed framework in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios with different degrees of word-label distribution shifts? The paper constructs a specific OOD testing set but does not explore the framework's performance across varying degrees of distribution shifts or different types of distribution changes.

2. How does the performance of the proposed framework compare to other debiasing techniques in multimodal sarcasm detection? The paper proposes a debiasing framework but does not directly compare it to other debiasing techniques like adversarial debiasing or reweighting methods.

3. How does the proposed framework handle multimodal sarcasm detection in languages other than English? The paper uses an English multimodal sarcasm detection dataset and does not explore the framework's performance on other languages.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and consistency of counterfactual samples generated by ChatGPT, with exact prompt templates not provided
- The adapted debiasing contrastive learning mechanism's sample weighting scheme lacks detailed analysis of its interaction with the contrastive loss
- The assumption that multimodal incongruity is a reliable indicator of sarcasm is not thoroughly validated across all sarcasm expressions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness on both IID and OOD testing sets, outperforming existing baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Counterfactual data augmentation and adapted debiasing contrastive learning are supported by experimental results, but lack detailed reproducibility information
- **Low Confidence**: Assumptions about multimodal incongruity as sarcasm indicator and cross-attention fusion effectiveness are not thoroughly validated

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce counterfactual sample generation using provided techniques (emotion-aware and entity-driven rewriting) and evaluate quality and consistency of generated samples

2. Conduct ablation study to understand impact of adapted debiasing sample weighting scheme on contrastive loss and overall performance by varying weighting parameters

3. Evaluate effectiveness of cross-attention fusion in capturing inter-modal incongruity cues by analyzing model performance on sarcasm expressions that rely heavily on incongruity versus those that do not
