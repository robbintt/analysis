# Using Property Elicitation to Understand the Impacts of Fairness Regularizers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.11343
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11343
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Key outcome:** Property elicitation theory reveals that fairness regularizers fundamentally change the optimal decision-making property in machine learning, with only specific regularizers (calibration and bounded group loss) preserving the original property while promoting fairness.

## Executive Summary
This paper applies property elicitation theory to analyze how fairness regularizers affect optimal decision-making in machine learning. The authors establish that a regularizer preserves the original property if and only if it elicits the same property as the base loss function. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, they demonstrate that common fairness regularizers (demographic parity, equalized false positive rates, and expected equality of opportunity) fundamentally change the optimal decision-making property by comparing outcomes across groups rather than evaluating individual predictions. The paper identifies calibration and bounded group loss as equivalent regularizers that maintain the original property while still promoting fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate these theoretical findings.

## Method Summary
The paper combines theoretical analysis using property elicitation theory with empirical validation. The theoretical framework establishes conditions for property equivalence under regularization (Theorem 1), which is then applied to analyze common fairness regularizers. Experiments use linear classifiers trained via SGD on synthetic datasets with varying group probabilities and two real-world datasets (German lending with age as sensitive attribute, and heart disease risk with sex as sensitive attribute). The study compares unregularized versus regularized models across different regularization weights to measure changes in fairness violations and decision-making properties.

## Key Results
- Fairness regularizers like demographic parity and equalized false positive rates change the optimal decision-making property compared to standard classification losses
- This occurs because these regularizers compare outcomes across groups rather than evaluating individual predictions
- Calibration and bounded group loss regularizers maintain the original property while promoting fairness
- The weight of regularization (λ) and data distribution significantly affect decision-making changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A regularizer preserves the original property if and only if it elicits the same property as the base loss function.
- **Mechanism:** The regularized loss combines the original loss and the regularizer with weight λ. The optimal treatment is determined by minimizing this combined objective. If the regularizer elicits the same property as the base loss, both terms optimize for the same underlying property, leaving the optimal treatment unchanged.
- **Core assumption:** The regularizer is additive in the loss function and the property elicitation framework applies to the combined objective.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The key insight is that a regularizer preserves the original property if and only if it elicits the same property as the base loss function."
  - [section] "Theorem 1 says that the property elicited by a regularized loss function is the same as the unregularized loss if and only if the regularizer elicits the same property as the loss itself."
- **Break condition:** If the regularizer is not additive in the loss function, or if the property elicitation framework does not apply to the combined objective.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Common fairness regularizers change the optimal decision-making property compared to standard classification losses.
- **Mechanism:** These regularizers compare outcomes across different groups rather than evaluating individual predictions. This changes the underlying property being optimized, leading to different optimal treatments.
- **Core assumption:** The fairness regularizers are not equivalent to the properties elicited by standard classification losses.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "They show this occurs because these regularizers compare outcomes across different groups rather than evaluating individual predictions."
  - [section] "We apply Theorem 1 to a handful of popular fairness regularizers... and demonstrate they are not equivalent to cost-sensitive classifications."
- **Break condition:** If the fairness regularizers are reformulated to elicit the same property as the base loss, or if the base loss is changed to match the property elicited by the regularizer.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Equivalent regularizers maintain the original property while still promoting fairness.
- **Mechanism:** These regularizers elicit the same property as the base loss (the mode in binary classification), but still promote fairness by ensuring accurate predictions within groups or bounding group-level loss.
- **Core assumption:** Calibration and bounded group loss regularizers elicit the mode property.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "They show this occurs because these regularizers compare outcomes across different groups rather than evaluating individual predictions. The paper also identifies equivalent regularizers (calibration and bounded group loss) that maintain the original property while still promoting fairness."
  - [section] "Calibration constraints ensure that the predicted value t(i) most closely lines up with the true probability p(i)... The absolute difference elicits the 1/2-quantile, which is also the mode on Y = {0,1}, so the regularizer R(t; s; p) = P_g 1/n_g P_i:s(i)=g |t(i) - p(i)| elicits the mode in binary classification problems."
- **Break condition:** If the hypothesis class is not sufficiently expressive to achieve perfect calibration, or if the bounded group loss constraint is too restrictive.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Property elicitation
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses property elicitation theory to analyze how fairness regularizers change the optimal decision-making property in machine learning. Understanding property elicitation is crucial for grasping the theoretical framework and results.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the relationship between a loss function and the property it elicits?

- **Concept:** Regularization in machine learning
  - **Why needed here:** The paper studies how adding regularization functions to the optimization problem changes the property of the data distribution learned. Understanding regularization is essential for understanding the problem setting and the impact of fairness constraints.
  - **Quick check question:** How does adding a regularization term to the loss function affect the optimization problem and the resulting model?

- **Concept:** Fairness in machine learning
  - **Why needed here:** The paper focuses on fairness regularizers, which are used to impose penalties for violating certain desiderata about community-level outcomes. Understanding fairness concepts and metrics is crucial for understanding the motivation and implications of the work.
  - **Quick check question:** What are some common fairness metrics used in machine learning, and how do they differ from each other?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Property elicitation framework -> Regularization functions -> Fairness metrics -> Optimization algorithms -> Datasets and experiments

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define the property elicitation framework and the concept of regularized property elicitation
  2. Derive the necessary and sufficient condition for property equivalence under regularization (Theorem 1)
  3. Apply Theorem 1 to common fairness regularizers and show their nonequivalence to standard classification losses
  4. Identify equivalent regularizers (calibration and bounded group loss) that maintain the original property while promoting fairness
  5. Validate the theoretical findings through experiments on synthetic and real datasets

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - The choice of regularizer affects the optimal decision-making property, with some regularizers preserving the original property and others changing it
  - The weight of the regularizer (λ) determines the balance between the original loss and the fairness constraint
  - The expressiveness of the hypothesis class affects the ability to achieve the desired property under regularization

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If the regularizer is not carefully chosen, it may change the optimal decision-making property in unintended ways
  - If the regularizer weight is too high, the model may prioritize fairness over accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance
  - If the hypothesis class is not sufficiently expressive, the model may not be able to achieve the desired property even with regularization

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the property elicitation framework and derive the necessary and sufficient condition for property equivalence under regularization (Theorem 1)
  2. Apply Theorem 1 to a simple fairness regularizer (e.g., demographic parity) and verify its nonequivalence to a standard classification loss on a synthetic dataset
  3. Implement an equivalent regularizer (e.g., calibration) and show that it maintains the original property while promoting fairness on a real dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do regularization functions affect property elicitation in more general prediction tasks beyond binary classification?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper focuses on binary classification but states "Our framework is general enough to handle a variety of prediction tasks and regularizers beyond the fair machine learning literature"
- **Why unresolved:** The authors only examine specific fairness regularizers in binary classification settings and note this as an open direction
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical and theoretical analysis of property elicitation changes under regularization for multi-class classification, regression, and ranking tasks

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the relationship between model complexity and the impact of fairness regularizers on elicited properties?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors mention "limited expressivity of the model" as a practical consideration and note this as future work
- **Why unresolved:** The paper primarily assumes sufficiently expressive hypothesis classes but acknowledges this may not hold in practice
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments varying model complexity (e.g., linear vs deep models) while measuring changes in optimal decisions under regularization

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can pre-processing or post-processing of data change the elicited property of a regularized loss function?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "Additional pre- or post-processing of the data may change the elicited property, though we leave this to future work"
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on algorithmic regularization but explicitly acknowledges data processing as an open area
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of property elicitation under different data preprocessing techniques (reweighting, resampling, feature transformation) with the same regularized objective function

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework assumes sufficiently expressive hypothesis classes, which may not hold in practice
- Experimental validation is limited to binary sensitive attributes and two specific real-world datasets
- The paper focuses on algorithmic regularization without exploring how data preprocessing might affect elicited properties

## Confidence
- **Confidence: Medium** in the theoretical claims regarding property elicitation equivalence. While the paper provides rigorous mathematical proofs for Theorem 1, the practical implications depend heavily on specific implementation details of regularizers and optimization procedures that are not fully specified in the paper.
- **Confidence: Low** regarding the generalizability of experimental results. The paper uses only two real-world datasets (German lending and heart disease risk) with binary sensitive attributes (age and sex respectively).
- **Confidence: Medium** in the identification of equivalent regularizers (calibration and bounded group loss). While the theoretical framework provides conditions for equivalence, the practical implementation of these regularizers and their effectiveness in promoting fairness while maintaining the original property requires further validation across diverse datasets and problem domains.

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation verification:** Reproduce the synthetic experiments with exact parameter settings (p_a=0.3, p_b ranging from 0.05 to 0.95, k=3 random features) to verify that fairness regularizers produce the claimed changes in optimal decision-making properties across different (p_a, p_b) regions.

2. **Cross-dataset validation:** Test the theoretical findings on additional real-world datasets with different characteristics (e.g., multi-class sensitive attributes, regression tasks, multi-class classification) to assess generalizability beyond the two binary datasets used in the paper.

3. **Regularizer implementation audit:** Carefully implement and compare multiple formulations of the fairness regularizers (demographic parity, FPR/FNR differences, equality of opportunity) to ensure that differences in optimal properties are not artifacts of implementation choices in how group membership or fairness violations are computed.
