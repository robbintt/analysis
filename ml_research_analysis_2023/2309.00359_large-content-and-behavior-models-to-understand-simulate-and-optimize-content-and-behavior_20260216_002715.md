# Large Content And Behavior Models To Understand, Simulate, And Optimize Content And Behavior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.00359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00359
- Reference count: 10
- Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) improve behavior-related task performance compared to similar-sized LLMs by integrating behavior tokens into training.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) that integrate receiver behavior tokens (likes, shares, clicks, etc.) into Large Language Model (LLM) training corpora to better model and predict human behavior in communication contexts. By performing behavior instruction tuning on content-behavior pairs, LCBMs achieve improved performance on behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and content understanding tasks compared to baseline models like Vicuna. The approach demonstrates both strong performance on behavior-related tasks and promising generalization capabilities across different behavior domains.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting content-behavior pairs from sources like YouTube videos and marketing emails, converting non-text content to language tokens using visual encoders and Q-Former, and verbalizing behavior metrics to align with text format. LCBMs are created by instruction-tuning base LLMs (e.g., Vicuna) on this combined content-behavior data using behavior instruction tuning, where the model learns to predict behavior given content and vice versa. The approach leverages existing LLM capabilities while adapting them to the behavior domain without requiring full retraining.

## Key Results
- LCBMs outperform Vicuna on behavior simulation tasks with better RMSE and accuracy scores
- Models show improved performance on content understanding tasks while maintaining general language capabilities
- LCBMs demonstrate domain adaptation capabilities, generalizing behavior understanding across different behavior types
- The approach achieves strong results on both behavior prediction and content generation tasks using the Content Behavior Corpus

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Including behavior tokens in LLM training corpora enables the model to learn joint representations of content and receiver behavior, improving performance on behavior-related tasks.
- Mechanism: Behavior tokens provide direct supervision signals about content effectiveness, allowing the model to learn causal links between communication and receiver response.
- Core assumption: Receiver behavior is a meaningful and measurable consequence of content that can be modeled as a token sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce the receivers' 'behavior tokens,' such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, retweets, etc. in the LLM's training corpora to optimize content for the receivers and predict their behaviors."
  - [section 2.4] "We treat the content tokens (XC) as input and behavior tokens (XB) as output of the language model."
- Break condition: If behavior tokens are too sparse, noisy, or not causally related to content, the model will fail to learn meaningful behavior-content mappings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction tuning on behavior prediction tasks transfers knowledge from pre-trained LLMs to the behavior domain without requiring full retraining.
- Mechanism: Behavior instruction tuning uses the pre-trained LLM's language understanding capabilities to predict behavior given content and vice versa, adapting the model to the new modality while preserving general language capabilities.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM has sufficient world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to understand behavior patterns when given appropriate instructions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, our trained models show generalization capabilities on the behavior dimension for behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation."
  - [section 2.4] "We then perform instruction-tuning of the LLM on the prediction tokens, using its original auto-regressive training objective."
- Break condition: If the instruction format is not well-aligned with the LLM's understanding or if the behavior patterns are too complex, instruction tuning will fail to transfer effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint modeling of content and behavior enables zero-shot and few-shot behavior understanding and domain adaptation capabilities.
- Mechanism: By training on diverse content-behavior pairs, the model learns general principles about human behavior that transfer across domains, allowing reasoning about new types of behavior with minimal additional training.
- Core assumption: Human behavior patterns have underlying commonalities that can be generalized across different communication contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LCBMs show promise in enabling the LLMs to not only reason about content but also reason about and predict human behavior over that content. Further, LCBMs also show potential of behavior domain adaptation where models trained on one type of behavior can generalize on another behavior type."
  - [section 2.3] "We test the model on a different dataset and task than what it was originally trained for."
- Break condition: If behavior patterns are highly domain-specific with little overlap, generalization will fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text-to-text framework
  - Why needed here: Allows unified modeling of both content and behavior as text sequences, leveraging LLM architecture
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how verbalizing video frames and behavior metrics enables them to be processed by an LLM?

- Concept: Multimodal alignment (vision-to-language)
  - Why needed here: Enables the LLM to understand visual content by converting it to language tokens through visual encoders and Q-Former
  - Quick check question: What components are used to convert video frames into language tokens that the LLM can process?

- Concept: Behavior instruction tuning
  - Why needed here: Adapts pre-trained LLMs to predict and understand behavior without full retraining, leveraging existing language capabilities
  - Quick check question: How does the instruction tuning objective differ from standard language model training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Visual encoder (EVA-CLIP) → GMHRA aggregator → Q-Former → LLM (Vicuna) → Behavior prediction head
  - Text components: ASR, BLIP captions, video titles/descriptions
  - Behavior components: replay values, likes/views ratios, comment sentiment
  - Communicator metadata: channel name, subscriber count

- Critical path:
  1. Input video frames → EVA-CLIP → visual tokens
  2. Visual tokens → GMHRA → aggregated visual features
  3. Aggregated features → Q-Former → language tokens
  4. Language tokens + text components → LLM
  5. LLM outputs behavior predictions or content understanding

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing visual encoder vs. fine-tuning: Freezing reduces computation but may limit adaptation
  - Behavior token granularity: More granular tokens provide better supervision but increase complexity
  - Instruction format: More explicit instructions help learning but require more data

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor behavior prediction → Check if behavior tokens are properly aligned with content
  - Visual understanding failures → Verify EVA-CLIP and Q-Former integration
  - Generalization failures → Check if training data covers sufficient behavioral diversity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify visual-to-language conversion: Input video frames, check if Q-Former produces coherent language tokens
  2. Test behavior prediction: Use a small subset of data, verify if model can predict simple behaviors like likes/views ratio
  3. Validate instruction tuning: Compare pre-trained LLM performance vs. behavior-tuned performance on behavior tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of behavior tokens in LLM training corpora affect the models' ability to understand and generate content in other modalities beyond text and video?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on integrating behavior tokens into LLMs for text and video content, but does not explore the impact on other modalities such as images or audio.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to text and video content, leaving the question of how behavior tokens affect other modalities unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with LLMs trained on behavior tokens for other modalities, such as images or audio, and comparing their performance to models trained without behavior tokens.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the size of the behavior instruction tuning dataset affect the performance of LCBMs on various tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a dataset of over 40,000 Youtube videos for behavior instruction tuning, but does not explore the impact of dataset size on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how varying the size of the behavior instruction tuning dataset affects LCBM performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with LCBMs trained on different sizes of behavior instruction tuning datasets and comparing their performance on various tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can LCBMs be effectively used for real-time behavior prediction and content optimization in dynamic communication environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates LCBMs' capabilities on static datasets, but does not explore their performance in real-time, dynamic communication environments.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are conducted on pre-collected datasets, leaving the question of LCBMs' effectiveness in real-time, dynamic environments unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing LCBMs in a real-time communication system and evaluating their performance on behavior prediction and content optimization tasks in dynamic environments.

## Limitations
- The approach assumes a relatively direct mapping between content and behavior, which may not hold for complex, multi-step decision processes
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and quantity of behavior data available, with verbalization introducing potential noise and information loss
- Results are demonstrated primarily on social media engagement metrics and marketing responses, limiting generalizability to more nuanced behavioral domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The technical implementation of combining content and behavior tokens in LLM training, and the general approach of behavior instruction tuning, is sound and well-supported by the results presented.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claims about LCBMs showing "generalization capabilities on the behavior dimension" and "behavior domain adaptation" are supported by the experiments but would benefit from testing on a wider range of behavior types and domains.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that LCBMs enable LLMs to "reason about and predict human behavior" is demonstrated for specific, measurable behaviors but may not extend to more complex behavioral reasoning tasks.

## Next Checks

1. **Behavioral Diversity Test**: Evaluate LCBMs on a dataset with substantially different behavior types (e.g., purchase decisions, health behavior changes, educational outcomes) to assess true generalization beyond social media engagement and marketing responses.

2. **Ablation Study on Verbalization**: Conduct experiments comparing performance when using raw behavior metrics versus verbalized behavior tokens to quantify the impact of the verbalization process on model effectiveness.

3. **Scaling Analysis**: Test LCBMs of varying sizes (smaller and larger than Vicuna) to determine if the behavior modeling improvements scale with model size, and whether there's a point of diminishing returns for the instruction tuning approach.
