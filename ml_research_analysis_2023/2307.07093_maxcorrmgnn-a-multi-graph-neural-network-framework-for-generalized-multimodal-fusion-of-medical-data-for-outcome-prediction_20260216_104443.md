# MaxCorrMGNN: A Multi-Graph Neural Network Framework for Generalized Multimodal Fusion of Medical Data for Outcome Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07093
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neural, graph-based, and traditional fusion techniques on tuberculosis dataset with statistically significant AU-ROC improvements across all outcome classes

## Executive Summary
MaxCorrMGNN is a novel multi-graph neural network framework for multimodal fusion of medical data that constructs patient-modality multi-layered graphs using Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation embeddings. The framework learns non-linear correlations between modalities through soft-thresholding and performs task-informed reasoning using a generalized multi-graph neural network. Evaluated on a tuberculosis dataset for multi-outcome prediction, MaxCorrMGNN consistently outperformed existing methods with statistically significant improvements in area under the receiver operating curve across all classes, while making few assumptions and maintaining interpretability through explicit reasoning at the granularity of both subjects and modalities.

## Method Summary
MaxCorrMGNN constructs patient-modality multi-layered graphs by learning non-linear correlations between modality projections using Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation embeddings with soft-thresholding. The framework then applies a generalized multi-graph neural network that performs fine-grained reasoning by preserving patient-modality semantics throughout message passing using intra-modality and inter-modality supra-adjacency matrices. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end with a coupled objective function combining the soft-HGR loss with cross-entropy loss, allowing joint optimization of graph connectivity parameters and message passing parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieved statistically significant improvements in AU-ROC across all five tuberculosis treatment outcome classes (Died, Still on treatment, Cured, Failure)
- Consistently outperformed state-of-the-art neural, graph-based, and traditional fusion techniques
- Demonstrated better interpretability through explicit reasoning at the granularity of both subjects and modalities
- Made few assumptions and can be applied to various multimodal fusion problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The MaxCorr formulation creates a task-informed multi-layered graph by learning non-linear correlations between modalities
- Mechanism: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) maximal correlation measures dependence between modality projections, creating edge weights between patient nodes across modality planes. The soft-thresholding matrix learns which edges are salient for the prediction task.
- Core assumption: Non-linear correlations between modalities contain discriminative information for the outcome prediction task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models non-linear modality correlations within and across patients through Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi maximal correlation (MaxCorr) embeddings"
  - [section] "The Hirschfield, Gebelin, Renyi (HGR) framework in statistics is known to generalize the notion of dependence to abstract and non-linear functional spaces"
  - [corpus] Weak - no directly comparable papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If the learned correlations are spurious or do not capture task-relevant dependencies, the graph structure will be uninformative for prediction

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Multi-Graph Neural Network (MGNN) performs fine-grained reasoning by preserving patient-modality semantics throughout message passing
- Mechanism: The MGNN uses two supra-adjacency matrices (intra-modality A and inter-modality C) to perform walks on the multi-graph. Message passing combines information within modality planes and across modality planes while maintaining the identity of both patients and modalities.
- Core assumption: Preserving patient and modality identities during message passing improves interpretability and prediction accuracy compared to collapsed representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "design, for the first time, a generalized multi-layered graph neural network (MGNN) for task-informed reasoning in multi-layered graphs"
  - [section] "The intra-modality adjacency matrix A ∈ RP K×P K. The second is the inter-modality connectivity matrix C ∈ RP K×P K"
  - [corpus] Weak - MAGNET paper uses multi-graph but for code clone detection, not multimodal fusion
- Break condition: If the preservation of identities creates too sparse or disconnected representations, the MGNN may fail to propagate useful information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: End-to-end optimization couples graph construction with task supervision, improving generalization
- Mechanism: The loss function combines the soft-HGR loss (LsHGR) with cross-entropy loss (LCE), allowing the graph connectivity parameters and MGNN parameters to be learned jointly. This couples the unsupervised graph construction with supervised prediction.
- Core assumption: Joint optimization of graph structure and inference parameters creates better representations than staged training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "learns the parameters defining patient-modality graph connectivity and message passing in an end-to-end fashion"
  - [section] "The parameters{{f k(·)}, S, {ϕ(d) I (·), ϕ(d) II (·), ϵ}, go(·)} of the framework are jointly learned via standard backpropagation"
  - [section] "Finally, this framework helps us evaluate the benefit of coupling the two components into a single objective"
- Break condition: If the coupling causes the graph construction to overfit to the training task, generalization to unseen patients may suffer

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) maximal correlation
  - Why needed here: Provides a principled way to measure non-linear dependence between modality projections in different subspaces
  - Quick check question: What makes HGR maximal correlation different from standard correlation measures when comparing two random variables?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and message passing
  - Why needed here: The MGNN extends GNN principles to multi-layered graphs, allowing information to flow within and across modality planes
  - Quick check question: How does a standard GNN layer aggregate information from neighbors, and how is this extended in the MGNN framework?

- Concept: Multi-layered/multi-relational graphs
  - Why needed here: The patient-modality multi-layered graph preserves the semantic structure of having different types of edges (intra-modality vs inter-modality)
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a multiplex graph and a multi-layered graph, and why does MaxCorrMGNN use the latter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MaxCorr block (sHGR projection + soft-thresholding) → Multi-Graph (supra-adjacency matrices A and C) → MGNN (message passing + readout) → Output layer
- Critical path: Input modalities → MaxCorr projections → Edge weight computation → Supra-adjacency construction → MGNN message passing → Readout → Prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Preserving patient-modality semantics increases interpretability but adds complexity compared to collapsed representations; end-to-end training improves task alignment but may reduce the unsupervised quality of the graph structure
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on classes with imbalanced data (Died, Still on treatment, Cured, Failure) suggests the graph construction is not capturing relevant patterns; high variance across runs indicates sensitivity to initialization or hyperparameter settings
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with λ=0 (no MaxCorr contribution) to verify the sHGR component is learning meaningful correlations
  2. Train with decoupled optimization (sHGR first, then MGNN) to quantify the benefit of end-to-end training
  3. Evaluate with different numbers of MGNN layers (L=1, 3, 5) to find the optimal depth for this multi-graph structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MaxCorrMGNN perform on datasets with significantly higher numbers of modalities (e.g., 10+ modalities) compared to the 5 modalities tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates MaxCorrMGNN on a Tuberculosis dataset with 5 modalities. The authors mention that the framework makes few assumptions and can be applied to various multimodal fusion problems, suggesting potential scalability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence of MaxCorrMGNN's performance on datasets with a higher number of modalities. The scalability of the framework to handle a larger number of modalities remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing MaxCorrMGNN's performance on datasets with varying numbers of modalities (e.g., 5, 10, 15) would provide evidence of its scalability and ability to handle a larger number of modalities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does MaxCorrMGNN handle modalities with significantly different data distributions or scales?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that MaxCorrMGNN uses Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation embeddings to model non-linear modality correlations. However, it does not explicitly discuss how the framework handles modalities with different data distributions or scales.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis of how MaxCorrMGNN handles modalities with different data distributions or scales. The robustness of the framework to such variations remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing MaxCorrMGNN's performance on datasets with modalities having different data distributions or scales would provide evidence of its robustness to such variations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MaxCorrMGNN compare to other multimodal fusion frameworks in terms of interpretability and explainability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that MaxCorrMGNN provides more explainable intermediate representations compared to baselines, allowing for explicit reasoning at the granularity of both subjects and modalities. However, it does not provide a detailed comparison of interpretability and explainability with other multimodal fusion frameworks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of MaxCorrMGNN's interpretability and explainability with other multimodal fusion frameworks. The relative advantages and disadvantages of MaxCorrMGNN in terms of interpretability remain unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of MaxCorrMGNN's interpretability and explainability with other multimodal fusion frameworks, including metrics such as feature importance, decision boundaries, and visualization of intermediate representations, would provide evidence of its relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of interpretability.

## Limitations
- The lack of baseline comparison papers in the corpus creates uncertainty about the novelty and relative performance claims of MaxCorrMGNN
- The coupled end-to-end training objective may create optimization challenges that are not fully explored
- Claims of "consistent outperformance" and "statistically significant improvements" across all classes cannot be fully verified without complete experimental results

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural design of using multi-layered graphs to preserve patient-modality semantics is well-specified and theoretically sound. The basic GNN message passing mechanics are established.
- **Medium confidence**: The use of HGR maximal correlation for non-linear dependence measurement is theoretically justified, but the practical implementation details (especially the learnable soft-thresholding) are underspecified in the paper.
- **Low confidence**: Claims of "consistent outperformance" and "statistically significant improvements" across all classes cannot be fully verified without access to the complete experimental results and statistical analysis details.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on graph construction**: Train the model with random edge weights versus MaxCorr-learned weights to quantify the contribution of the non-linear correlation learning component to overall performance.
2. **Decoupled training analysis**: Compare end-to-end training versus staged training (sHGR component first, then MGNN) to isolate the benefit of the coupled optimization objective.
3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate the framework on a different multimodal medical dataset (e.g., MIMIC-III or another publicly available multimodal dataset) to assess whether the performance gains generalize beyond the tuberculosis-specific domain.
