# State-of-the-Art in Nudity Classification: A Comparative Analysis

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16338

- This paper presents a comparative analysis of existing nudity classification techniques for classifying images based on the presence of nudity, with a focus on their application in content moderation.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative analysis of existing nudity classification techniques for classifying images based on the presence of nudity, with a focus on their application in content moderation. The evaluation focuses on CNN-based models, vision transformer, and popular open-source safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION). The study identifies the limitations of current evaluation datasets and highlights the need for more diverse and challenging datasets. The paper discusses the potential implications of these findings for developing more accurate and effective image classification systems on online platforms. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of continually improving image classification models to ensure the safety and well-being of platform users.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six different models, including MobileNetv3 (small and large), Inceptionv3, ConvNexT(tiny), ViT(B16), and popular open-source safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and LAION. The evaluation is conducted on three datasets: Adult Content Dataset, NudeNet Dataset, and LSPD Dataset. The models are trained and tested on the datasets using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, a cosine scheduler with 10% warmup, and a batch size of 256 for six epochs. The evaluation metrics used include label-wise F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall for all labels in the test sets of the datasets. Overall scores are calculated by macro averaging the label-wise scores.

## Key Results
- CNN models (MobileNetv3, Inceptionv3) outperform transformer-based models (ViT) in nudity classification due to their inductive bias and spatial hierarchies.
- Zero-shot performance of safety checkers (Stable Diffusion and LAION) is inferior to supervised models trained on the same datasets.
- Current evaluation datasets have limitations in label definitions and lack fine-grained hierarchical categories necessary for real-world applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformer-based models (ViT) perform worse than convolutional models (CNNs) in nudity classification due to limited transfer learning capability.
- Mechanism: ViTs lack the inductive bias present in CNNs, which helps in capturing spatial hierarchies and local patterns crucial for detecting nudity features. The limited transfer learning capability means ViTs cannot effectively leverage pre-trained knowledge from large-scale datasets for this specific task.
- Core assumption: The spatial hierarchies and local patterns captured by CNNs are essential for accurate nudity detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ViT did not achieve good results due to slow convergence. This may be due to inductive bias present in CNN’s or the limited transfer learning capability of the transformer-based models."
  - [section] "The limited transfer learning capability of transformer-based models may be a contributing factor to their lower performance."
- Break condition: If a ViT variant is specifically pre-trained on a large dataset containing nudity-related features, or if architectural modifications are made to introduce inductive bias.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The zero-shot performance of popular safety checkers (Stable Diffusion and LAION) is inferior to supervised models trained on the same datasets.
- Mechanism: Safety checkers are designed for a different task (preventing unsafe image generation or filtering training data) and are not optimized for the specific nuances of the evaluation datasets. Supervised models, trained on the target datasets, learn the specific patterns and features relevant to nudity detection in those datasets.
- Core assumption: The evaluation datasets have unique characteristics and challenges that require specific training for optimal performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study highlights inferior zero-shot performance of popular safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and LAION and presents better alternatives."
  - [section] "Furthermore, the study highlights inferior zero-shot performance of popular safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and LAION and presents better alternatives."
- Break condition: If safety checkers are retrained or fine-tuned on the evaluation datasets, or if the evaluation datasets are significantly simplified.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Current nudity classification datasets have limitations, such as unclear label definitions and lack of fine-grained hierarchical labels, which hinder the development of accurate and effective models.
- Mechanism: The ambiguity in labels like 'sexy' (which can include 'explicit nudity', 'bikini', 'lingerie', and 'cleavage' in LSPD, but not 'explicit nudity' in NudeNet) leads to inconsistent model training and evaluation. The absence of hierarchical labels prevents models from understanding the severity and context of nudity, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- Core assumption: Fine-grained and hierarchical labels are necessary for accurate nudity classification in real-world scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study identifies the limitations of current evaluation datasets and highlights the need for more diverse and challenging datasets."
  - [section] "Furthermore, the dataset labels can be combined in a multi-label setting ('safe' or 'nude' per image and other subcategories per image), which requires an additional labeling effort. Moreover, the current 'sexy' category in datasets is not clearly defined and not useful in real-world settings."
- Break condition: If new datasets are created with clear, hierarchical, and culturally sensitive labels, or if existing datasets are relabeled with more granular categories.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their inductive bias.
  - Why needed here: CNNs are the primary models used in the study and their inductive bias is crucial for understanding their superior performance in nudity classification.
  - Quick check question: What is the inductive bias of CNNs, and how does it help in capturing spatial hierarchies and local patterns?

- Concept: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their limitations in transfer learning.
  - Why needed here: ViTs are compared to CNNs in the study, and understanding their limitations in transfer learning is key to explaining their lower performance.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of ViTs in transfer learning, and how do they differ from CNNs in this aspect?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning and its application in evaluating safety checkers.
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates the zero-shot performance of safety checkers, and understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What is zero-shot learning, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of models on datasets they were not trained on?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Ingestion -> Model Training -> Evaluation -> Comparison and Analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
  2. Model Training
  3. Evaluation
  4. Comparison and Analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model Complexity vs. Performance: CNNs are simpler but perform better than ViTs in this task, suggesting that model complexity does not always translate to better performance.
  - Zero-shot vs. Supervised Learning: Zero-shot learning allows for quick evaluation of models on new datasets but may not capture the nuances of the target dataset, leading to inferior performance compared to supervised learning.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor Convergence: If a model (especially ViT) does not converge during training, it may indicate that the model architecture is not suitable for the task or that the training hyperparameters need to be adjusted.
  - Overfitting: If a model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set, it may indicate overfitting, which can be addressed by using regularization techniques or increasing the size of the training data.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate all models on the LSPD dataset to establish a baseline performance.
  2. Perform zero-shot evaluation of the safety checkers (Stable Diffusion and LAION) on the LSPD dataset to compare their performance with the trained models.
  3. Train and evaluate the models on the NudeNet and AdultContent datasets to assess their performance on different data distributions and label definitions.
