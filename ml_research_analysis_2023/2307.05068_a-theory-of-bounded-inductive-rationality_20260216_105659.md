# A Theory of Bounded Inductive Rationality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.05068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05068
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Develops theory of bounded inductive rationality (BRIA) showing agents learn to value random/pseudo-random lotteries at expected reward and converge to individually rational correlated strategy profiles in strategic interactions

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theory of bounded inductive rationality (BRIA) that addresses rational decision-making under computational constraints, particularly when the environment can contain descriptions of the agent itself. The core idea is that agents repeatedly face decision problems and learn to choose options that keep their promises of high rewards while testing each efficiently computable hypothesis infinitely often. BRIAs satisfy a no-overestimation criterion and cover all hypotheses in a given set, while being computable within certain asymptotic bounds.

## Method Summary
The BRIA framework involves agents maintaining wealth variables for each hypothesis about optimal actions and using a bidding system where hypotheses compete to determine actions through first-price sealed-bid auctions. When a hypothesis consistently outpromises the agent's estimates, it gets tested; if its promises are false, its wealth decreases, preventing future selection. The method proves that BRIAs learn to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward and can converge to any individually rational correlated strategy profile in strategic interactions.

## Key Results
- BRIAs learn to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward
- BRIAs converge to individually rational correlated strategy profiles in strategic interactions
- BRIAs satisfy a no-overestimation criterion and cover all hypotheses in a given set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BRIA agents learn to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward
- Mechanism: The agent maintains wealth variables for each hypothesis and uses a bidding system where hypotheses compete to determine actions. When a hypothesis consistently outpromises the agent's estimates, it gets tested; if its promises are false, its wealth decreases, preventing future selection
- Core assumption: The environment contains algorithmically random sequences that cannot be predicted better than random under computational constraints
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "they learn to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward"; [section] "Theorem 4. Let ¯µ be an e.c. sequence on [0, 1]. Let α be an O (h(t))-computable BRIA... Then in the limit as T → ∞, it holds that ∑T t=1 rt/T≥ ∑T t=1 µ t /T"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BRIA agents converge to individually rational correlated strategy profiles in strategic interactions
- Mechanism: Two BRIA agents play a game repeatedly, each maintaining hypotheses about optimal strategies. Through testing and wealth-based selection, they learn to coordinate on mutually beneficial outcomes without requiring logical omniscience
- Core assumption: Players can maintain and test hypotheses about each other's strategies while facing computational constraints
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "BRIAs satisfy a no-overestimation criterion and cover all hypotheses in a given set"; [section] "Theorem 5 (Folk theorem). Let Γ be a game... Then there exists c′ arbitrarily close to c and BRIAs... s.t. the empirical distribution... converges to c′"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BRIA agents avoid Dutch books and money extraction schemes
- Mechanism: The no-overestimation criterion ensures that cumulative overestimation cannot grow unboundedly, while hypothesis coverage ensures agents learn to follow options with guaranteed payoffs
- Core assumption: At least one option in each decision problem has an efficiently computable guaranteed payoff
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Theorem 3. Let ¯α be a BRIA... Let ¯a be a sequence of terms... We require also that the at are efficiently identifiable... Then in the limit as T → ∞ it holds that ∑T t=1 rt/T≥ ∑T t=1 Lt/T"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hypothesis testing and coverage
  - Why needed here: BRIAs need to evaluate competing hypotheses about optimal actions while facing computational constraints. Without systematic testing, biased or suboptimal hypotheses could dominate
  - Quick check question: If a hypothesis promises high rewards but consistently fails when tested, what happens to its wealth and future selection probability?

- Concept: No overestimation criterion
  - Why needed here: Prevents agents from systematically overpromising what they can deliver, ensuring convergence to optimal behavior over time
  - Quick check question: If an agent's cumulative overestimation grows without bound, what does this violate about the BRIA criterion?

- Concept: Algorithmic randomness and bounded computational constraints
  - Why needed here: BRIAs must handle environments where optimal choices depend on hard-to-compute mathematical facts or strategic interactions with other boundedly rational agents
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of boundedly vMWC random sequences differ from standard algorithmic randomness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Hypothesis pool -> Wealth tracking system -> Auction mechanism -> Test selection system -> Learning module
- Critical path: 1. Receive decision problem DPt 2. Run auction among active hypotheses 3. Select winning hypothesis and execute its recommendation 4. Observe reward rt 5. Update wealth variables for all hypotheses 6. Distribute allowance to hypotheses 7. Prepare for next decision problem
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational efficiency vs. hypothesis coverage: More hypotheses provide better coverage but increase computational cost
  - Testing frequency vs. exploration: More testing provides better empirical validation but may reduce exploitation of known good hypotheses
  - Wealth update rules vs. convergence speed: Different update rules affect how quickly agents learn optimal behavior
- Failure signatures:
  - Hypothesis wealths all converge to zero: Indicates poor hypothesis selection or inappropriate allowance distribution
  - Overestimation grows without bound: Violates BRIA criterion, suggests implementation bug in wealth updates
  - No convergence to optimal behavior: May indicate insufficient hypothesis coverage or biased testing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test BRIA on simple betting problems (digits of π) to verify learning of expected values
  2. Implement two-agent game to verify convergence to correlated equilibria
  3. Test with varying computational bounds to observe effect on learning speed and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the BRIA theory imply coherence properties similar to those found in Garrabrant et al.'s logical inductors?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "Can we modify the BRIA requirement so that it implies coherence properties `a la Garrabrant et al. [10]?" in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore this connection or provide any results about coherence properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing that BRIAs satisfy the same coherence properties as Garrabrant inductors, or a counterexample demonstrating they don't.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the frequencies with which BRIAs play pure strategies in games converge to mixed Nash equilibria as well as correlated equilibria?
- Basis in paper: The paper proves convergence to correlated equilibria but only states "Do the frequencies with which BRIAs play the given pure strategies of a game converge to mixed Nash and correlated equilibria?" in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The folk theorem only proves convergence to correlated equilibria, not Nash equilibria.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing convergence to Nash equilibria, or a counterexample showing convergence to correlated equilibria that are not Nash.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can BRIA theory be used to build better real-world AI systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "Can BRIA theory be used to build better real-world systems?" in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The paper is theoretical and doesn't provide any practical implementation or evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A practical implementation of BRIA agents applied to real-world decision problems, showing improved performance compared to existing methods.

## Limitations
- Assumes at least one option has an efficiently computable guaranteed payoff, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios
- Requires hypotheses to be efficiently identifiable, potentially excluding many natural decision problems
- Computational bounds assumed may be unrealistically generous for practical applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: Mathematical proofs and theoretical framework, particularly regarding no-overestimation criterion and formal properties of BRIAs
- Medium confidence: Practical applicability to real-world decision problems, as theory makes strong assumptions about computational efficiency and hypothesis identifiability
- Low confidence: Scalability to very complex environments with large hypothesis spaces, as computational costs could become prohibitive

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation**: Implement BRIA agents in controlled simulation environments with varying levels of computational constraints to test whether the theoretical convergence guarantees hold in practice.

2. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate BRIA performance when the assumption of efficiently computable guaranteed payoffs is violated, to understand the boundaries of the theory's applicability.

3. **Scalability Analysis**: Measure computational costs as the hypothesis space grows and assess whether the theoretical asymptotic bounds translate to practical feasibility for realistic problem sizes.
