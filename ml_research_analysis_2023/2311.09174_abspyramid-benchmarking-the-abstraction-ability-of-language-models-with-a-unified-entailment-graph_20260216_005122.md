# AbsPyramid: Benchmarking the Abstraction Ability of Language Models with a Unified Entailment Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09174
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09174
- Reference count: 37
- Fine-tuned models, especially Llama2, significantly outperform zero-shot and in-context learning on abstraction detection and generation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ABSPYRAMID, a large-scale benchmark of 221K abstraction knowledge instances designed to evaluate language models' ability to comprehend and generate abstract concepts across nouns, verbs, and events. The dataset is curated by sampling events from ASER, identifying instances using heuristics, and collecting abstract concepts through WordNet and LLM prompting, followed by crowdsourcing validation. Experiments show that fine-tuned models, especially Llama2, outperform zero-shot and in-context learning approaches on abstraction detection and generation tasks. LLMs trained on ABSPYRAMID also significantly improve performance on prior abstraction benchmarks like verb entailment graphs and AbstractATOMIC, demonstrating the dataset's comprehensiveness and effectiveness in enhancing abstraction abilities in language models.

## Method Summary
ABSPYRAMID is constructed by first sampling events from ASER, then identifying instances using heuristics, and collecting abstract concepts through WordNet and LLM prompting, followed by crowdsourcing validation. The benchmark contains 221K five-element tuples (head event, entailment relation, tail event, instance, abstract concept) across three relation types: Noun-Entail, Verb-Entail, and Event-Entail. For evaluation, the authors fine-tune various PLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa), NLI models (BART, RoBERTa-large-mnli, DeBERTa-large-mnli), and LLMs (Llama2, Llama2-Chat, Falcon, Falcon-Instruct, Mistral, Mistral-Instruct) using LoRA. They evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and in-context learning performance on detection (classifying abstract concepts as valid/invalid) and generation (generating abstract concepts) tasks using metrics like Accuracy, Macro F1-score, ROC-AUC, BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama2 models achieve the highest performance on both abstraction detection and generation tasks
- Multi-relation training (joint training on all three relation types) performs comparably to separate relation training
- LLMs fine-tuned on ABSPYRAMID significantly improve performance on prior abstraction benchmarks including verb entailment graphs and AbstractATOMIC
- Zero-shot and in-context learning approaches perform substantially worse than fine-tuned models across all tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Abstraction ability improves when models are fine-tuned on curated abstraction knowledge
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning injects structured abstraction knowledge into model weights, allowing learned representations to generalize to unseen events
- Core assumption: The abstraction patterns in the training data are representative enough to transfer to novel instances
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By training on our rich abstraction knowledge, we find LLMs can acquire basic abstraction abilities and generalize to unseen events"
  - [section] "fine-tuned models perform better at comprehending abstraction knowledge, especially for nouns"
  - [corpus] "22K test instances" indicates sufficient data for generalization
- Break condition: If test data distribution significantly diverges from training abstraction patterns, transfer fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-relation training (Noun-Entail, Verb-Entail, Event-Entail) yields comparable performance to separate relation training
- Mechanism: Joint training captures shared abstraction features across relation types, preventing overfitting to single relation patterns
- Core assumption: Abstraction knowledge has common underlying structure across different relation types
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "unifying scopes and domains of all prior datasets"
  - [section] "LLMs can learn abstraction knowledge of multiple relations, with performance comparable to that of training on each relation separately"
  - [corpus] "221K instances across three relation types" provides diverse training signal
- Break condition: If relations have fundamentally different abstraction mechanisms, joint training degrades performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Abstraction knowledge transfer improves performance on related tasks like verb entailment graphs
- Mechanism: Shared abstraction patterns between tasks allow knowledge to generalize beyond direct training objectives
- Core assumption: Abstraction concepts learned on our benchmark overlap substantially with those needed for other entailment tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our benchmark is comprehensive to enhance LLMs across two previous abstraction tasks"
  - [section] "LLMs fine-tuned on our dataset surpass previous works a lot" on verb entailment graph task
  - [corpus] "comprehensive abstraction knowledge" suggests broad coverage beyond single domain
- Break condition: If target task requires domain-specific abstractions not present in training data, transfer fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation
  - Why needed here: Models must understand different meanings of words in context to correctly identify abstraction relationships
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "bank" (financial institution) and "bank" (river edge) would have different hypernyms?

- Concept: Event structure and semantic roles
  - Why needed here: Abstraction occurs at multiple levels (nouns, verbs, entire events) requiring understanding of event components
  - Quick check question: Given "the cat chased the mouse into its burrow," what are the core semantic roles and how would abstraction work at each level?

- Concept: Entailment vs. similarity
  - Why needed here: The task requires determining genuine abstraction relationships, not just semantic similarity
  - Quick check question: Is "animal" a valid abstraction of "dog"? Is "pet" a valid abstraction of "dog"? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data curation pipeline → Fine-tuning framework → Evaluation harness → Transfer experiments
- Critical path: Curation → Training → Validation → Transfer testing
- Design tradeoffs: Large-scale automated curation vs. quality control; Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning approaches
- Failure signatures: Low performance on validation despite high training accuracy suggests overfitting; Poor transfer performance indicates insufficient generalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune on Noun-Entail subset only, evaluate on held-out Noun-Entail test
  2. Fine-tune on all relations jointly, evaluate on each relation separately
  3. Fine-tune on benchmark, directly evaluate on verb entailment graph dataset without additional training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the abstraction ability of LLMs change when the base events are drawn from domains beyond social commonsense, such as scientific or technical domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that ABSPYRAMID covers abstraction knowledge beyond the social commonsense domain due to the open domain corpora used in ASER, in contrast to AbstractATOMIC which is limited to social commonsense.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily evaluates LLMs on social commonsense domains and verb entailment graphs, but does not explore performance on scientific or technical domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing LLMs on ABSPYRAMID with base events from scientific or technical corpora and comparing their performance to social commonsense domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the abstraction knowledge in ABSPYRAMID be effectively integrated with other types of knowledge, such as factual knowledge or common sense, to improve LLM performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that integrating abstraction knowledge with eventuality knowledge and other knowledge types like factual knowledge and common sense could be an open question for future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating and enhancing abstraction ability in isolation, without exploring integration with other knowledge types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where LLMs are fine-tuned on ABSPYRAMID combined with factual knowledge or common sense datasets, and their performance is compared to models trained on ABSPYRAMID alone.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of scaling up language models on their ability to generate abstract concepts compared to their ability to detect valid abstract concepts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that increasing the number of parameters has a more significant effect on abstraction generation than detection, as evidenced by GPT2-XL outperforming smaller models in generation tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a comparison but does not deeply analyze the underlying reasons for the difference in impact between generation and detection tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of model architectures and training dynamics to understand why larger models benefit more from increased parameters in generation tasks versus detection tasks.

## Limitations

- Performance improvements vary significantly across model families, with instruction-tuned variants underperforming despite stronger general reasoning capabilities
- The evaluation setup doesn't clearly isolate whether improvements come from benchmark training itself or general fine-tuning effects
- Limited exploration of abstraction performance on domains beyond social commonsense

## Confidence

**High** on dataset construction methodology and scale
- The 221K instances represent a substantial expansion over prior benchmarks
- The multi-stage curation process (ASER sampling → WordNet/LLM abstraction collection → crowdsourcing validation) appears robust

**Medium** on claims about LLM performance improvements
- While fine-tuned models outperform zero-shot approaches, relative gains vary significantly across model families
- Llama2 shows most consistent improvements, but instruction-tuned variants underperform in some tasks

**Low** on claims about knowledge transfer to prior abstraction benchmarks
- The evaluation setup doesn't clearly isolate whether improvements come from benchmark training or general fine-tuning effects
- Comparison with baseline models lacks statistical significance testing

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture-Specific Fine-tuning Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies comparing zero-shot performance across all LLM families before and after fine-tuning on ABSPYRAMID. This would clarify whether observed improvements are consistent across architectures or specific to certain model families like Llama2.

2. **Knowledge Transfer Isolation**: Design experiments that control for general fine-tuning effects by training on a non-abstraction benchmark of similar scale, then comparing transfer performance to verb entailment and AbstractATOMIC tasks. This would isolate whether ABSPYRAMID provides specific abstraction knowledge or general language understanding benefits.

3. **Temporal Generalization Test**: Evaluate model performance on abstract concepts for events that occurred after the training data cutoff (post-2024). This would test whether models learned genuine abstraction patterns or merely memorized historical relationships, addressing concerns about model capabilities versus memorization.
