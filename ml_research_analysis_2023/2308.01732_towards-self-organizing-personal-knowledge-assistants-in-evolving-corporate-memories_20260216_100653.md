# Towards Self-organizing Personal Knowledge Assistants in Evolving Corporate Memories

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.01732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01732
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Decade-long research on self-organizing personal knowledge assistants using knowledge graphs, context spaces, and managed forgetting with industrial deployments showing 40% faster context switching and 91% agreement on preservation decisions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive decade of research on self-organizing personal knowledge assistants (PKAs) in evolving corporate memories. The work focuses on constructing knowledge graphs from messy enterprise data using interactive approaches and RML mappings, implementing self-organizing context spaces for context-aware personal information management, and developing managed forgetting mechanisms for intelligent information lifecycle management. The research has been validated through industrial use cases including a CoMem system at energy provider enviaM with 9M items and 200M triples, demonstrating significant improvements in context switching speed and user trust in autonomous assistance.

## Method Summary
The research methodology combines Human-in-the-Loop (HumL) approaches for knowledge graph construction with semantic desktop environments for context-aware personal information management. The process involves collecting personal and corporate data through PIM crawlers, constructing knowledge graphs using interactive concept mining and RML mappings, implementing context spaces with context elicitation and information value assessment (Memory Buoyancy and Preservation Value), and evaluating system performance through user studies measuring context switching speed and preservation decision agreement. The approach emphasizes user feedback loops and transparency mechanisms to build trust in autonomous assistance.

## Key Results
- 40% faster context switching in cSpaces compared to traditional desktop environments
- 91% agreement among users on preservation decisions made by the system
- Successful industrial deployment at enviaM with 9M items and 200M triples in the CoMem system
- Significant user trust in autonomous assistance for information reorganization and managed forgetting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interactive approaches and RML mappings enable construction of knowledge graphs from messy enterprise data.
- Mechanism: Interactive human-in-the-loop (HumL) approaches allow knowledge engineers to annotate spreadsheets and other data sources, extracting entities and relationships that are then represented in a knowledge graph. RML mappings provide a formal way to define these transformations, making the process reproducible and scalable.
- Core assumption: Human expertise is necessary to interpret messy data and define appropriate mappings for knowledge graph construction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We construct knowledge graphs (KGs) from messy enterprise data using interactive approaches, RML mappings..."
  - [section]: "AnnoSpreadKGC... lets users create resources and relationships mainly on an ABox level... A user study with 17 participants showed that users were able to create more statements in less time..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence for specific RML application; corpus neighbors focus on different topics (e.g., AI ethics, software engineering training).
- Break condition: If the messy data is too complex for human interpretation or if the formal mapping definitions become too cumbersome to maintain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-organizing context spaces (cSpaces) provide context-aware personal information management (PIM) and knowledge work support.
- Mechanism: cSpaces use context as an explicit interaction element, allowing users to work in and with contexts. User activity tracking and information extraction are used to elicit contexts and trigger support measures like temporal hiding, condensation, and reorganization. Memory Buoyancy and Preservation Value assess the information value for selecting appropriate actions.
- Core assumption: User behavior and context are reliable indicators of information value and can be used to automate PIM and knowledge work support.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our self-organizing context spaces (cSpaces) provide context-aware PIM and knowledge work support via context as an explicit interaction element, managed forgetting, and intelligent reorganization."
  - [section]: "The interaction with cSpaces is basically a cycle of six steps... evidence collection, information extraction, context elicitation, information value assessment, self-(re)organization measures, and user interface updates."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence for specific cSpaces implementation; corpus neighbors do not discuss context-aware PIM systems.
- Break condition: If user behavior tracking is perceived as privacy-invasive or if the context elicitation algorithms fail to accurately identify user contexts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Managed forgetting complements human memory by providing a system of escalating measures for information preservation and deletion.
- Mechanism: Managed forgetting replaces the binary keep-or-delete paradigm with measures like temporal hiding, condensation, aggregation, summarization, adaptive reorganization, synchronization, archiving, and deletion. These measures are applied in a self-organizing and decentralized way based on observed evidence and information value assessments.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from a system that can automatically manage the information lifecycle, freeing up cognitive resources and preventing information overload.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Managed forgetting... provides context-aware PIM and knowledge work support via... managed forgetting, and intelligent reorganization."
  - [section]: "Managed Forgetting was envisioned in the EU project ForgetIT... The idea was initially published by members of the team in two position papers... and later extended by us in the Managed Forgetting project..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence for specific managed forgetting implementation; corpus neighbors do not discuss intentional forgetting in information systems.
- Break condition: If users lose trust in the system due to unexpected deletions or if the information value assessments are perceived as inaccurate.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
  - Why needed here: KGs are the core data structure used to represent and interconnect information in the corporate memory and personal knowledge assistant systems.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a knowledge graph, and how do they differ from traditional relational databases?

- Concept: Semantic Desktop
  - Why needed here: The Semantic Desktop provides the ecosystem for bridging users' local devices with the corporate memory, enabling context-aware PIM and knowledge work support.
  - Quick check question: How does the Semantic Desktop extend traditional desktop environments, and what are its key features for PIM?

- Concept: Human-in-the-Loop (HumL) Approaches
  - Why needed here: HumL approaches are used in knowledge graph construction and context elicitation to leverage human expertise and ensure the system aligns with user needs.
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits and challenges of using HumL approaches in AI systems, and how can they be effectively implemented?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data acquisition -> Knowledge Graph construction (RML mappings, interactive mining) -> Context spaces (context elicitation, value assessment) -> Managed forgetting (preservation measures) -> User interface
- Critical path: User activity tracking -> Information extraction -> Context elicitation -> Information value assessment -> Self-(re)organization measures -> User interface updates
- Design tradeoffs: The system trades off automation for user control, using HumL approaches to ensure the system aligns with user needs while still providing automated support measures.
- Failure signatures: System failures can manifest as inaccurate context elicitation, privacy concerns due to user activity tracking, or user distrust due to unexpected deletions or reorganizations.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic KG construction pipeline using RML mappings on a sample dataset.
  2. Develop a context space prototype with basic context switching and item management features.
  3. Integrate a simple managed forgetting mechanism based on usage frequency and implement a user interface for managing forgotten items.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the cold start problem be effectively addressed in personal knowledge assistants when no user data is initially available?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that personal knowledge assistants suffer from a cold start problem, where they don't know anything about users initially, including information items and observed interaction data.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions bootstrapping the system with user data through interviews or initial data collection, it doesn't provide a comprehensive solution for the cold start problem when no data is available.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study comparing different bootstrapping methods and their effectiveness in addressing the cold start problem would provide evidence for the best approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the performance of knowledge graph construction methods be improved when dealing with messy enterprise data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses challenges in constructing knowledge graphs from messy enterprise data, such as spreadsheets with various data entry inconsistencies, and proposes methods like AnnoSpreadKGC and Spread2RML to address these issues.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents methods to tackle messy data, it doesn't provide a comprehensive evaluation of their performance or compare them to other existing methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough evaluation comparing the performance of different knowledge graph construction methods on various types of messy enterprise data would provide insights into their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the trust in highly autonomous personal knowledge assistants be improved, especially when they make decisions about reorganizing or forgetting information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the importance of trust in highly autonomous personal knowledge assistants and mentions studies exploring transparency and user trust in such systems.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents initial findings on transparency and trust, it doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for building and maintaining trust in highly autonomous personal knowledge assistants.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study investigating the factors that influence trust in highly autonomous personal knowledge assistants and the effectiveness of different trust-building strategies would provide valuable insights.

## Limitations
- The evidence for specific mechanisms like RML mappings and managed forgetting comes from related projects rather than direct evaluation within the presented system.
