core_contribution: XLNet effectively models argumentative elements in persuasive essays,
  achieving strong performance across diverse annotation schemes and surpassing human
  agreement levels in some cases. By leveraging XLNet's recurrent transformer architecture,
  the models handle long texts and capture long-term dependencies crucial for essay
  annotation.

# Argumentation Element Annotation Modeling using XLNet

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06239
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06239
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: XLNet models achieve human-level agreement on argumentative element annotation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to annotating argumentative elements in persuasive essays using XLNet, a transformer-based language model. The study demonstrates that XLNet's recurrent mechanism and permutation language modeling effectively capture long-term dependencies and interdependencies between annotation tags. When applied to three diverse datasets (ARROW, PERSUADE, and AAE), the fine-tuned XLNet models achieve F1 scores up to 0.956 and kappa statistics up to 0.832, surpassing human agreement levels in some cases. The approach uses synthetic labels derived from model predictions to create robust training data, enabling effective annotation of unseen essay prompts.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes XLNet-Base and XLNet-Large models on three datasets using Adafactor optimizer for 20 epochs, with truncated inputs to 2048 tokens. Models are trained on synthetic labels generated from ensemble predictions, with hierarchical resolution applied to conflicting annotations. Evaluation uses F1 scores and Cohen's kappa statistics, comparing model performance against human benchmarks. The approach handles both sentence-level (ARROW) and word-level (PERSUADE, AAE) annotations across different annotation schemes.

## Key Results
- XLNet models achieve F1 scores up to 0.956 on argumentative element annotation tasks
- Kappa statistics reach 0.832, exceeding human rater agreement levels
- Models trained on synthetic labels successfully generalize to unseen essay prompts
- XLNet's architecture effectively handles long essays through recurrent mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XLNet's recurrent transformer architecture enables it to handle long essays without fixed-length token limits.
- Mechanism: XLNet caches and reuses hidden states from previous segments as extended context for the next segment, allowing long-term dependencies to span beyond a single segment
