# Streaming Compression of Scientific Data via weak-SINDy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14962
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14962
- Reference count: 28
- The paper proposes a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm for compressing scientific data generated from simulations or experiments.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm for compressing scientific data from simulations or experiments. The method constructs feature matrices and target vectors incrementally using streaming integration, then builds a model via regression to recover governing equations. For high-dimensional data, it combines streaming weak-SINDy with streaming POD to reduce dimensionality before compression. Numerical tests on Lorenz system and fluid flow data demonstrate accurate reconstruction with low memory costs compared to storing full datasets.

## Method Summary
The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm compresses streaming scientific data by incrementally updating feature matrices and target vectors using streaming integration (Newton-Cotes formulas). For high-dimensional data, streaming POD reduces dimensionality by dynamically updating the projection basis as new data arrives. The algorithm updates integrals one set of P snapshots at a time, holding only P snapshots in memory. For high-dimensional data, POD reduces the state dimension S to L ≪ S before applying weak-SINDy. The method uses sequential threshold least squares to promote sparsity in the coefficient vector, yielding parsimonious governing equations.

## Key Results
- Streaming integration updates feature matrices and target vectors incrementally using a fixed number of snapshots, making memory footprint independent of total data size
- Dimensionality reduction via streaming POD reduces state dimension S to L ≪ S before applying weak-SINDy, keeping projection basis size manageable
- Sequential threshold least squares promotes sparsity in coefficient vector, yielding parsimonious governing equations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Streaming integration updates feature matrices and target vectors incrementally using a fixed number of snapshots, making the memory footprint independent of total data size.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm uses a composite Newton-Cotes formula to update integrals one set of P snapshots at a time. Each update replaces the oldest snapshot with the newest, so only P snapshots are ever held in memory.
- **Core assumption**: Data arrives in equally spaced time intervals and the integral over the full time domain can be decomposed into a sum of integrals over P-sized subintervals.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner."
  - [section] "Streaming integration with equal intervals: For a collection ofN snapshots... a composite integration rule using a P -th degree Newton-Cotes formula has the form..."
- **Break condition**: If snapshots are irregularly spaced and the adaptation step in [section] is not implemented, the integral updates become inaccurate and the model degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Dimensionality reduction via streaming POD reduces the state dimension S to L ≪ S before applying weak-SINDy, keeping the projection basis size manageable.
- **Mechanism**: An initial POD basis is built from p0 snapshots. As new data arrives, residuals are computed; if a snapshot cannot be well-approximated, a new spatial mode is added. The temporal modes of the reduced system are then fed to weak-SINDy.
- **Core assumption**: The dominant dynamics of the high-dimensional system can be captured by a small number of POD modes whose temporal evolution is governed by a low-dimensional ODE.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "For high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension..."
  - [section] "Function 2: Streaming POD... computes the residual... and adds a new component to the basis when the incoming data cannot be well-approximated..."
- **Break condition**: If the data changes too rapidly (see Section 5.2.2), the number of POD modes grows large, eroding memory savings.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Sequential threshold least squares promotes sparsity in the coefficient vector, yielding parsimonious governing equations.
- **Mechanism**: After computing an initial least-squares solution, coefficients below a threshold are set to zero and the corresponding basis functions removed; the process iterates until all remaining coefficients exceed the threshold.
- **Core assumption**: The true governing equations are sparse in the chosen basis, so most coefficients should be zero.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "In Algorithm 3, we have opted to use a sequential threshold least squares approach..."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus match; this is a standard technique in SINDy literature.
- **Break condition**: If the threshold is set too high, important terms are pruned and the model loses accuracy; too low, and sparsity is not achieved.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Newton-Cotes integration formulas**
  - Why needed here: The streaming algorithm relies on composite Newton-Cotes rules to update integrals incrementally.
  - Quick check question: Given P=3 (Simpson's rule) and three equally spaced snapshots g1, g2, g3, what is the integral approximation over that interval?

- **Concept: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**
  - Why needed here: POD reduces high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by dominant spatial modes.
  - Quick check question: If the data matrix has singular values σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3, and εspec=1e-1, which modes are kept?

- **Concept: Sparse regression (LASSO / sequential thresholding)**
  - Why needed here: SINDy seeks the sparsest set of basis functions that can represent the dynamics.
  - Quick check question: In a feature matrix G with columns φj, what does setting c_j=0 for small |c_j| accomplish?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data ingestion → streaming integration (Update function) → feature matrix G and target vector b accumulation → streaming POD (UpdatePOD) → basis expansion → offline regression (BuildAndSolve) → coefficient vectors c → model reconstruction
- **Critical path**: Streaming integration → target/feature update → regression solve. Any delay here directly impacts model fidelity.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Memory vs. accuracy: Larger P in Newton-Cotes increases accuracy but requires holding more snapshots; smaller P reduces memory but may degrade integral quality.
  - Basis size vs. sparsity: More projection functions increase model expressivity but also memory and risk overfitting.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Growing number of POD modes → residual threshold too low or data too non-stationary.
  - Degraded reconstruction accuracy → streaming integration step size too coarse or coefficient threshold too aggressive.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run streaming weak-SINDy on a low-dimensional synthetic ODE (e.g., Lorenz) with P=2 (trapezoid) and verify memory independence from N.
  2. Test streaming POD on a slowly varying high-dimensional dataset; monitor mode count and residual over time.
  3. Vary coefficient threshold in sequential thresholding; measure sparsity vs. reconstruction error on a held-out validation set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm perform when the underlying dynamical system exhibits strong nonlinearity or chaos, beyond the Lorenz system tested in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that streaming variants of DMD inherit disadvantages from DMD, including poor prediction of strongly nonlinear dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the algorithm on the Lorenz system and fluid flow data. No experiments were conducted on strongly nonlinear or chaotic systems to validate performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments applying the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to data from strongly nonlinear or chaotic systems (e.g., double pendulum, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) to assess accuracy and convergence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the number of projection functions and test functions in the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm for achieving the best compression-accuracy trade-off?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that the size of the feature matrix and target vectors depends on the number of projection functions (J) and test functions (K), and that the efficiency depends on having K(J + S) < SN.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study of how varying J and K affects compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. The choice appears to be heuristic.
- What evidence would resolve it: A parametric study varying J and K for different datasets, measuring compression ratio, reconstruction error, and computational cost to identify optimal parameter ranges.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the streaming POD basis update frequency affect the overall compression efficiency and accuracy in high-dimensional streaming data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss that the efficiency depends on minimizing the number of times new POD modes are added, as each addition increases the feature matrix size.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions this trade-off, it does not quantify the relationship between update frequency, compression efficiency, and accuracy. The impact of different update thresholds is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the residual threshold (εres) and spectral threshold (εspec) in the streaming POD algorithm, measuring the resulting compression ratios, reconstruction errors, and computational costs across different datasets.

## Limitations
- The streaming POD component's effectiveness appears sensitive to data stationarity - rapidly changing data can cause the number of POD modes to grow large, eroding memory savings.
- The streaming integration mechanism assumes equally spaced snapshots, with irregular spacing requiring additional adaptation steps not fully detailed in the paper.
- The coupling between POD basis updates and weak-SINDy feature construction introduces complexity that could lead to compounding errors if not carefully managed.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of streaming integration for building feature matrices incrementally is well-established (Newton-Cotes formulas are standard). The memory independence from total data size follows directly from the algorithm design.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of combining streaming POD with weak-SINDy for high-dimensional data is demonstrated numerically but depends heavily on problem-specific parameters. The trade-off between basis size and compression efficiency is acknowledged but not fully characterized.
- **Low confidence**: The generality of the approach across diverse scientific domains is asserted but not extensively validated. The paper focuses on Lorenz and fluid flow examples without exploring edge cases where the method might fail.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce the Lorenz system experiment**: Implement the streaming integration with P=2 (trapezoid rule) and verify that memory usage remains bounded as N increases, while maintaining reconstruction accuracy comparable to the full data storage approach.

2. **Stress test the streaming POD**: Create a synthetic high-dimensional dataset that gradually transitions between two distinct dynamical regimes. Monitor how quickly the number of POD modes grows and whether the algorithm can adapt without catastrophic memory growth.

3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary εspec, εres, and the coefficient threshold across multiple orders of magnitude. Quantify how these choices affect (a) the final number of POD modes, (b) the sparsity of the learned equations, and (c) the reconstruction error on held-out data.
