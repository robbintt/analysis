# Synthpop++: A Hybrid Framework for Generating A Country-scale Synthetic Population

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.12284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12284
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Hybrid IPU-CTGAN framework generates synthetic populations with realistic family structures and individual attributes, validated against Census data and used in disease modeling

## Executive Summary
SynthPop++ introduces a hybrid framework combining Iterative Proportional Updating (IPU) and Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) to generate synthetic populations at country scale. The framework generates populations with realistic family structures, individual attributes, and geolocation data by leveraging multiple data sources including Census marginals, household surveys, and population density grids. Applied to Mumbai district, the synthetic population demonstrates high fidelity to real data across statistical and machine learning evaluations, and shows utility in infectious disease modeling scenarios.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in three main stages: first, IPU generates household structures matching Census marginal distributions; second, CTGAN generates individual-level attributes conditioned on IPU base attributes; third, geolocation sampling places households and external locations (workplaces, schools) according to population density data. The hybrid approach combines the marginal distribution guarantees of IPU with the joint distribution learning capabilities of CTGAN, while using reject sampling to ensure geographic accuracy within administrative boundaries.

## Key Results
- Synthetic population for Mumbai district contains 44 columns of demographic, socioeconomic, health, and geolocation attributes
- Statistical tests (Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) show synthetic population closely matches real population distributions
- ML efficacy tests (Linear Regression, MLP Regressor) demonstrate synthetic data utility for predictive modeling
- Synthetic population successfully used in Agent-based disease spread modeling for policy intervention analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The hybrid IPU-CTGAN approach preserves both marginal and joint distributions of demographic attributes.
- Mechanism: IPU ensures marginal distributions match Census data, while CTGAN learns joint distributions from the IHDS-II survey. By conditioning CTGAN on IPU-generated base attributes, the framework captures realistic correlations between attributes like age, sex, height, and comorbidities.
- Core assumption: The overlapping attributes between IPU and CTGAN input datasets are sufficient to condition the CTGAN model and preserve realistic joint distributions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The population density sampling method accurately geolocates synthetic households while respecting administrative boundaries.
- Mechanism: Grid population density data is filtered to the target district boundary. Sampling with replacement weighted by population counts ensures households are distributed proportionally to real density. Rejection sampling removes points outside the boundary.
- Core assumption: The grid resolution (1 km²) is fine enough to capture meaningful density variation within districts, and administrative boundary polygons are accurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The external location assignment algorithm creates realistic workplace and school networks based on distance decay.
- Mechanism: Each individual is assigned external locations (workplaces, schools) with probability inversely proportional to their distance from home, using an arbitrary strictly decreasing function f(D). This models the heuristic that people prefer nearby locations.
- Core assumption: Distance is the primary determinant of location choice; other factors like job type or school quality are secondary or captured by the synthetic data's inherent distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Iterative Proportional Updating (IPU)
  - Why needed here: IPU generates household structures that match Census marginal distributions, providing the base population for conditioning.
  - Quick check question: What type of data does IPU require as input, and what does it guarantee about the output?

- Concept: Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN)
  - Why needed here: CTGAN learns and generates complex joint distributions of individual attributes conditioned on base attributes, filling in details IPU cannot provide.
  - Quick check question: How does conditioning CTGAN on IPU-generated attributes help preserve realistic correlations?

- Concept: Reject Sampling
  - Why needed here: Ensures sampled geographic points fall within administrative boundaries while maintaining population density weighting.
  - Quick check question: Why is rejection sampling necessary when sampling from population density grids?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Census marginals → IPU Engine → CTGAN Models → Geo Sampling Module → Assignment Engine → Evaluation Suite
- Critical path: IPU → CTGAN conditioning → Geo Sampling → External Assignment → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using multiple data sources improves attribute coverage but increases data integration complexity
  - Reject sampling ensures geographic accuracy but may require oversampling to meet point quotas
  - Distance-based assignment is simple but may not capture all location choice factors
- Failure signatures:
  - Marginal distributions diverge from Census → IPU parameters or input data are incorrect
  - Joint distributions are implausible → CTGAN is underfit or conditioning attributes are insufficient
  - Geographic placement is inaccurate → Boundary polygons or density grids are flawed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run IPU alone on Census marginals and verify household size and individual attribute marginals match input
  2. Train CTGAN on IHDS-II subset conditioned on age and sex, then generate synthetic individuals and check marginal distributions
  3. Combine IPU and CTGAN outputs for a small test district, then apply geo sampling and verify spatial distribution against known density patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we generate synthetic populations at the country scale without relying on sample survey data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention this as a future work direction in the conclusion section.
- Why unresolved: Current methods require survey data as input, which may not always be available or representative for all regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that can generate synthetic populations using only census data and publicly available statistics, without requiring microdata from surveys.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we model complex economic variables in synthetic populations to capture socioeconomic diversity more accurately?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list this as a future work direction in the conclusion section.
- Why unresolved: Current models may not capture the full complexity of economic variables like income, occupation, and wealth distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that can generate synthetic populations with more realistic and diverse economic attributes, validated against real-world data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we model realistic intra-city geographical distributions of individuals based on their demographic and socioeconomic attributes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list this as a future work direction in the conclusion section.
- Why unresolved: Current models assume a uniform distribution of population density within a city, which may not reflect reality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that can generate synthetic populations with more realistic geographical distributions, validated against real-world data.

## Limitations
- Framework relies heavily on data availability and quality, with limited validation against ground truth for individual-level attributes
- Distance-based location assignment may oversimplify complex location choice behaviors
- CTGAN model's ability to capture all relevant joint distributions is constrained by available training data and conditioning variables

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: IPU-generated household structures matching Census marginals, basic geolocation sampling methodology
- **Medium confidence**: CTGAN-generated individual attributes, distance-based external location assignment
- **Low confidence**: Complete end-to-end synthetic population validity without extensive real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. **Joint Distribution Validation**: Compare synthetic individual attribute correlations against multiple independent survey datasets to verify CTGAN's learned relationships are generalizable beyond the IHDS-II training data.

2. **Geographic Accuracy Assessment**: Conduct a spatial validation study comparing synthetic household distributions against detailed satellite imagery or mobile phone location data in the Mumbai district to assess geolocation sampling accuracy.

3. **Behavioral Realism Testing**: Implement a simple agent-based simulation using the synthetic population to model a non-disease behavior (e.g., commuting patterns) and compare results against actual transportation survey data to validate the behavioral assumptions in the framework.
