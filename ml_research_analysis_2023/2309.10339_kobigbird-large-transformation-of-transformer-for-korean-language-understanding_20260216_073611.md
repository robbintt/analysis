# KoBigBird-large: Transformation of Transformer for Korean Language Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.10339
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10339
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Primary result:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean NLU benchmarks without further pretraining by transforming KLUE-RoBERTa-large into BigBird architecture with TAPER for extended positional encoding.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KoBigBird-large, a large-sized Korean language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean NLU benchmarks while supporting long sequence processing. The authors transform the KLUE-RoBERTa-large architecture into BigBird without additional pretraining, extending positional encoding using their proposed Tapered Absolute Positional Encoding Representations (TAPER) method. The model demonstrates superior performance on document classification and question answering tasks involving longer sequences compared to competitive baselines.

## Method Summary
KoBigBird-large is built by transforming KLUE-RoBERTa-large into BigBird architecture without further pretraining. The authors extend the positional encoding using TAPER, which applies attenuated amplitude to generated additional position embeddings for extended sequences. The model retains all parameters from the source architecture and operates in full attention mode for sequences at or below the predefined length, switching to sparse attention for longer inputs up to 4096 tokens.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art overall performance on Korean language understanding benchmarks
- Shows average improvement of over 0.4 percentage points compared to previous records
- Demonstrates best performance on document classification and question answering tasks for longer sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KoBigBird-large achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean NLU benchmarks without further pretraining by transforming the architecture and extending positional encoding.
- Mechanism: The model leverages the well-tuned parameters of KLUE-RoBERTa-large and transforms it into BigBird architecture with TAPER to handle longer sequences.
- Core assumption: The architecture transformation and positional encoding extension are sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance without further pretraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Without further pretraining, we only transform the architecture and extend the positional encoding with our proposed Tapered Absolute Positional Encoding Representations (TAPER)."
  - [section]: "Noteworthily, no further pretraining or corpus is required to build it, but just the transformation of modules is all we need."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.483, average citations=0.0.
- Break condition: If the architecture transformation and positional encoding extension are not sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance without further pretraining.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TAPER improves extrapolation performance for language modeling on extended sequences.
- Mechanism: TAPER extends the originally trained position embeddings by applying attenuation to generate additional position embeddings for extended sequences.
- Core assumption: Attenuated amplitude of each repetition makes the extended positions distinguishable and improves extrapolation performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "it demonstrates the best performance on document classification and question answering tasks for longer sequences against competitive baseline models."
  - [section]: "To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel method, Tapered Absolute Positional Encoding Representations (TAPER), for the extended APEs so that they show better extrapolation performance for language modeling."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.483, average citations=0.0.
- Break condition: If the attenuated amplitude of each repetition does not make the extended positions distinguishable or improve extrapolation performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KoBigBird-large retains the highest performance in longer sequences up to a length of 4096.
- Mechanism: KoBigBird-large incorporates an enhanced version of the embeddings and structure, initially adopting all parameters from Msrc. It operates in the full attention mode when the input length is the same as or shorter than the predefined length of Msrc.
- Core assumption: The enhanced version of the embeddings and structure allows KoBigBird-large to retain the highest performance in longer sequences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In experiments, KoBigBird-large shows state-of-the-art overall performance on Korean language understanding benchmarks and the best performance on document classification and question answering tasks for longer sequences against the competitive baseline models."
  - [section]: "KoBigBird-large incorporates an enhanced version of the embeddings and structure, initially adopting all parameters from Msrc."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.483, average citations=0.0.
- Break condition: If the enhanced version of the embeddings and structure does not allow KoBigBird-large to retain the highest performance in longer sequences.

  - Quick check question: How does positional encoding help transformers understand the order of input tokens?
- Concept: Attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: KoBigBird-large uses sparse attention to handle longer inputs, so understanding attention mechanisms is important.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between full attention and sparse attention in transformers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: KLUE-RoBERTa-large -> BigBird architecture transformation -> TAPER extension -> KoBigBird-large
- Critical path: Transform architecture → Apply TAPER for extended positional encoding → Fine-tune on Korean NLU benchmarks
- Design tradeoffs: Achieving state-of-the-art performance while handling longer sequences without further pretraining
- Failure signatures: If the model fails to achieve state-of-the-art performance or struggles with longer sequences, it may indicate issues with the architecture transformation or TAPER implementation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the architecture transformation by comparing the model's performance on short sequences with the original KLUE-RoBERTa-large
  2. Test the TAPER implementation by evaluating the model's performance on extended sequences and comparing it with a baseline model without TAPER
  3. Assess the overall performance by fine-tuning the model on Korean NLU benchmarks and comparing it with other state-of-the-art models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of KoBigBird-large compare to other state-of-the-art language models for Korean language understanding, specifically in tasks involving longer sequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that KoBigBird-large achieves state-of-the-art overall performance on Korean language understanding benchmarks and the best performance on document classification and question answering tasks for longer sequences against competitive baseline models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides comparisons with other models, it does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art models, making it difficult to assess the true performance of KoBigBird-large.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing KoBigBird-large with other state-of-the-art language models on Korean language understanding tasks involving longer sequences would provide a clear answer.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the temperature parameter τ on the extrapolation performance of KoBigBird-large?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the temperature parameter τ determines the degree of attenuation applied to the amplitude of the extended position embeddings (APEs) in the Tapered Absolute Positional Encoding Representations (TAPER) method. It also states that a temperature of 2.0 is used for KoBigBird-large, but suggests that the value of τ should be adjusted to achieve the best extrapolation performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of different temperature values on the extrapolation performance of KoBigBird-large.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different temperature values and measuring the extrapolation performance of KoBigBird-large would provide insights into the impact of the temperature parameter.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the distinct segment type embeddings in KoBigBird-large contribute to its performance in tasks involving multiple text inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that KoBigBird-large incorporates distinct segment type embeddings to distinguish between different types of text segments. It also states that distinguishing segment types tends to offer performance advantages in tasks involving multiple text inputs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific contributions of distinct segment type embeddings to the performance of KoBigBird-large in tasks involving multiple text inputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing the performance of KoBigBird-large with and without distinct segment type embeddings in tasks involving multiple text inputs would provide insights into their contributions to the model's performance.

## Limitations

- The claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance without further pretraining lacks direct experimental validation against models that did undergo additional Korean pretraining
- The paper does not report computational efficiency metrics, which is critical for evaluating the practical value of supporting long sequences without further pretraining
- The absence of citations (0 average) and modest field citation impact (0.483 FMR) suggest the results have not been extensively validated by the community

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic architecture transformation methodology (converting RoBERTa to BigBird) is well-established and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The TAPER method's effectiveness for extrapolation is supported by qualitative claims but lacks comprehensive ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: The claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance without further pretraining, as this is not directly validated against comparable models with Korean pretraining

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on pretraining**: Compare KoBigBird-large against an identical architecture with additional Korean pretraining to quantify the actual cost-benefit tradeoff of skipping pretraining.

2. **Long sequence efficiency analysis**: Measure and report computational overhead (FLOPs, memory usage) when processing sequences up to 4096 tokens compared to standard transformers, validating the practical benefits of the sparse attention mechanism.

3. **Cross-lingual generalization test**: Evaluate the model on multilingual benchmarks to determine whether the Korean-specific optimization creates performance tradeoffs for other languages, providing insight into the generalizability of the approach.
