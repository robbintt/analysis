- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11305

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of continual learning for neural implicit representations in videos, where traditional methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning new videos. The authors propose Progressive Fourier Neural Representation (PFNR), a novel method that adaptively finds and updates subnetworks within a supernet to encode incoming videos while preserving previously learned representations. PFNR leverages Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to identify optimal subnetworks for each video session, freezing past subnetwork weights to maintain generation quality. The method achieves impressive performance gains on UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 video sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior PSNR and MS-SSIM scores compared to strong continual learning baselines.

## Method Summary
PFNR is a continual learning method for neural implicit representations that uses a supernet architecture with adaptive subnetwork selection. The approach employs a parametric score function to identify weight importance, generating binary masks to select optimal subnetworks for each video session. During training, PFNR freezes weights from previously learned subnetworks while updating weights for new videos, enabling knowledge transfer without catastrophic forgetting. The method uses positional embeddings and Fourier features to process video frames, with layer-wise capacity constraints to control subnetwork sparsity.

## Key Results
- PFNR achieves higher average PSNR and MS-SSIM scores compared to strong continual learning baselines on UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 benchmarks
- The method successfully preserves encoding and generation quality of previously learned videos without using replay buffers
- PFNR demonstrates effective transfer learning by reusing relevant subnetwork weights across similar video sessions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PFNR identifies and updates sparse subnetworks within a supernet to encode incoming videos while preserving previously learned representations.
- Mechanism: Uses Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to find optimal subnetworks for each video session, freezing past subnetwork weights to maintain generation quality.
- Core assumption: Sparse subnetworks can preserve dense network performance while enabling efficient sequential learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PFNR leverages Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to identify optimal subnetworks for each video session, freezing past subnetwork weights to maintain generation quality."
  - [section 3.1]: "Let each weight be associated with a learnable parameter we call weight score ρ, which numerically determines the importance of the weight associated with it; that is, a weight with a higher weight score is seen as more important."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors do not directly address neural implicit representations or video sequential learning.
- Break condition: If the weight score function fails to accurately identify important weights, the subnetwork selection becomes suboptimal and catastrophic forgetting occurs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PFNR transfers learned knowledge of previously obtained subnetworks to learn the representation of the current video while keeping the weights for previous video sessions frozen.
- Mechanism: Maintains a binary mask for each session and accumulates these masks over time, allowing selective weight updates while preserving past representations.
- Core assumption: Freezing weights of previously learned subnetworks prevents interference with new video encoding while enabling knowledge transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "when learning a representation for a new video, PFNR transfers the representation of previous videos with frozen weights."
  - [section 3]: "At each training session, our PNR transfers the learned knowledge of the previously obtained subnetworks to learn the representation of the current video while keeping the past subnetwork weights intact."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors do not directly address continual learning or weight freezing strategies.
- Break condition: If the accumulated binary masks become too restrictive, the model loses the ability to adapt to new video characteristics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PFNR finds the optimal subnetwork in an online manner through joint training of the weights and structure, bypassing iterative retraining and pruning steps.
- Mechanism: Uses a parametric score function that learns to generate binary masks by directly choosing top-c percent in weight ranking scores during each training session.
- Core assumption: Joint training of weights and structure enables efficient online subnetwork discovery without the computational overhead of traditional lottery ticket approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our PNR allows overlapping subnetworks with previous sessions during training to transfer the learned representation of previous videos when relevant but keeps the weights for previous video sessions frozen."
  - [section 3.1]: "We use subnetworks instead of the dense network as solvers for two reasons: (1) Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [11] shows the existence of a competitive subnetwork that is comparable with the dense network, and (2) the subnetwork requires less capacity than dense networks, and therefore it inherently reduces the size of the expansion of the solver."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors do not directly address online subnetwork discovery or parametric score functions.
- Break condition: If the joint training process fails to converge, the model cannot find effective subnetworks for new video sessions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical foundation for finding sparse subnetworks that maintain performance, which is essential for PFNR's approach to sequential video learning.
  - Quick check question: What is the main claim of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis regarding sparse subnetworks and their relationship to dense networks?

- Concept: Continual Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting
  - Why needed here: PFNR specifically addresses the challenge of learning new videos without losing the ability to reconstruct previously learned videos.
  - Quick check question: What is catastrophic forgetting, and why is it particularly problematic for neural implicit representations of videos?

- Concept: Neural Implicit Representations (NIR)
  - Why needed here: PFNR builds upon NIR framework for video representation, extending it to handle sequential learning scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How do neural implicit representations differ from explicit representations in terms of data storage and reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Supernet backbone (NeRV architecture) -> Parametric score function for weight importance -> Binary mask generation system -> Session-specific subnetwork storage -> Weight freezing mechanism

- Critical path: Video input → Positional encoding → Weight scoring → Binary mask generation → Subnetwork selection → Training with frozen past weights → Output generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sparsity level vs. representation quality
  - Computational efficiency vs. adaptation capability
  - Memory overhead for storing binary masks vs. performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Increasing PSNR degradation on previously learned videos
  - Subnetwork size growing without corresponding performance gains
  - Training instability during weight score updates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify subnetwork identification by testing weight score function on a single video session
  2. Validate weight freezing mechanism by comparing performance with and without freezing on two sequential sessions
  3. Test catastrophic forgetting by measuring reconstruction quality on past videos after training on new sessions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of PNR scale with video session size and complexity, particularly when videos have high inter-session similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that PNR's performance is affected by input embedding resolution and that videos with higher contextual similarity might benefit from weight reuse, but does not explore the limits of scalability with large, highly correlated video datasets.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on datasets with limited session sizes (8 and 17 videos), and the authors do not analyze performance degradation or advantages when scaling to hundreds of sessions or when videos have high redundancy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing PNR on larger video benchmarks (e.g., hundreds of sessions) and measuring PSNR/MS-SSIM degradation or improvements when varying inter-session similarity would clarify scalability limits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is PNR's subnetwork selection to the layer-wise capacity ratio c, and what is the optimal strategy for dynamically adjusting c during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores fixed layer-wise capacities (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%) and notes that reinitialization improves performance, but does not investigate adaptive capacity adjustment or sensitivity analysis.
- Why unresolved: Fixed capacities may be suboptimal for different video types or training stages, and the paper does not explore whether dynamic adjustment of c could improve transfer or compression efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis showing PSNR/MS-SSIM performance across a continuous range of c values, and experiments testing adaptive capacity adjustment strategies, would clarify the impact of capacity selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can PNR's lottery ticket-based subnetwork selection be extended to non-Euclidean or multimodal video data, such as 3D point clouds or multi-view videos?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] PNR is designed for sequential video compilation using NeRV-based architectures, but the paper does not explore its applicability to other data modalities that also benefit from implicit representations.
- Why unresolved: The method's reliance on frame and session indices as positional embeddings may not generalize to data without such structured indexing, and the lottery ticket hypothesis may behave differently in non-Euclidean spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying PNR to 3D shape regression or multi-view synthesis tasks, with adapted positional embeddings and subnetwork selection criteria, would demonstrate generalizability to other modalities.

## Limitations

- The paper's claims about PFNR's effectiveness rely heavily on the successful implementation of the weight score function and subnetwork identification mechanism, which are not fully detailed in the manuscript.
- The computational overhead of maintaining and updating binary masks across multiple video sessions is not quantified, potentially impacting practical deployment.
- The evaluation focuses primarily on PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics, with limited discussion of other quality measures or real-world applicability.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core concept of using Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for subnetwork selection in sequential video learning is well-established and theoretically sound.
- Medium confidence: The experimental results showing improved PSNR and MS-SSIM scores are promising, but the evaluation scope is limited to specific benchmarks without ablation studies on critical components.
- Low confidence: The claim about avoiding replay buffers while maintaining performance is difficult to verify without detailed analysis of memory usage and long-term stability across many video sessions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each PFNR component (weight scoring, subnetwork selection, weight freezing) to overall performance gains.
2. Evaluate PFNR's performance on longer video sequences and more diverse datasets to assess scalability and generalization beyond the tested UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 benchmarks.
3. Measure and compare the computational overhead of PFNR against baseline methods, including memory usage for storing binary masks and training time per video session.
