# Batch-less stochastic gradient descent for compressive learning of deep regularization for image denoising

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03085
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03085
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: CL-SGD algorithms learn deep priors from compressed sketches with theoretical convergence guarantees and improved efficiency over grid-based methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational burden of training deep neural networks on large datasets by adapting the compressive learning framework to learn deep regularization parameters from heavily compressed database sketches. The authors propose two variants of stochastic gradient descent (CL-SGD) that dynamically generate descent directions using random discretization of the sketching operator at each iteration, enabling efficient recovery of deep regularization parameters. The method is validated on synthetic and real audio and image data, demonstrating the ability to learn deep priors for patch-based image denoising while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees.

## Method Summary
The method combines compressive learning with stochastic gradient descent to learn deep neural network parameters for image denoising from compressed data representations. The core innovation is CL-SGD, which replaces expensive grid-based discretization of the sketching operator with stochastic gradients generated through random uniform discretization at each iteration. Two variants are proposed: Naïve CL-SGD and Unbiased CL-SGD, both operating on m-dimensional sketch vectors that compress the original dataset. The approach enables learning from large datasets while significantly reducing memory requirements and computational cost compared to traditional methods.

## Key Results
- CL-SGD methods achieve theoretical convergence guarantees under specific conditions
- Learning deep priors from compressed sketches enables effective patch-based image denoising
- Random discretization approach provides computational efficiency gains over grid-based methods
- Method successfully applied to both synthetic and real audio/image datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CL-SGD dynamically generates descent directions using random discretization of the sketching operator at each iteration
- Mechanism: Instead of discretizing the forward operator S once on a large regular grid, CL-SGD uses stochastic gradients where each iteration uses a different random uniform discretization of S. This ensures descent directions are generated from information synthesized from the entire training dataset while only requiring a small number of points per iteration.
- Core assumption: Random discretization provides an unbiased or consistent approximation of the true gradient of the sketch matching functional G
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions dynamic generation of descent directions from whole training dataset; Section 3.2 describes the stochastic gradient approach with random uniform discretization

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CL-SGD methods have theoretical convergence guarantees under certain conditions
- Mechanism: Using stochastic gradient descent with diminishing or fixed step sizes under specific conditions, CL-SGD achieves convergence to a critical point of the sketch matching functional G. Theoretical analysis shows expectation of stochastic gradient direction equals true gradient of G.
- Core assumption: Sketching operator S is constructed with random frequencies and probability distribution μθ is differentiable with respect to parameters θ
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions theoretical analysis ensures convergence; Section 3.5 shows lim k→∞ inf E∥∇G(θk)∥2 2 = 0

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CL-SGD enables learning deep regularization parameters from heavily compressed databases
- Mechanism: Using compressive learning framework to sketch dataset into fixed-size representation, CL-SGD estimates regularization parameters from sketch instead of entire dataset. This reduces computational cost and memory requirements while capturing enough information for learning task.
- Core assumption: Sketch size is chosen proportional to intrinsic complexity of learning task
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes recovering deep regularization parameters from compressed sketch; Section 1 explains adapting compressive learning framework for DNN-regularized learning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Compressive Learning Framework
  - Why needed here: Allows compression of large datasets into fixed-size sketch, reducing computational burden of training deep neural networks while capturing enough information for learning task
  - Quick check question: What is the main idea behind compressive learning framework and how does it help reduce computational burden of training deep neural networks?

- Concept: Stochastic Gradient Descent
  - Why needed here: Proposed CL-SGD methods are based on stochastic gradient descent, enabling efficient optimization of regularization parameters from compressed sketch
  - Quick check question: How does stochastic gradient descent differ from standard gradient descent and what are its advantages in context of proposed CL-SGD methods?

- Concept: Deep Neural Networks as Regularizers
  - Why needed here: Proposed methods use deep neural networks as regularizers, encoding complex probability distributions and capturing prior information about data
  - Quick check question: How do deep neural networks serve as regularizers in proposed methods and what advantages do they offer compared to traditional regularizers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Compressive Learning Framework -> Sketching Operator S -> Stochastic Gradient Descent -> Deep Neural Networks -> Random Discretization

- Critical path: 1) Compress dataset into sketch using compressive learning framework 2) Initialize DNN parameters randomly 3) Perform SGD iterations with random discretization 4) Update DNN parameters using descent direction 5) Repeat until convergence

- Design tradeoffs: Higher compression ratios reduce computational cost but may lose information; larger sketch sizes capture more information but increase cost; more discretization points provide better approximations but increase per-iteration cost; larger step sizes may lead to faster convergence but can cause instability

- Failure signatures: Convergence issues may indicate problems with random discretization or step size; memory issues may indicate sketch size or discretization points are too large; poor denoising performance may indicate compression ratio is too high or sketch size is insufficient

- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement CL-SGD on small synthetic dataset with known ground truth to verify convergence and denoising performance 2) Vary compression ratio and sketch size to study impact on convergence and denoising 3) Compare CL-SGD with baseline grid-based method in computational cost, memory, and denoising performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: What is optimal design of sketching operator for DNN-based priors beyond GMM?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions design of sketching operator was heavily influenced by prior model and should be revisited for DNN-based priors
  - Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide specific method or theory for designing sketching operators tailored to DNN-based priors
  - What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new sketching operators specifically designed for DNN-based priors with theoretical analysis and experimental validation

- Open Question 2: How can acceleration methods like inertia be integrated into CL-SGD to improve learning time?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper suggests acceleration methods should be investigated to improve learning time of deep prior
  - Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore or implement acceleration methods
  - What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing acceleration methods within CL-SGD framework with comparative analysis of learning times and performance

- Open Question 3: Can denoising results with compressive approach on large image databases be compared to plug-and-play approaches using training on noisy/clean image pairs?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper suggests comparing denoising results with compressive approach to plug-and-play approaches
  - Why unresolved: Paper doesn't perform this comparison
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments applying both approaches to same large image databases with detailed comparison of denoising results

## Limitations

- Specific architectural details of deep neural network for regularization are not fully specified, impacting reproducibility
- Computational complexity of random discretization process and its relationship to convergence speed remains unclear
- Sensitivity to sketching operator parameters and compression ratios requires further investigation

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Theoretical convergence guarantees under stated conditions (follows standard stochastic optimization analysis)
- Medium Confidence: Practical denoising performance improvements (limited empirical validation on only two datasets)
- Low Confidence: Claimed computational efficiency benefits (detailed runtime comparisons with baseline methods are absent)

## Next Checks

1. Implement algorithm with varying sketching operator parameters (sketch size, discretization density) to identify sensitivity thresholds
2. Compare convergence rates and final performance against both baseline grid-based method and direct training on full datasets
3. Test method on additional datasets (different image types, larger scales) to assess generalizability beyond reported synthetic and small-scale image examples
