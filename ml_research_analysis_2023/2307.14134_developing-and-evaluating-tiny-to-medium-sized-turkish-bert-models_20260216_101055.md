# Developing and Evaluating Tiny to Medium-Sized Turkish BERT Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.14134
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14134
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Tiny to medium-sized Turkish BERT models achieve strong performance on NLP tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains

## Executive Summary
This study introduces and evaluates a series of smaller Turkish BERT models (tiny, mini, small, and medium) trained from scratch on a diverse 75GB dataset. The models demonstrate competitive performance across multiple tasks including mask prediction, sentiment analysis, news classification, and zero-shot classification. Despite their reduced size compared to standard BERT models, these architectures achieve notable results such as 65.69% top-1 accuracy in mask prediction and 67.68% in zero-shot sentiment analysis, while offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.

## Method Summary
The researchers trained BERT models with varying sizes on a 75GB Turkish dataset collected from Wikipedia, news sources, novels, OSCAR, and MC4. Using the Huggingface library, they trained tiny, mini, small, and medium-sized models with the BERTurk tokenizer, employing the Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4, batch size 128). The models were evaluated on multiple NLP tasks including mask prediction, sentiment analysis with 8491 examples, news classification with 979 articles, and zero-shot classification. Performance metrics included accuracy scores and vectorization time comparisons against the base model.

## Key Results
- Medium-sized model achieved 65.69% top-1 accuracy in mask prediction task
- Zero-shot sentiment analysis accuracy reached 67.68% across 8491 examples
- Tiny model vectorized sentences approximately 50 times faster than base model
- Models demonstrated robust performance across diverse tasks despite smaller size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Smaller BERT models can maintain strong performance while significantly reducing computational cost and memory usage.
- Mechanism: Direct training of smaller models with fewer parameters (tiny, mini, small, medium) rather than knowledge distillation allows for more efficient architectures tailored to resource constraints.
- Core assumption: Training from scratch on diverse, large datasets enables smaller models to capture essential language features without the overhead of larger models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Despite their smaller size, the models demonstrated robust performance, with the medium-sized model achieving 65.69% top-1 accuracy in mask prediction and 67.68% in zero-shot sentiment analysis.
  - [section] We trained these models on a diverse dataset encompassing over 75GB of text from multiple sources... This breadth and diversity in training data underpin our models' robust performance across several tasks.
- Break condition: If the dataset is too small or lacks diversity, the smaller models may fail to generalize, leading to poor performance despite reduced size.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Smaller models can achieve faster execution times due to reduced computational requirements.
- Mechanism: By reducing the number of parameters, attention heads, and hidden layers, the models require fewer computations per inference, leading to faster vectorization and prediction times.
- Core assumption: The trade-off between model size and performance is favorable, allowing smaller models to maintain acceptable accuracy while gaining speed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The models also showed significant computational efficiency, with the tiny model vectorizing sentences approximately 50 times faster than the base model.
  - [section] Our findings provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the NLP field, particularly within the Turkish language context.
- Break condition: If the reduction in model size is too aggressive, the loss in performance may outweigh the gains in speed, making the model impractical for real-world use.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Smaller models are practical for real-world applications where computational resources are limited.
- Mechanism: By offering a balance between efficiency and performance, smaller models can be deployed in environments with constrained hardware or where quick processing is essential.
- Core assumption: The target application can tolerate a slight decrease in accuracy in exchange for faster processing and lower resource consumption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] These findings highlight the potential of smaller models for resource-constrained applications while maintaining strong performance.
  - [section] Our results also underscore the potential of utilizing smaller models for tasks demanding quicker processing and lower memory usage.
- Break condition: If the application requires the highest possible accuracy and can afford the computational cost, the smaller models may not be suitable.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: tiny, mini, small, medium BERT models (reduced hidden sizes, attention heads, layers) -> BERTurk tokenizer -> diverse 75GB Turkish dataset -> Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4, batch_size=128) -> multiple evaluation tasks
- Critical path: Data collection and preprocessing → Model training with diverse datasets → Evaluation on multiple tasks → Performance and efficiency analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model size and performance, computational efficiency versus accuracy, and the diversity of training data
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on evaluation tasks, inability to generalize, or excessive computational time despite reduced model size
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate the tiny model on mask prediction to assess its basic capabilities
  2. Compare the mini and small models on sentiment analysis to understand the impact of model size on accuracy
  3. Test the medium model on zero-shot classification to evaluate its practical applicability in real-world scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do the performance and efficiency trade-offs of the Turkish BERT models change when applied to other less-resourced languages?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The study mentions that the findings provide insights for Turkish NLP and similar less-resourced languages, but does not explore applications to other languages.
  - Why unresolved: The study focuses exclusively on Turkish, so the applicability of the results to other languages remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying the Turkish BERT models to other less-resourced languages, with performance metrics and efficiency analyses.

- Question: What is the impact of knowledge distillation techniques on the performance and efficiency of the Turkish BERT models?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention future work to experiment with knowledge distillation methods to further balance performance and efficiency.
  - Why unresolved: The study uses direct training instead of knowledge distillation, so the potential benefits of distillation are not explored.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the current models with versions created using knowledge distillation, evaluating both performance and efficiency.

- Question: How does the performance of the Turkish BERT models vary with different dataset sizes and compositions?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses a specific dataset composition and size, but does not explore how variations in these factors affect model performance.
  - Why unresolved: The study does not investigate the impact of different dataset characteristics on the models' performance.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying dataset sizes and compositions, analyzing the resulting changes in model performance and efficiency.

## Limitations

- The dataset composition lacks detailed breakdowns of source proportions and quality metrics
- Evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy without comprehensive analysis of model robustness, calibration, or bias
- Computational efficiency claims are based on vectorization time measurements without comparison across different hardware configurations
- Models are uncased, which may limit applicability in contexts requiring case sensitivity for Turkish language processing

## Confidence

- High confidence in core finding: Smaller BERT models can maintain reasonable performance while offering computational advantages, supported by empirical results across multiple tasks
- Medium confidence in specific performance metrics: 65.69% mask prediction accuracy, 67.68% zero-shot sentiment accuracy due to limited task diversity and absence of comparison with other Turkish language models
- Medium confidence in computational efficiency claims: Speedup measurements are specific to vectorization tasks and may not fully represent end-to-end application performance

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Validation on Additional Tasks: Test the models on named entity recognition, question answering, and syntactic parsing tasks to assess generalizability beyond the current evaluation suite.

2. Real-World Deployment Benchmarking: Deploy the models on resource-constrained hardware (mobile devices, edge computing platforms) and measure actual inference latency, memory usage, and throughput under varying load conditions.

3. Ablation Study on Model Architecture: Systematically vary hidden sizes, attention heads, and layer counts to identify the optimal architecture for Turkish language processing, determining whether current model sizes represent true minima or if further compression is possible.
