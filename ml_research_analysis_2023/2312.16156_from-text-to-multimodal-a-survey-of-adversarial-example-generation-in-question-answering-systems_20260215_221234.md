# From text to multimodal: a survey of adversarial example generation in question answering systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16156
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16156
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of adversarial example generation techniques in QA systems, covering rule-based perturbations, generative models, and multimodal attacks.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of adversarial example generation techniques in question answering systems, examining both textual and multimodal contexts. The paper analyzes rule-based perturbations, generative models, and hybrid approaches for creating adversarial questions that challenge QA system robustness. It evaluates defense mechanisms, adversarial datasets, and metrics for assessing attack effectiveness, highlighting the importance of adversarial training and multimodal attacks for enhancing QA system resilience.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on adversarial example generation for QA systems, covering rule-based perturbations, generative models, and hybrid approaches. It analyzes various attack techniques including question reordering, paraphrasing, and typo-based perturbations, as well as defense mechanisms like adversarial training. The review examines both textual and multimodal QA systems, discussing evaluation metrics and future research directions for improving robustness against adversarial attacks.

## Key Results
- Rule-based perturbations (word substitutions, paraphrasing, typo-based changes) effectively generate adversarial examples while maintaining human readability
- Generative models and adversarial training can strengthen QA system robustness by exposing models to challenging inputs during training
- Multimodal adversarial attacks that manipulate both textual and visual components create more effective attacks on multimodal QA systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial examples are systematically crafted by applying subtle transformations to input questions that are nearly invisible to humans but cause QA models to produce incorrect answers.
- Mechanism: The adversarial perturbations exploit the model's learned patterns and vulnerabilities by introducing syntactic or semantic modifications, such as word substitutions, paraphrasing, or typo-based changes that maintain human readability while confusing the model's reasoning.
- Core assumption: The QA model relies on statistical patterns rather than true semantic understanding, making it susceptible to carefully crafted perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These adversarially designed inputs are constructed by applying subtle transformations to the original question, usually in a form that is invisible to humans but drastically modifies the model's generated answer."
  - [section] "These adversarial perturbations could vary from word substitutions to more complicated linguistic structures aimed at making inaccurate or biased texts, images, or videos, challenging the robustness of textual and multimodal QA systems."
- Break condition: If the QA model demonstrates true semantic understanding rather than pattern matching, or if robust defense mechanisms effectively filter or neutralize these perturbations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Generative models and adversarial training techniques can be used to create diverse adversarial examples that strengthen QA system robustness by exposing them to challenging inputs during training.
- Mechanism: By incorporating adversarial examples into the training process, QA models learn to recognize and handle deceptive inputs, improving their ability to manage unpredictable malicious data through exposure to perturbed versions of questions.
- Core assumption: Models can generalize from adversarial training examples to handle unseen adversarial attacks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The review highlights the importance of adversarial training, multimodal attacks, and human-in-the-loop approaches for enhancing QA system resilience."
  - [section] "By integrating adversarial examples into the training phase, the model learns to identify and mitigate the impact of adversarial manipulation."
- Break condition: If adversarial training leads to overfitting on specific attack patterns or if the generated adversarial examples fail to represent the diversity of real-world attacks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal adversarial attacks that manipulate both textual and visual components can create more effective attacks on QA systems that utilize multimodal inputs.
- Mechanism: These attacks modify content across multiple modalities (text, images, videos) while maintaining contextual meaning, requiring complex manipulations that impact the model's ability to integrate and reason across different input types.
- Core assumption: QA models that process multimodal inputs have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by coordinated attacks across multiple modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It analyzes defense mechanisms, evaluates adversarial datasets, and discusses various metrics for assessing attack effectiveness."
  - [section] "Multimodal adversarial attacks purpose to manipulate textual and visual components of QA systems that utilize multimodal inputs, such as text, images, and videos."
- Break condition: If multimodal QA systems develop robust cross-modal reasoning capabilities or if effective multimodal defense mechanisms are implemented.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial machine learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how adversarial examples are crafted and their impact on model performance is crucial for comprehending the survey's focus on QA system vulnerabilities.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes adversarial examples from regular noisy inputs in machine learning?

- Concept: Question Answering system architectures
  - Why needed here: The survey covers various QA approaches including traditional models, transformer-based architectures, and multimodal systems, requiring understanding of these different paradigms.
  - Quick check question: How do transformer-based QA models differ from traditional seq2seq models in handling context and questions?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and integration
  - Why needed here: The survey extends to multimodal QA systems, requiring understanding of how different modalities (text, images, audio) are processed and integrated.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary challenges in aligning and integrating data from different modalities in QA systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Adversarial Example Generation (rule-based perturbations, generative models, hybrid approaches) -> QA System Evaluation (defense mechanisms, adversarial datasets, evaluation metrics) -> Multimodal Extension (generative models, encoder-decoder architectures, hybrid approaches for multimodal QA)
- Critical path: The primary workflow involves generating adversarial examples, applying them to QA systems, evaluating system performance under attack, and implementing defense mechanisms based on evaluation results.
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing between attack effectiveness and maintaining human readability of adversarial examples, versus the computational cost of generating diverse adversarial samples and the potential for overfitting during adversarial training.
- Failure signatures: Reduced QA system accuracy without corresponding human-perceptible changes in input questions, inconsistent answers to semantically equivalent questions, and successful attacks that bypass existing defense mechanisms.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic rule-based perturbation system (e.g., word substitution, paraphrasing) on a QA dataset and measure its impact on a standard QA model's accuracy.
  2. Apply adversarial training using generated examples and compare the robustness of the trained model against both original and new adversarial attacks.
  3. Test multimodal adversarial attacks by modifying both image and text components of a VQA system and measure the system's ability to maintain accuracy across different perturbation types.

## Limitations
- Reliance on published adversarial techniques without empirical validation of their relative effectiveness across different QA architectures
- Limited practical implementation data and real-world performance metrics for multimodal adversarial attacks
- Lack of standardized evaluation protocols for human-in-the-loop approaches and comprehensive defense mechanism benchmarking

## Confidence
- **High**: The fundamental mechanisms of adversarial example generation (perturbation techniques, generative models) are well-established in the literature

- **Low**: The comparative effectiveness of different adversarial techniques in real-world scenarios and the long-term robustness of defense mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical validation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing the effectiveness of different adversarial techniques (rule-based vs. generative) across multiple QA architectures using standardized datasets
2. **Cross-modal robustness testing**: Implement and evaluate multimodal adversarial attacks on current state-of-the-art VQA systems to quantify the actual vulnerability across different perturbation types
3. **Defense mechanism benchmarking**: Create a standardized benchmark suite that evaluates the effectiveness of various defense mechanisms against a diverse set of adversarial attacks, measuring both robustness and computational overhead
