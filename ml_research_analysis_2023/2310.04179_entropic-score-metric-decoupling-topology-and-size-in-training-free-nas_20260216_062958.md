# Entropic Score metric: Decoupling Topology and Size in Training-free NAS

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04179
- Reference count: 40
- State-of-the-art accuracy on mobile-sized architectures with <1 GPU hour search time

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a training-free neural architecture search (NAS) method that decouples model topology and size optimization using two complementary metrics: Entropic Score for topology and LogSynflow for size. The approach leverages entropy-based activation pattern analysis to guide topology selection while using LogSynflow for dimensional choices. The method employs a cyclic search algorithm alternating between topology and size optimization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on mobile-sized models while requiring less than 1 GPU hour for search - a 12x improvement over previous methods.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a novel training-free NAS framework that separates topology and size optimization into two complementary metrics. Entropic Score measures activation pattern diversity through element-wise entropy, serving as a proxy for model expressivity. LogSynflow handles dimensional aspects of architecture design. The cyclic search algorithm alternates between topology-focused and size-focused phases, using evolutionary operations to refine both aspects iteratively. This decoupled approach prevents metric conflicts and leverages each metric's specialization, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification with dramatically reduced search time.

## Key Results
- ESFormer models achieve up to 80.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
- Search time reduced to <1 GPU hour (12x faster than previous fastest method)
- Outperforms both hand-designed networks and other NAS methods for mobile-sized architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Entropic Score captures model expressivity through aggregated element-wise entropy of normalized activations, serving as a topology proxy.
- Mechanism: The metric measures the diversity of activation patterns by computing entropy across activation tensors. Higher entropy indicates richer representational capacity in the network's topology.
- Core assumption: Activation entropy correlates with model expressivity and topology quality without requiring training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Entropic Score shows remarkable ability in searching for the topology of the network"
  - [section] "Entropic Score represents a measure of the network ability to represent and encode meaningful signal information"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found, but conceptually similar to entropy-based complexity measures
- Break condition: If activation distributions become too peaked or uniform, entropy becomes uninformative and loses correlation with expressivity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decoupling topology and size searches with complementary metrics (Entropic Score + LogSynflow) yields better architectures than combined scoring.
- Mechanism: Each metric specializes in its domain - Entropic Score for topological decisions, LogSynflow for dimensional choices. This specialization prevents metric conflicts and leverages their respective strengths.
- Core assumption: Metrics optimized for different architectural aspects will conflict when combined, leading to suboptimal decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a novel decoupled approach, where Entropic Score and LogSynflow are used separately yet synergistically"
  - [section] "Seamlessly combining different metrics, as done in previous works [6, 1, 4, 57], could yield to sub-optimal results"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - other works mention metric combination issues but don't explicitly test decoupling
- Break condition: If metrics have overlapping sensitivity to both topology and size, decoupling may miss global optima.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The cyclic search algorithm alternates between topology and size optimization, refining both aspects iteratively.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses multi-start evolution with Entropic Score-only initial phases, then alternates between topology and size search phases with different durations based on model size.
- Core assumption: Iterative refinement of topology and size produces better results than single-pass optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a cyclic search algorithm to separately yet synergistically search model size and topology"
  - [section] "The main search process then alternates between topology search and size search in a cyclic manner"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - cyclic approaches exist in evolution algorithms but not specifically for decoupled NAS
- Break condition: If early decisions lock the architecture into poor local optima that later phases cannot escape.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entropy and information theory basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how activation entropy measures representational capacity requires grasp of entropy concepts
  - Quick check question: What does high entropy in activation distributions indicate about information content?

- Concept: Neural architecture search fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on NAS concepts like search spaces, metrics, and optimization strategies
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between differentiable and training-free NAS approaches?

- Concept: Transformer architecture components
  - Why needed here: The ESFormer family uses hybrid Transformer designs requiring understanding of attention mechanisms and FFN blocks
  - Quick check question: How does multi-head self-attention differ from standard convolution in terms of receptive field?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Entropic Score computation module -> LogSynflow metric calculator -> Evolutionary search engine with mutation/crossover -> Search space definition (topology vs size dimensions) -> Model evaluation pipeline (MACs, parameters, accuracy)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize population with random architectures
  2. Evaluate using Entropic Score (topology) and LogSynflow (size)
  3. Apply evolutionary operations (mutation, crossover)
  4. Alternate between topology-focused and size-focused search phases
  5. Output top-performing architectures

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Entropic Score vs training-based accuracy correlation
  - Search space granularity vs computational efficiency
  - Number of evolutionary generations vs final accuracy
  - Metric specialization vs flexibility in search space

- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between metrics and final accuracy
  - Search getting stuck in local optima
  - Disproportionate computation time in one search phase
  - Inconsistent results across multiple runs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Entropic Score evaluation on a small network to verify entropy computation and normalization
  2. Test LogSynflow correlation with model size on a controlled search space
  3. Execute a single cycle of the cyclic search algorithm on a toy search space to verify alternation logic

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How would the Entropic Score metric perform on different vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or semantic segmentation?
- What is the theoretical relationship between Entropic Score and actual model accuracy, and can this relationship be generalized across different network architectures and tasks?
- How sensitive is the Entropic Score metric to different random initialization seeds, and what is the optimal number of initializations needed for reliable results?

## Limitations
- The Entropic Score's correlation with true model expressivity may degrade on datasets with different characteristics than ImageNet
- The cyclic search algorithm's effectiveness depends heavily on proper timing of alternation between topology and size phases
- The decoupling approach assumes metrics don't share overlapping sensitivities, but some architectural choices may affect both metrics simultaneously

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical formulation of Entropic Score and its implementation as element-wise entropy of normalized activations is well-defined and verifiable
- Medium confidence: The claim of state-of-the-art accuracy on mobile-sized models, as this depends on the specific search space design
- Medium confidence: The 12x improvement in search efficiency, as this is measured against a specific baseline

## Next Checks
1. Verify Entropic Score correlation with accuracy on a separate architecture benchmark (like NAS-Bench-101) to confirm the metric's general effectiveness across different search spaces
2. Test the cyclic search algorithm's sensitivity to alternation timing by running experiments with different phase durations and comparing final architecture quality
3. Implement a controlled ablation study comparing decoupled search (Entropic Score + LogSynflow) against a combined scoring approach using the same evolutionary framework to isolate the benefit of metric decoupling
