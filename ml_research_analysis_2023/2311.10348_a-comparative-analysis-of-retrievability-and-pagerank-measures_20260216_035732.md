# A Comparative Analysis of Retrievability and PageRank Measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10348
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10348
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Empirical analysis showing low overall correlation but high overlap in top-ranked documents between Retrievability and PageRank measures

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative analysis of Retrievability and PageRank measures in information retrieval, investigating their alignment in quantifying document importance and discoverability. Through empirical experimentation on WT10g and English Wikipedia datasets, the study reveals a nuanced relationship: while overall correlation remains relatively low, there is significant overlap in top-ranked documents. The analysis demonstrates that dataset size and content diversity substantially influence the relationship between these metrics, with stronger correlations observed in larger, more diverse collections.

## Method Summary
The study computes Retrievability scores using BM25 with query generation from reference [4] and PageRank values using standard iterative computation. The analysis employs Kendall's τ, Spearman's ρ, and RBO metrics to compare the two ranked lists. Datasets used include WT10g (1.69M documents) and English Wikipedia (6.58M documents). The methodology involves query generation, retrieval score computation, link graph analysis, and statistical correlation assessment across both collections.

## Key Results
- Low overall correlation between Retrievability and PageRank measures across both datasets
- Significant overlap in top-ranked documents (RBO > 0.5) despite low correlation
- Stronger correlation observed in larger Wikipedia dataset compared to smaller WT10g
- PageRank distributions show higher Gini coefficient values, indicating greater inequality than Retrievability scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PageRank and retrievability measure different aspects of document accessibility, but their overlap increases with dataset size and link density
- Mechanism: In larger, richly linked datasets, documents important in the link graph also tend to be highly retrievable due to their prominence and connectivity increasing matching diverse queries
- Core assumption: Correlation increase driven by richer link structure and diverse vocabulary in larger datasets
- Evidence anchors: Abstract showing low correlation but significant top overlap; section noting increased correlation with Wikipedia; corpus showing related work
- Break condition: Insufficient link density or query diversity prevents correlation regardless of size

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RBO metric reveals substantial top-ranked overlap despite low overall correlation
- Mechanism: RBO captures similarity in top elements where user attention concentrates, showing both metrics agree on "important" documents despite different absolute rankings
- Core assumption: User behavior focused on top results makes top overlap more meaningful than overall correlation
- Evidence anchors: Abstract showing low correlation but significant top overlap; section noting RBO > 0.5 in both datasets
- Break condition: RBO parameters overweighting lower ranks may not show observed top overlap

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gini coefficient differences indicate PageRank values are more concentrated than retrievability scores
- Mechanism: PageRank's iterative propagation from high-degree nodes creates more skewed distribution than query-based retrievability
- Core assumption: Mathematical properties of PageRank inherently produce more inequality than query-based retrievability
- Evidence anchors: Section contrasting PageRank and retrievability across datasets; section showing significant Gini coefficient differences
- Break condition: Uniform link structure or restrictive query sets may diminish Gini coefficient differences

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Retrieval System Components (query processing, document indexing, ranking)
  - Why needed here: Understanding retrievability computation requires knowledge of query generation, processing, and document ranking
  - Quick check question: What role does the rank cutoff parameter c play in retrievability score computation?

- Concept: Graph Algorithms (PageRank, link analysis)
  - Why needed here: PageRank computation requires understanding of graph theory, iterative algorithms, and link-based importance measures
  - Quick check question: How does the damping factor in PageRank affect the distribution of scores across documents?

- Concept: Statistical Correlation Measures (Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, RBO)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multiple correlation metrics to analyze the relationship between two ranked lists
  - Quick check question: When would you prefer RBO over Kendall's tau for comparing two ranked lists?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion -> Link graph construction (PageRank) -> Query generation and retrieval (retrievability) -> Correlation analysis (statistical measures)
- Critical path: Dataset preparation -> PageRank computation -> Retrievability computation -> Statistical correlation analysis
- Design tradeoffs: BM25 with default vs. tuned parameters for retrievability; computing PageRank on entire graph vs. sampled subgraphs; query generation method choice affecting retrievability scores
- Failure signatures: Missing or broken links preventing PageRank computation; query generation producing too few or too many queries; correlation measures failing due to rank ties or empty results
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute PageRank and retrievability on a small, well-linked subset to verify both metrics can be calculated and compared
  2. Vary the rank cutoff c in retrievability computation to observe its effect on Gini coefficient and correlation with PageRank
  3. Test correlation on datasets of increasing size to confirm the relationship between dataset size and metric alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the correlation between retrievability and PageRank strengthen further when analyzing datasets significantly larger than Wikipedia?
- Basis in paper: The paper observes increased correlation with larger datasets like Wikipedia, suggesting dataset size plays a role
- Why unresolved: Only two datasets tested, one of which is already quite large
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on datasets orders of magnitude larger than Wikipedia, such as the entire web graph

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different retrieval models and parameter settings affect the correlation between retrievability and PageRank?
- Basis in paper: The study used BM25 with default settings, but the impact of different retrieval models and parameters on the correlation is not explored
- Why unresolved: Controlled use of BM25 with default parameters limits generalizability
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically varying retrieval models and parameter settings across multiple datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a unified metric that combines retrievability and PageRank improve document ranking performance compared to using either metric alone?
- Basis in paper: The paper suggests future work on fusion techniques for combining the two metrics
- Why unresolved: While proposed as future work, no empirical evidence exists to support whether such fusion would improve ranking performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating fusion techniques on standard information retrieval benchmarks

## Limitations
- Only two benchmark datasets used, limiting generalizability of correlation findings
- Implementation details of query generation method from reference [4] are unspecified
- Static analysis doesn't address performance in dynamic environments with changing document collections

## Confidence
- Correlation findings: Medium confidence (empirical evidence from two datasets, but limited sample size)
- Gini coefficient observations: High confidence (directly computed and compared)
- Top overlap findings: Medium confidence (RBO metric used, but practical significance unclear)

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce correlation analysis using multiple query generation methods to assess sensitivity to query set composition
2. Test scaling relationship using additional datasets spanning wider size range (100K to 10M documents)
3. Conduct ablation studies varying BM25 parameters and rank cutoff to determine their impact on Retrievability-PageRank correlation
