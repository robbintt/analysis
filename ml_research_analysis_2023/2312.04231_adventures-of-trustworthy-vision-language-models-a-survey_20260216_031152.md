# Adventures of Trustworthy Vision-Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.04231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04231
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey examining bias, robustness, and interpretability in vision-language transformers (VLPMs)

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive examination of vision-language transformers (VLPMs) through the lens of trustworthiness, focusing on three critical aspects: bias, robustness, and interpretability. The authors analyze how VLPMs, trained on large open-web datasets, can encode harmful biases present in their training data and propose methods to measure and mitigate these biases. The paper also explores the vulnerability of VLPMs to adversarial attacks and identifies the need for new benchmarks to evaluate their robustness. Finally, the survey discusses interpretability methods, including visualization techniques and probing tasks, while highlighting the limitations of relying on attention mechanisms as reliable explanation tools.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of existing research on vision-language transformers, synthesizing findings across multiple domains including architecture, pre-training tasks, and downstream applications. The authors systematically analyze the current state of VLPMs from the perspectives of bias, robustness, and interpretability, drawing connections between these areas and identifying common challenges. The survey methodology involves reviewing recent literature, extracting key findings and methods, and organizing them into coherent themes while identifying gaps in current research and opportunities for future work.

## Key Results
- VLPMs trained on open-web datasets inherit biases present in their training data, requiring specialized methods for detection and mitigation
- The unique architectural differences between VLPMs and traditional CNNs necessitate development of VLPM-specific methods rather than extending CNN approaches
- Attention mechanisms, while commonly used for interpretation, may not reliably explain VLPM decision-making and require further validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLPMs encode biases from open-web training data due to the amalgamation of diverse, uncurated sources without oversight.
- Mechanism: Large-scale datasets used for pre-training combine multiple sources from the open web, inheriting biases present in the underlying data. These biases then propagate through the model's learned representations during training.
- Core assumption: The training data directly influences the model's behavior and can introduce biases if not carefully curated or filtered.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Many well-known VLPMs today have been trained on large heavy datasets crawled from the Internet, giving less control and oversight during data collection. This can lead the dataset to learn harmful representations."
  - [corpus]: "Average neighbor FMR=0.383" (suggests moderate relevance but limited citation evidence)
- Break condition: If rigorous data curation, bias detection, and mitigation techniques are applied during data collection and model training, the propagation of biases can be reduced or eliminated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The architecture of VLPMs differs significantly from CNNs, necessitating the development of methods specifically tailored to the VLPM architecture rather than extending approaches designed for CNNs.
- Mechanism: The self-attention mechanism in VLPMs allows for modeling long-range dependencies and has different inductive biases compared to CNNs. This fundamental architectural difference means that methods designed for CNNs may not be directly applicable or effective for VLPMs.
- Core assumption: The unique characteristics of the VLPM architecture require specialized methods for tasks like bias detection, robustness evaluation, and interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The architecture of VLPMs differs significantly from CNNs. Consequently, it's crucial to develop methods specifically tailored to the VLPM architecture rather than merely extending approaches originally designed for CNNs."
  - [corpus]: "Vision Language Transformers: A Survey" (suggests relevance but limited citation evidence)
- Break condition: If methods originally designed for CNNs can be adapted or extended to effectively handle the unique characteristics of VLPMs, the need for entirely new methods may be reduced.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Attention mechanisms are heavily relied upon for interpreting VLPMs, but their reliability as an explanation tool is questionable and requires further examination.
- Mechanism: Attention weights are used to create visual representations that provide reasoning behind the model's decisions. However, recent studies have shown that attention may not be a reliable indicator of feature importance or justification, especially in the context of vision and cross-modality.
- Core assumption: Attention mechanisms, while useful, may not always provide meaningful or accurate explanations for the model's behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Attention mechanisms are often used to explain how models make decisions by creating visual representations that provide reasoning behind these decisions. However, to better understand and interpret attention, especially in the context of vision and cross-modality, we need to thoroughly examine attention modules."
  - [corpus]: "Vision Language Transformers: A Survey" (suggests relevance but limited citation evidence)
- Break condition: If attention mechanisms can be combined with other established methods or evaluated on controlled benchmarks to demonstrate their reliability and usefulness as an explanation tool, their role in interpreting VLPMs may be strengthened.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the architecture, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks of VLPMs is crucial for analyzing their trustworthiness and developing methods to improve their reliability.
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a VLPM architecture, and how do they differ from traditional CNNs?

- Concept: Bias in Machine Learning
  - Why needed here: Bias in VLPMs can lead to unfair or harmful outcomes, making it essential to understand the sources of bias, how to measure it, and methods for mitigation.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential sources of bias in VLPMs, and how can they be detected and mitigated?

- Concept: Adversarial Robustness
  - Why needed here: VLPMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their reliability and security. Understanding robustness and developing methods to improve it is crucial for building trustworthy VLPMs.
  - Quick check question: How do adversarial attacks affect VLPMs, and what methods can be used to improve their robustness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vision-Language Raw Input Data -> Vision-Language Representation -> Vision-Language Interaction Model -> Vision-Language Representation
- Critical path: Pre-training (large-scale dataset) → Fine-tuning (task-specific dataset) → Inference (task-specific head)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-stream vs. dual-stream architectures: Early fusion vs. separate processing of modalities
  - Vision feature extraction: Region features vs. grid features vs. patch projection
  - Pre-training tasks: Cross-modal masked language modeling, masked region modeling, image-text matching, contrastive learning
- Failure signatures:
  - Biases in the model's outputs or decision-making process
  - Vulnerability to adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution samples
  - Lack of interpretability or explainability in the model's reasoning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the model's performance on a bias detection benchmark to identify potential biases in the learned representations.
  2. Test the model's robustness against adversarial attacks using a white-box or black-box attack method.
  3. Apply interpretability techniques, such as attention visualization or probing tasks, to understand the model's decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop standardized frameworks for evaluating bias, robustness, and interpretability across diverse vision-language transformer architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of specific architecture-based methods and standard protocols for evaluating VLPMs in terms of bias, robustness, and interpretability.
- Why unresolved: Different VLPM architectures have unique characteristics, making it challenging to create a one-size-fits-all evaluation framework. The paper emphasizes the need for better generalized methods that can evaluate not only between CNNs and transformers but also between different architecture formats within transformers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a standardized evaluation framework that can be applied consistently across various VLPM architectures, demonstrating improved comparability and fairness in assessments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can attention mechanisms be reliably used as explanations for decisions made by vision-language transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the heavy reliance on attention mechanisms for interpreting VLPMs but also highlights recent studies questioning the reliability of attention as a justification tool, especially in cross-modal contexts.
- Why unresolved: While attention is a key component of transformer models, its interpretability and reliability as an explanation tool remain contentious. The paper suggests that attention needs to be evaluated from multiple angles, including its impact on model performance, its role in explaining decisions, and its role in understanding the model's reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Rigorous empirical studies comparing attention-based explanations with other explanation methods across various VLPM tasks and architectures, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of attention as an interpretability tool.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop pre-training strategies that mitigate bias while maintaining or improving task-aware performance in vision-language transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of large datasets in pre-training VLPMs and their potential as sources of bias. It suggests that better and more focused pre-training strategies could reduce training costs while improving task-aware performance and mitigating bias.
- Why unresolved: Pre-training is crucial for VLPMs but can introduce biases from large, diverse datasets. Balancing the need for extensive pre-training with the goal of reducing bias and improving performance remains a challenge. The paper suggests that strategic pre-training could be a way forward.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of pre-training strategies that demonstrably reduce bias in VLPMs while maintaining or improving their performance on downstream tasks, supported by empirical studies across multiple architectures and datasets.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of attention mechanism reliability as interpretation tools specifically for VLPMs
- Theoretical discussion of adversarial robustness without concrete benchmarks or attack success rates
- Reliance on general observations about bias propagation rather than specific empirical demonstrations

## Confidence

- High confidence: The architectural differences between VLPMs and CNNs necessitating specialized methods
- Medium confidence: The mechanisms of bias propagation from training data to model outputs
- Low confidence: The reliability of attention mechanisms as interpretation tools for VLPMs

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies measuring specific bias types (gender, racial, cultural) in popular VLPMs using standardized bias detection benchmarks, comparing results against traditional computer vision models.

2. Design controlled experiments testing whether attention visualizations in VLPMs actually correspond to human-interpretable features, using ablation studies and feature importance comparisons.

3. Develop and validate VLPM-specific adversarial attack methods, establishing baseline robustness metrics and evaluating the effectiveness of proposed defense mechanisms against these attacks.
