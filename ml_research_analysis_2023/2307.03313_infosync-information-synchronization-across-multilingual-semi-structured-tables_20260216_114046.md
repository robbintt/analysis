# InfoSync: Information Synchronization across Multilingual Semi-structured Tables

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.03313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03313
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 87.91 F1-score for alignment, 77.28% acceptance rate for Wikipedia edits

## Executive Summary
INFO SYNC introduces a new task and dataset for synchronizing information across multilingual Wikipedia Infoboxes. The proposed two-step method first aligns rows across language pairs using corpus statistics and gradually relaxed matching constraints, then updates missing or outdated information via a rule-based approach. The alignment method achieves 87.91 F1-score on English–non-English pairs, and the updation system obtains 77.28% acceptance rate when deployed for human-assisted Wikipedia edits.

## Method Summary
INFO SYNC introduces a two-step method for synchronizing information across multilingual semi-structured Wikipedia Infoboxes. First, it aligns rows across language pairs using a five-module approach that incrementally relaxes matching constraints: corpus-based (using translation embeddings), key-only (removes value context), key-value bidirectional (adds context with strict constraints), key-value unidirectional (relaxes directionality), and multi-key (allows one-to-many mappings). Second, it updates missing or outdated information using nine rule-based strategies that prioritize information flow based on resource availability, table size, temporal trends, and rarity of keys. The method leverages XInfoTabS for translating non-English tables to English and uses MPNet embeddings for similarity computations.

## Key Results
- Alignment F1-score of 87.91 on English↔non-English pairs
- 77.28% acceptance rate for Wikipedia edits generated by the updation system
- Rule-based updation accounts for ~64% of updates, with Row Transfer being the most frequent operation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The incremental relaxation of matching constraints across five modules progressively captures more aligned row pairs without requiring cross-lingual links or manual feature engineering. Each module increases the scope of potential matches—corpus-based uses translation embeddings, key-only removes value context, key-value bidirectional adds context back with strict constraints, key-value unidirectional relaxes directionality, and multi-key allows one-to-many mappings. This incremental design allows the system to start with conservative matches and broaden as needed. If similarity thresholds are set too low, spurious matches dominate and precision drops sharply, as seen in the error analysis where corpus-based module is worst for Tx ↔ Ty.

### Mechanism 2
Rule-based updation transfers missing or outdated information effectively by leveraging resource asymmetry and structural cues across language variants. Nine logical rules prioritize information flow based on factors like resource availability (HR→LR), table size (#Rows), temporal trends (Time-based, Trends), and rarity of keys. The sequential application ensures high-priority updates are handled first, reducing the risk of overwriting newer data. If the source table contains outdated or erroneous information, the update propagates inaccuracies, which could lead to rejections in human-assisted edits.

### Mechanism 3
Translating non-English tables to English before alignment leverages high-quality monolingual embeddings while avoiding the sparsity of multilingual embeddings. XInfoTabS is used to translate all non-English tables to English; MPNet embeddings are then applied to the translated keys and values. This ensures that similarity computations are performed in a consistent linguistic space with strong semantic representation. If the translation system introduces errors—especially for implicit or culturally specific content—the alignment accuracy will degrade despite strong embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity over multilingual sentence embeddings
  - Why needed here: Forms the basis for matching keys and key-value pairs across languages in each alignment module.
  - Quick check question: What threshold would you set if you observed precision falling below 0.8 in the corpus-based module?

- Concept: Incremental constraint relaxation in algorithm design
  - Why needed here: Allows the system to balance precision and recall without requiring cross-lingual supervision.
  - Quick check question: Why does adding the key-only module improve recall more than precision in the corpus-based baseline?

- Concept: Rule-based logic for structured data updates
  - Why needed here: Provides deterministic, interpretable updates that can be verified and accepted by Wikipedia editors.
  - Quick check question: Which rule would you apply first if a table pair has mismatched timestamps for the same event?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input tables → XInfoTabS translation → MPNet embedding → Five alignment modules (M1–M5) → Rule-based updater → Human-assisted edit pipeline
- Critical path: Translation → Corpus-based alignment → Key-only alignment → Key-value bidirectional → Update generation → Wikipedia submission
- Design tradeoffs: Translation to English trades off multilingual expressiveness for embedding quality; rule-based updates trade automation for interpretability and acceptance.
- Failure signatures: Low precision in corpus-based module → excessive false positives; high rejection rate in Wikipedia edits → outdated or incorrect source data; sparse coverage → missing rows in multi-key module.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run alignment on a small balanced sample of English↔Non-English pairs; check precision/recall per module.
  2. Apply updation rules to gold-aligned pairs; measure edit acceptance rate manually.
  3. Compare performance with and without translation step to validate embedding choice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How well does the two-step table synchronization method generalize beyond Wikipedia Infoboxes to other semi-structured data domains like technical, legal, or medical tables? The paper mentions this as a future direction, stating "We want to test whether the strategy applies to technical, scientific, legal, and medical domain tables." The method was only evaluated on Wikipedia Infoboxes. Its performance on other types of semi-structured data is unknown. Evaluating the method on datasets of tables from technical, legal, medical, or other domains would show its generalization capability.

### Open Question 2
Can the table synchronization method be extended to align and update information across multiple languages simultaneously rather than just pairwise? Currently, independent language pairs are considered for (bi) alignment. However, multiple languages can be utilized jointly for (multi) alignment. The method currently only considers pairwise language alignments and updates. Joint multi-way alignment and updates are not implemented. Implementing and evaluating a multi-way alignment and update method would demonstrate if it improves synchronization quality over pairwise methods.

### Open Question 3
How can the table synchronization method be extended to jointly align and update information in a single step rather than the current two-step approach? Even while our current approach is accurate, it employs a two-step process for synchronization, namely alignment followed by updating. We want to create rapid approaches aligning and updating in a single step. The method uses separate alignment and update steps. Integrating them into a single step is not explored. Developing and evaluating a joint alignment and update method would show if it can improve synchronization speed and/or quality compared to the two-step approach.

## Limitations

- The method demonstrates strong performance on English→non-English alignment but does not evaluate alignment quality for non-English→English pairs.
- The rule-based updation system relies on resource availability assumptions (HR→LR) that may not hold for all language pairs.
- The human-assisted Wikipedia edit acceptance rate of 77.28% lacks detail on rejection reasons, making it difficult to assess error sources.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The corpus-based alignment mechanism's effectiveness, supported by strong F1-scores (87.91) and clear architectural progression through the five modules.

**Medium confidence**: The rule-based updation system's generalizability, as it depends heavily on the assumption that higher-resource tables contain more accurate information.

**Low confidence**: The translation quality's impact on downstream alignment, as the paper assumes XInfoTabS translations are sufficient without providing quantitative validation.

## Next Checks

1. Run the full alignment pipeline on non-English→English pairs and compare F1-scores to the reported English→non-English results to assess symmetry and potential translation-induced bias.

2. Manually examine 50 rejected Wikipedia edits to categorize failure modes (alignment errors, translation issues, guideline violations) and compute the distribution to identify the primary bottleneck.

3. Re-run the updation system with randomized rule ordering on a held-out test set and measure changes in acceptance rate to determine whether the current priority ranking is optimal or arbitrary.
