## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Interpretable Learning Effective Dynamics (iLED) framework, a novel approach for modeling high-dimensional multiscale systems that combines deep learning with interpretable dynamical models. The method addresses the challenge of capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics in systems described by high-dimensional partial differential equations while maintaining interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework learns a reduced-order representation of the system state and propagates it using a model that consists of linear dynamics plus a nonlinear closure term, grounded in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Koopman operator theory.

## Method Summary
The iLED framework combines nonlinear dimensionality reduction using autoencoders with a theoretically grounded dynamical model inspired by the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Koopman operator theory. The method learns a reduced-order representation of the system state through an autoencoder, then propagates this reduced state using a model that consists of linear dynamics plus a nonlinear closure term. The framework is trained end-to-end using reconstruction and forecast losses with semi-implicit Runge-Kutta integration and adjoint scheme. The approach is demonstrated on three benchmark problems: the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Navier-Stokes equations for flow around a cylinder.

## Key Results
- iLED accurately predicts system behavior while providing interpretable insights into underlying dynamics
- For FitzHugh-Nagumo and cylinder flow cases, the learned linear operator dominates dynamics, enabling quasi-linear modeling of nonlinear PDEs
- Achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art RNN approaches while providing added benefit of interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The iLED framework achieves interpretable dynamics by combining linear operators with nonlinear closure terms grounded in Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Koopman operator theory.
- Mechanism: The method learns a reduced-order representation through nonlinear autoencoders, then propagates this reduced state using a model consisting of linear dynamics (Aθ) plus a nonlinear closure term (Ψθ,1). This structure directly connects to the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, where the linear operator represents observed dynamics and the nonlinear term captures memory effects from the orthogonal subspace.
- Core assumption: The effective dynamics of high-dimensional multiscale systems can be accurately represented by linear dynamics plus a nonlinear closure term, and this decomposition is both mathematically justified and practically learnable from data.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The iLED framework is motivated by Mori-Zwanzig and Koopman operator theory; [section 2.3] The iLED architecture is based on both the Mori-Zwanzig formalism as well as KO theory; [corpus] Found 25 related papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The iLED framework transforms high-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs into quasi-linear ODEs in the latent space.
- Mechanism: By learning an optimal nonlinear manifold through autoencoders, the method identifies a reduced-dimensional space where the dynamics are predominantly linear. The nonlinear encoder projects the high-dimensional state onto this manifold, where the learned linear operator captures the primary dynamics, while a smaller nonlinear correction term handles deviations from perfect linearity.
- Core assumption: For many multiscale systems, the effective dynamics in an appropriately chosen latent space are predominantly linear, even when the original PDEs are highly nonlinear.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.4] We have shown that the iLED model was able to transform high dimensional, nonlinear PDEs into quasi-linear Ordinary Differential Equations; [section 3.1] Due to the optimal latent dimension dz = 2, the linear part of the iLED dynamics exhibits a single natural frequency; [section 3.3] The results underline the effectiveness of the iLED architecture.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The iLED framework provides interpretability while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art RNN approaches.
- Mechanism: By grounding the latent dynamics in established theoretical frameworks (Mori-Zwanzig and Koopman theory), the model provides a clear mathematical interpretation of each component. The linear operator Aθ represents the observed dynamics, while the nonlinear closure captures memory effects. This structure allows for analysis of the learned dynamics (e.g., examining eigenvalues of Aθ) while achieving similar predictive performance to black-box RNN models.
- Core assumption: Theoretical grounding in established dynamical systems theory can be combined with modern deep learning techniques to create models that are both accurate and interpretable.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The iLED framework offers comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art recurrent neural network-based approaches while providing the added benefit of interpretability; [section 3] Our results show that the iLED framework can generate accurate predictions and obtain interpretable dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction through autoencoders
  - Why needed here: The high-dimensional multiscale systems described by PDEs have intrinsic low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for efficient modeling and simulation.
  - Quick check question: How does the autoencoder architecture ensure that the latent space captures the essential dynamics rather than just the static structure of the system?

- Concept: Mori-Zwanzig formalism and memory effects
  - Why needed here: The framework needs to account for the fact that reduced-order models of multiscale systems often exhibit memory effects due to the interaction between resolved and unresolved scales.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between the memory integral in the iLED model and the orthogonal dynamics in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism?

- Concept: Koopman operator theory and linear representations of nonlinear dynamics
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages the Koopman operator's ability to provide a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics, which is essential for creating interpretable models.
  - Quick check question: How does the assumption of a finite-dimensional Koopman operator affect the choice of latent dimension in the iLED framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder E -> Linear operator Aθ + Nonlinear closure Ψθ,1,Ψθ,2 -> Decoder D
- Critical path: 1. Train autoencoder (E, D) to find optimal latent representation; 2. Initialize iLED dynamics with learned latent space; 3. Train iLED model by integrating the coupled ODE system (16); 4. Validate by comparing reconstructed and forecasted states
- Design tradeoffs: Latent dimension (dz): Higher values increase expressiveness but reduce interpretability and increase computational cost; Memory dimension (dh): Must be large enough to capture memory effects but small enough to avoid overfitting; Linear vs. nonlinear balance: More weight on linear dynamics increases interpretability but may reduce accuracy for complex systems
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction performance indicates inadequate latent space representation; Unstable integration suggests issues with linear operator parameterization or memory initialization; Discrepancy between linear and nonlinear contributions may indicate incorrect latent dimension choice
- First 3 experiments: 1. Implement and test the autoencoder on a simple 1D system (e.g., FitzHugh-Nagumo) to verify reconstruction capability; 2. Train the iLED dynamics on a system with known linear dynamics (e.g., cylinder flow at Re=100) to validate the linear operator learning; 3. Test the full pipeline on a chaotic system (e.g., Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) to evaluate the balance between linear and nonlinear contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for selecting the latent dimension dz in the iLED framework, especially for high-dimensional problems where statistical analysis of attractor dimension is computationally expensive?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.4 discusses the challenge of choosing dz and mentions both grid search and statistical analysis approaches
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that hyperparameter optimization can be expensive for high-dimensional problems, and while statistical methods exist, they may not be practical in all cases
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of different dimension selection strategies on a range of problems, demonstrating both computational efficiency and modeling accuracy

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the iLED framework perform when applied to partially observed systems where the full state cannot be directly measured?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions this as a potential future application in the conclusion, but doesn't explore it experimentally
- Why unresolved: The current iLED architecture assumes complete state observations are available for training and prediction
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying iLED to partially observed systems, demonstrating reconstruction and prediction performance compared to fully observed cases

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical justification for the choice of the nonlinear closure term structure in the iLED architecture, beyond the empirical results shown in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.3.1 mentions that the infinite-dimensional operators need to be approximated, but the choice of specific neural network architectures is presented as a practical decision
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates good performance with the chosen architecture, a deeper theoretical understanding of why this specific structure works well is lacking
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis connecting the neural network architecture to properties of the underlying infinite-dimensional operators, potentially through approximation theory or functional analysis

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends critically on the appropriate choice of latent dimension, which requires empirical determination
- The framework assumes that the effective dynamics can be separated into linear and nonlinear components, which may not hold for systems with strong non-Markovian behavior
- While the paper demonstrates success on three specific problems, broader validation across diverse multiscale systems is needed to establish generalizability

## Confidence

- High confidence: The theoretical foundation connecting iLED to Mori-Zwanzig and Koopman operator theory is well-established
- Medium confidence: The empirical results showing accurate predictions and interpretable dynamics on benchmark problems
- Medium confidence: The claim of comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art RNN approaches

## Next Checks

1. **Latent dimension sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the latent dimension dz across the benchmark problems and quantify the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy, forecast accuracy, and interpretability of the learned linear dynamics.

2. **Memory term importance**: Conduct ablation studies by removing the memory term h or setting its dimension to zero, and measure the impact on forecast accuracy for each benchmark problem, particularly for the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

3. **Cross-validation on unseen initial conditions**: Test the trained iLED models on initial conditions not seen during training (e.g., different phases of the FitzHugh-Nagumo limit cycle or different perturbation patterns for the cylinder flow) to assess generalization capability beyond the training distribution.
