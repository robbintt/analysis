## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: PerMod successfully modifies typical voices along perceptual axes using a conditional latent diffusion model but struggles with atypical voices

## Executive Summary
This paper presents PerMod, a conditional latent diffusion model for perceptually grounded voice modification. The system takes an input voice and a perceptual qualities vector to generate modified speech along seven perceptual axes: resonance, weight, breathiness, strain, pitch, loudness, and roughness. Trained on VCTK and PVQD datasets with a random forest regressor modeling perceptual qualities, PerMod demonstrates effective modification of typical voices with low RMSE while maintaining or improving audio quality compared to baseline methods. However, the model shows limited performance on atypical voices, suggesting the need for expanded labeled data in this domain.

## Method Summary
PerMod employs a conditional latent diffusion model architecture that modifies speech along perceptual axes. The system uses D-DSVAE to extract speaker and content embeddings from mel-spectrograms, then applies a random forest regressor trained on the PVQD dataset to generate perceptual quality vectors. The diffusion model learns to modify the input voice embedding based on these perceptual qualities, with HiFi-GAN used for final audio reconstruction. The model is pretrained on VCTK for 100 epochs, then fine-tuned on PVQD using LoRA for 2000 epochs to adapt to atypical voices.

## Key Results
- PerMod achieves low RMSE for modifying typical voices along perceptual qualities
- Audio quality is maintained or improved compared to baseline voice conversion methods
- Model struggles significantly with atypical voices despite LoRA fine-tuning attempts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PerMod modifies typical voices effectively by leveraging a conditional latent diffusion model trained on perceptual quality vectors from a Random Forest regressor.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model learns to map an input voice embedding and a target perceptual qualities vector into a latent space, generating a modified voice that approximates the target perceptual characteristics.
- Core assumption: The Random Forest regressor can accurately model the mapping from audio features to perceptual qualities, and the diffusion model can learn this mapping in latent space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PerMod generates a new voice corresponding to specific perceptual modifications"
  - [section] "We model the perceptual qualities of a given audio segment via a random forest regressor"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations found, but related work on diffusion models for audio generation exists (e.g., PixelGen, Latent Guidance in Diffusion Models)
- Break condition: If the Random Forest regressor's accuracy degrades significantly or the diffusion model fails to learn the perceptual mapping in latent space.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PerMod maintains or improves audio quality compared to baseline voice conversion methods.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model is trained to generate high-quality audio by reconstructing the target voice from a noisy latent representation, guided by the perceptual qualities vector.
- Core assumption: The HiFi-GAN vocoder used for audio reconstruction is capable of producing high-quality speech from the generated latent representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model's audio quality is maintained or improved compared to baseline methods"
  - [section] "For the V ocoder, we utilize HiFi-GAN, which is frequently applied for high quality speech synthesis"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations found, but HiFi-GAN is a well-established vocoder in the literature
- Break condition: If the HiFi-GAN vocoder fails to produce high-quality speech from the generated latent representations or the diffusion model introduces artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PerMod struggles with atypical voices due to the limited availability of labeled data for such voices.
- Mechanism: The model is trained primarily on typical voices from the VCTK dataset, and the Random Forest regressor is trained on the PVQD dataset, which may not adequately represent the perceptual space of atypical voices.
- Core assumption: The perceptual qualities of atypical voices are significantly different from those of typical voices, and the current training data is insufficient to capture this difference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PerMod produces voices with the desired perceptual qualities for typical voices, but performs poorly on atypical voices"
  - [section] "We hypothesize that there is a straightforward way to improve the generalizability of PerMod... expanding the amount of labeled data available, particularly the amount of data on atypical voices"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations found, but the need for more diverse training data is a common theme in machine learning
- Break condition: If the perceptual qualities of atypical voices are not significantly different from those of typical voices, or if the current training data is sufficient to capture the differences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their application to audio generation
  - Why needed here: PerMod is a conditional latent diffusion model that generates modified voices based on perceptual qualities vectors
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a standard diffusion model and a conditional diffusion model?

- Concept: Perceptual voice qualities and their modeling
  - Why needed here: PerMod relies on a Random Forest regressor to model the mapping from audio features to perceptual qualities
  - Quick check question: What are the seven perceptual qualities used in PerMod, and how are they defined?

- Concept: Voice conversion and disentanglement of speaker and content information
  - Why needed here: PerMod uses a D-DSVAE encoder/decoder to disentangle speaker and content information, allowing for the modification of perceptual qualities while preserving the content
  - Quick check question: How does the D-DSVAE encoder/decoder achieve disentanglement of speaker and content information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input voice → D-DSVAE encoder → Conditional latent diffusion model → D-DSVAE decoder → HiFi-GAN vocoder → Output voice
- Critical path: Input voice → D-DSVAE encoder → Conditional latent diffusion model → D-DSVAE decoder → HiFi-GAN vocoder → Output voice
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a Random Forest regressor to model perceptual qualities vs. directly training a model on labeled data
  - Using a conditional latent diffusion model vs. other generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs)
  - Using HiFi-GAN as the vocoder vs. other vocoder options
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor quality output audio
  - Inability to modify certain perceptual qualities
  - Failure to generalize to atypical voices
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the Random Forest regressor's accuracy on the PVQD dataset
  2. Assess the diffusion model's ability to modify typical voices using the VCTK dataset
  3. Test the system's performance on atypical voices using the PVQD dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can non-experts reliably label perceptual voice qualities in atypical voices, and how does their accuracy compare to experts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that non-experts can label perceptual qualities with remarkable accuracy, but notes a bias towards labeling atypical voices as more atypical than they actually are, with an ensemble error roughly twice that of experts.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests non-experts can label atypical voices, it doesn't provide specific data on their accuracy or a direct comparison with expert labeling for atypical voices.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing non-expert and expert labeling accuracy on a dataset of atypical voices, with statistical analysis of the differences in labeling accuracy and bias.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would expanding the PVQD dataset with more labeled samples of atypical voices improve PerMod's performance on atypical voice modification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that expanding the amount of labeled data, particularly for atypical voices, would improve PerMod's generalizability to atypical voices.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't test this hypothesis by actually expanding the dataset and retraining PerMod.
- What evidence would resolve it: Retraining PerMod on an expanded PVQD dataset with more atypical voice samples and evaluating its performance on atypical voice modification tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there alternative fine-tuning or conditional generation approaches that could improve PerMod's ability to modify atypical voices compared to LoRA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that LoRA fine-tuning doesn't significantly improve PerMod's ability to modify atypical voices and suggest exploring other approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests LoRA for fine-tuning and doesn't explore other potential methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and comparing the performance of alternative fine-tuning methods (e.g., full fine-tuning, prompt tuning) or conditional generation approaches on atypical voice modification tasks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does sentence-level labeling of perceptual qualities in VCTK affect PerMod's performance compared to the current random forest model's predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hypothesize that additional sentence-level labels from clinicians and voice teachers for VCTK would improve PerMod's performance, but they leave this to future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a random forest model to predict perceptual qualities for VCTK, without incorporating actual human-labeled data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Collecting sentence-level perceptual quality labels for VCTK from experts and retraining PerMod with this labeled data, then comparing its performance to the current model.

### Open Question 5
- Question: Can PerMod be extended to handle a larger set of perceptual qualities beyond the seven currently used, and how would this affect its performance and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the space of possible perceptual voice qualities is vast and they limit their scope to seven qualities, implying potential for expansion.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the addition of more perceptual qualities or their impact on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanding the perceptual quality set, retraining PerMod, and evaluating its performance and interpretability on both typical and atypical voices with the additional qualities.

## Limitations

- Limited performance on atypical voices due to data scarcity, with minimal improvements from LoRA fine-tuning
- Cannot modify speaker identity or voice type (e.g., male to female transformation)
- Significant computational requirements for pretraining and fine-tuning phases

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The model successfully modifies typical voices along the seven perceptual dimensions as evidenced by low RMSE scores and MOS ratings comparable to or better than baseline methods. The architectural choices (D-DSVAE for disentanglement, HiFi-GAN for vocoding) are well-established in the literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The model's performance on atypical voices is demonstrably worse, but the extent to which this is due to data limitations versus model architecture remains uncertain. The limited improvements from LoRA fine-tuning suggest architectural constraints beyond just data scarcity.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the perceptual quality regressor across different voice types and recording conditions is not thoroughly evaluated. The model's behavior with perturbed or out-of-distribution perceptual quality vectors is only briefly explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset evaluation**: Test the perceptual quality regressor on voices from datasets other than PVQD and VCTK to assess generalizability beyond the training distribution.

2. **Atypical voice augmentation**: Experiment with data augmentation techniques (pitch shifting, time stretching, noise injection) on typical voices to simulate atypical characteristics and evaluate whether this improves performance on genuine atypical voices.

3. **Perceptual quality dimension importance**: Conduct ablation studies to determine which of the seven perceptual dimensions contribute most to successful voice modification, and whether the model can be simplified by focusing on a subset of these qualities.
