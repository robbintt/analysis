# Adversarial Client Detection via Non-parametric Subspace Monitoring in the Internet of Federated Things

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.01537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01537
- Reference count: 7
- This paper proposes FedRR, a non-parametric monitoring method for detecting adversarial clients in federated learning (FL) systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical security challenge of detecting adversarial clients in federated learning systems. The authors propose FedRR, a non-parametric monitoring approach that leverages the low-rank structure of transmitted model updates to enable effective anomaly detection. By transforming high-dimensional gradient updates into rank statistics and applying a non-parametric CUSUM procedure, FedRR can detect various attack types while maintaining controlled false alarm rates.

## Method Summary
FedRR monitors adversarial clients in federated learning by exploiting the low-rank structure of model updates. The method operates in two phases: Phase I estimates the principal subspace of updates from initial communication rounds, then Phase II transforms residuals (updates orthogonal to this subspace) into rank statistics. These ranks are mapped to approximately standard normal variables, and a non-parametric CUSUM procedure aggregates local monitoring statistics across clients. Detection occurs when the maximum CUSUM statistic exceeds a threshold, with the threshold calibrated to achieve a target average run length under normal conditions.

## Key Results
- FedRR achieves effective detection of label flipping, poisoning samples, and model poisoning attacks on MNIST
- The method maintains controlled false alarm rates while providing quick detection of adversarial behavior
- Performance exceeds benchmark methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to attack variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FedRR transforms high-dimensional gradient updates into low-rank residuals, enabling effective anomaly detection.
- Mechanism: The method projects transmitted updates onto a low-dimensional subspace estimated from initial rounds, then monitors the norm of residuals perpendicular to this subspace. This exploits the low-rank structure of updates in over-parameterized models.
- Core assumption: The linear subspace spanned by model parameter updates in federated learning is low-dimensional due to model redundancy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "FedRR leverages the low-rank features of the transmitted parameter updates generated by federated learning"
  - [section]: "the linear subspace spanned by the model parameter updates...is typically low dimensional"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim
- Break condition: If the model is not over-parameterized or the updates don't follow the low-rank assumption, the residual monitoring becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rank statistics provide a non-parametric probabilistic model for monitoring federated learning updates.
- Mechanism: The method converts residual magnitudes into rank statistics across clients, then transforms these ranks into approximately standard normal variables using inverse CDF mapping. This creates a distribution-free monitoring framework.
- Core assumption: When clients have homogeneous data distributions, the rank statistics follow a uniform distribution across all permutations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Theorem 1...˜rt is a uniform random permutation"
  - [abstract]: "leverages an effective non-parametric statistics approach: transforming the transmitted updates after the dimensional reduction into rank statistics"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim
- Break condition: If client data distributions become heterogeneous or the rank transformation assumption fails, the monitoring statistics lose their validity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CUSUM-based aggregation of local monitoring statistics enables quick detection of adversarial clients.
- Mechanism: Each client's rank-transformed monitoring statistic is tracked with a CUSUM procedure, and the maximum across all clients triggers detection when exceeding threshold. This aggregates local evidence for faster decision-making.
- Core assumption: The CUSUM procedure with rank statistics can detect upward shifts in adversarial behavior with controlled false alarm rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we apply the CUSUM procedure on the sequences {Z(k)t, t = T0 + 1, T0 + 2, ...}"
  - [abstract]: "uses a non-parametric CUSUM procedure to aggregate local monitoring statistics"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim
- Break condition: If the attack magnitude is too small relative to normal variation, or if multiple clients are adversarial simultaneously, detection performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Why needed here: PCA extracts the low-dimensional subspace from initial updates to enable dimensionality reduction.
  - Quick check question: How does PCA identify the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data?

- Concept: Non-parametric statistics
  - Why needed here: Rank statistics provide distribution-free monitoring without requiring probabilistic assumptions about update distributions.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using rank statistics over parametric methods in this context?

- Concept: Sequential hypothesis testing (CUSUM)
  - Why needed here: CUSUM procedures accumulate evidence over time to detect shifts quickly while controlling false alarm rates.
  - Quick check question: How does the reference value in CUSUM affect the balance between detection speed and false alarm rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Server coordinates all communication; Clients perform local updates; Monitoring module transforms and analyzes updates; PCA module estimates subspace; Detection module triggers alerts.
- Critical path: Server receives updates → Compute residuals → Transform to ranks → Apply CUSUM → Compare to threshold → Trigger detection if needed.
- Design tradeoffs: Dimensionality reduction improves efficiency but may lose attack signals; Non-parametric approach avoids distributional assumptions but may be less powerful than parametric alternatives.
- Failure signatures: False negatives occur when attack magnitude is small; False positives happen during initial subspace estimation; Detection delay increases with large threshold settings.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate low-rank property on synthetic federated learning updates
  2. Test rank transformation under varying client data distributions
  3. Evaluate detection performance under different attack magnitudes and frequencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of start-up communication rounds T0 for the FedRR procedure in heterogeneous federated learning environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The number of start-up communication rounds T0. For the optimal performance of the threat detection procedure, T0 should be selected large enough to adequately describe the space of the updates so as to estimate the principal components bj's accurately. However, no adversarial attack should occur in the start-up period."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that the selection of T0 is crucial but does not provide a method for determining it, especially in heterogeneous environments where data distributions across clients may differ.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing FedRR performance with different T0 values across various heterogeneous datasets would provide insights into the optimal selection criteria.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the FedRR approach be extended to handle missing data when not all clients participate in each communication round?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "Many IoFT systems in practice only have a few clients participating in each communication round. Under this setup, the ideas of FedRR are still applicable, while the ranks of those clients not participating in the updates should be regarded as missing data, and the monitoring approach needs to be modified."
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that the approach can be adapted but does not provide a concrete method for handling missing ranks or integrating this into the existing framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the FedRR algorithm that explicitly handles missing data, along with empirical validation on real-world datasets with varying client participation rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the FedRR method be adapted to effectively detect adversarial clients in non-IID federated learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "A major limitation of FedRR is the assumptions of homogeneous clients. When the clients are heterogeneous, the idea of the FedRR can be adapted if we can find appropriate summary statistics of the updates that satisfy the following conditions: (1) they decrease the dimension of the clients' updates, (2) they have the same distribution for all clients when they are not under attack, and (3) they have significantly different distributions when attacks occur."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the limitation of assuming homogeneous clients but does not provide a solution or methodology for adapting the approach to non-IID scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a modified FedRR algorithm that incorporates client-specific summary statistics or distribution models, tested on diverse non-IID federated learning datasets.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends critically on the low-rank assumption of model updates, which may not hold for all neural network architectures
- Experimental validation is limited to the MNIST dataset with a single CNN architecture, raising questions about generalizability
- The non-parametric approach may be less powerful than parametric alternatives when distributional assumptions can be verified

## Confidence

- Low-rank subspace monitoring effectiveness: Medium - supported by theoretical claims but limited empirical validation
- Non-parametric rank statistics validity: Medium - theoretical foundation exists but practical robustness untested
- CUSUM detection performance: Medium - demonstrated on synthetic attacks but real-world attack scenarios unexamined

## Next Checks

1. Test FedRR on non-image datasets (e.g., tabular or sequential data) to assess generalizability beyond MNIST
2. Evaluate detection performance under simultaneous multiple-client attacks to examine system robustness
3. Compare detection delay and false alarm rates against parametric alternatives when distributional assumptions can be verified
