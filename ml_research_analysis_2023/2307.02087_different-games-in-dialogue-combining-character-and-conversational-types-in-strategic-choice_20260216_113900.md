# Different Games in Dialogue: Combining character and conversational types in strategic choice

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.02087
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02087
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Proposes a formal model integrating conversational type and character type (Big Five) for strategic dialogue move selection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formal mathematical framework for strategic dialogue move selection that integrates two key factors: conversational type (the domain-specific structure of the interaction) and character type (personality traits modeled via the Big Five framework). The model scores each possible dialogue move based on its conformity with the conversational type and its alignment with both participants' personality traits, then uses a weighted combination of these factors with dynamic weights to produce probabilistic move selection. An illustrative bakery transaction example demonstrates how different parameter settings lead to different dialogue strategies.

## Method Summary
The method defines a scoring function that combines three factors: self-character type similarity, other-character type similarity, and conversational type conformity, each weighted by coefficients (α, β, γ). Character type vectors are derived from Big Five personality dimensions, and move vectors represent possible dialogue moves. The scoring function uses cosine similarity to measure affinity between move vectors and character vectors, combines these with weighted conformity scores, and applies softmax to convert scores to probabilities. A self-monitoring mechanism dynamically adjusts the weights based on contextual factors during dialogue.

## Key Results
- The model provides a quantitative framework for combining personality traits and conversational structure in dialogue move selection
- Illustrative examples show how different parameter settings (e.g., prioritizing character alignment vs. conversational conformity) produce distinct dialogue strategies
- The framework connects linguistic pragmatics with game-theoretic strategic reasoning in dialogue

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining Big Five personality traits with conversational type structure enables more nuanced dialogue move selection.
- Mechanism: The model creates a weighted scoring function that integrates self-character type, other-character type, and conversational type conformity for each possible dialogue move.
- Core assumption: Both personality traits and conversational structure are independent but interacting factors that influence strategic dialogue choice.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We present a method of calculating the decision making process for selecting dialogue moves that combines character type and conversational type." [section 3.1] "By calculating the similarity between the χ and ci, we obtain the extent to which a given dialogue move can fit either the self character type or the other character type." [corpus] Weak - no direct citations of Big Five + conversational type integration
- Break condition: If personality trait predictions are unreliable or conversational type classification fails, the weighted combination would produce poor move scores.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-monitoring adjusts the relative importance of character type vs. conversational type factors during dialogue.
- Mechanism: A SelfMonitor component dynamically sets weights (α, β, γ) for each factor based on the current dialogue context and information state.
- Core assumption: Speakers continuously evaluate and adjust their strategic choices based on contextual factors.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.4.1] "Levelt (1993) proposed that speakers monitors themselves while speaking. In other words, individuals have a self-criticism mechanism enabling them to reflect on their behaviors, emotions and speaking." [section 3.4.2] "α, β, γ are in fact estimated by the SelfMonitor based on information deriving from the information state." [corpus] Weak - self-monitoring in dialogue is mentioned but not deeply explored in related work
- Break condition: If self-monitoring becomes too dominant or too weak, the model may either ignore important contextual factors or become too rigid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Probabilistic conversational type estimation allows for uncertainty in dialogue classification.
- Mechanism: The model maintains a probability distribution over possible conversational types that updates via Bayesian inference as dialogue progresses.
- Core assumption: Dialogue participants often cannot perfectly identify the conversational type they are engaged in.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] "Wong (2018) argued that clarification interactions provide data showing that interlocutors can be uncertain about the conversational type that classifies the interaction they are in" [section 3.2] "Following probabilistic TTR theory (Cooper et al., 2014), we assume that the DP has a probabilistic conversational type in the private part of information state and this can be updated during dialogue by Bayesian inference." [corpus] Moderate - STAMPsy and other works show uncertainty in dialogue type classification
- Break condition: If conversational type probabilities become too diffuse, move selection becomes essentially random; if too peaked, the model may miss important contextual cues.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Big Five personality traits and their dimensional representation
  - Why needed here: The model uses these traits as one of the core factors for dialogue move scoring
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what each of the five traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) represents and how they might influence dialogue behavior?

- Concept: Probabilistic type theory and information states
  - Why needed here: The model uses probabilistic type theory to represent uncertainty about conversational types and character types
  - Quick check question: How does a probabilistic type differ from a classical type, and why is this distinction important for modeling dialogue uncertainty?

- Concept: Cosine similarity for vector comparison
  - Why needed here: The model uses cosine similarity to measure affinity between character type vectors and move vectors
  - Quick check question: What does a cosine similarity of 1, 0, or -1 indicate about the relationship between two vectors, and why is this measure appropriate for comparing personality traits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Character type vectors (χ_s, χ_o) -> Move vectors (c_i) -> Similarity calculation -> Scoring function ρ -> Softmax -> Move probabilities
- Critical path: 1. Character type vectors are generated or received 2. Move vectors are generated for each possible dialogue move 3. SelfMonitor sets weights (α, β, γ) 4. Scoring function ρ calculates affinity scores 5. Softmax converts scores to probabilities 6. Dialogue move is selected based on probabilities
- Design tradeoffs: Fixed vs. dynamic weight adjustment: Static weights are simpler but less adaptive; dynamic weights require more complex self-monitoring logic; Vector dimensionality: Higher dimensionality allows more nuanced personality representation but increases computational cost; Move space granularity: Finer-grained move spaces provide more options but require more computational resources
- Failure signatures: Uniform probability distribution across moves (indicates weights or scoring not working); Extreme probabilities (indicates weights not balancing properly); Character type vectors not affecting scores (indicates similarity calculation issue); Conversational type probability not updating (indicates Bayesian update mechanism failure)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Test with fixed weights and simple character types to verify basic scoring mechanism works 2. Test self-monitoring weight adjustment with controlled character type changes 3. Test Bayesian conversational type updating with simulated dialogue progression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the model dynamically update conversational type probabilities during an ongoing dialogue?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "in practice this assessment can change as the dialogue unfolds" but leaves this for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current model uses a static probability estimate for conversational type that doesn't account for how this probability should be updated based on new dialogue moves.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mechanism showing how Bayesian updating of conversational type probabilities could be integrated into the model, tested on dialogue corpora showing type shifts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can move conformity be automatically detected and quantified across different conversational types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions this requires "automatic detection of research based on different types of dialogue" and suggests modifying existing NLG evaluation models.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides qualitative descriptions of move conformity (e.g., "high conformity" or "incongruity") without a concrete computational method for automatic detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational method that automatically scores moves for conformity with conversational types, validated against human judgments of move appropriateness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle cases where character type estimation changes significantly during dialogue?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "inference about each other's character types is also in flux during conversations" but doesn't specify how the model should handle such changes.
- Why unresolved: The model assumes relatively stable character type estimates, but real conversations may involve significant character type reassessment that could affect strategic choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing showing how the model's predictions change when character type estimates are dynamically updated versus kept static, using dialogue corpora with personality annotations.

## Limitations
- The self-monitoring mechanism's practical implementation details are not specified, leaving a critical component undefined
- The model's computational complexity for maintaining probabilistic conversational type distributions may limit real-time scalability
- The illustrative examples demonstrate the concept but lack validation with real dialogue data

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Big Five + conversational type integration): Medium - theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation
- Mechanism 2 (self-monitoring weight adjustment): Low - described conceptually but implementation details missing
- Mechanism 3 (probabilistic conversational type estimation): Medium - supported by probabilistic type theory literature but not demonstrated in practice

## Next Checks
1. Implement the self-monitoring weight adjustment mechanism and test whether it can recover known personality-conversation interactions from controlled dialogue data
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency of maintaining probabilistic conversational type distributions in real-time dialogue systems
3. Conduct ablation studies removing either the personality or conversational components to quantify their relative contributions to move selection accuracy
