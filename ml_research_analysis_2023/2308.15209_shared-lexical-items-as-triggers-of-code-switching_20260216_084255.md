# Shared Lexical Items as Triggers of Code Switching

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.15209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15209
- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Shared lexical items (proper names and culturally specific terms) are strongly associated with code-switching, with this association diminishing as distance from the switch point increases.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the triggering hypothesis in code-switching, proposing that certain shared lexical items (proper names and culturally specific terms) can trigger language switches. The authors conduct a large-scale analysis across five datasets in three language pairs (English–Arabic, English–German, English–Spanish) using both spoken and written data. They define shared lexical items based on their origin and examine their association with code-switching points. The primary results confirm three key hypotheses: shared lexical items are strongly associated with code-switching, this association is stronger when the shared item precedes the switch point, and the association diminishes as the distance between the shared item and the switch point increases.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes five datasets in three language pairs, using token-level language ID annotations to identify code-switching points and shared lexical items. Shared items are classified by origin (shared-English, shared-Arabic/German/Spanish, or shared-Other). The authors use Fisher's exact test and relative switching propensity to measure the association between shared items and code-switching events at various distances (1-6 tokens) from the switch point. They examine both the presence/absence of shared items and their temporal ordering relative to code-switching points. The analysis focuses on alternational code-switching, excluding insertional switches.

## Key Results
- Shared lexical items are strongly associated with code-switching across all datasets (relative switching propensity ranges from 2.266 to 18.261)
- The association between shared items and code-switching is stronger when shared items precede rather than follow or are adjacent to the switch point
- The association diminishes as the distance between the shared item and the switch point increases
- No evidence that shared items from one language are more likely to trigger switches to that language

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shared lexical items trigger code-switching because they exist in the mental lexicon of both languages.
- Mechanism: When a bilingual speaker encounters a shared lexical item (e.g., a proper name or culturally specific term), the lexical item is simultaneously accessible in both language systems. This shared accessibility creates a cognitive "trigger" that increases the likelihood of switching to the language in which the shared item is more deeply rooted or contextually appropriate.
- Core assumption: Shared lexical items are genuinely shared between mental lexicons rather than being separate translation equivalents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "words that are assumed to reside in a mental lexicon shared by both languages indeed trigger code-switching"
  - [section 3.1]: Definition of shared items as "named entities in one language that are not translated to the other, and consequently have a similar form in both languages"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors show related work on code-switching but no direct evidence for mental lexicon sharing
- Break condition: If shared items are actually processed as separate lexical entries rather than truly shared representations, the triggering effect would diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The strength of the triggering effect depends on the distance between the shared item and the code-switching point.
- Mechanism: Cognitive activation from the shared lexical item decays over time and distance. When the shared item is close to the switch point (within 1-2 tokens), the activation is strong and the probability of switching is high. As distance increases, activation decays and the triggering effect weakens.
- Core assumption: Lexical activation follows a decay function with distance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the tendency to switch depends on the distance of the trigger from the switch point"
  - [section 6]: "the association between shared items and CS diminishes as the shared item is farther away from the CS point"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on code-switching but no direct evidence for distance-dependent activation
- Break condition: If other cognitive factors (like topic or syntactic constraints) override distance effects, the monotonic decay pattern would break.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Shared items that precede the code-switching point have stronger triggering effects than those that follow or are adjacent.
- Mechanism: Preceding shared items have more time to activate their associated language system, creating a stronger preparatory effect. Items that follow the switch or are adjacent may not have sufficient time to influence the upcoming switch decision.
- Core assumption: Language selection is a gradual process influenced by preceding lexical items.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the tendency to switch depends on... whether the trigger precedes or succeeds the switch"
  - [section 6]: "the solid lines are always above the dashed lines" indicating stronger association when shared items precede CS points
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on code-switching but no direct evidence for temporal ordering effects
- Break condition: If language selection is primarily driven by syntactic or pragmatic factors rather than lexical activation, the temporal ordering effect would disappear.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fisher's exact test and relative switching propensity
  - Why needed here: To statistically measure the association between shared items and code-switching events, accounting for the fact that shared items are rare and the data is sparse
  - Quick check question: What does a relative switching propensity of 2.266 mean in practical terms?

- Concept: Definition and classification of code-switching types (alternational vs. insertional)
  - Why needed here: To properly identify which code-switching events should be included in the analysis and which should be excluded as insertional switches
  - Quick check question: Why did the authors exclude the second switch in insertional code-switching cases?

- Concept: Language ID annotation and shared item tagging
  - Why needed here: To accurately identify which tokens are shared items and their language origins, which is critical for the analysis
  - Quick check question: How does the context-dependent nature of shared item tagging affect the analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection and preprocessing -> Language identification -> Shared item classification -> CS point identification -> Statistical analysis -> Result interpretation
- Critical path: Data → Language ID → Shared item classification → CS point identification → Statistical analysis → Result interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Using automated classifiers (with lower recall for shared items) vs. manual annotation for scalability; focusing on alternational switches only vs. including insertional switches
- Failure signatures: High p-values (non-significant results) would indicate no association between shared items and CS; non-monotonic distance effects would contradict the activation decay hypothesis
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Fisher's exact test on a small subset of data to verify the statistical methodology works correctly
  2. Test the distance decay hypothesis by plotting relative switching propensity against distance for a single dataset
  3. Compare results between spoken (Bangor-Miami) and written (Reddit/Twitter) datasets to identify modality effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the status of English as a minority vs. dominant language in German-speaking countries specifically affect the patterns of code-switching between English and German compared to other language pairs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the Denglisch corpus differs from other datasets and suggest that the status of English and German in German-speaking countries may result in a unique pattern of code-switching.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this difference but does not provide a detailed comparative analysis of how language status specifically influences code-switching patterns across different language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of code-switching patterns in communities where English is a minority language versus a dominant language, controlling for other sociolinguistic factors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the cognitive mechanisms underlying the observation that shared items originating in L1 are not more likely to trigger switches from L2 to L1 than vice versa?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors were unable to confirm their fourth hypothesis that shared items from L1 would more strongly trigger switches to L1, and suggest this might be due to noise in the data or rooted in cognitive-theoretical explanations of bilingualism.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the cognitive mechanisms in depth or provide experimental evidence to support or refute the theoretical explanations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Psycholinguistic experiments measuring language activation and suppression in bilinguals when encountering shared lexical items from different languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do written and spoken code-switching differ in terms of the triggering hypothesis, and what factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that previous work focused on spoken language and extend the investigation to written data, observing that findings in written code-switching differ somewhat from those in speech, but do not provide a detailed comparative analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct a systematic comparison of the triggering hypothesis across written and spoken modalities, leaving open questions about the influence of modality on code-switching patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale comparative studies of code-switching in both spoken and written corpora, analyzing the role of shared lexical items in triggering switches across modalities.

## Limitations

- The definition of shared lexical items relies heavily on origin-based classification, which may not fully capture the cognitive reality of how these items are processed in bilingual mental lexicons
- The analysis focuses primarily on alternational code-switching and excludes insertional switches, potentially missing important patterns
- The distance decay effect, while observed, shows variability across datasets and language pairs, suggesting other factors may also play significant roles in triggering code-switching

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The general association between shared lexical items and code-switching (Hypothesis 1) is well-supported across all five datasets and three language pairs, with consistently low p-values and relative switching propensities significantly above 1.0.

**Medium Confidence**: The distance decay hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) shows the expected pattern but with notable variation across datasets. The monotonic decrease in relative switching propensity with distance is observed but not perfectly consistent.

**Low Confidence**: The temporal ordering effect (Hypothesis 3) shows weaker and more inconsistent support. The lack of support for Hypothesis 4 (language-specific triggering) is based on non-significant results, which could also reflect insufficient statistical power.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation of shared item classification**: Re-analyze a subset of the data using manual annotation of shared items (rather than automatic classification) to assess how classification errors might affect the reported associations and statistical significance.

2. **Syntactic constraint analysis**: Examine whether the observed distance decay pattern persists when controlling for syntactic boundaries (e.g., clause or sentence boundaries), which could provide evidence for whether lexical activation or syntactic constraints primarily drive the triggering effect.

3. **Individual variation study**: Analyze code-switching patterns separately for different speakers/writers within the datasets to determine whether the shared item triggering effect varies significantly across individuals, which would suggest individual differences in bilingual language processing.
