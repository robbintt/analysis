# Streaming data recovery via Bayesian tensor train decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.12148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12148
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: SPTT achieves lower relative errors than state-of-the-art Bayesian tensor decomposition methods on streaming data with high-order, incomplete, and noisy properties

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SPTT, a streaming probabilistic tensor train decomposition method that leverages streaming variational Bayes to recover streaming data with high-order, incomplete, and noisy properties. The method models TT cores using Gaussian distributions and introduces a probabilistic TT model with streaming variational inference for posterior inference. Experiments demonstrate that SPTT outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian tensor decomposition methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
SPTT implements a streaming variational Bayes framework for Bayesian tensor train decomposition. The algorithm models TT cores as Gaussian distributions and performs incremental posterior updates as new data batches arrive, without revisiting past data. The method introduces a probabilistic TT model with streaming variational inference for posterior inference, where each fiber in the TT cores is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with mean and variance parameters that are updated via Bayesian inference as new data arrives.

## Key Results
- SPTT achieves lower relative errors than POST and BASS-Tucker on synthetic data with varying noise levels
- The method demonstrates competitive performance on real-world datasets (Alog, Carphone, Flow injection) compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian tensor decomposition methods
- Computational complexity is O(SDL^4) and space complexity is O(NDL^2), where D is tensor order, N is length in each order, S is batch size, and L is rank

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Streaming variational Bayes (SVI) enables incremental posterior updates for tensor train (TT) cores without revisiting past data. The algorithm recursively approximates the posterior distribution over TT cores by factorizing it into independent components, updating each component as new data batches arrive. The factorized variational posterior assumption (independence of TT core entries) holds sufficiently for accurate approximation.

### Mechanism 2
Gaussian priors on TT cores with shared variance parameters enable uncertainty quantification in streaming tensor decomposition. Each fiber in the TT cores is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with mean and variance parameters that are updated via Bayesian inference as new data arrives. The Gaussian prior assumption adequately captures the true distribution of TT core entries.

### Mechanism 3
The TT format's storage efficiency (O(NDR²) vs O(N^D)) makes it suitable for high-order tensor streaming applications. By decomposing high-order tensors into a sequence of three-way factor tensors, the algorithm achieves linear scaling in tensor order rather than exponential scaling. The TT ranks remain sufficiently small to maintain the storage advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor Train (TT) decomposition
  - Why needed here: The TT format is the core representation method that enables efficient storage and computation for high-order tensors in the streaming setting
  - Quick check question: What is the storage complexity of a tensor in TT format versus standard format for a D-dimensional tensor with dimension N in each mode?

- Concept: Streaming Variational Inference (SVI)
  - Why needed here: SVI provides the framework for updating posterior distributions incrementally as new data batches arrive, without revisiting past data
  - Quick check question: How does SVI differ from batch variational inference in terms of computational requirements and memory usage?

- Concept: Bayesian Tensor Decomposition
  - Why needed here: The Bayesian framework provides uncertainty quantification and regularization through priors, which is essential for handling incomplete and noisy streaming data
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using a Bayesian approach versus a point-estimate approach for tensor decomposition in the presence of noise?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data batch -> SVI update equations -> TT core posterior update -> Output updated TT cores -> Repeat for next batch
- Critical path: Data batch → SVI update equations → TT core posterior update → Output updated TT cores → Repeat for next batch
- Design tradeoffs: The factorized variational posterior assumption enables computational efficiency but may sacrifice some accuracy; the Gaussian prior assumption provides regularization but may not capture all data distributions
- Failure signatures: Degraded reconstruction error on test data, increasing relative error between iterations, sensitivity to initial rank selection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on synthetic tensor with known TT decomposition and varying noise levels to validate relative error performance
  2. Compare against POST and BASS-Tucker on real-world datasets with different batch sizes to assess streaming efficiency
  3. Vary TT ranks and batch sizes to find the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed SPTT algorithm perform compared to non-streaming tensor decomposition methods when the streaming data has high-order tensor structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that existing Bayesian streaming tensor decomposition algorithms may not be suitable for high-order tensor structures, and the proposed SPTT algorithm aims to address this issue
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between SPTT and non-streaming tensor decomposition methods for high-order tensor structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing SPTT with non-streaming tensor decomposition methods on high-order tensor structures would provide insights into the performance of SPTT in such scenarios

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the initial rank (R) on the performance of SPTT for different real-world datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the effect of different initial ranks (R) on the performance of SPTT for synthetic and real-world datasets, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of R on the performance for different real-world datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the initial rank (R) on the performance of SPTT for different real-world datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying initial ranks (R) for different real-world datasets and analyzing the performance of SPTT would provide insights into the impact of R on the performance for different datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational complexity of SPTT scale with the size of the streaming data and the tensor order?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the computational complexity of SPTT is O(SDL^4) and the space complexity is O(NDL^2), but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the computational complexity scales with the size of the streaming data and the tensor order
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the scaling of computational complexity with the size of the streaming data and the tensor order
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying sizes of streaming data and tensor orders and analyzing the computational complexity of SPTT would provide insights into the scaling of computational complexity with the size of the streaming data and the tensor order

## Limitations
- The empirical validation scope is limited to synthetic data and three real-world datasets
- Theoretical guarantees about convergence rates and approximation quality are not fully proven
- Scalability claims for extremely high-dimensional tensors (D > 10) are not thoroughly validated

## Confidence

High confidence: The core mechanism of streaming variational inference for TT decomposition is well-established, with clear mathematical formulation and algorithmic steps

Medium confidence: The Gaussian prior assumption's adequacy for diverse data distributions, as this is validated only on specific datasets

Low confidence: The scalability claims for extremely high-dimensional tensors (D > 10) and the impact of rank growth on storage efficiency

## Next Checks

1. Test the algorithm on additional high-order tensor datasets with varying correlation structures to assess the Gaussian prior assumption's robustness
2. Conduct runtime and memory usage profiling for tensor orders D > 10 to verify the claimed O(NDL^4) and O(NDL^2) complexity bounds
3. Implement a theoretical analysis of the variational approximation error bounds, particularly for the factorized posterior assumption in high-rank scenarios
