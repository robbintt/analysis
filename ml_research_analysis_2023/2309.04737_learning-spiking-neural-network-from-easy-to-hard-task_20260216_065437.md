# Learning Spiking Neural Network from Easy to Hard task

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.04737
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04737
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CL-SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on six datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture) by incorporating curriculum learning into spiking neural networks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CL-SNN, a spiking neural network that incorporates curriculum learning to enhance biological plausibility. Unlike traditional SNNs that treat all samples equally, CL-SNN dynamically adjusts the importance of samples based on their difficulty using a confidence-aware loss function. This approach mimics human learning by focusing on easier samples first and gradually introducing more challenging ones. The model was evaluated on six datasets, including static image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST) and neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on all of them. The confidence-aware loss function automatically adjusts the contribution of each sample during training, improving the model's ability to generalize. This is the first attempt to enhance the biological plausibility of SNNs by introducing curriculum learning, making the model learn more like humans.

## Method Summary
CL-SNN uses a spiking neural network architecture with PLIF (Parameterized Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) neurons that have learnable membrane time constants. The model employs surrogate gradient backpropagation with an arctan-based surrogate function for training. The core innovation is a confidence-aware loss function that automatically learns sample difficulty weights during training, allowing the model to focus on easier samples first and gradually incorporate harder ones. The confidence weights are derived from the initial cross-entropy loss of each sample, with easier samples (smaller initial loss) receiving higher weights and harder samples (larger initial loss) receiving lower weights. This creates an implicit curriculum learning effect without requiring predefined scheduling.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all six tested datasets: MNIST (99.71%), CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS-Gesture
- Confidence-aware loss automatically adjusts sample contributions during training, improving generalization
- Dynamic confidence threshold performs better on CIFAR10, N-MNIST, and DVS-Gesture, while fixed threshold works better on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10-DVS
- PLIF neurons with learnable membrane time constants provide improved fitting capabilities compared to fixed-time-constant models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Confidence-aware loss automatically learns sample difficulty weights during training, mimicking curriculum learning without predefined scheduling.
- **Mechanism:** The model computes initial loss `li` for each sample and transforms it into a confidence weight `ωi` using a learnable exponential function. Samples with smaller `li` (easier samples) receive higher `ωi`, amplifying their gradient contribution, while samples with larger `li` (harder samples) receive lower `ωi`, reducing their impact on parameter updates.
- **Core assumption:** Sample difficulty can be inferred from its instantaneous training loss, and adjusting loss contributions based on these confidences accelerates convergence and improves generalization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "By learning the confidence of different samples, the model reduces the contribution of difficult samples to parameter optimization automatically."
  - [section] "The confidence-aware loss function automatically adjusts the contribution of each sample during training, improving the model's ability to generalize."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; the most relevant neighbor papers focus on different aspects (e.g., synaptic penalties, graph neural networks) rather than curriculum learning.
- **Break condition:** If the initial loss `li` does not correlate well with sample difficulty (e.g., noisy labels or ambiguous samples), the confidence weights may misguide training and hurt performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Spiking neural networks with learnable membrane time constants (PLIF) provide greater expressive power than fixed-time-constant models, enabling better fitting of curriculum-induced learning patterns.
- **Mechanism:** PLIF neurons replace the fixed membrane time constant `τm` with a learnable parameter `a`, where `τm = 1/g(a)` and `g(a)` is a sigmoid. This allows the neuron to adapt its temporal integration dynamics during training, improving the network's ability to encode temporal patterns in neuromorphic datasets.
- **Core assumption:** Temporal dynamics of spiking neurons are crucial for learning in neuromorphic datasets, and adapting these dynamics improves classification accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "To avoid errors caused by τm in the denominator during the learning process, Eq.(6) is rewritten as follows: Qt = (1 − g(a)) Vt−1 + g(a) (Vr + It)"
  - [section] "The PLIF model, which simultaneously learns τm and synaptic weights during training, resulting in improved fitting capabilities."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence linking PLIF with curriculum learning, but adjacent work on SNNs supports the benefit of learnable dynamics.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset does not require fine-grained temporal processing (e.g., static images), learnable `τm` may overfit and provide no benefit over fixed constants.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Gradually increasing the proportion of harder samples during training aligns with biological plausibility, improving model generalization.
- **Mechanism:** As training progresses, the model's ability to fit difficult samples improves, causing their confidence weights `ωi` to increase toward 1. This dynamic adjustment implicitly controls the difficulty distribution fed to the model, ensuring early epochs focus on easier samples and later epochs include harder ones.
- **Core assumption:** The natural progression from simple to complex knowledge acquisition is beneficial for both biological and artificial neural networks, and this can be emulated by adjusting loss contributions rather than explicit data reordering.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Starting with small and simple concepts, and gradually introducing complex and difficult concepts is the natural process of human learning."
  - [section] "The sequential learning process of CL mimics the natural way humans acquire new knowledge."
  - [corpus] No strong corpus evidence; the only related neighbor paper on curriculum design for SNNs is a recent preprint and lacks citation data.
- **Break condition:** If the model cannot effectively learn from easier samples in early stages, the confidence weighting may stagnate and fail to expose the network to necessary hard examples, leading to poor final accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and the LIF neuron model
  - **Why needed here:** The paper builds CL-SNN specifically for spiking neural networks; understanding LIF neuron dynamics and surrogate gradient training is essential to grasp how confidence-aware loss is integrated.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the LIF neuron update its membrane potential, and why is the surrogate gradient necessary for training SNNs?

- **Concept:** Curriculum Learning (CL) principles
  - **Why needed here:** CL-SNN is fundamentally an SNN augmented with curriculum learning; knowing how difficulty estimation and scheduling work explains the role of confidence-aware loss.
  - **Quick check question:** What distinguishes pre-defined CL from automatic CL, and how does confidence-aware loss achieve automatic CL without explicit scheduling?

- **Concept:** Confidence-aware loss and its mathematical formulation
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation relies on transforming initial loss into sample confidences; understanding the Lambert W function and the regularization term is crucial for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the confidence weight `ωi` scale the contribution of each sample during backpropagation, and what role does the threshold `ϵ` play?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input layer → Convolutional blocks (128c3-BN-MP2) → Dropout → Fully connected (FC2048) → Dropout → Output (FC100-AP10)
- **Critical path:**
  1. Forward pass through PLIF layers
  2. Compute initial cross-entropy loss `li` for each sample
  3. Derive confidence weights `ωi` from `li`
  4. Combine into final loss with confidence scaling
  5. Backward pass using surrogate gradient
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using learnable membrane time constants increases parameter count and training time but improves temporal modeling.
  - Confidence-aware loss adds negligible overhead but requires careful tuning of `λ` and `ϵ`.
  - Fixed vs. dynamic `ϵ` offers a tradeoff between stability and adaptability.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training loss plateaus early: confidence weights may be stuck at extremes (all samples too easy or too hard).
  - Overfitting on small datasets: excessive confidence on a few samples can dominate updates.
  - Poor generalization on neuromorphic data: fixed `τm` may be insufficient for temporal dynamics.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train CL-SNN on MNIST with fixed `ϵ` and monitor confidence evolution per sample difficulty.
  2. Compare fixed vs. dynamic `ϵ` on CIFAR10 to observe impact on accuracy and convergence speed.
  3. Evaluate PLIF vs. standard LIF on N-MNIST to quantify benefit of learnable membrane time constants.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the difficulty threshold ϵ in confidence-aware loss be optimally determined for different types of datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions two approaches for defining the threshold ϵ: using a fixed constant (ϵ = log(c) where c is the number of classes) or using a dynamic threshold (the average initial loss of each batch). The paper states that "experimental results show that dynamic ϵ performs better on CIFAR10, N-MNIST and DVS-Geature datasets. And for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS, the fixed ϵ achieves better performance."
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that the choice between fixed and dynamic ϵ affects performance differently depending on the dataset, but it doesn't provide a clear method for determining which approach to use for a new, unseen dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that tests the fixed and dynamic approaches across a wide variety of datasets and identifies patterns or rules for when each approach is most effective. Alternatively, a method that can automatically determine the best threshold-setting strategy based on dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term implications of using curriculum learning in spiking neural networks for energy efficiency and computational speed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the biological plausibility of CL-SNN and its improved performance on various datasets. However, it doesn't explicitly discuss the implications for energy efficiency and computational speed, which are key advantages of spiking neural networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the accuracy and biological plausibility of CL-SNN, but doesn't explore how the curriculum learning approach affects the inherent energy efficiency and speed advantages of spiking neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring the energy consumption and computational speed of CL-SNN versus traditional SNNs across various tasks and datasets, especially in real-world applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the confidence-aware loss function in CL-SNN compare to other curriculum learning strategies in terms of model generalization and robustness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the confidence-aware loss function as a way to implement curriculum learning in SNNs. It mentions that "Confidence-aware loss is a convenient method" but also notes that "the choice of difficulty threshold and the measurement of difficulty are not unique."
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't compare the confidence-aware loss approach to other curriculum learning strategies, either in traditional ANNs or other SNN models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of the confidence-aware loss approach with other curriculum learning strategies across multiple tasks, datasets, and model architectures, evaluating both performance and robustness to adversarial examples or noisy data.

## Limitations

- The correlation between instantaneous training loss and true sample difficulty may not hold across all datasets, particularly those with ambiguous or noisy labels
- Learnable membrane time constants provide measurable benefit for neuromorphic datasets but may overfit on static image tasks where fixed constants suffice
- Biological plausibility claims remain largely theoretical without direct measurement or validation of biological mechanisms

## Confidence

- **Confidence-aware loss mechanism:** Medium - well-specified mathematically but correlation between loss and difficulty may vary by dataset
- **Learnable membrane time constants:** Medium - supported for neuromorphic datasets but lacks validation for static image tasks
- **Biological plausibility claims:** Low - compelling but theoretical without direct biological validation

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset sensitivity test:** Evaluate CL-SNN on datasets with known label noise to determine if confidence-aware loss misguides training when initial loss doesn't correlate with true difficulty.

2. **Ablation on learnable τm:** Compare CL-SNN with fixed membrane time constants across all six datasets to quantify where learnable dynamics provide measurable benefit versus overfitting.

3. **Dynamic vs fixed confidence threshold:** Systematically compare fixed and dynamic ε values on CIFAR10 to measure the tradeoff between training stability and adaptive confidence weighting.
