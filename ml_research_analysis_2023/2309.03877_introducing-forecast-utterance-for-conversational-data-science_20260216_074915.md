# Introducing "Forecast Utterance" for Conversational Data Science

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.03877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03877
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Forecast Utterance Understanding is framed as an unsupervised slot-filling problem solved using zero-shot Entity Extraction and Question-Answering techniques, achieving MRR scores between 0.6-0.9 on three datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "Forecast Utterance," a novel approach enabling users to express forecasting goals through natural language in conversational data science applications. The authors frame the task as an unsupervised slot-filling problem where each slot corresponds to a specific aspect of the prediction task. To address the challenge of real-time, unseen datasets, they develop a synthetic data generation technique to pre-train Entity Extraction (EE) and Question-Answering (QA) models. Experiments on three datasets (Flight Delay, Online Food Delivery Preferences, and Student Performance) demonstrate that the proposed zero-shot methods achieve competitive performance with MRR scores ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 across various slots.

## Method Summary
The method involves framing Forecast Utterance Understanding as a slot-filling problem where user utterances are parsed to extract salient phrases corresponding to specific slots (Target Attribute, Aggregation Constraint, Filter Operation, etc.). Since real training data is unavailable in real-time scenarios, the authors propose generating synthetic training data using heuristic templates and T5-based keyword-to-sequence generation. Pre-trained EE/QA models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Albert) are then fine-tuned on this synthetic data to extract salient phrases and confidence scores from user utterances. Candidate attributes from the database schema are ranked based on semantic similarity to these extracted phrases, and the most likely candidates are selected to fill each slot, ultimately formulating the complete forecasting task.

## Key Results
- The proposed zero-shot approaches achieve MRR scores between 0.6-0.9 for various slots across three datasets.
- BERT-based models demonstrate superior performance compared to other EE/QA models in most cases.
- The method shows particular strength in extracting Target Attributes and Aggregation Constraints, with weaker performance on Filter Operation slots.
- Synthetic data generation using both heuristic and T5-based approaches enables effective pre-training of EE/QA models without requiring real labeled data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic data generation bridges the gap when real training data is unavailable in real-time forecasting tasks.
- Mechanism: By generating artificial utterances using heuristic templates and T5-based keyword-to-sequence generation, the system can simulate user expressions for various attributes and their synonyms. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune pre-trained EE/QA models, enabling them to extract relevant salient phrases and confidence scores from previously unseen utterances.
- Core assumption: Artificially generated utterances accurately represent the distribution of real user expressions for forecasting tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We present a robust approach, comprising two methods for synthetic data generation. As described in Algorithm 2 the first method, a heuristic technique, involves constructing realistic template utterances with empty slots, subsequently populated with relevant attributes and their synonyms derived from the provided schema."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.337, average citations=0.0." (Weak corpus evidence for synthetic data approaches in conversational forecasting)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Framing Forecast Utterance Understanding as an unsupervised slot-filling problem enables zero-shot learning for real-time forecasting tasks.
- Mechanism: Each aspect of the user's prediction need is treated as a slot (e.g., Target Attribute, Aggregation Constraint). The system uses EE/QA techniques to extract salient phrases from user utterances and ranks candidate attributes based on their semantic similarity to these phrases. This approach allows the system to understand and formulate forecasting tasks without requiring labeled training data for each new dataset.
- Core assumption: User utterances contain sufficient information to accurately infer the desired slot values through semantic similarity and extraction techniques.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We frame the task as a slot-filling problem, where each slot corresponds to a specific aspect of the goal prediction task."
  - [section] "Given a relevant (Rx = 1 ) salient-phrase x and a candidate attribute ai from the database schema, P (ai|x, Rx = 1) represents the probability that ai is the desired target. We assume that attributes with high semantic similarity to relevant salient-phrases are more likely to be the target attribute..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot approaches using EE/QA techniques can effectively interpret Forecast Utterances for real-time forecasting tasks.
- Mechanism: By fine-tuning pre-trained EE/QA models on artificially generated data, the system can extract salient phrases and their confidence scores from user utterances. These confidence scores are then used to estimate the probability of each attribute being the desired target attribute, enabling the system to rank and select the most likely candidates for each slot.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained EE/QA models can be effectively fine-tuned on synthetic data to perform accurate extraction and ranking for real-time forecasting tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "By leveraging both synthetic datasets and their corresponding slots, we generate training examples in the CoNLL-2003 format (for EE) and SQuAD format (for QA). This comprehensive foundation allows us to effectively fine-tune pre-trained EE/QA models, thereby enabling accurate extraction of salient phrases and confidence scores from previously unseen utterances."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Question Answering (QA) techniques
  - Why needed here: These techniques are used to extract salient phrases and their confidence scores from user utterances, which are crucial for inferring the desired slot values in the Forecast Utterance Understanding task.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering techniques, and how are they applied in the context of Forecast Utterance Understanding?

- Concept: Semantic similarity and embedding techniques
  - Why needed here: Semantic similarity and embedding techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) are used to rank candidate attributes based on their relevance to the extracted salient phrases from user utterances.
  - Quick check question: How do semantic similarity and embedding techniques help in ranking candidate attributes for the Forecast Utterance Understanding task?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning and transfer learning
  - Why needed here: Zero-shot learning allows the system to perform Forecast Utterance Understanding tasks without requiring labeled training data for each new dataset, while transfer learning enables the fine-tuning of pre-trained models on synthetic data to adapt to specific forecasting domains.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User Utterance Input -> Synthetic Data Generation -> EE/QA Model Fine-tuning -> Salient Phrase Extraction -> Attribute Ranking -> Slot-Filling and Forecasting Task Formulation

- Critical path: User Utterance Input → Synthetic Data Generation → EE/QA Model Fine-tuning → Salient Phrase Extraction → Attribute Ranking → Slot-Filling and Forecasting Task Formulation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using synthetic data generation allows for zero-shot learning but may not capture the full complexity of real user utterances.
  - Relying on pre-trained EE/QA models enables transfer learning but may require significant fine-tuning to adapt to specific forecasting domains.
  - Ranking attributes based on semantic similarity is intuitive but may not always capture the user's true intent if the utterances are ambiguous or implicit.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on real user utterances despite good results on synthetic data may indicate that the generated data does not accurately represent the true distribution of user expressions.
  - Inability to extract relevant salient phrases or low confidence scores may suggest that the fine-tuned EE/QA models are not effectively capturing the user's intent.
  - Incorrect ranking of candidate attributes may indicate that the semantic similarity measure is not well-suited for the specific forecasting domain or that the extracted salient phrases are not sufficiently informative.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate synthetic data using heuristic templates and T5-based keyword-to-sequence generation for a simple forecasting task (e.g., predicting the average temperature for a given location).
  2. Fine-tune a pre-trained EE/QA model on the generated synthetic data and evaluate its performance on a small set of manually crafted user utterances.
  3. Implement the full Forecast Utterance Understanding pipeline, including salient phrase extraction, attribute ranking, and slot-filling, and test it on a variety of user utterances for a specific forecasting domain (e.g., flight delay prediction).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed zero-shot slot-filling method compare to supervised learning approaches when sufficient labeled data is available?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that supervised learning is impractical due to real-time conversations and unique datasets, but does not compare the zero-shot method's performance to supervised approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the zero-shot approach due to the lack of pre-training data, but does not explore how it would perform compared to supervised methods if labeled data were available.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the zero-shot method's performance to supervised learning approaches on datasets with available labeled data would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the proposed method to user utterances with implicit or abstract slot expressions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the method struggles with utterances containing abstract or implicit slot expressions, as evidenced by the failure analysis section.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the difficulty of handling abstract or implicit expressions, it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method's robustness to such utterances.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the method's performance on a diverse set of user utterances, including those with implicit or abstract slot expressions, would provide evidence of its robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed method be extended to handle multiple values for each slot?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that it assumes each slot can have one value at maximum, but acknowledges that this may not hold in real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how the method can be adapted to handle multiple values for each slot, which may be necessary for more complex forecasting tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the method that can handle multiple values for each slot, along with experiments demonstrating its effectiveness, would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The synthetic data generation process, while innovative, may not fully capture the variability and complexity of real user utterances in conversational data science tasks.
- The evaluation is constrained to three specific datasets (Flight Delay, Online Food Delivery Preferences, and Student Performance), limiting generalizability to other domains.
- The method shows weaker performance on filtering constraints, suggesting it struggles with more abstract slot values.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core methodology of framing Forecast Utterance as a slot-filling problem and using EE/QA techniques for extraction is well-grounded in established NLP practices.
- Medium confidence: The reported MRR scores (0.6-0.9) across different slots are promising but require independent validation.
- Low confidence: The claim that the system can handle "real-time, unseen datasets" is the most uncertain aspect, with limited evidence about how well the approach generalizes to truly novel datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the fine-tuned EE/QA models to a fourth, completely different forecasting dataset (not used in training or development) and measure MRR scores across all slot types. This would validate the claim of handling "unseen datasets" in real-time applications.

2. **Human evaluation study**: Conduct a user study where human evaluators assess whether the system's slot-filling outputs accurately capture user intent across different levels of utterance complexity. This would address the uncertainty around performance on implicit or abstract expressions.

3. **Error analysis on filtering constraints**: Perform detailed error analysis specifically on the filtering constraint slots where performance is weakest. Identify whether failures stem from the synthetic data generation, the EE/QA model limitations, or the semantic similarity ranking approach.
