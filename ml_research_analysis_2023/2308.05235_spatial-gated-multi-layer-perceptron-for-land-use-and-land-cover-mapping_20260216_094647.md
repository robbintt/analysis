# Spatial Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron for Land Use and Land Cover Mapping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05235
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05235
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: SGU-MLP achieves significant improvements in LULC mapping accuracy across three datasets compared to benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT models

## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Spatial Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron (SGU-MLP), a novel deep learning classifier for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. The method addresses limitations of CNNs and vision transformers (ViTs) by using spatial gating units (SGU) to capture spatial relationships without positional embeddings, enabling robust performance with limited training data. Tested on three diverse datasets (Houston, Berlin, and Augsburg), SGU-MLP consistently outperformed benchmark models, achieving significant improvements in accuracy metrics. The approach demonstrates its potential for precise LULC mapping across diverse environments.

## Method Summary
The SGU-MLP architecture combines depth-wise convolution blocks, spatial gating units, and MLP-Mixer layers to process multi-modal remote sensing data. The method uses three parallel depth-wise convolutions with different kernel sizes to capture multi-scale features, followed by spatial gating units that encode spatial relationships without positional embeddings. The architecture employs MLP-Mixer blocks to separate spatial and channel mixing operations, resulting in linear computational complexity compared to ViTs. The model was tested on three datasets: Houston (hyperspectral + multispectral), Berlin (hyperspectral + SAR), and Augsburg (hyperspectral + SAR + DSM).

## Key Results
- SGU-MLP achieved 25% higher average accuracy than ResNet on the Houston dataset
- Outperformed iFormer by 21%, EfficientFormer by 20%, CoAtNet by 19%, and HybridSN by 15% in terms of average accuracy
- Demonstrated consistent improvements across all three datasets (Houston, Berlin, and Augsburg)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The SGU-MLP uses spatial gating units to capture complex spatial relationships without positional embeddings.
- Mechanism: The spatial gating unit (SGU) replaces positional embeddings by using depth-wise convolutions to encode spatial relationships directly into the gating function. This allows the model to learn spatial interactions while avoiding the quadratic complexity of self-attention.
- Core assumption: Depth-wise convolutions can adequately encode spatial relationships for the task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The SGU concept enables the algorithm to efficiently characterize complex spatial interactions across input data tokens without the use of positional information embedding as utilized in popular ViTs."
  - [section] "The SGU is designed to extract complex spatial interaction across tokens. Unlike, the current ViT models, the SGU does not necessitate the use of positional embedding."
- Break condition: If depth-wise convolutions fail to capture relevant spatial patterns in the input data, performance may degrade significantly compared to models using positional embeddings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The MLP-Mixer architecture allows for linear computational complexity compared to ViTs.
- Mechanism: By separating spatial mixing (height/width) from channel mixing, the MLP-Mixer applies independent transformations to rows and columns of the input, resulting in linear complexity with respect to sequence length.
- Core assumption: Separating spatial and channel mixing is sufficient for the task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The objective of the MLP-Mixer architecture is to distinguish between cross-location (height and width mixing) operations and per-location (channel-mixing) operations"
  - [section] "Notably, the MLP-Mixer has a linear computation complexity, which distinguishes it from vision transformers with quadratic computation complexity"
- Break condition: If the task requires more complex interactions between spatial and channel dimensions that cannot be captured by the separated approach, performance may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The depth-wise convolution block (DWC) addresses overfitting when training data is limited.
- Mechanism: By using parallel depth-wise convolutions with different kernel sizes, the DWC captures multi-scale features while maintaining a relatively small number of parameters compared to standard convolutions.
- Core assumption: Limited training data makes overfitting a significant concern.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "With so many variables and the limited available training data, a higher probability of overfitting exists during the training process. Hence, to address overfitting and capture multi-scale feature information, we incorporated three depth-wise convolutions in parallel."
  - [abstract] "Where the available training data are limited, current advanced multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep CNNs and ViTs."
- Break condition: If the training data is sufficiently large, the DWC's parameter efficiency may become less critical, and standard convolutions might perform equally well.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → DWC → Flatten → MLP-Mixer (with SGU) → Classification Head
- Critical path: Input → Depth-wise Convolution Block → Flatten → MLP-Mixer (with SGU) → Classification Head
- Design tradeoffs:
  - SGU vs. positional embeddings: Reduced complexity but potentially less expressive spatial encoding
  - MLP-Mixer vs. CNNs: Linear complexity but potentially less effective for local feature extraction
  - DWC vs. standard convolutions: Reduced parameters but potentially less powerful feature extraction
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with complex spatial patterns
  - Overfitting when training data is insufficient
  - Inability to capture local features effectively
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test SGU-MLP on a small subset of the Houston dataset to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare performance with and without the SGU component to validate its contribution
  3. Evaluate the impact of different kernel sizes in the DWC on classification accuracy
