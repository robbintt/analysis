# The Effects of Signal-to-Noise Ratio on Generative Adversarial Networks Applied to Marine Bioacoustic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14806
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: SNR significantly impacts WaveGAN performance on marine bioacoustic data, with optimal training at SNR ≥ -5dB.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affects WaveGAN's ability to generate synthetic marine bioacoustic data. The authors address the challenge of low SNR in marine environments by systematically evaluating WaveGAN performance across SNRs from -15dB to 10dB. They develop and compare three evaluation methodologies - frequency spectra comparison, spectrogram pixel intensity comparison, and triplet loss learning via Siamese Neural Networks - to assess synthetic data quality. The study finds that WaveGAN performance degrades as input SNR decreases, particularly below -5 dB, and that the generator systematically outputs data with lower SNR than the training data.

## Method Summary
The authors generate synthetic marine bioacoustic data at 32kHz with SNRs ranging from -15dB to 10dB, containing dolphin whistle-like upsweep sounds combined with underwater noise. WaveGAN models are trained for approximately 10,000 epochs on each SNR dataset. The evaluation employs three methodologies: frequency spectra comparison using Pearson's correlation coefficient, spectrogram pixel intensity comparison using Pearson's correlation coefficient, and SNN analysis using both individual per-SNR models and a single multi-SNR model. SNNs are trained using semi-hard triplet loss to learn signal vs. noise embeddings for downstream SNR prediction of synthetic outputs.

## Key Results
- WaveGAN performance degrades significantly as input SNR decreases, with optimal performance at SNR ≥ -5dB
- On average, WaveGAN produces synthetic data with a lower SNR than the training data
- SNNs trained on triplet loss effectively evaluate GAN performance by learning distinct signal and noise embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: WaveGAN performance degrades as input SNR decreases, particularly below -5 dB.
- Mechanism: Lower SNR increases noise dominance in training data, causing the generator to learn and reproduce corrupted spectral characteristics rather than the underlying signal structure.
- Core assumption: The GAN training process treats low-SNR inputs as valid training targets, thereby learning to replicate degraded signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "lower SNRs resulting in poorer performance" and "SNR significantly impacts WaveGAN performance."
  - [section] shows in Figure 4 that correlation scores increase with SNR, and Figure 6 indicates RMSDE is minimized in the range [-2, 2] dB.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The WaveGAN generator systematically outputs data with a lower SNR than the training data.
- Mechanism: The adversarial loss may favor high-noise outputs because they better match the noisy training distribution, especially when noise and signal are poorly separable at low SNR.
- Core assumption: The generator is optimizing for discriminator realism rather than signal fidelity, leading to a bias toward noisier outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] notes "On average, WaveGAN produces synthetic data with a lower SNR than the training data."
  - [section] Figure 3 shows synthetic embeddings clustering with lower SNRs than their actual SNR, indicating systematic underestimation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) can effectively evaluate GAN performance by learning signal vs. noise embeddings.
- Mechanism: SNNs trained on triplet loss learn to map high-SNR signals and noise into distinct clusters, allowing classification and regression-based SNR prediction of synthetic data.
- Core assumption: The learned embedding space preserves SNR and signal characteristics for downstream evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] describes two SNN evaluation methods, with Figure 2 and 3 showing clear separation between whistle and noise embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and its impact on deep learning.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SNR affects model training and evaluation is central to interpreting WaveGAN's behavior on marine bioacoustic data.
  - Quick check question: If a signal has an SNR of 0 dB, what does that imply about the power of the signal relative to the noise?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their training dynamics.
  - Why needed here: WaveGAN's architecture and training process determine how it handles low-SNR inputs and what kind of outputs it generates.
  - Quick check question: In GAN training, what role does the discriminator play in shaping the generator's output distribution?

- Concept: Siamese Neural Networks and triplet loss learning.
  - Why needed here: SNNs are used as an evaluation tool to assess the quality and SNR of synthetic data generated by WaveGAN.
  - Quick check question: How does triplet loss encourage the network to separate signal from noise in the embedding space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WaveGAN -> SNR data generator -> Evaluation methods -> SNN models
- Critical path:
  1. Generate synthetic training data at various SNR levels
  2. Train WaveGAN models on each SNR dataset
  3. Generate synthetic whistles from each trained WaveGAN
  4. Evaluate synthetic data using frequency, pixel, and SNN methods
  5. Analyze results to determine optimal training SNR and performance trends
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using individual SNNs per SNR allows focused evaluation but increases model count and complexity
  - A single SNN on all SNRs reduces overhead but may struggle with SNR-specific nuances
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor synthetic-SNR alignment (synthetic data clustering with lower SNRs than expected)
  - SNN embeddings showing overlap between signal and noise clusters at low SNRs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train WaveGAN on data at SNR = -5 dB and evaluate synthetic outputs using all three methods
  2. Vary training SNR from -15 dB to 10 dB in 5 dB steps and record RMSDE for each
  3. Train a single SNN on all SNRs and use KNN regression to predict SNR of synthetic outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of WaveGAN compare to other audio-based GANs (e.g., WaveNet, DiffWave, MelGAN) when applied to marine bioacoustic data with varying SNR levels?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest exploring the impact of SNR on other audio-based GANs in future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses specifically on WaveGAN and does not compare its performance to other GAN architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments using the same evaluation methodologies on other audio-based GANs with the same marine bioacoustic dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the upper limit of SNR at which WaveGAN performance begins to degrade significantly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that future work should explore the existence of an upper limit to SNR.
- Why unresolved: The study only investigates SNRs within the range [-15, 10]dB and does not explore higher SNR values.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generate synthetic data with SNRs higher than 10dB and evaluate WaveGAN performance to determine if and when performance begins to decline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different similarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard similarity, Cosine similarity) compare to Pearson's correlation coefficient in evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by WaveGAN?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest considering alternative similarity metrics in future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only employs Pearson's correlation coefficient for evaluating the similarity between real and synthetic data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply alternative similarity metrics to the same synthetic data and compare the results with those obtained using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the choice of signal shape (e.g., cetacean whistles) affect the performance of WaveGAN in generating synthetic marine bioacoustic data across different SNR levels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study uses a specific signal shape (upsweep frequency) that mimics cetacean whistles, but does not explore other signal shapes.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on one type of signal shape and does not investigate how other shapes might influence WaveGAN performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generate synthetic data using different signal shapes (e.g., clicks, burst pulses) and evaluate WaveGAN performance to determine if certain shapes are more challenging or easier to generate across varying SNR levels.

## Limitations
- WaveGAN architecture details remain underspecified beyond the latent dimension (256)
- SNR estimation pipeline for synthetic data evaluation is not fully described
- SNN models rely on semi-hard triplet mining without clear convergence criteria or hyperparameter specifications

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general trend that WaveGAN performance degrades at low SNRs is supported by multiple evaluation methods and consistent across figures.
- Medium confidence: The recommendation to train at SNR ≥ -5dB is based on empirical observation but lacks statistical significance testing across multiple training runs.
- Low confidence: The SNN-based SNR prediction methodology has limited validation, with only one SNR (0dB) tested against actual measurements, and no cross-validation across different noise types.

## Next Checks

1. Run 5 independent training trials at SNR = -5dB and SNR = -10dB to establish confidence intervals for performance metrics.
2. Test whether the observed SNR-performance relationship holds across different WaveGAN generator architectures (varying filter sizes, latent dimensions).
3. Evaluate synthetic data on an independent marine bioacoustic dataset to verify that learned representations transfer beyond the synthetic training domain.
