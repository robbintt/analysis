## Executive Summary
This review provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering methods for natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the medical domain. It covers different prompt design methods, including manual and automated, discrete and continuous, and discusses their practical applications in medical settings. The review highlights the promise of prompt engineering in improving NLP performance for medical tasks like classification, generation, detection, and question answering. However, it also identifies challenges like data scarcity and uncertainty, model interpretability, and self-consistency issues that need to be addressed.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes existing literature on prompt engineering applications in healthcare, examining various methodologies including manual prompts (zero-shot, few-shot), automated prompts (discrete and continuous), and their effectiveness across medical NLP tasks. The authors analyze the mechanisms by which prompt engineering improves model performance, discuss practical applications in healthcare settings, and identify key challenges and open questions for future research. The methodology involves comprehensive literature review and categorization of prompt engineering approaches based on their design principles and applications.

## Key Results
- Prompt engineering significantly improves NLP performance in medical tasks by providing structured guidance to large language models without requiring extensive fine-tuning
- Automated prompt methods can generate more task-specific and efficient prompts than manual approaches, though with trade-offs in interpretability
- Continuous prompts offer advantages by operating in embedding space, allowing parameter optimization through tuning while relaxing constraints on natural language formulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt engineering improves NLP performance in medical tasks by providing structured guidance to large language models without requiring extensive fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The approach leverages the inherent contextual learning ability of LLMs by designing task-specific prompts that guide the model's output, allowing it to perform specialized tasks with minimal labeled data.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-trained knowledge is sufficiently comprehensive to cover the medical domain when properly guided by well-designed prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "prompt engineering has shown significant superiority across various domains and has become increasingly important in the healthcare domain"
  - [section 1]: "With the continuous improvement of general large language models, the importance of prompt engineering in the healthcare domain is becoming increasingly prominent"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus papers directly address this specific mechanism
- Break Condition: If the medical domain contains highly specialized terminology or concepts not well-represented in the LLM's pre-training data, the prompt-based approach would fail to achieve satisfactory performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automated prompt methods can generate more task-specific and efficient prompts than manual approaches, improving model performance.
- Mechanism: Automated techniques like prompt mining, paraphrasing, generation, and scoring systematically explore the prompt space to find optimal prompt formulations that maximize task performance.
- Core assumption: The automated search algorithms can effectively navigate the high-dimensional prompt space to discover high-performing prompt templates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "Automated prompts have gained popularity due to their efficiency and adaptability" and "These prompts are generated using various algorithms and techniques"
  - [section 3.2.1]: Describes various automated prompt construction methods including "prompt mining, prompt paraphrasing, prompt generation, and prompt scoring"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus papers directly validate the comparative effectiveness of automated versus manual prompts
- Break Condition: If the search space is too large or the evaluation metric is noisy, automated methods may converge to suboptimal prompts or require excessive computational resources.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Continuous prompts (soft prompts) offer advantages over discrete prompts by operating in the embedding space and allowing parameter optimization through tuning.
- Mechanism: Continuous prompts are represented as vectors in the embedding space rather than natural language text, enabling gradient-based optimization and reducing the constraints of natural language formulation.
- Core assumption: The embedding space representation can effectively capture the semantic information needed to guide the LLM without being limited to human-readable text formats.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Unlike discrete prompts, continuous prompts can be operated in the embedding space and are no longer limited to text-readable types"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Continuous prompts can optimize parameters through tuning on downstream task training data, which relaxes the constraints on prompts"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus papers provide empirical validation of continuous prompt effectiveness
- Break Condition: If the continuous prompt vectors become too abstract or lose semantic interpretability, they may fail to provide meaningful guidance to the LLM or become difficult to debug and improve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their contextual learning capabilities
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs work is essential to grasping why prompt engineering is effective - the approach leverages the models' ability to learn from context rather than requiring task-specific training
  - Quick check question: How do LLMs like BERT and GPT differ in their approach to language understanding, and why does this matter for prompt engineering?

- Concept: The distinction between zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses various prompting strategies including zero-shot and few-shot prompting, which represent different levels of example provision to guide the model
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting in terms of the information provided to the LLM?

- Concept: The difference between discrete and continuous prompt representations
  - Why needed here: The review distinguishes between manual prompts (typically discrete/natural language) and automated continuous prompts that operate in the embedding space
  - Quick check question: Why might continuous prompts be more flexible than discrete prompts for certain medical NLP tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained LLM -> Prompt Design Layer (Manual/Automated) -> Task-specific Template -> Evaluation Metrics -> Application Layer (Classification/Generation/Detection/QA)
- Critical path: Data -> Prompt Design -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation -> Evaluation -> Iteration
- Design tradeoffs: Manual prompts offer greater control and interpretability but require domain expertise and are time-consuming; automated prompts are more efficient and potentially more task-specific but may lack interpretability and require computational resources for search; continuous prompts offer flexibility in the embedding space but sacrifice natural language interpretability
- Failure signatures: Poor performance despite high-quality LLM (indicates prompt design issues); inconsistent results across similar inputs (suggests prompt template problems); excessive computational cost (points to inefficient automated prompt search); lack of model interpretability (suggests need for better prompt documentation or visualization)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple zero-shot classification task using a basic prompt template on a small medical text dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Test few-shot learning by providing 3-5 examples in the prompt for the same classification task to measure improvement
  3. Compare manual prompt design versus automated prompt search for the same task to evaluate efficiency and performance trade-offs
