# I Spy a Metaphor: Large Language Models and Diffusion Models Co-Create Visual Metaphors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14724
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration significantly outperforms direct input to diffusion models for visual metaphor generation, with fine-tuning visual entailment models on the resulting dataset achieving approximately 23-point accuracy improvement.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for generating visual metaphors from linguistic metaphors by combining large language models with diffusion models. The authors propose using Chain-of-Thought prompting with Instruct GPT-3 to generate visual elaborations that explicitly include relevant objects and implicit meaning, which are then used as input to diffusion models like DALL·E 2. Through a human-AI collaboration framework, they create HAIVMet, a high-quality dataset of 6,476 visual metaphors for 1,540 linguistic metaphors. Professional illustrators evaluated the generated images, showing that the LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration significantly outperforms direct input to diffusion models, with LLM-DALL·E 2 achieving the best results.

## Method Summary
The authors collect linguistic metaphors from six sources (FLUTE, Advertisements, CoPoet, FigQA, Figure-of-Speech, CrossLing Metaphors, Metaphor Paraphrase) and filter for visually grounded metaphors. They use Instruct GPT-3 with Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate visual elaborations containing objects to include and implicit meaning. These elaborations are then input to diffusion models (DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion v2.1) to generate visual metaphors. Expert annotators validate and slightly edit the generated visual elaborations. The resulting HAIVMet dataset is used to fine-tune a visual entailment model, achieving approximately 23-point improvement in accuracy compared to using only standard visual entailment datasets.

## Key Results
- LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration (particularly LLM-DALL·E 2) significantly outperforms direct input to diffusion models, with only 6% "Lost Cause" images
- HAIVMet dataset contains 6,476 visual metaphors for 1,540 linguistic metaphors
- Fine-tuning a visual entailment model on HAIVMet leads to approximately 23-point improvement in accuracy compared to using only standard visual entailment datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Chain-of-Thought prompting with Instruct GPT-3 generates visual elaborations that explicitly include relevant objects and implicit meaning, which improves diffusion model outputs for visual metaphor generation.
- Mechanism: CoT prompting decomposes the metaphor understanding task into intermediate reasoning steps (objects to include + implicit meaning → visual elaboration), providing diffusion models with more structured and complete input compared to raw metaphors.
- Core assumption: Diffusion models require explicit representation of both objects and implicit meaning to generate appropriate visual metaphors.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states CoT prompting generates visual elaborations containing objects to include and implicit meaning; [method] describes using these elaborations as input to diffusion models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The human-AI collaboration framework improves dataset quality through expert validation and editing of generated visual elaborations.
- Mechanism: Expert annotators validate and slightly edit the generated visual elaborations, ensuring higher quality input for the diffusion models and resulting visual metaphors.
- Core assumption: Expert validation and editing of generated content improves the quality of the final output.
- Evidence anchors: [method] describes expert annotators validating and editing generated visual elaborations.

## Foundational Learning
The authors do not explicitly discuss what the LLM component is learning or how it learns. The focus is on using the LLM as a tool for generating visual elaborations rather than on its learning process.

## Architecture Onboarding
The paper does not provide specific details about how the LLM or diffusion model architectures are designed or how they would be onboarded for this specific task. The focus is on the collaboration framework rather than the underlying architectures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. It focuses on presenting the methodology and results of the LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration for visual metaphor generation.

## Limitations
- The paper does not discuss potential limitations of the approach, such as the dependency on the quality of the linguistic metaphors in the source datasets or the generalizability of the results to other types of metaphors.
- The evaluation is based on professional illustrators' assessments, which may not fully capture the effectiveness of the visual metaphors for other audiences or applications.

## Confidence
The evidence provided is primarily from the authors' experiments and evaluations, including professional illustrators' assessments. The results show significant improvements in visual metaphor generation and dataset quality, but the lack of explicit discussion of limitations or potential biases in the evaluation process introduces some uncertainty.

## Next Checks
- Examine the specific evaluation criteria used by professional illustrators to assess the generated visual metaphors
- Investigate the diversity and representativeness of the linguistic metaphors in the source datasets
- Explore potential applications of the HAIVMet dataset beyond fine-tuning visual entailment models
