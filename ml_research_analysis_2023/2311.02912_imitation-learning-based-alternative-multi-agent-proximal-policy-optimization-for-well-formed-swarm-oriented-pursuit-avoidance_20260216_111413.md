# Imitation Learning based Alternative Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Well-Formed Swarm-Oriented Pursuit Avoidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.02912
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02912
- Authors: [not specified in source]
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: Decentralized IA-MAPPO reduces communication overhead by 65-70% while maintaining competitive pursuit avoidance performance compared to centralized approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes IA-MAPPO, a decentralized framework for multi-robot pursuit avoidance that uses imitation learning with alternative training to compensate for decentralization losses. The approach combines policy distillation to create a mixed-formation policy from multiple fixed-formation teachers, imitation learning to generate decentralized formation confidence, and alternative training to correct compounding errors. Experiments show IA-MAPPO achieves similar performance to centralized methods while significantly reducing communication overhead from 13.14 KB to 5.15 KB per episode.

## Method Summary
IA-MAPPO uses policy distillation to train a centralized mixed-formation policy from multiple fixed-formation teacher policies, then applies imitation learning to decentralize this control by generating formation confidence values. Alternative training fine-tunes the low-level mixed-formation policy using task-oriented rewards to correct compounding errors from imitation learning. The framework operates in a multi-agent particle environment with 8 agents, using MAPPO as the base algorithm and employing Hausdorff distance for formation measurement.

## Key Results
- IA-MAPPO reduces communication overhead by 65-70% compared to centralized approaches
- Decentralized performance matches centralized CE-MAPPO in pursuit avoidance rewards
- Communication costs drop from 13.14 KB to 5.15 KB per episode

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Imitation Learning (IL) with alternative training (AT) compensates for the performance loss caused by decentralizing formation control.
- Mechanism: The centralized policy πf is first learned and then imitated to generate decentralized formation confidence. Alternative training fine-tunes the low-level mixed-formation policy πs using task-oriented rewards to correct compounding errors from IL.
- Core assumption: The compounding error ϵ in IL grows quadratically over time and can be corrected by fine-tuning πs using alternative training rewards.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "alternative training is leveraged to compensate the performance loss incurred by decentralization"
  - [section] "To rectify the adverse effects incurred by IL, we leverage AT by fine-tuning mixed-formation policy πs after learning the division policy πf"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for AT compensating IL errors in multi-agent settings.
- Break condition: If the compounding error is too large or the alternative training reward cannot effectively guide correction, performance may degrade below the centralized baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Policy distillation reduces memory overhead by combining multiple fixed-formation policies into one mixed-formation policy.
- Mechanism: Each teacher policy πc_i for formation Fc is trained separately, then distilled into a single student policy πs using Mean-Squared-Error loss between teacher and student actions on the same state.
- Core assumption: The distilled policy πs can approximate the combined behavior of all teacher policies without significant loss of formation accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we regard these policies as teacher models...utilize policy distillation to obtain a mixed-formation policy"
  - [section] "we adopt the Hausdorff Distance (HD) to measure the topology distance between the current and the expected formation"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for multi-agent policy distillation effectiveness in formation control.
- Break condition: If the state space complexity exceeds the capacity of the student policy or if the teacher policies are too dissimilar, the distilled policy may fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Decentralized confidence communication and masking operation enable formation pattern determination without centralized coordination.
- Mechanism: Agents compute formation confidence using local observations, broadcast to neighbors, aggregate neighbor confidences, and use masking to reshape observations for the next formation.
- Core assumption: Local observations plus neighbor confidences provide sufficient information to determine optimal formation patterns in real-time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "agents share the separation confidence with neighbors and concatenate these received values as the enhanced confidence"
  - [section] "The masking operation transfers the raw observation hi(t) into h′i(t) to meet the input of low-level mix-formation policy πs"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for decentralized confidence-based formation switching in multi-agent systems.
- Break condition: If communication range δcom is too small or observation quality is poor, agents may fail to correctly determine formation patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Dec-POMDP formulation
  - Why needed here: The problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process where agents must learn policies to coordinate formation control without centralized control.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a Dec-POMDP and how does it differ from standard RL?

- Concept: Policy distillation and imitation learning
  - Why needed here: Policy distillation combines multiple fixed-formation policies into one, while imitation learning transfers centralized policies to decentralized execution.
  - Quick check question: How does MSE loss between teacher and student policies ensure policy distillation effectiveness?

- Concept: Alternative training and reward shaping
  - Why needed here: Alternative training fine-tunes policies using task-oriented rewards to correct compounding errors from imitation learning.
  - Quick check question: What characteristics should an alternative training reward have to effectively correct policy deviations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Centralized policy → Policy distillation → Imitation learning → Alternative training → Decentralized execution
- Critical path: Central policy → Policy distillation → Imitation learning → Alternative training → Decentralized execution
- Design tradeoffs: Centralized vs decentralized control (communication overhead vs performance), fixed vs adaptive formations (flexibility vs complexity), imitation learning vs direct RL (sample efficiency vs optimality).
- Failure signatures: High communication overhead (centralized control failure), formation instability (policy distillation failure), poor pursuit avoidance (imitation learning failure), compounding errors (alternative training failure).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance and communication overhead between centralized CE-MAPPO and decentralized IA-MAPPO in simple formation switching scenarios.
  2. Test the effectiveness of policy distillation by comparing mixed-formation policy vs individual fixed-formation policies in maintaining formation accuracy.
  3. Validate alternative training by measuring performance recovery after imitation learning and comparing with baseline IL-MAPPO.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed IA-MAPPO algorithm perform in larger-scale swarms (e.g., 50+ agents) compared to the tested 8-agent setup?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "In the future, we will enlarge the scale of swarms" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments are limited to 8 agents, and scalability to larger swarms is not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing IA-MAPPO's performance (rewards, communication overhead, convergence speed) in swarms with 20, 50, and 100 agents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is IA-MAPPO's performance to communication range δcom and what is the optimal range for different swarm sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a fixed communication range (δcom = 2m) but doesn't explore its impact on performance.
- Why unresolved: The communication range is a critical parameter that affects both performance and overhead, but its sensitivity analysis is missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing performance metrics (reward, collision rate, formation stability) across different communication ranges (0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m) for various swarm sizes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does IA-MAPPO handle communication delays and packet losses compared to centralized approaches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes communication efficiency but doesn't address imperfect communication conditions.
- Why unresolved: Real-world systems experience communication delays and losses, but the paper only considers ideal communication scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments introducing artificial delays (10ms, 50ms, 100ms) and packet loss rates (5%, 10%, 20%) to compare IA-MAPPO's robustness against centralized approaches.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can IA-MAPPO adapt to dynamic formation patterns beyond the binary F8/F4 switch tested in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "enrich formation patterns" as a future direction and only tests two formation types.
- Why unresolved: The algorithm is designed for multiple formations but is only validated on a simple binary case.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating successful formation switching among 3+ patterns (e.g., F4, F6, F8, F10) while maintaining pursuit avoidance performance.

### Open Question 5
- Question: What is the computational overhead of IA-MAPPO's decentralized policy compared to the centralized baseline?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on communication overhead reduction but doesn't report computation costs.
- Why unresolved: Decentralization might reduce communication but increase local computation, which is important for deployment on resource-constrained agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Measurements of per-agent computation time and memory usage for both centralized and decentralized implementations across different swarm sizes.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability due to evaluation only in a single multi-agent particle environment
- Core mechanisms (policy distillation, imitation learning compensation) lack direct empirical validation through ablation studies
- Decentralized confidence-based formation switching depends heavily on communication range assumptions not extensively stress-tested

## Confidence

- Imitation Learning + Alternative Training compensation: Medium
- Policy distillation effectiveness: Medium
- Decentralized confidence-based formation switching: Low
- Communication overhead reduction (65-70%): High

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive ablation studies isolating each component (policy distillation, imitation learning, alternative training) to quantify individual contributions to overall performance.
2. Test the framework across multiple environment complexities and team sizes to assess scalability and robustness beyond the initial particle environment.
3. Implement stress tests with varying communication ranges, observation noise levels, and adversary behaviors to evaluate the limits of decentralized confidence-based formation switching.
