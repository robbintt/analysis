# Latent Graphs for Semi-Supervised Learning on Biomedical Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.15757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15757
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Latent graph construction improves semi-supervised learning on biomedical tabular data with average F1-micro score of 0.910

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised learning approach for biomedical tabular data by constructing latent graphs based on instance similarity and applying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for classification. The method transforms instance classification into node classification on a latent graph, enabling the incorporation of global and local knowledge. Experiments on nine biomedical datasets demonstrate that the approach outperforms several baseline classifiers and semi-supervised learning techniques.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs latent graphs by calculating cosine similarity between instances and creating edges based on a similarity threshold. The graph nodes represent instances while edges represent similarity relationships. A two-layer GCN is then applied to learn meaningful representations through message passing, with the final classification performed using a linear layer. The model is trained using Adam optimization with early stopping, and all available data (labeled and unlabeled) is used for graph construction to enable semi-supervised learning.

## Key Results
- Achieves average F1-micro score of 0.910 across nine biomedical datasets
- Outperforms traditional classifiers (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, SpyCT) in semi-supervised settings
- Demonstrates effectiveness of latent graph construction for inter-instance relationship discovery
- Shows robustness across datasets with varying characteristics (instances: 32-801, features: 661-20,531, classes: 3-5)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Latent graph construction transforms instance classification into node classification, enabling global and local knowledge propagation
- Mechanism: By calculating cosine similarity between instances and creating a graph where nodes represent instances and edges represent similarity above a threshold, the method converts tabular data into a graph structure suitable for GCN processing
- Core assumption: Cosine similarity effectively captures meaningful relationships between biomedical tabular instances that can be leveraged for classification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach facilitates the seamless propagation of information throughout the graph, effectively incorporating global and local knowledge"
  - [section] "This approach allows us to leverage the relationships between instances in the data based on inter-instance similarity to improve the classification accuracy"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly comparable methods found in the corpus
- Break condition: If the cosine similarity threshold is too high, the graph becomes disconnected and cannot propagate information effectively; if too low, noise dominates the graph structure

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GCN layers aggregate neighborhood information to learn better representations for classification
- Mechanism: The two-layer GCN applies message passing where each node's representation is updated by aggregating weighted features from neighboring nodes, with normalization by the product of node degrees
- Core assumption: The latent graph structure contains discriminative information that GCN can extract through message passing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [12] to exploit the latent graph structure and learn meaningful representations of the instances"
  - [section] "At each layer, the node representations are updated by aggregating information from neighboring nodes"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks GCN-based tabular data methods
- Break condition: If the graph becomes too dense or too sparse, GCN cannot effectively learn meaningful representations; also fails if neighborhood aggregation doesn't capture relevant patterns

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semi-supervised learning benefits from unlabeled data through graph-based information propagation
- Mechanism: The method uses all available data (labeled and unlabeled) to construct the latent graph, allowing information to flow from labeled to unlabeled instances during GCN training
- Core assumption: Unlabeled instances provide useful structural information that improves classification when incorporated through the graph
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our work demonstrates the significance of inter-instance relationship discovery as practical means for constructing robust latent graphs to enhance semi-supervised learning techniques"
  - [section] "By leveraging graph-based representations, our approach facilitates the seamless propagation of information throughout the graph"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - limited semi-supervised tabular data methods in corpus
- Break condition: If the labeled data is insufficient to anchor the graph structure, the model may propagate incorrect information; also fails if unlabeled data introduces misleading relationships

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and message passing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GCN aggregates neighborhood information is crucial for implementing and debugging the proposed method
  - Quick check question: How does the normalization term (1/√(N(v)·N(u))) in GCN prevent feature explosion during message passing?

- Concept: Cosine similarity and its properties
  - Why needed here: The method relies on cosine similarity to construct the latent graph, so understanding its behavior with high-dimensional biomedical data is essential
  - Quick check question: Why might cosine similarity be preferred over Euclidean distance for comparing biomedical tabular instances with different scales?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning principles
  - Why needed here: The method combines labeled and unlabeled data, requiring understanding of how information propagates in semi-supervised settings
  - Quick check question: How does using unlabeled data in graph construction differ from traditional semi-supervised approaches that only use it during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Similarity matrix -> Thresholded graph -> GCN layers -> Classification -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Data → Similarity matrix → Thresholded graph → GCN layers → Classification → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Threshold θ vs. graph density (higher θ = sparser graph, potentially less information propagation)
  - Number of GCN layers (more layers = more complex representations but risk oversmoothing)
  - Feature normalization method (affects cosine similarity computation quality)
- Failure signatures:
  - Very low F1 scores on all datasets suggest graph construction issues
  - High variance across folds indicates sensitivity to data partitioning
  - Training loss doesn't decrease suggests GCN architecture problems
  - Performance similar to baseline classifiers suggests graph doesn't add value
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary θ threshold from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1 to find optimal graph density
  2. Compare GCN with different numbers of layers (1, 2, 3) to assess depth impact
  3. Test different similarity metrics (cosine, Euclidean, Jaccard) to validate choice of cosine similarity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the thresholding parameter θ affect the performance of the latent graph-based semi-supervised learning method?

- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study of the impact of varying the thresholding parameter θ on the method's performance, including an analysis of the trade-off between the number of edges in the graph and the classification accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the latent graph-based semi-supervised learning method perform on other types of biomedical tabular data beyond the datasets used in the experiments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the method on nine biomedical datasets, but it does not explore its generalizability to other types of biomedical tabular data

## Limitations

- Limited systematic exploration of optimal threshold θ for graph construction
- No comparison with state-of-the-art graph-based semi-supervised learning methods for tabular data
- Performance may be dataset-dependent given the varying characteristics of biomedical tabular data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The methodological framework of using latent graphs for tabular data classification is sound and well-justified
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical results showing performance improvements across nine datasets, though the specific threshold choice remains a limitation
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to other biomedical domains and the sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (threshold, GCN depth)

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the cosine similarity threshold θ across [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9] and measure F1-micro score changes to identify optimal graph density

2. **GCN Architecture Ablation**: Compare one-layer vs. two-layer vs. three-layer GCN configurations on the same datasets to quantify the impact of model depth

3. **Alternative Similarity Metrics**: Replace cosine similarity with Euclidean distance, Jaccard similarity, and learned similarity measures to validate the choice of similarity function
