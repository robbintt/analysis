- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12940
- Reference count: 0
- Self-Explanation prompting consistently outperforms other zero-shot methods and matches few-shot prompting on dialogue understanding tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Self-Explanation prompting, a zero-shot prompting strategy that enhances contextual comprehension of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogues. The method requires models to analyze and explain each dialogue utterance before completing the task, leading to improved performance across various dialogue-centric tasks. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Self-Explanation prompting consistently outperforms other zero-shot prompting methods and matches or exceeds the efficacy of few-shot prompting.

## Method Summary
Self-Explanation prompting is a task-agnostic approach where the model analyzes each dialogue utterance before task execution. The method requires the model to generate structured explanations for each utterance (e.g., intent, action) before responding to the task-specific question. This sequential utterance-by-utterance explanation process mirrors human cognitive strategies and aims to improve the model's internal representation of dialogue context. The approach is compared against zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Plan-and-Solve, and few-shot prompting baselines across six benchmark dialogue datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 44.44% Joint Goal Accuracy on MultiWOZ dataset, surpassing zero-shot CoT (27.64%) and Plan-and-Solve (39.19%) baselines
- Matches or exceeds few-shot prompting performance (41.60% JGA on MultiWOZ) without requiring demonstration examples
- Consistently outperforms other zero-shot prompts across six benchmark datasets including STARv2, SGD, SpokenWOZ, MELD, and MuTual

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-explanation prompting enhances dialogue comprehension by forcing the model to generate structured explanations for each utterance before responding.
- Mechanism: The model converts low-level natural language inputs into abstract, high-level constructs (e.g., intent, action) through sequential utterance-by-utterance explanation. This process mirrors the human cognitive strategy of self-explanation, which has been shown to improve understanding of new material by forcing learners to articulate their reasoning.
- Core assumption: That generating explanations for each utterance improves the model's internal representation of the dialogue context, leading to better task performance.
- Evidence anchors: Weak corpus evidence; relies on comparison with Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve baselines.
- Break condition: If the model generates superficial or repetitive explanations that don't genuinely improve contextual understanding, the performance gains would diminish or disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-explanation prompting reduces the risk of overlooking dialogue states by providing detailed semantic interpretations of each utterance.
- Mechanism: By explicitly explaining each utterance, the model is less likely to miss important information or context needed for dialogue state tracking tasks. The explanations serve as an intermediate comprehension step that bridges raw dialogue input and final task output.
- Core assumption: That explicit explanation of each utterance creates a more robust internal representation of dialogue state than direct response generation.
- Evidence anchors: Weak corpus evidence; performance gains are shown but mechanism not explicitly validated in corpus.
- Break condition: If the dialogue contains highly implicit or ambiguous information that requires contextual reasoning beyond what utterance-level explanations can capture.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-explanation prompting narrows the solution space for dialogue understanding tasks by focusing attention on external context rather than internal reasoning.
- Mechanism: Unlike Chain-of-Thought prompting which directs models to internal reasoning steps, self-explanation focuses on interpreting the existing dialogue context. This approach is more suitable for TOD tasks where answers are typically extractable from context rather than requiring complex computation.
- Core assumption: That TOD tasks have solution spaces primarily located in the external dialogue context, making comprehension-focused prompting more effective than reasoning-focused prompting.
- Evidence anchors: Weak corpus evidence; the corpus contains related dialogue understanding papers but no direct evidence comparing solution space assumptions.
- Break condition: If the dialogue task requires significant reasoning or computation beyond simple context extraction, the benefits of self-explanation would be reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: Understanding why CoT prompting underperforms on dialogue tasks compared to self-explanation is central to the paper's contribution.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between CoT prompting (which focuses on reasoning steps) and self-explanation prompting (which focuses on contextual comprehension)?

- Concept: Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The paper compares self-explanation to both zero-shot and few-shot baselines, establishing its competitive advantage.
  - Quick check question: How does self-explanation prompting achieve performance comparable to few-shot prompting without requiring demonstration examples?

- Concept: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) schema formats
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between procedural and declarative schema formats, which affects how self-explanation applies to different TOD tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between procedural schema (STARv2) and declarative schema (MultiWOZ, SGD) datasets in terms of dialogue structure and task requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input processing layer -> Self-explanation generation module -> Task execution layer -> Output formatting layer
- Critical path: C → Q → Self-explanation instructions → Sequential utterance analysis → Task completion → Output generation
- Design tradeoffs: Self-explanation trades increased prompt length and processing time for improved comprehension accuracy. The approach requires careful instruction design to ensure explanations are meaningful rather than superficial.
- Failure signatures: (1) Superficial explanations that don't genuinely improve understanding, (2) Explanation generation that exceeds context window limits, (3) Inconsistent performance across different dialogue domains or task types.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare self-explanation prompting against vanilla prompting on MultiWOZ dataset to measure baseline improvement.
  2. Test different trigger phrases (e.g., "understand", "summarize", "explain") to identify optimal instruction wording.
  3. Evaluate performance on procedural schema tasks (STARv2) versus declarative schema tasks (MultiWOZ, SGD) to understand domain-specific effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of self-explanation prompting vary across different language models, particularly between smaller and larger models?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 for experiments, but does not explicitly compare the effectiveness of self-explanation prompting across different model sizes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of self-explanation prompting across different language models, leaving the question of its effectiveness on smaller models unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of self-explanation prompting on a range of language models, from smaller to larger, would provide insights into its effectiveness across different model sizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can self-explanation prompting be effectively combined with other prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought or Plan-and-Solve, to further enhance dialogue understanding in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the limitations of existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve in dialogue tasks and introduces self-explanation prompting as a solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the potential synergies between self-explanation prompting and other prompting strategies, leaving the question of their combined effectiveness open.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the combination of self-explanation prompting with other prompting strategies on dialogue tasks would provide evidence of their potential synergistic effects.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of self-explanation prompting scale with the complexity and length of dialogues in task-oriented dialogue systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that TOD tasks involve multi-turn dialogues with long contexts, but does not explicitly analyze how the performance of self-explanation prompting scales with dialogue complexity and length.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of self-explanation prompting across dialogues of varying complexity and length, leaving the question of its scalability open.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the performance of self-explanation prompting on dialogues of varying complexity and length would provide insights into its scalability and effectiveness in handling complex dialogues.

## Limitations

- Prompt Design Variability: The paper does not provide specific prompt templates for Self-Explanation prompting, leaving critical implementation details ambiguous.
- Domain Generalization: While the method shows strong performance across six datasets, these span relatively similar dialogue domains, limiting generalizability to more diverse dialogue types.
- Mechanism Validation: The paper proposes that self-explanation improves dialogue comprehension but lacks direct evidence showing how explanations actually improve internal representations.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The empirical finding that Self-Explanation prompting consistently outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve baselines across multiple dialogue tasks and datasets.
- Medium Confidence: The mechanism that self-explanation improves dialogue comprehension through structured utterance interpretation, though this requires further validation to confirm.
- Low Confidence: The claim that self-explanation is fundamentally better suited to TOD tasks than reasoning-focused approaches like CoT, as this depends on untested assumptions about solution space location.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Explanation Quality**: Systematically remove or degrade the quality of self-explanations (e.g., using placeholder explanations) to measure how much performance depends on genuine comprehension versus prompt structure or length effects.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate Self-Explanation prompting on dialogue datasets from substantially different domains (legal, medical, technical) compared to the current benchmarks to assess domain transferability and identify potential failure modes.

3. **Mechanism Probing with Attention Analysis**: Use attention visualization or probing classifiers to examine whether self-explanation actually improves the model's internal representation of dialogue context, or if performance gains arise from other factors like increased processing time or token count.
