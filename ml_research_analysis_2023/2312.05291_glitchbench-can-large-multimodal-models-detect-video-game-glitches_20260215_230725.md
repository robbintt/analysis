# GlitchBench: Can large multimodal models detect video game glitches?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2312.05291
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05291
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** GPT-4V achieves 43.4% accuracy on video game glitch detection, outperforming other LMMs, revealing substantial room for improvement in multimodal reasoning.

## Executive Summary
GlitchBench is a new challenging benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models on video game glitch detection. The dataset contains 593 images of glitches from 205 games, collected from Reddit's game community. The glitches span various categories including physics violations, animation errors, rendering issues, and UI problems. When evaluated on GlitchBench, GPT-4V achieved the highest accuracy at 43.4%, while other state-of-the-art models like LLaVA-1.5 scored significantly lower at 29.6%. The benchmark reveals that detecting subtle glitches involving body positions and rendering artifacts remains challenging for current models. The performance gap between GPT-4V and open-source models suggests substantial room for improvement in multimodal reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
GlitchBench evaluates LMMs on video game glitch detection using 593 images of glitches from 205 games, collected from Reddit's game community. Each image has a short description of the glitch. Models are prompted with three questions about what is unusual or wrong with each image, and a Llama-2-70B-Chat judge compares model responses to ground truth, outputting Yes/No. The benchmark includes 513 samples from online videos and 75 synthetic samples generated in Unity, spanning physics, collision, spawn, animation, pose, rendering, and texture categories.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V achieved 43.4% accuracy on average across two main evaluation questions, the highest among all tested models
- LLaVA-1.5 scored 29.6% accuracy, significantly lower than GPT-4V
- Models struggled most with animation and pose glitches, which require fine-grained spatial reasoning
- Extensive captioning (Q3) increased GPT-4V accuracy to 64.9%, a +7.7pp improvement over basic questions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LMMs struggle with glitches requiring fine-grained spatial reasoning and anomaly detection
- Mechanism: Glitch detection demands recognizing violations of physical laws and implausible body configurations, which current LMMs cannot reliably perform without strong visual grounding and reasoning
- Core assumption: Spatial reasoning and anomaly detection are fundamental prerequisites for glitch detection that are not yet solved in LMMs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "detecting subtle glitches involving body positions and rendering artifacts remains challenging for current models"
  - [section 4.3] "LMMs struggle to detect unnatural body and limb configurations and incorrect animations being displayed"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for spatial reasoning limitations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-step reasoning and detailed image captioning are necessary but not sufficient for glitch detection
- Mechanism: Asking models to describe images in detail (Q3) triggers more verbose responses but doesn't guarantee identification of unusual elements
- Core assumption: More detailed image descriptions will surface glitches through increased model attention
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the extensive captioning setup, we estimated the upper limits of models, and GPT-4V can achieve an accuracy of 64.9%, which is an increase of +7.7pp over Q1"
  - [section 4.2] "Asking LMMs to extensively caption the image using Q3 only triggers GPT-4V to produce a very verbose response"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for effectiveness of multi-step reasoning in glitch detection

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Privacy features and model architecture affect glitch detection performance
- Mechanism: GPT-4V's privacy features may prevent it from seeing facial details clearly, while smaller models lack the resolution and architectural capabilities to detect subtle glitches
- Core assumption: Model architecture and privacy features directly impact visual perception capabilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "We found several issues when processing glitches related to faces, and in the majority of cases, GPT-4V fails to detect the glitch and sometimes hallucinates about characters wearing costumes"
  - [section 4.2] "OtterHD, which employs Fuyu as the base model with enhanced flexibility and support for higher image resolutions, outperforms Fuyu on average by +15.5pp (24.0 vs. 8.5)"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for privacy feature impact on detection

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatial reasoning and anomaly detection
  - Why needed here: Glitch detection fundamentally requires identifying violations of physical laws and implausible configurations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a car floating in air is a glitch while a car parked normally is not?

- Concept: Multimodal integration and reasoning
  - Why needed here: Models must integrate visual and linguistic information to understand what constitutes "unusual" in an image
  - Quick check question: How would you design a prompt to test if a model can identify unusual elements in an image?

- Concept: Computer vision fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding image representation, resolution, and feature extraction is crucial for interpreting model performance
  - Quick check question: What factors affect a model's ability to detect subtle visual anomalies in images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual Encoder -> Feature Extraction -> Fusion -> Language Model -> Response Generation -> Judge Evaluation
- Critical path: Image → Visual Encoder → Feature Extraction → Fusion → Language Model → Response Generation → Judge Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Higher resolution improves detection but increases computational cost. Privacy features may protect users but reduce detection accuracy. Model size affects both performance and hallucination tendency
- Failure signatures: Hallucinations (generating content not in image), missing subtle glitches, focusing on wrong image elements, privacy-induced blind spots in facial recognition
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test model performance on easy vs. hard glitch categories to understand reasoning capabilities
  2. Compare performance with different prompt formulations (Q1 vs Q2 vs Q3) to understand reasoning requirements
  3. Evaluate impact of image resolution and privacy features on detection accuracy across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can we create a benchmark for video game glitch detection that better correlates with real-world performance?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper compares GlitchBench performance with other multimodal benchmarks and finds that good performance on prior benchmarks does not guarantee good performance on real-world tasks.
- Why unresolved: Existing benchmarks often use yes/no or multiple-choice formats that allow models to find shortcuts without truly understanding glitches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a new benchmark with free-form responses and evaluating model performance on actual game QA tasks versus existing benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of multimodal reasoning are most challenging for models when detecting video game glitches?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper categorizes glitches into physics, collision, spawn, animation, pose, rendering, and texture categories, with animation and pose being consistently the most challenging.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies categories where models struggle, it doesn't deeply analyze what specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., spatial reasoning, temporal understanding) are most lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis of model failures across different glitch categories to identify common reasoning patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we improve model performance on subtle glitches that require attention to small details?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper notes that some glitches require close attention to detail, such as clipping issues with clothing, and that models struggle with these subtle glitches.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but doesn't propose solutions for improving model attention to fine-grained details in complex scenes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing different prompting strategies, attention mechanisms, or model architectures specifically designed to enhance detail detection.

## Limitations
- The dataset contains only 593 images, which may not provide sufficient statistical power to draw definitive conclusions about LMM capabilities across all glitch types
- Ground truth labeling relies on Reddit user descriptions, which may contain subjective interpretations or incomplete information about the glitches
- Privacy features in GPT-4V may artificially suppress performance on certain glitch types rather than reflecting true reasoning limitations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about relative performance differences between GPT-4V and open-source models (43.4% vs 29.6%) are well-supported by the experimental results and consistent across evaluation questions
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about LMMs struggling with spatial reasoning and anomaly detection are supported by qualitative observations but lack direct mechanistic evidence from the corpus
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about multi-step reasoning and detailed captioning being necessary but not sufficient are supported by Q3 results but the causal mechanism is not fully established

## Next Checks
1. Expand temporal evaluation: Test LMMs on video sequences rather than static images to determine if temporal context improves glitch detection accuracy, particularly for subtle animation and physics violations

2. Ablation study on privacy features: Compare GPT-4V performance with and without privacy restrictions on facial recognition to isolate the impact of privacy features from fundamental reasoning limitations

3. Human baseline comparison: Conduct controlled experiments with human annotators to establish performance bounds and identify specific glitch categories where LMMs fall short of human-level reasoning capabilities
