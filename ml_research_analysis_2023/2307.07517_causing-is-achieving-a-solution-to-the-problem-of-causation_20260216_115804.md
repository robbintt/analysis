- Causation is real and occurs as an event rather than as a relation between events

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel theory of causation that treats causation as an occurrent (event/process) rather than a relation between events. The theory decomposes causation into four subfunctions: Achieves, Prevents, Allows, and Disallows, with Achieves being the essence of causation. The framework is characterized by three fundamental patterns: <Event → State>, <Process → Process>, and <State → State>, and distinguishes between direct causation (simultaneous influence between processes sharing parameters) and indirect causation (mediated by states).

## Method Summary
The paper employs philosophical analysis and argumentation to develop a theory of causation as a systemic function. It introduces the device ontology approach, where causation is understood by identifying a device with the effect as output and the cause as internal behavior, enabling recursive analysis down to minimal granularity. The Achieves function is investigated through identification of devices and parameter propagation, with recursion terminating at minimal granularity or when states are obtained.

## Key Results
- Causation is real and occurs as an event rather than as a relation between events
- Achieves is the essence of causation and can be characterized by three patterns: <Event → State>, <Process → Process>, and <State → State>
- There is no direct causation between events; direct causation involves simultaneous influence between processes sharing parameters, while indirect causation is mediated by states

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causation can be understood as a systemic function, specifically the Achieves function.
- Mechanism: The paper reframes causation by identifying a device (system) where the cause is the internal behavior and the effect is the output. This enables recursive analysis down to minimal granularity, capturing causation as the achievement of a state or process.
- Core assumption: Causation is real and not merely a relation; it is an occurrent (event/process) that can be modeled functionally.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "causation can be understood via the notion of systemic function"
  - [section 4.1]: "Considering E as a systemic goal for C, an entity composed of all entities participating in C can be said to perform a systemic function that achieves E by behaving in a certain way in C."
- Break condition: The recursion terminates at minimal granularity or when a state is obtained through parameter propagation, as in the device ontology.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Achieves is the essence of causation and can be decomposed into three patterns: <Event → State>, <Process → Process>, and <State → State>.
- Mechanism: Achieves is characterized by these patterns, each representing how causation manifests depending on the nature of the relata. <Event → State> generates new states upon event completion, <Process → Process> involves concurrent interactions through shared parameters, and <State → State> continues causal phenomena.
- Core assumption: All causation can be reduced to the Achieves function, with Prevents, Allows, and Disallows defined in terms of Achieves.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Achieves is the essence of causation and can be characterized by three patterns"
  - [section 5.2]: Detailed discussion of each pattern, e.g., "The essence of causation lies in a single function, namely Achieves."
- Break condition: The Achieves patterns are complete; no additional patterns are needed to explain causation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Direct causation involves simultaneous influence between processes sharing parameters, while indirect causation is mediated by states.
- Mechanism: Direct causation occurs when processes overlap and share parameters (e.g., piston and crank), leading to concurrent interaction. Indirect causation requires states as intermediaries, allowing non-simultaneous influence.
- Core assumption: There is no direct causation between events because events are completed and cannot influence others except via resultant states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "the interaction between C and E are included in either C or E... only (d) where C and E are overlapped is valid"
  - [section 5.2.2]: "Direct causation involves simultaneous influence between processes sharing parameters"
- Break condition: The distinction holds as long as processes are ongoing and events are treated as completed wholes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systemic function
  - Why needed here: Provides the framework to model causation as a functional achievement, moving beyond traditional relational views.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a systemic function and a simple relation in the context of causation?

- Concept: Device ontology
  - Why needed here: Enables recursive analysis of causation by identifying devices with input-output behavior, allowing decomposition into finer-grained phenomena.
  - Quick check question: How does the device ontology help in identifying the minimal granularity for causation?

- Concept: Direct vs. indirect causation
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes between concurrent process interactions and state-mediated influences, crucial for understanding the simultaneity of causation.
  - Quick check question: Why can't there be direct causation between events according to the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Causal pair (C→E) to be analyzed
  - Device ontology: Recursive framework for identifying devices and their internal behaviors
  - Achieves function: Core subfunction with three patterns (<Event → State>, <Process → Process>, <State → State>)
  - State mediation: Mechanism for indirect causation
  - Output: Complete model of causation as systemic function

- Critical path:
  1. Identify causal pair (C→E)
  2. Apply device ontology to find device with E as output and C as internal behavior
  3. Recursively analyze C if it's a causal chain
  4. Classify causation into one of the three Achieves patterns
  5. If indirect, identify mediating states

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. simplicity: Finer granularity provides more detail but increases complexity
  - Direct vs. indirect focus: Emphasizes direct causation but requires careful handling of indirect cases
  - Ontological commitment: Assumes causation is real, which may not align with all philosophical views

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to terminate recursion: Indicates missing minimal granularity or state identification
  - Misclassification of patterns: Suggests incorrect identification of relata types
  - Overlooking state mediation: Leads to incorrect direct/indirect causation distinction

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Model a simple mechanical causation (e.g., piston and crank) using device ontology and verify Achieves pattern
  2. Analyze an indirect causation example (e.g., John locked the door → no robbery) and identify state mediation
  3. Test recursion termination by applying device ontology to a complex causal chain (e.g., traffic accident) and verify minimal granularity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How many fundamental causal principles exist that cannot be reduced to finer-grained causal phenomena, and what is their precise nature?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "Alpha collapse" as an example of a principle that is not reducible to more fundamental phenomena, but states that the exact number and nature of such principles is unknown.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as an open question but does not provide a definitive answer, stating "Although we cannot provide a proof, there seems to exist only a few such principles."
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical research identifying and categorizing fundamental causal principles that resist decomposition into simpler causal mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the theory of causation be rigorously positioned within the historical context of causal theories, and what are its precise relationships to existing frameworks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions this as future work, stating "The future work includes proper positioning of the theory in the rich history of causal theories."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for this analysis but does not undertake it, focusing instead on developing the new theoretical framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparative analysis of the proposed theory against major historical and contemporary causal theories, highlighting points of convergence and divergence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise relationship between the four subfunctions (Achieves, Prevents, Allows, Disallows) in complex causal chains, and how can these chains be formally represented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We need a theory for explaining what a causal chain is as a whole in terms of these four subfunctions."
- Why unresolved: While the paper defines the four subfunctions individually, it acknowledges that understanding their collective behavior in complex causal sequences remains an open challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a formal framework for representing and analyzing causal chains composed of mixed subfunctions, with empirical validation through real-world examples.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework relies heavily on specific ontological commitments about states, processes, and events that are not universally accepted in philosophy of causation
- The device ontology approach, while innovative, requires further formalization to ensure consistent application across different domains
- The recursion termination conditions (minimal granularity and state identification) may be ambiguous in complex systems

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The Achieves function as the essence of causation and its three fundamental patterns (<Event → State>, <Process → Process>, <State → State>)
- Medium Confidence: The distinction between direct and indirect causation, and the claim that there is no direct causation between events
- Medium Confidence: The device ontology approach for recursive analysis, pending formalization

## Next Checks

1. Formalize the device ontology framework with explicit rules for recursion termination and parameter propagation
2. Apply the Achieves function analysis to empirical case studies across multiple domains (physics, biology, social sciences) to test generalizability
3. Develop a formal logic system that captures the Achieves function and its patterns, then test its consistency and completeness
