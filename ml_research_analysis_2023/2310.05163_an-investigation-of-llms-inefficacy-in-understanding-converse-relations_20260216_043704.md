# An Investigation of LLMs' Inefficacy in Understanding Converse Relations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.05163
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05163
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Key outcome:** This paper introduces ConvRe, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs’ understanding of converse relations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ConvRe, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of converse relations. The benchmark comprises two tasks, Re2Text and Text2Re, formulated as multi-choice question answering tests. Through experiments with three popular LLM families, the authors observed various scaling trends, suggesting that LLMs often resort to shortcut learning and still face challenges in understanding converse relations. The results indicate that LLMs' performance on formal language tasks might be inflated by shortcut learning, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methodologies.

## Method Summary
The ConvRe benchmark evaluates LLMs on understanding converse relations through two tasks: Re2Text (relation to text) and Text2Re (text to relation). The benchmark uses 17 relations and 1240 triples extracted from knowledge graph completion datasets. Experiments employ multi-choice question answering format with zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods, including text variants and chain-of-thought reasoning. Three LLM families (GPT, Claude, Flan-T5) are evaluated across different prompting strategies.

## Key Results
- LLMs often resort to shortcut learning when interpreting formal relations, leading to inflated performance metrics
- Larger models may underperform due to conflicting memorized patterns with given instructions
- Few-shot examples that match test difficulty can reduce model bias and improve performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLMs exploit statistical shortcuts from pre-training data when interpreting formal relations.
- **Mechanism:** The model relies on surface-level textual similarity between relations and natural language text rather than performing true semantic parsing.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-training corpus contains predominantly normal (non-converse) relation triples.
- **Evidence anchors:** Performance drops when test text variants are introduced; no explicit corpus analysis provided.
- **Break condition:** When the task explicitly requires understanding reversed semantics without shortcut cues.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Model performance on formal language tasks is inflated due to over-reliance on memorized patterns.
- **Mechanism:** Larger models memorize more patterns that may conflict with task instructions when patterns don't match converse relation semantics.
- **Core assumption:** Larger models have stronger priors causing reliance on memorized patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:** GPT-4 underperforms compared to smaller models; performance falls below random-guess levels.
- **Break condition:** When instructions explicitly contradict common memorized patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Few-shot examples can reduce model bias when aligned with test difficulty.
- **Mechanism:** Hard examples matching test complexity help models focus on actual semantics rather than superficial cues.
- **Core assumption:** Models can generalize from hard examples to test scenarios.
- **Evidence anchors:** Hard examples outperform standard examples on average across models.
- **Break condition:** When few-shot examples don't match test scenario in complexity or semantic structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Asymmetric relations in knowledge graphs
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark focuses on relations where R ≠ R⊤, so understanding asymmetry is fundamental to interpreting converse relations.
  - **Quick check question:** If "parent of" is asymmetric, what does (x, parent of, y) imply about the relationship between x and y?

- **Concept:** Semantic equivalence between relations and natural language
  - **Why needed here:** Tasks require mapping triples to/from natural language while preserving meaning.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you express (x, has part, y) in natural language if the relation is defined as "y has a part called x"?

- **Concept:** Shortcut learning in deep learning models
  - **Why needed here:** Central argument is that LLMs rely on superficial cues rather than true understanding.
  - **Quick check question:** What is an example of a shortcut a model might use when mapping (x, has part, y) to natural language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ConvRe benchmark -> Two tasks (Re2Text, Text2Re) -> Prompting methods (zero-shot, few-shot) -> Text variants (altered/unaltered) -> Model families (GPT, Claude, Flan-T5) -> Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path:** Understand relation definitions → Implement two tasks → Create text variants → Run experiments across model families → Analyze scaling trends
- **Design tradeoffs:** Multi-choice QA format simplifies evaluation but may affect smaller models' performance; manually crafted examples ensure quality but limit scalability
- **Failure signatures:** Performance drops with text variants; larger models may underperform due to conflicting priors; models may fail to follow CoT instructions
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run zero-shot experiments on normal relations with unaltered test text to establish baseline
  2. Run zero-shot experiments on converse relations with unaltered test text to observe impact of relation type
  3. Introduce text variants to test text and compare performance to identify shortcut learning behaviors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can LLMs learn to generalize beyond the data distribution of their pre-training data when it comes to understanding converse relations?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper states that current benchmarks mostly follow the data distribution of LLMs' pre-training data, and raises the question of whether LLMs genuinely understand structured semantics of formal languages.
- **Why unresolved:** Experiments show LLMs resort to shortcut learning and struggle with converse relations, but don't conclusively prove whether this is due to lack of generalization ability or other factors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments testing LLMs' performance on novel converse relations not present in pre-training data, or using transfer learning techniques.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms that cause LLMs to take shortcuts when processing formal languages?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper mentions that LLMs tend to rely on statistical patterns in their pre-training data, and that they struggle with converse relations due to unfamiliarity during pre-training.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies the problem of shortcut learning but doesn't delve into specific mechanisms causing this behavior in LLMs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Detailed analysis of LLMs' internal representations and decision-making processes when handling formal languages.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can evaluation methodologies be improved to better assess LLMs' true understanding of formal languages?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper introduces ConvRe as a novel benchmark and mentions the need for more robust evaluation methodologies.
- **Why unresolved:** While ConvRe is a step towards better evaluation, the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for assessing LLMs' understanding beyond converse relations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and testing of additional benchmarks covering wider range of formal language phenomena, and comparison of different evaluation methodologies.

## Limitations

- **Limitation 1:** The findings rely on the assumption that pre-training data contains predominantly normal relation triples, but this lacks direct corpus evidence.
- **Limitation 2:** The benchmark's effectiveness depends on the quality and representativeness of manually crafted examples, which may not scale well to other relation types.
- **Limitation 3:** Performance differences between model sizes could be influenced by factors beyond shortcut learning, such as instruction following capabilities, which are not fully isolated.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** LLMs struggle with converse relations and performance drops when text variants are introduced.
- **Medium confidence:** Larger models underperform due to conflicting memorized patterns with instructions.
- **Medium confidence:** Hard few-shot examples reduce model bias when aligned with test difficulty.

## Next Checks

1. Analyze pre-training corpora of evaluated models to quantify distribution of normal vs. converse relation triples.
2. Test ConvRe benchmark with broader set of relation types beyond the 17 used to assess generalization.
3. Conduct controlled experiment isolating effect of model size on instruction following and CoT reasoning capabilities.
