# Driving through the Concept Gridlock: Unraveling Explainability Bottlenecks in Automated Driving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16639
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16639
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Concept bottleneck models achieve competitive performance to black-box visual feature methods while providing interpretable explanations for driving behavior changes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a concept bottleneck model for explainable control command prediction in autonomous driving. The model uses interpretable concepts derived from GPT-3.5 and human-annotated scene descriptions, processed through a Longformer to capture sequential dependencies. The approach achieves competitive performance to black-box visual feature methods while providing interpretable explanations for driving behavior changes. Human evaluation shows 94% of concept predictions accurately explain driving scenes, and the method can identify when interventions might occur through attention mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The method employs a concept bottleneck approach where driving-related concepts (e.g., "a car in close proximity", "poor visibility") are encoded from both GPT-3.5 and human-annotated scene descriptions. These concepts are then processed by a Longformer with sliding window attention to capture temporal dependencies in driving scenarios. The model predicts control commands (steering angle and distance) while providing interpretable explanations through concept predictions. The approach is evaluated on Comma2k19 and NuScenes datasets, demonstrating competitive performance to traditional black-box methods while offering transparency in decision-making.

## Key Results
- Achieves steering angle MAE of 0.7 and distance MAE of 0.97 on Comma2k19 dataset
- Achieves steering angle MAE of 1.89 and distance MAE of 4.21 on NuScenes dataset
- 94% of concept predictions accurately explain driving scenes in human evaluation
- GPT-3.5 generated concepts perform as well as human-curated concepts for driving scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Concept bottleneck models provide interpretable visual features that can explain driving behavior changes through explicit concept predictions.
- Mechanism: The model encodes driving-related concepts derived from both GPT-3.5 and human-annotated scene descriptions, followed by a Longformer to capture sequential dependencies in driving scenarios.
- Core assumption: The concept space maps accurately to different driving conditions and that the attention mechanism can identify when interventions might occur.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human evaluation shows 94% of concept predictions accurately explain driving scenes"
  - [section] "The interpretability of the concept bottleneck model allows us to understand the underlying causes behind these gap variations"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on general autonomous driving frameworks but don't specifically address concept bottleneck explainability
- Break condition: If the concept predictions do not accurately reflect driving scenarios or if the attention mechanism fails to identify relevant intervention points, the interpretability benefits would be lost.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concept bottleneck models achieve competitive performance to black-box visual feature methods while providing interpretable explanations.
- Mechanism: The concept bottleneck replaces traditional visual feature extraction with interpretable concept predictions, which are then processed by a temporal encoder (Longformer) for control command prediction.
- Core assumption: The bottleneck size and concept curation method significantly impact performance, with a sweet spot at 100 concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The approach achieves competitive performance to black-box visual feature methods while providing interpretable explanations"
  - [section] "Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of concept bottleneck models in sequential learning"
  - [section] "We see that bottleneck size seems to have a significant impact on performance, with a sweet spot at 100 concepts"
- Break condition: If the bottleneck size is too small or too large, or if the concept curation method produces irrelevant concepts, performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concept curation from large language models can perform better than human-curated concepts for driving scenarios.
- Mechanism: GPT-3.5 generates diverse driving scenarios using specific prompts, which are then combined with human-created scene descriptions and manually filtered for duplicates.
- Core assumption: Large language models can generate relevant and diverse driving concepts that capture important driving scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We evaluate a randomly selected subset of 270 human created concepts... We additionally evaluate 270 generated concepts by GPT 3.5"
  - [section] "Our results show that human curation is not better compared to concept curation obtained by large language models"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on autonomous driving frameworks but don't specifically address concept curation methods
- Break condition: If the generated concepts are irrelevant, redundant, or fail to capture important driving scenarios, the model's performance and interpretability would suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Concept Bottleneck Models

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Image → Image Encoder → Image Features → Cosine Similarity → Concept Scores → Longformer → Sequential Features → MLP Heads → Control Commands

- Critical path:
  1. Image → Image Encoder → Image Features
  2. Text → Text Encoder → Text Embeddings
  3. Image Features + Text Embeddings → Cosine Similarity → Concept Scores
  4. Concept Scores + Sensor History → Longformer → Sequential Features
  5. Sequential Features → MLP Heads → Control Commands

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. Performance: Concept bottleneck models provide explanations but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to black-box methods
  - Concept Bottleneck Size: Larger bottlenecks provide more detailed explanations but may lead to performance degradation
  - Concept Curation Method: GPT-3.5 generated concepts may be more diverse but require careful filtering and validation

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor concept predictions: Low human evaluation scores for concept accuracy
  - Attention mechanism not identifying intervention points: No correlation between attention spikes and scenario changes
  - Performance degradation: MAE increases significantly compared to black-box baselines

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare concept bottleneck model performance with different backbone architectures (ResNet, ViT, CLIP) on both datasets
  2. Evaluate the impact of bottleneck size on control command prediction accuracy
  3. Assess the effectiveness of GPT-3.5 generated concepts versus human-curated concepts through human evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of concept bottleneck models compare to traditional black-box approaches across different driving scenarios and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares concept bottleneck models to traditional methods like ResNet, ViT, and CLIP on Comma2k19 and NuScenes datasets for steering angle and distance prediction tasks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides initial comparisons, it doesn't extensively explore performance variations across diverse driving scenarios or investigate the generalizability of concept bottleneck models to different datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments on a wider range of driving datasets with varying conditions and scenarios, along with a detailed analysis of performance differences between concept bottleneck models and traditional approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal bottleneck size for concept bottleneck models in terms of balancing interpretability and prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a "sweet spot" at a bottleneck size of 100 concepts but doesn't provide a definitive answer or explore the impact of different bottleneck sizes on interpretability.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that bottleneck size affects performance but doesn't delve into the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy or provide guidelines for choosing the optimal size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying bottleneck sizes and analyzing the impact on both prediction accuracy and interpretability, along with guidelines for selecting the appropriate size based on specific use cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can concept bottleneck models be extended to incorporate additional modalities like sensor data or textual instructions for more comprehensive explanations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on visual concepts but mentions the potential for incorporating more modalities in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the integration of other modalities beyond visual concepts, leaving open the question of how to leverage additional information for richer explanations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments integrating sensor data or textual instructions into the concept bottleneck framework and evaluating the impact on explanation quality and model performance.

## Limitations

- Performance on NuScenes dataset shows higher error rates compared to Comma2k19, suggesting potential limitations in generalization across different driving environments.
- The concept generation process using GPT-3.5 prompts is not fully specified, raising concerns about reproducibility and potential bias in the generated concepts.
- Claims about the model's ability to identify intervention points through attention mechanisms are primarily qualitative with limited quantitative evidence.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Claims about the concept bottleneck architecture and its basic functionality (e.g., achieving interpretable features, competitive performance metrics). The experimental methodology and dataset specifications are clearly described.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about the superiority of GPT-3.5 generated concepts over human-curated concepts. While the paper states that human curation is not better, the evaluation criteria and sample size (270 concepts) may not be sufficient to draw definitive conclusions.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the model's ability to identify intervention points through attention mechanisms. The paper mentions using attention to identify potential interventions but provides limited quantitative evidence of this capability beyond qualitative descriptions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation study with diverse annotators to validate the 94% accuracy claim for concept predictions, including a more rigorous methodology for assessing interpretability.

2. Perform ablation studies systematically varying the bottleneck size beyond the reported 100-concept sweet spot to map the full performance landscape and identify potential overfitting patterns.

3. Test the model on additional driving datasets with different environmental conditions (urban vs. highway, day vs. night) to assess robustness and identify specific failure modes that may not be apparent in the current evaluation.
