# Learning in Cooperative Multiagent Systems Using Cognitive and Machine Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.09219
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09219

- Primary result: MAIBL models significantly outperform MADRL baselines in coordinated multi-agent object transportation with stochastic rewards

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces multi-agent instance-based learning (MAIBL) models that combine Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) with reinforcement learning concepts to improve coordination in stochastic multi-agent environments. The approach leverages cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms alongside RL techniques like epsilon-greedy exploration, hysteretic learning, and leniency. Three variants (Greedy-MAIBL, Hysteretic-MAIBL, Lenient-MAIBL) are evaluated on a coordinated multi-agent object transportation problem, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MADRL models across multiple stochastic reward scenarios.

## Method Summary
The MAIBL framework integrates IBLT's cognitive memory mechanisms with RL concepts to enable agents to learn and adapt to teammates' behavior without communication. Agents store instances based on experience, retrieving them using activation values influenced by frequency and recency. The models incorporate decreasing epsilon-greedy exploration, hysteretic learning with separate increase/decrease rates, and leniency for optimistic learning. These are tested on a 16x16 gridworld CMOTP task with stochastic rewards, comparing against MADRL baselines across four reward scenarios.

## Key Results
- MAIBL models achieve higher average proportion of maximization (PMax) than MADRL baselines in all tested scenarios
- Greedy-MAIBL excels when highest expected reward is deterministic, while Hysteretic-MAIBL performs best with stochastic highest rewards
- MAIBL models show superior coordination rates and efficiency metrics compared to MADRL approaches
- Lenient-MAIBL demonstrates robust performance but doesn't match Greedy or Hysteretic variants in their respective optimal scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MAIBL outperforms MADRL by leveraging human-like memory retrieval processes integrating frequency and recency biases
- Mechanism: Instances are stored and retrieved based on activation values influenced by recent and frequent experiences, enabling cognitively plausible learning in non-stationary environments
- Core assumption: IBLT accurately captures human decision-making processes applicable to multi-agent coordination
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] cognitive models based on IBLT capture human decisions; [section 3] choice rule selects maximum blended value
- Break condition: Memory retrieval becomes inefficient in large state spaces or assumptions about human-like decision-making fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Integration of RL concepts with IBLT provides synergistic benefits for exploration and learning
- Mechanism: Combines IBLT framework with RL techniques like decreasing epsilon-greedy, hysteretic learning, and leniency to balance exploration-exploitation and adapt to dynamic environments
- Core assumption: IBLT and RL concepts work synergistically better than either approach alone
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] decreasing epsilon-greedy strategy; [section 3.2] hysteretic learning with separate rates
- Break condition: Complexity from combination or poor interaction between IBLT and RL components

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model performance varies significantly based on reward scenario characteristics
- Mechanism: Greedy-MAIBL excels in deterministic scenarios through effective exploration-exploitation, while Hysteretic-MAIBL adapts better to stochastic rewards using optimistic learning
- Core assumption: Scenario characteristics (deterministic vs. stochastic, high vs. low probability rewards) significantly impact model performance
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.1] Greedy-MAIBL performs best in deterministic zones; Hysteretic-MAIBL excels in stochastic zones
- Break condition: Assumptions about scenario impact don't hold or models fail to adapt to unexpected reward changes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT)
  - Why needed here: Provides cognitive framework for storing and retrieving instances based on similarity, crucial for learning in dynamic multi-agent coordination
  - Quick check question: How does activation value influence instance retrieval probability in IBLT?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts
  - Why needed here: Enhances exploration (epsilon-greedy), optimistic learning (hysteretic), and leniency to improve adaptation in stochastic environments
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between alpha and beta learning rates in hysteretic Q-learning?

- Concept: Markov games
  - Why needed here: Framework for modeling fully cooperative multi-agent problems as multi-agent decision processes
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes independent learners from joint-action learners in Markov games?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Agent observes state -> retrieves instances based on activation -> combines IBLT with RL concepts -> selects action -> receives reward -> updates instances -> learns from outcome

- Critical path:
  1. Agent observes state and retrieves relevant instances based on activation values
  2. Agent combines RL concepts (epsilon-greedy, hysteretic, lenient) with IBLT to select action
  3. Agent takes action, receives reward, and updates instance utilities and activations
  4. Agent learns from outcome and adjusts decision-making for future interactions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. performance: Greedy-MAIBL simpler but may underperform Hysteretic-MAIBL in stochastic scenarios
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: Balance crucial for learning efficiency
  - Memory usage vs. learning speed: More instances improve learning but slow retrieval

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor coordination rates from exploration-exploitation imbalance
  - Suboptimal zone selection from incorrect stochastic reward sampling
  - High variance from sensitivity to leniency parameter choices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Greedy-MAIBL, Hysteretic-MAIBL, and Lenient-MAIBL on simple deterministic scenario to verify basic functionality
  2. Test models on stochastic scenario with high probability of high reward to validate Hysteretic-MAIBL advantage
  3. Evaluate adaptability to sudden reward structure changes by introducing optimal zone switches during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- No specific open questions identified in the paper

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to single task (CMOTP) with limited stochastic reward configurations
- Comparison uses relatively small number of trials (30) and episodes (1000), raising statistical robustness concerns
- Implementation relies on SpeedyIBL library without full algorithmic specifications

## Confidence
- **High**: MAIBL models outperform MADRL baselines in tested scenarios
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of IBLT-RL integration supported by results but lacks theoretical grounding
- **Low**: Claims about human-like decision-making processes are largely speculative

## Next Checks
1. Run 100+ trials with 5000+ episodes per scenario to establish confidence intervals and test for significant differences between MAIBL variants across all four reward scenarios

2. Evaluate MAIBL models on at least two additional multi-agent coordination tasks (e.g., predator-prey, traffic signal control) with varying numbers of agents and environmental complexity

3. Implement and test additional state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms (e.g., MADDPG, QMIX) to determine if MAIBL's advantages extend beyond specific MADRL variants used in this study
