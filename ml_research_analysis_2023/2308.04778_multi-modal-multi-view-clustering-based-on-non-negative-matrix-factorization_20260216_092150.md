# Multi-modal Multi-view Clustering based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04778
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: The proposed multi-modal multi-view clustering method improves clustering quality compared to state-of-the-art multi-view NMF clustering techniques on NUS-WIDE and MOSI datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel multi-modal multi-view clustering method based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The approach combines NMF clustering results from different views and modalities through a collaborative phase, where information is exchanged between local NMF models. The collaboration terms are optimized using weights derived from the inner product between data points and centroids. Experiments on NUS-WIDE and MOSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering quality compared to state-of-the-art multi-view NMF clustering techniques, particularly when collaborating with views of higher quality.

## Method Summary
The proposed method applies NMF to each view/modality independently to obtain initial clustering results. It then introduces collaboration phases between views within the same modality and across modalities. The collaboration terms are computed using inner products between data points and centroids, and the weights for these terms are optimized based on their magnitudes. The method iteratively updates the partition and centroid matrices using gradient descent with adaptive learning rates to minimize an overall cost function that combines local NMF terms with collaborative terms. This process allows local NMF models to benefit from information in other views/modalities, revealing hidden patterns and structures in the data.

## Key Results
- The proposed method improves clustering quality compared to state-of-the-art multi-view NMF clustering techniques.
- Purity scores increase when collaborating with views of higher quality.
- The method has minimal impact on the silhouette index while improving clustering quality.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The inner product-based collaborative term improves clustering quality by leveraging complementary information from different views/modalities.
- Mechanism: The collaborative term C(vp,v'p) measures agreement between data partitions G(vp) and G(v'p) weighted by the inner product between data points and centroids. When partitions agree, the term is zero, minimizing the overall cost function and improving clustering quality.
- Core assumption: The inner product is a more robust similarity measure than Euclidean distance for multi-modal data, especially for images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The collaboration terms are optimized using weights derived from the inner product between data points and centroids."
  - [section] "the inner product between each data point and the set of centroids" is used instead of Euclidean distance "since the traditional euclidean distance is a summation of the pixel-wise intensity differences, even minor deformations may produce large euclidean distances."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but related works like "Graph Regularized NMF with L20-norm for Unsupervised Feature Learning" suggest inner products are useful for clustering.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimizing the collaboration weights β and γ based on the magnitude of collaborative terms improves clustering by emphasizing more informative views/modalities.
- Mechanism: The weights βvp,v'p and γvp,vp' are set proportional to the squared magnitude of their respective collaborative terms. This gives higher weight to collaborations that have larger disagreement (and thus more potential for improvement).
- Core assumption: Views/modalities with larger collaborative terms have more complementary information to offer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the results of the optimization are presented in (11): βvp,v'p = |Cvp,v'p|2 / (P v'p ̸=vp |Cvp,v'p|2)" and similarly for γ.
  - [abstract] "The collaboration terms are optimized using weights derived from the inner product between data points and centroids."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but related works like "Multi-View Clustering via Semi-non-negative Tensor Factorization" suggest weighted fusion of views.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-modal multi-view collaboration improves clustering quality by allowing information exchange between local NMF models, revealing hidden patterns and structures.
- Mechanism: The overall cost function J(F,G) combines local NMF terms with collaborative terms that encourage agreement between views within a modality and between modalities. This allows local models to benefit from the information in other views/modalities.
- Core assumption: The true clustering structure is shared across views/modalities, so encouraging agreement will reveal it.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the proposed method improves clustering quality compared to state-of-the-art multi-view NMF clustering techniques" and "the multi-modal multi-view collaboration in revealing inherent patterns and structures in complex data sets."
  - [section] "a collaboration phase between different views within the same modality allows for the exchange of information and finally a second collaboration phase is introduced, where each of the other modalities contributes to the co-clustering."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but related works like "Interpretable Multi-View Clustering Based on Anchor Graph Tensor Factorization" suggest information fusion across views improves clustering.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
  - Why needed here: NMF is the core clustering algorithm that is applied locally to each view/modality and then collaboratively refined.
  - Quick check question: What are the two matrices that NMF decomposes the data matrix into, and what do they represent?

- Concept: Multi-view and multi-modal data
  - Why needed here: The proposed method specifically handles data that has multiple views (different representations of the same data) and multiple modalities (different types of data like text and images).
  - Quick check question: How does the proposed method handle the fact that different modalities may have different dimensionalities or feature spaces?

- Concept: Collaborative clustering
  - Why needed here: The proposed method uses a co-training strategy where clustering results from different views/modalities are used to improve each other iteratively.
  - Quick check question: How does the proposed method ensure that the collaboration does not degrade the clustering quality of high-quality views/modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Local NMF clustering -> Multi-view collaboration -> Multi-modal collaboration -> Optimization

- Critical path:
  1. Apply NMF to each view/modality to get initial clustering results
  2. Compute collaborative terms and optimize weights
  3. Iteratively update partition and centroid matrices to minimize the overall cost function
  4. Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using inner product vs Euclidean distance for collaborative terms: Inner product is more robust for images but may not be meaningful for all modalities
  - Optimizing weights based on collaborative term magnitude vs other schemes: Current scheme emphasizes views with larger disagreement but may not always be optimal
  - Including both multi-view and multi-modal collaboration: Allows rich information exchange but increases complexity and may lead to conflicting signals

- Failure signatures:
  - Clustering quality does not improve or degrades after collaboration
  - One view/modality dominates the collaboration due to high weight
  - Collaboration terms become too large or too small, leading to numerical instability

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the method to a simple synthetic dataset with known clusters and two views, one of which is a noisy version of the other. Verify that the collaboration improves the clustering of the noisy view without degrading the clean view.
  2. Apply the method to the NUS-2B subset as in the paper, but vary the number of clusters K and measure the impact on clustering quality. Verify that the method is robust to the choice of K.
  3. Apply the method to a dataset with three modalities (e.g., text, image, and audio) and verify that the multi-modal collaboration improves clustering quality compared to using only multi-view collaboration within each modality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
No specific open questions were called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifics for the NMF algorithm and collaboration phases, particularly regarding gradient descent updates and cluster prototype initialization.
- Parameter settings for PCA and T-SNE are not specified, which could affect data dimensionality and visualization outcomes.
- The method's performance on datasets with more than two modalities is not explored.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core mechanism of using inner product-based collaboration terms to improve clustering quality
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of optimizing collaboration weights based on collaborative term magnitude
- Medium confidence in the overall improvement of clustering quality through multi-modal multi-view collaboration

## Next Checks
1. Validate the optimization of collaboration weights by testing the method on a synthetic dataset with known clusters and varying levels of noise across views.
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters (e.g., number of components in NMF, number of clusters K) to ensure robustness of the method.
3. Extend the evaluation to datasets with more than two modalities to assess the scalability and effectiveness of the multi-modal collaboration approach.
