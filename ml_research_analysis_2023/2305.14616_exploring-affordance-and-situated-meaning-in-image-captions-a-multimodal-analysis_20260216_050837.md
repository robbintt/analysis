# Exploring Affordance and Situated Meaning in Image Captions: A Multimodal Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14616
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: Gibsonian affordance correlates with higher frequency of holding-verbs and container-nouns in captions compared to telic affordance

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the grounding problem in multimodal semantic representation by annotating images from Flickr30k with five perceptual properties: Affordance, Perceptual Salience, Object Number, Gaze Cueing, and Ecological Niche Association (ENA). Using a multiple linear regression model, the research analyzes how these properties influence linguistic expressions in image captions. The findings reveal that Gibsonian affordance leads to more frequent use of holding-verbs and container-nouns compared to telic affordance, while perceptual salience, object number, and ENA also significantly affect caption content.

## Method Summary
The study employs Flickr30k images with captions, focusing on 733 manually selected images involving container-like objects (3665 captions total). Images are annotated with five perceptual properties: Affordance (telic vs. Gibsonian), Perceptual Salience, Object Number, Gaze Cueing, and ENA. Captions are lemmatized and POS-tagged using spaCy. Multiple linear regression models analyze associations between perceptual properties and linguistic expressions, specifically holding-verbs and container-nouns usage, with normalized dependent variables on a 0-1 scale.

## Key Results
- Images with Gibsonian affordance show higher frequency of holding-verbs and container-nouns in captions compared to telic affordance
- Perceptual salience positively correlates with use of holding-verbs in captions
- Object number has significant positive relationship with holding-verbs usage
- ENA shows negative association with container-nouns, suggesting conventional scenes reduce need to mention containers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating situated meaning and affordance grounding leads to more contextually accurate image captions.
- Mechanism: The study uses a multiple linear regression model to analyze how perceptual properties (affordance, salience, object number, gaze cueing, and ecological niche association) influence the linguistic choices in image captions. The model finds significant associations, suggesting that these properties guide how humans conceptualize and describe images.
- Core assumption: Cognitive attention, semantic nuances, and multimodal integration are essential for comprehensive object/event understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings reveal that images with Gibsonian affordance show a higher frequency of captions containing 'holding-verbs' and 'container-nouns' compared to images displaying telic affordance."
  - [section] "Our findings suggest that a comprehensive understanding of an object or event requires cognitive attention, semantic distinctions in linguistic expression, and multimodal construction."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors are not directly related to the specific mechanisms of this study, though they touch on related topics like affordance and image captioning.
- Break condition: If the perceptual properties do not significantly influence linguistic choices in captions, or if the regression model fails to find associations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The type of affordance (telic vs. Gibsonian) influences the choice of verbs in image captions.
- Mechanism: Telic affordance implies purposeful, intentional use of objects, leading to more specific, informative verbs. Gibsonian affordance, representing mere interaction, results in more general "holding-verbs."
- Core assumption: The conceptualization of an object's function (purposeful vs. interactive) directly impacts the linguistic expression of actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "images with Gibsonian affordance show a higher frequency of captions containing 'holding-verbs' and 'container-nouns' compared to images displaying telic affordance."
  - [section] "Our hypothesis posits that there is a stronger tendency for individuals to use holding-verbs in captions of images annotated as 'G,' as compared to those marked as 'T.'"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not specifically address the distinction between telic and Gibsonian affordance.
- Break condition: If the frequency of holding-verbs does not differ significantly between telic and Gibsonian affordance images.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Perceptual salience, object number, and ecological niche association (ENA) are significant predictors of linguistic choices in image captions.
- Mechanism: High perceptual salience increases the likelihood of mentioning objects in captions. Singular objects are more likely to be described with container-nouns. Conventional scenes (high ENA) reduce the need to explicitly mention containers.
- Core assumption: Human attention and context influence how objects are linguistically represented in image descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Perceptual Salience, Object Number, and ENA are also associated with the choice of linguistic expressions."
  - [section] "The Perceptual salience of the container is found to have a positive relationship with the use of holding-verbs... Object number has a significant positive relationship with the use of holding-verbs... ENA has an estimate of -0.0208 and p-value 0.0041."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not specifically address perceptual salience, object number, or ENA.
- Break condition: If perceptual salience, object number, or ENA do not significantly predict linguistic choices in captions.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Flickr30k images -> Perceptual properties annotation -> Lemmatization and POS-tagging -> Multiple linear regression analysis -> Statistical associations
- Critical path: 1. Select images from Flickr30k dataset 2. Annotate images with perceptual properties 3. Lemmatize and POS-tag captions 4. Analyze holding-verbs and container-nouns distribution 5. Run multiple linear regression model 6. Interpret results
- Design tradeoffs: Subjective selection of target images may introduce bias; need for consensus on annotations; limited generalizability beyond container-like objects
- Failure signatures: Weak correlations between perceptual properties and linguistic choices; multicollinearity issues in regression model; inconsistent annotations across annotators
- First 3 experiments: 1. Validate annotation agreement on a subset of images 2. Test regression model on a held-out set of images 3. Analyze the impact of each perceptual property individually on linguistic choices

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the inclusion of additional perceptual properties beyond the five studied affect the grounding of multimodal semantic representation?
- Can the findings of this study be generalized to other image captioning datasets beyond Flickr30k, and what factors might influence such generalizability?
- How can the insights from this study on situated meaning and affordance grounding be applied to improve the performance of natural language understanding systems in diverse scenarios?

## Limitations
- Findings are based on a limited set of perceptual properties and may not generalize to other object categories beyond container-like objects
- Subjective selection of target images and need for consensus on annotations introduce potential bias
- Focus on specific linguistic expressions (holding-verbs and container-nouns) may overlook other important aspects of image description

## Confidence
- High: The association between Gibsonian affordance and higher frequency of holding-verbs and container-nouns in captions is well-supported by the data and analysis.
- Medium: The influence of perceptual salience, object number, and ENA on linguistic choices in captions is statistically significant but may be subject to contextual factors not fully accounted for.
- Low: The generalizability of findings beyond container-like objects and the specific set of linguistic expressions analyzed is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the annotation process with a different set of images and objects to assess the generalizability of the findings.
2. Conduct a qualitative analysis of image descriptions to identify additional linguistic patterns influenced by perceptual properties.
3. Investigate the impact of individual perceptual properties on linguistic choices by analyzing them separately in the regression model.
