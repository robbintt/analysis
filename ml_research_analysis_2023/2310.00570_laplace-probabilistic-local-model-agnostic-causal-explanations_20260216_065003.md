# LaPLACE: Probabilistic Local Model-Agnostic Causal Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00570
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00570
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Probabilistic causal explanations using Markov blankets outperform LIME and SHAP in local accuracy and consistency

## Executive Summary
LaPLACE introduces a probabilistic graphical model approach for generating local explanations of classifier predictions. The method leverages Markov blankets to automatically identify relevant features without predefining the number of features, then constructs Bayesian networks to provide probabilistic causal explanations. By using conditional probabilities and causal relationships among features, LaPLACE generates human-understandable cause-and-effect explanations that demonstrate superior local accuracy and consistency compared to established methods like LIME and SHAP.

## Method Summary
LaPLACE generates probabilistic causal explanations through a multi-step process. First, it creates perturbed data by sampling from the training distribution. Then it identifies the Markov blanket of the target variable using the IPC-MB algorithm, which contains the minimal set of features sufficient for prediction. Next, it learns the causal structure among these features and estimates conditional probabilities to construct a Bayesian network. Finally, it uses these conditional probabilities to generate probabilistic explanations of individual predictions, providing both the relevant features and their causal relationships with uncertainty quantification.

## Key Results
- Local accuracy (weighted F1 scores) up to 1.000, outperforming LIME and SHAP
- Consistency (entropy scores) as low as 2.31, demonstrating stable feature selection
- Superior performance across multiple datasets and classifiers while handling trust-related concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LaPLACE uses Markov blankets to automatically select optimal feature subsets for explaining predictions. The Markov blanket contains the minimal set of features statistically sufficient to predict the target variable, eliminating the need to predefine a fixed number of top features. This works under the faithfulness assumption that the Markov blanket is unique and contains all necessary features for prediction.

### Mechanism 2
The approach generates probabilistic causal explanations by learning both structure and parameters of a Bayesian network over the Markov blanket features. After identifying relevant features, LaPLACE learns causal relationships among them and estimates conditional probabilities, enabling computation of P(target|MB) to generate explanations with uncertainty quantification.

### Mechanism 3
LaPLACE achieves higher local accuracy and consistency than LIME and SHAP by using a more principled approach to feature selection and explanation. By selecting features based on statistical sufficiency rather than feature importance, and providing explanations as causal graphs with probabilities, the method produces more faithful and stable explanations aligned with the true decision process.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov blanket**
  - Why needed here: Enables automatic selection of optimal feature subset for explanation without predefining N
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of features that make up a Markov blanket of a target variable?

- **Concept: Bayesian network structure learning**
  - Why needed here: Essential for learning causal structure among Markov blanket features to generate accurate probabilistic explanations
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of exact Bayesian network structure learning, and why is it a challenge for LaPLACE?

- **Concept: Conditional probability estimation**
  - Why needed here: Necessary for quantifying causal relationships and generating probabilistic explanations
  - Quick check question: What is the standard approach for estimating conditional probabilities in Bayesian networks, and what is its computational complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (classifier, instance, data) -> Perturbation module -> MB learning module -> Structure learning module -> Parameter learning module -> Explanation module
- **Critical path:** Perturbation -> MB learning -> Structure learning -> Parameter learning -> Explanation
- **Design tradeoffs:** High computational complexity for more principled and accurate explanations vs. faster but less interpretable feature importance-based methods
- **Failure signatures:** Incomplete or irrelevant features in MB, inaccurate causal structure, misleading conditional probabilities, low local accuracy or consistency
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify MB learning: Check if MB contains known relevant features for a simple synthetic dataset
  2. Test structure learning: Compare learned structure to ground truth on a small BN
  3. Validate explanations: Assess local accuracy and consistency on a benchmark dataset with a simple classifier

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can LaPLACE be extended to handle non-tabular data types such as text, images, or time series data? The paper focuses exclusively on tabular data without addressing applicability to other data types.

- **Open Question 2:** What specific heuristics or algorithmic improvements could reduce the computational complexity of structure learning while maintaining explanation quality? The paper acknowledges computational challenges but does not propose specific solutions.

- **Open Question 3:** How can fairness evaluation be systematically integrated into LaPLACE to provide quantitative fairness metrics alongside causal explanations? The paper mentions fairness as an unaddressed issue but provides no framework for integration.

## Limitations
- High computational complexity due to intensive structure learning requirements
- Relies on faithfulness assumption and quality of Markov blanket learning
- Limited empirical validation on small datasets and narrow set of classifiers

## Confidence
- **Core claims:** Medium
  - Theoretical foundation is sound but empirical validation is limited
  - Superior performance over LIME/SHAP needs more rigorous statistical testing
- **Computational efficiency claims:** Low
  - Computational complexity acknowledged but not thoroughly benchmarked
  - No comparative runtime analysis with established methods

## Next Checks
1. Stress-test MB learning on high-dimensional synthetic data with known causal structure to assess robustness
2. Compare computational efficiency against LIME/SHAP on datasets with varying sizes to quantify the cost of probabilistic explanations
3. Evaluate explanation stability when training data distribution shifts to assess real-world applicability
