# Explainable Multi-View Deep Networks Methodology for Experimental Physics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08206
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08206
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SSG architecture achieves 84% accuracy and 93% AUC in foam quality classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving explainability in multi-view deep learning models for physical experiments, specifically for classifying foam quality in High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) experiments using multiple imaging representations. The authors propose four multi-view architectures with different levels of view similarity and introduce a methodology to enhance interpretability by training one-view classifiers with frozen feature extractors. Applied to an expanded HEDP foam dataset, the SSG architecture achieved the best performance with 84% accuracy and 93% AUC, outperforming the previously used CSV architecture (78% accuracy, 83% AUC).

## Method Summary
The methodology proposes four multi-view CNN architectures (CSV, SSG, PSG, CDV) that vary in how they handle view relationships through feature extraction and pooling strategies. After initial multi-view training, feature extractors are frozen and used to train one-view classifiers for each view or subgroup. This enables interpretability through LIME and SHAP methods while maintaining classification performance. The approach is applied to an expanded HEDP foam dataset with 123 samples across 5 imaging views.

## Key Results
- SSG architecture achieved 84% accuracy and 93% AUC, outperforming CSV baseline (78% accuracy, 83% AUC)
- The methodology enables both local and global explainability through one-view classifiers
- Demonstrates a trade-off between performance and explainability across different architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The SSG architecture outperforms CSV because it aligns feature extractors with naturally clustered view groups, reducing representation mismatch. By clustering views into subgroups with shared visual attributes and assigning each subgroup its own feature extractor, the model can learn more discriminative features without forcing a single extractor to generalize across dissimilar views.

### Mechanism 2
Freezing feature extractors and attaching one-view classifiers enables both local and global explainability without sacrificing too much accuracy. By freezing the weights of the multi-view feature extractors after training, then training separate classifiers on each view, the model preserves view-specific feature mappings. This allows explainability methods like LIME and SHAP to be applied to each one-view classifier, revealing which image regions influence predictions for each view independently.

### Mechanism 3
The trade-off between explainability and performance is managed by selecting architectures with appropriate granularity of view separation. CSV offers highest performance but lowest explainability per view because all views share a single feature extractor. SSG balances performance and explainability by grouping similar views. CDV maximizes explainability per view but reduces performance due to lack of shared learning across views.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-view learning
  - Why needed here: HEDP experiments use multiple imaging modalities (optical, confocal, etc.) that must be combined to classify foam quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you name at least two different imaging modalities used in the HEDP foam dataset?

- Concept: Explainability methods (LIME, SHAP)
  - Why needed here: Deep learning models are "black boxes"; for scientific credibility, we need to understand which image regions drive predictions.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between LIME and SHAP in terms of the type of interpretability they provide?

- Concept: View pooling and feature blending
  - Why needed here: Multi-view models combine features from different views, but this blending can obscure which view contributed what, making explainability harder.
  - Quick check question: Why does view pooling make it difficult to attribute model decisions to individual views?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer (5 views) -> Feature extractors (1-5 CNNs) -> View pooling layer -> Classifier(s) -> EXPLAINer (frozen extractor + one-view classifier)

- Critical path: 1. Train multi-view model end-to-end, 2. Freeze feature extractors, 3. Attach one-view classifiers, 4. Train one-view classifiers, 5. Apply LIME/SHAP to each one-view classifier

- Design tradeoffs: CSV (highest performance, lowest per-view explainability), SSG (balanced performance and explainability), PSG (good explainability but potentially lower performance), CDV (highest explainability, lowest performance)

- Failure signatures: Poor convergence during multi-view training (check if views are too dissimilar), one-view classifiers perform poorly (feature extractor may not capture view-specific features), explanations are vague or inconsistent (view pooling may be blending features too aggressively)

- First 3 experiments: 1. Train CSV on expanded dataset and verify 78% accuracy baseline, 2. Train SSG and compare accuracy (target 84%) and AUC (target 93%), 3. Apply LIME/SHAP to one-view classifiers and visualize explanations for a test sample

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance trade-off between explainability and accuracy vary across different multi-view architectures (CSV, SSG, PSG, CDV) in diverse scientific domains? The paper focuses on a specific use case in HEDP experiments and does not provide empirical evidence of how the trade-off varies across different scientific contexts.

### Open Question 2
What are the specific challenges and limitations of applying the proposed explainability methodology to other multi-view deep learning models beyond CNNs in the vision domain? The paper does not address how the methodology adapts to different types of multi-view models, which may have distinct architectural complexities.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of normal-defective examples impact the model's performance and explainability in the HEDP foam classification task? The paper mentions these examples might confuse the model and were excluded, but acknowledges their potential impact on model training without detailed analysis.

## Limitations

- The claim that SSG outperforms CSV relies on visual similarity assumptions between view subgroups that are not empirically validated
- The trade-off between explainability and performance is described qualitatively but not quantified across architectures
- The effectiveness of freezing feature extractors for one-view classifiers is assumed but not rigorously tested against end-to-end training

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: CSV architecture achieves 78% accuracy and 83% AUC as baseline performance metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: SSG architecture achieves 84% accuracy and 93% AUC, representing improvement over CSV
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism by which freezing feature extractors preserves discriminative features for one-view classifiers is not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Test SSG architecture on datasets where view subgroups have less natural visual similarity to verify the clustering assumption
2. Compare frozen feature extractor approach against end-to-end one-view training to quantify explainability-performance trade-off
3. Apply the methodology to a different scientific domain (e.g., medical imaging) to validate generalizability
