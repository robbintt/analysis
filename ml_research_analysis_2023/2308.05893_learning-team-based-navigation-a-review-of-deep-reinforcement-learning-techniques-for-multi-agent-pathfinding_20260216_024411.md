# Learning Team-Based Navigation: A Review of Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Multi-Agent Pathfinding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05893
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Review of DRL techniques for MAPF with proposed new evaluation metrics (DAF and Crowdedness)

## Executive Summary
This review paper examines the application of deep reinforcement learning techniques to multi-agent pathfinding problems. The paper highlights how DRL approaches address key challenges in MAPF including computational efficiency, collision avoidance, and adaptability to complex environments. The review covers various DRL algorithm categories (value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods) and proposes new metrics for evaluating MAPF algorithms. The authors identify model-based DRL as a promising future direction for improving planning capabilities in MAPF scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a comprehensive review of DRL approaches applied to MAPF problems, examining existing algorithms and their applications. The methods discussed include value-based approaches (DQN, Dueling-DQN), policy gradient methods, and actor-critic methods (PPO, A2C, A3C, MADDPG). The review synthesizes existing work without presenting new experimental results, focusing instead on theoretical foundations and potential applications. The paper also proposes new evaluation metrics (DAF and Crowdedness) to better capture problem complexity.

## Key Results
- DRL-based approaches show promise for decentralized MAPF execution in partially observable environments
- Proposed DAF and Crowdedness metrics can better evaluate MAPF algorithm performance across different problem instances
- Model-based DRL approaches offer potential advantages for long-range planning in MAPF
- Actor-critic methods demonstrate particular effectiveness for multi-agent coordination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: DRL methods adapt to complex and dynamic MAPF environments without explicit environmental modeling
- **Mechanism**: DRL algorithms learn optimal policies through trial-and-error interaction, using neural networks to approximate value functions or policies for decentralized decision-making
- **Core assumption**: Partial observability can be overcome through sufficient interaction data
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract highlights DRL's adaptability to new contexts and uncertainty; section 2.2.1 emphasizes elimination of explicit coordination mechanisms
- **Break condition**: When environments change too rapidly or partial observability is too severe

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: DAF and Crowdedness metrics provide better MAPF algorithm evaluation
- **Mechanism**: DAF quantifies available action freedom while Crowdedness measures environmental congestion, enabling nuanced comparison across problem instances
- **Core assumption**: Different MAPF instances have varying difficulty levels not captured by standard metrics
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 2.3 discusses the need for space efficiency utilization metrics and congestion-based difficulty assessment
- **Break condition**: When metrics don't correlate with actual performance or become computationally expensive

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Model-based DRL enables proactive planning and improved sample efficiency for MAPF
- **Mechanism**: Learned dynamics models allow agents to simulate future states and plan accordingly, addressing long-range planning challenges
- **Core assumption**: Reliable environment models can be learned from experience data
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 4 discusses model-based DRL's simulation capabilities and potential for informed decision-making
- **Break condition**: When learned models are inaccurate or computational costs outweigh benefits

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: MAPF is formulated as a Markov Game extending MDPs to multi-agent settings
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between an MDP and a POMDP, and why is this distinction important for MAPF?

- **Concept**: Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm categories
  - Why needed here: Paper discusses various DRL approaches and their MAPF applications
  - Quick check question: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of actor-critic methods compared to pure value-based or policy gradient methods?

- **Concept**: Multi-Agent Path Finding problem formulation
  - Why needed here: Paper builds on specific MAPF formulations and constraints
  - Quick check question: What are the key conditions that must be satisfied for a valid MAPF solution, and how do these relate to the objective functions discussed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Multiple autonomous agents in shared environment, each with observation space, action space, and reward function. System modeled as Partially Observable Markov Game with agents using different DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO, MADDPG, etc.).

- **Critical path**: 1) Environment initialization with agents, obstacles, goals 2) Agent observation gathering 3) Policy inference using DRL network 4) Action execution and environment update 5) Reward calculation 6) Experience storage and network update

- **Design tradeoffs**: Centralized vs decentralized execution (computational efficiency vs global optimality), model-free vs model-based approaches (simplicity vs planning capability), different DRL algorithm choices (stability vs sample efficiency), communication vs non-communication approaches (coordination vs scalability)

- **Failure signatures**: High collision rates indicating poor policy learning, failure to converge during training, poor generalization to new environments, computational bottlenecks in real-time execution, deadlocks in constrained environments

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement simple grid-based MAPF environment with 2-4 agents and test basic DQN agent to verify environment-agent interaction loop
  2. Add dynamic obstacles and evaluate success rate improvements using PPO vs DQN
  3. Implement DAF and Crowdedness metrics and validate them on benchmark MAPF scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing hybrid approaches combining model-based DRL with other MAPF techniques on various benchmarks

## Limitations
- Paper is a review without original experimental results or quantitative comparisons
- Practical scalability limits of DRL-based MAPF solutions in real-world scenarios are not thoroughly examined
- Computational overhead of different DRL approaches relative to traditional MAPF algorithms is not quantified

## Confidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement DAF and Crowdedness metrics on benchmark MAPF datasets and verify correlation with actual algorithm performance across different problem classes
2. Conduct head-to-head comparisons of model-free vs model-based DRL approaches on standardized MAPF scenarios, measuring both success rates and computational efficiency
3. Test generalization capability of DRL-trained MAPF agents across different environment types to validate claimed adaptability to complex environments
