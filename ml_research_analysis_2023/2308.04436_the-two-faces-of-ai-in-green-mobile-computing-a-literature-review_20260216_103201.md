# The Two Faces of AI in Green Mobile Computing: A Literature Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04436
- Reference count: 40
- 34 papers analyzed on AI applications in mobile energy efficiency from 2013-2022

## Executive Summary
This literature review systematically examines 34 research papers on AI applications in mobile energy efficiency published between 2013 and 2022. The field has experienced significant growth since 2019, with most studies proposing solutions rather than analyzing AI's own energy consumption. The research reveals a striking imbalance: 23 papers use AI to improve energy efficiency while only 11 study the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems. The review identifies key research topics including offloading, context adaptation, and federated learning, while highlighting critical gaps in tool provision and industry involvement.

## Method Summary
The study employed a systematic literature review methodology using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to Google Scholar search results. Researchers conducted bidirectional snowballing on selected papers and extracted data across seven categories: publication year, study type, AI role category, topic, level of study, industry involvement, and tool provision. The review focused on peer-reviewed papers in English, published after 2012, that dealt with AI and mobile energy consumption at the software level.

## Key Results
- Publication growth: ~2 papers/year before 2019, ~6 papers/year after 2019
- Solution-oriented studies dominate: 32/34 papers propose solutions
- Tool provision is rare: Only 2 studies provide publicly available tools
- Industry involvement is minimal: 28/34 papers are purely academic with no industry-only papers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AI has two roles in mobile energy use: reducing consumption and consuming energy itself
- Mechanism: The literature shows a clear split where 23/34 papers use AI to improve energy efficiency (AI4E) while 11/34 study the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems (EofAI)
- Core assumption: Papers can be cleanly categorized into these two roles based on their primary research focus
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these devices"
  - [section]: "Around 68% of the papers (i.e., 23 out of 34 papers) deal with the use of artificial intelligence to tackle the mobile energy consumption (cf. AI4E in Figure 3), while the rest (i.e., 11 out of 34 papers) studies the energy consumption of the use of artificial intelligence in mobile devices (cf. EofAI in Figure 3)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains related papers on green computing and AI but no direct evidence of this specific dual-role mechanism
- Break condition: If papers cannot be clearly categorized into AI4E vs EofAI roles due to overlapping research objectives

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interest in AI for mobile energy efficiency has increased significantly since 2019
- Mechanism: Publication count shows a clear trend from ~2 papers per year before 2019 to ~6 papers per year after 2019
- Core assumption: The observed trend represents genuine research interest rather than artifact of search methodology
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our results showcase a growing interest in the intersection between AI and Mobile Computing Energy since 2019. Most studies revolve around solution papers (32 out of 34 papers)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains recent papers but no historical data to validate the trend
- Break condition: If the trend is driven by changes in publication venues or search engine indexing rather than actual research activity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Academic institutions dominate research in this field with minimal industry involvement
- Mechanism: 28/34 papers have only academic authors while only 6/34 have mixed academic-industrial authorship, with no papers having only industrial authors
- Core assumption: Author affiliation data accurately represents research ownership and contribution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "the vast majority of the papers are authored by academic researchers (28 out of 34 papers), while 6 papers have authors being a mix of researchers with an academic and industrial background"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus does not contain information about author affiliations to validate this claim
- Break condition: If industry research is published under different channels not captured in the academic literature search

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systematic literature review methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper uses systematic literature review to identify and categorize relevant research papers
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in a systematic literature review according to Kitchenham's guidelines?

- Concept: AI energy consumption measurement
  - Why needed here: Understanding how AI energy consumption is measured and compared is crucial for evaluating the EofAI papers
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in measuring AI energy consumption on mobile devices?

- Concept: Federated learning energy trade-offs
  - Why needed here: Federated learning is a major topic in the literature, requiring understanding of its energy implications
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning's distributed training model affect overall energy consumption compared to centralized training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Literature search and selection system -> Classification framework (AI4E vs EofAI) -> Topic categorization engine -> Author affiliation analyzer -> Tool provision detector

- Critical path:
  1. Initial search query execution
  2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria application
  3. Snowballing for additional papers
  4. Data extraction and classification
  5. Analysis and synthesis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Broad vs narrow search terms (tradeoff between completeness and relevance)
  - Single vs multiple snowballing iterations (tradeoff between effort and completeness)
  - Manual vs automated classification (tradeoff between accuracy and scalability)

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent classification between reviewers
  - Missing relevant papers despite snowballing
  - Incomplete tool provision information
  - Unclear AI role categorization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate classification consistency by having multiple reviewers independently classify 10% of papers
  2. Test search term sensitivity by varying query parameters and measuring changes in results
  3. Verify snowballing effectiveness by comparing results with and without backward snowballing for a subset of papers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do studies focused on using AI to reduce energy consumption significantly outnumber those studying the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems is under-studied in comparison to the usage of AI for energy-efficient mobile computing"
- Why unresolved: Despite the clear recognition of this imbalance, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this research gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive survey of researchers in the field to understand barriers, priorities, and resource constraints that lead to this disparity in research focus.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific technical challenges that prevent more researchers from making their AI-based mobile energy efficiency solutions publicly available as tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "only very few papers provide available tools to address the mobile energy consumption involving artificial intelligence"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the lack of tool provision but doesn't investigate the underlying technical, resource, or incentive-related barriers that prevent researchers from sharing their implementations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the development, maintenance, and distribution costs of such tools, along with interviews with researchers about their decision-making process regarding tool provision.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can industry be effectively incentivized to increase their involvement in research on AI for green mobile computing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "we need to promote the involvement of the mobile software industry in this field" and notes that most contributions are purely academic
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the lack of industry involvement, it doesn't propose specific mechanisms or incentives that could encourage greater industry participation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of successful industry-academia collaborations in similar fields, along with empirical data on the ROI of industry investment in green mobile computing research.

## Limitations

- Small sample size: Only 34 papers analyzed over a decade, potentially missing relevant research
- Selection bias: Reliance on Google Scholar and manual snowballing may introduce systematic biases
- Publication bias: The review may overrepresent positive results that are more likely to be published

## Confidence

- Publication trend analysis: High
- AI role categorization: Medium
- Industry involvement assessment: Low

## Next Checks

1. Validate the AI4E vs EofAI classification by having multiple independent reviewers categorize a random sample of 10 papers and measuring inter-rater agreement
2. Replicate the search process using alternative databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library) to assess the comprehensiveness of the literature coverage
3. Conduct citation analysis on the 34 papers to identify influential works and verify the completeness of the topic categorization
