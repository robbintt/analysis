# A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.13940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13940
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: MMGN achieves comparable or better estimation accuracy while being significantly faster than existing methods for 1-bit matrix completion.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MMGN, a fast and accurate algorithm for 1-bit matrix completion. The method uses the majorization-minimization principle to convert the problem into a sequence of standard low-rank matrix completion problems, which are then solved using a factorization approach and a Gauss-Newton method. MMGN demonstrates comparable or better estimation accuracy than existing methods while being significantly faster, particularly for spiky matrices and when the fraction of observed entries is small.

## Method Summary
MMGN solves 1-bit matrix completion by iteratively constructing quadratic majorizations of the negative log-likelihood and solving the resulting low-rank matrix completion subproblems using a factorization approach with a single Gauss-Newton step. The method estimates the rank by validation on a held-out subset of observations. The algorithm is simple to implement and scales well to large matrices.

## Key Results
- MMGN achieves comparable or better estimation accuracy than TraceNorm and MaxNorm methods
- MMGN is significantly faster than existing methods, especially for spiky matrices and when the fraction of observed entries is small
- The method is simple to implement and scales well to large matrices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MMGN reduces 1-bit matrix completion to a sequence of standard low-rank matrix completion problems by majorization-minimization.
- Mechanism: The negative log-likelihood ℓ(Θ) is upper bounded by a quadratic majorization g(Θ|Θ̃) at the current iterate Θ̃. Minimizing this quadratic surrogate subject to rank constraint yields a standard least squares problem.
- Core assumption: The CDF Φ satisfies: (A1) log Φ(θ) is L-Lipschitz differentiable; (A2) φ(θ) is symmetric around zero.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our method is based on the majorization-minimization principle, which yields a sequence of standard low-rank matrix completion problems in our setting."
  - [section]: "To derive our majorization, we assume the CDF Φ(θ) in (3) satisfies the following two conditions."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found; core assumption relies on common CDF properties.
- Break condition: If Φ does not satisfy A1 or A2, the quadratic majorization fails and the algorithm loses its theoretical descent guarantee.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Factorization + Gauss-Newton approximates the rank-constrained least squares subproblem efficiently.
- Mechanism: Express Θ = UV^T with U∈ℝ^{m×r}, V∈ℝ^{n×r}, solve the linearized problem minimize_{∆U,∆V} ‖X - U∆V^T - ∆U V^T‖²_{Ω}, and select the least l2-norm solution.
- Core assumption: Single Gauss-Newton step with least-norm selection provides a descent direction without expensive inner iterations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We solve (7) using a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm... We address three important details about our approach."
  - [section]: "Motivated by computational considerations, we inexactly solve the MM optimization problem by taking a single Gauss-Newton step."
  - [corpus]: Weak; relies on Zilber & Nadler (2022) but not directly cited in text.
- Break condition: If the residual is large, a single step may be too coarse; backtracking line search compensates but slows progress.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The rank is estimated by validation on a held-out subset, making the method robust to unknown true rank.
- Mechanism: Split observed entries into training (80%) and validation (20%); fit for candidate ranks {r₁,...,r_K}; select r that maximizes validation likelihood.
- Core assumption: The validation set is representative and large enough to distinguish ranks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For MMGN, we use the following validation approach to estimate the rank r... Given a candidate set of K ranks {r₁,...,r_K}, we randomly split the observations into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%)."
  - [section]: "We select the candidate rank which produces the greatest likelihood among all K candidates as our estimate of the rank r."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; described only in paper text.
- Break condition: If validation set is too small or noisy, rank selection may overfit or underfit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Majorization-Minimization (MM) principle
  - Why needed here: Converts non-convex likelihood minimization into a sequence of tractable convex subproblems.
  - Quick check question: What are the two conditions a surrogate function must satisfy in MM?

- Concept: Matrix factorization for low-rank constraints
  - Why needed here: Enforces rank-r structure while reducing optimization to lower-dimensional space.
  - Quick check question: How does expressing Θ = UV^T help solve the rank constraint?

- Concept: Gauss-Newton method for nonlinear least squares
  - Why needed here: Provides a fast, locally convergent update without full second-order computation.
  - Quick check question: Why is a single Gauss-Newton step sufficient in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data loader -> split into train/validation sets -> MM loop: construct majorization -> factorize -> Gauss-Newton update -> rank selection: train on subset, evaluate on validation set -> Output: final rank-r estimate of Θ
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize U₀, V₀
  2. Build quadratic majorization (X matrix)
  3. Solve linearized least squares (∆U*, ∆V*)
  4. Armijo backtracking if needed
  5. Update U, V
  6. Check convergence
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact MM minimization vs. single Gauss-Newton step (speed vs. accuracy)
  - Fixed rank vs. data-driven rank selection (simplicity vs. adaptivity)
  - Full vs. compressed storage (memory vs. generality)
- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence: objective increases despite backtracking
  - Slow convergence: many backtracking steps triggered
  - Poor rank selection: validation likelihood flat across candidates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Small synthetic probit data (m=n=100, r*=1, ρ=0.8) to verify convergence and rank selection.
  2. Compare MMGN vs. TraceNorm on non-spiky matrix with varying noise σ to reproduce Figure 1 trends.
  3. Test spikiness sensitivity: generate t-distributed factors with ν=4,5,10, measure runtime and error vs. ρ.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does MMGN always converge to the global maximum likelihood solution under suitable assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note this as an open problem, stating "it is of interest to prove that under suitable assumptions, and possibly starting from a sufficiently accurate initial guess, MMGN indeed converges to the maximum likelihood solution."
- Why unresolved: While the MM principle guarantees monotonic decrease in the objective function, proving global convergence to the maximum likelihood solution requires additional theoretical analysis beyond what is provided in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous mathematical proof showing that under certain conditions on the initial guess and problem parameters, MMGN converges to the global maximum likelihood solution.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of MMGN compare to other 1-bit matrix completion methods on real-world datasets beyond MovieLens?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors only evaluate MMGN on the MovieLens dataset, stating "We applied MMGN to the MovieLens (1M) data set" and comparing it to TraceNorm and MaxNorm.
- Why unresolved: The paper only considers one real-world dataset, leaving open the question of how MMGN performs on other datasets with different characteristics (e.g., different noise levels, matrix sizes, or sparsity patterns).
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying MMGN to a variety of real-world datasets with different characteristics and comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can MMGN be extended to handle other quantization models beyond binary observations, such as movie ratings on a scale of 1-5?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention this as a practical direction for future research, stating "it is of interest to extend MMGN to other quantization models, such as movie ratings between 1 and 5."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on 1-bit matrix completion, where observations are binary. Extending the method to handle multi-level quantization would require developing new majorization functions and potentially modifying the factorization approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of an extended version of MMGN that can handle multi-level quantization, along with comparisons to existing methods for such problems.

## Limitations
- Reliance on specific CDF properties (Lipschitz log-derivative and symmetry around zero) for the majorization to hold
- Single Gauss-Newton step approximation may compromise convergence speed for matrices with high condition numbers or when residuals are large
- Rank selection via validation depends on the representativeness of the validation set

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The MM framework's theoretical foundation and the equivalence to standard low-rank matrix completion in the surrogate problem
- **Medium confidence**: The practical effectiveness of the single Gauss-Newton step approximation, as convergence depends heavily on the quality of the quadratic majorization
- **Medium confidence**: The rank selection via validation, as performance depends on the representativeness of the validation set

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm with alternative CDFs (logistic, Cauchy) to verify the majorization conditions hold beyond the probit case
2. Benchmark against exact MM minimization (multiple Gauss-Newton steps) on small problems to quantify the single-step approximation cost
3. Evaluate rank selection sensitivity by systematically varying validation set size and observing the stability of selected ranks across synthetic datasets
