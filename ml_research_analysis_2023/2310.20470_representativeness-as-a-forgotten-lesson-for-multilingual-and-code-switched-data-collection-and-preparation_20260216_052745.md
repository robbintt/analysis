# Representativeness as a Forgotten Lesson for Multilingual and Code-switched Data Collection and Preparation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20470
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20470
- Reference count: 40
- The study examines representativeness in multilingual and code-switched data collection, finding that most datasets involve English and ignore other language pairs, location-based variation, socio-demographic factors, and filtering issues.

## Executive Summary
This critical study examines representativeness in multilingual and code-switched (CSW) data collection and preparation. Analyzing 68 CSW datasets across speech and social media domains, the authors identify significant flaws stemming from ignoring location-based variation, socio-demographic factors, register differences, and unclear filtering practices. The study concludes that most CSW data involves English, ignoring other language pairs/tuples, and provides a checklist to improve representativeness for future data collection efforts.

## Method Summary
The study conducts a critical analysis of 68 CSW datasets from speech and social media domains, examining papers from ACL Anthology and Interspeech between 2008-2023. The authors analyze datasets for representativeness based on location-based variation, language coverage, register variation, socio-demographic variation, and filtering practices. Rather than proposing new methods, the study synthesizes findings from existing research to identify systematic issues in CSW data preparation and provides recommendations for improving future dataset collection.

## Key Results
- Most CSW datasets involve English and ignore other language pairs/tuples
- Representativeness flaws arise from ignoring location-based, socio-demographic, and register variation
- Lack of clarity on data selection and filtering stages compromises dataset representativeness
- The study provides a checklist to improve representativeness for future CSW data collection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ignoring location-based variation in code-switched data collection leads to system performance failures when models are deployed in different regions.
- Mechanism: Regional differences in multilingual communities create distinct code-switching patterns even within the same language pairs. When models are trained on data from one region and evaluated on another, substantial performance gaps emerge due to these unaddressed variations.
- Core assumption: Code-switching patterns are not uniform across geographic locations even for identical language pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "most CSW data involves English ignoring other language pairs/tuples"
  - [section] "we observe a substantial performance gap between 25% and 35% in Match Error Rate (MER) and Character Error Rate (CER) when the models were trained and evaluated on different data sets"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus shows related papers but doesn't provide geographic variation evidence
- Break condition: If code-switching patterns were uniform across regions, then location-based data collection variation would not impact model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Lack of socio-demographic information about speakers, data collectors, transcribers, and annotators creates representativeness gaps in CSW datasets.
- Mechanism: Socio-demographic factors (age, gender, language background) influence code-switching patterns. Without tracking this information throughout the data pipeline, datasets cannot accurately represent the target population's linguistic diversity.
- Core assumption: Socio-demographic characteristics systematically influence code-switching behavior and data preparation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "there are flaws in terms of representativeness in data collection and preparation stages due to ignoring the location based, socio-demographic and register variation in CSW"
  - [section] "Without knowing the socio-demographic information about the speakers/users in a CSW data set, it is not possible to assess what type of CSW patterns represent which type of speakers/users"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't address socio-demographic considerations
- Break condition: If socio-demographic factors had no systematic influence on code-switching patterns, then tracking this information would be unnecessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Filtering practices that remove monolingual content from code-switched datasets create systems that fail on real-world communication where both modalities coexist.
- Mechanism: Real-world multilingual communication involves fluid transitions between code-switching and monolingual speech. Filtering out monolingual portions creates datasets that don't reflect this reality, leading to poor system performance when encountering natural speech patterns.
- Core assumption: Monolingual and code-switched speech co-occur naturally in multilingual communication and should be represented together in training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "lack of clarity on the data selection and filtering stages shadow the representativeness of CSW data sets"
  - [section] "Shah et al. (2020) build ASR systems using monolingual and CSW data filtered from the same corpus and find that models that perform well on CSW data do not perform well on the monolingual data (and vice versa)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't address filtering practices
- Break condition: If real-world multilingual communication occurred exclusively in code-switched mode without monolingual transitions, then filtering would not create representativeness issues.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Representativeness in corpus linguistics
  - Why needed here: The entire study hinges on understanding what makes a dataset representative of real-world language use, particularly for code-switching
  - Quick check question: What is the core requirement for a corpus to enable generalizations about a language according to Biber (1993)?

- Concept: Socio-linguistic variation in multilingual contexts
  - Why needed here: The study emphasizes how factors like location, age, gender, and register create systematic variation in code-switching patterns
  - Quick check question: Which socio-demographic factors are identified as influencing code-switching patterns across different studies?

- Concept: Data filtering and its impact on language model performance
  - Why needed here: The study critiques current practices of filtering monolingual content from code-switched datasets, which creates performance issues
  - Quick check question: What happens to ASR system performance when models trained on filtered CSW data are evaluated on monolingual speech from the same speakers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data collection pipeline (location specification, speaker recruitment)
  - Socio-demographic tracking system (speakers, collectors, transcribers, annotators)
  - Filtering decision framework (criteria, documentation, representativeness assessment)
  - Quality validation module (performance gap analysis across regions/demographic groups)

- Critical path: Location-based data collection → Socio-demographic tracking → Appropriate filtering → Performance validation across target populations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Comprehensive socio-demographic tracking vs. privacy concerns and data collection burden
  - Representativeness vs. dataset size (more variation requires more data)
  - Filtering for specific use cases vs. maintaining natural code-switching patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance gaps >20% when models trained on one region are evaluated on another
  - Systematic errors on specific demographic groups (age, gender)
  - Poor performance on mixed monolingual-code-switched inputs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train ASR models on region-specific CSW data and evaluate cross-region performance to quantify location-based variation impact
  2. Collect CSW data with full socio-demographic tracking and analyze performance differences across demographic groups
  3. Create parallel datasets with and without monolingual content filtering, then compare real-world performance on mixed inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the linguistic variation in CSW patterns differ across regions for the same language pairs, and what are the underlying causes of these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that there is location-based variation in CSW patterns, citing the example of Mandarin-English CSW differing between Hong Kong and Singapore.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides evidence of regional variation, it does not delve into the specific linguistic features or underlying causes that contribute to these differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed linguistic analysis of CSW patterns across different regions, including phonetic, syntactic, and lexical features, along with socio-cultural studies to understand the underlying causes of regional variation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the age of annotators influence the quality and accuracy of CSW data annotation, and what are the specific challenges associated with annotating CSW data across different age groups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that age-related differences in CSW patterns have been observed, and Al Kuwatly et al. (2020) show that age of the annotators influences the annotation task.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific information on how age affects annotation quality or the challenges faced by annotators of different ages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of annotation quality and accuracy across different age groups, along with qualitative analysis of the challenges faced by annotators of different ages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for filtering CSW data while maintaining representativeness, and how can we minimize the loss of valuable data during the filtering process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the issues with filtering CSW data, mentioning that filtering based on scripts or languages can lead to loss of valuable data and affect the representativeness of the dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific guidelines or strategies for effective filtering that balances representativeness and data quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different filtering strategies and their impact on dataset representativeness, along with the development of new filtering techniques that minimize data loss.

## Limitations
- Cannot quantify full impact of representativeness issues due to incomplete metadata in reviewed datasets
- 68 analyzed datasets represent convenience samples rather than comprehensive coverage
- Many claims about specific filtering practices remain inferential rather than empirically verified
- Lack of access to raw data and detailed collection protocols limits definitive conclusions

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The identification of English-centrism in CSW datasets and the general lack of socio-demographic tracking are well-documented across multiple reviewed studies. The observation that location-based variation creates performance gaps is supported by direct empirical evidence from Shah et al. (2020).

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanisms linking specific socio-demographic factors to code-switching patterns are plausible based on sociolinguistic theory, but the strength and consistency of these relationships across different language pairs and communities requires further validation.

**Low Confidence**: The specific filtering practices and their representativeness impacts are often unclear from paper descriptions alone, making definitive claims about filtering mechanisms difficult to substantiate.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Regional Performance Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments training ASR models on CSW data from different geographic regions (e.g., India vs. Philippines for English-Hindi/Tagalog) and measure performance degradation when models are evaluated across regions.

2. **Socio-Demographic Impact Study**: Collect a new CSW dataset with comprehensive socio-demographic tracking (age, gender, education, language background) and systematically analyze how model performance varies across demographic groups.

3. **Filtering Impact Benchmark**: Create parallel CSW datasets with different filtering strategies (strict monolingual filtering vs. inclusive mixed-content approach) and evaluate both on real-world multilingual communication samples to quantify the impact on practical system performance.
