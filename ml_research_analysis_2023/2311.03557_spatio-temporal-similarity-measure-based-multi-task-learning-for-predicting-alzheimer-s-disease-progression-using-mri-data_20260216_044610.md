# Spatio-Temporal Similarity Measure based Multi-Task Learning for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression using MRI Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.03557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03557
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Spatio-temporal similarity measure + multi-task learning outperforms baseline ROI-based methods for AD progression prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression using MRI data by combining spatio-temporal similarity measures with multi-task learning. The method captures synergistic deterioration patterns between brain biomarkers by computing cosine similarity between temporal magnitude/velocity vectors, then uses structured regularization (TGL/cFSGL) to jointly predict cognitive scores across multiple time points. Experiments on ADNI data demonstrate significant improvements over traditional ROI-based approaches, with the method identifying key deteriorating biomarker pairs that correlate with disease progression.

## Method Summary
The method extracts cortical and subcortical morphological features from MRI scans using FreeSurfer, then computes temporal magnitude and velocity of biomarker changes between consecutive scans. Pairwise cosine similarity between these temporal vectors creates a rich spatio-temporal feature space capturing synergistic relationships. Multi-task learning with Temporal Group Lasso or Convex Fused Sparse Group Lasso regularization jointly predicts cognitive scores (MMSE, ADAS-cog) across multiple time points while ensuring temporal smoothness and feature selection. Stability selection identifies robust biomarker pairs critical for disease progression.

## Key Results
- Spatio-temporal similarity representation significantly outperforms baseline ROI-based methods with lower nMSE and rMSE
- Temporal Group Lasso with stability selection achieves best performance across cognitive scales and time points
- Stability selection identifies key synergistic deteriorating biomarker pairs, particularly involving cortical volumes and surface areas in regions like insula, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex
- Method demonstrates superior ability to capture complex disease progression patterns compared to traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal and spatial similarity between biomarkers captures synergistic deterioration patterns in AD progression
- Mechanism: The method defines temporal vectors using magnitude and velocity of biomarker changes, then computes cosine similarity between these vectors to quantify spatial relationships. This creates a rich feature space where synergistic relationships between biomarkers are encoded as high similarity values
- Core assumption: Synergistic deterioration between biomarkers manifests as correlated temporal and spatial change patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "novel spatio-temporal similarity measure combining temporal magnitude/velocity of biomarker changes with spatial cosine similarity between biomarker vectors"
  - [section]: "Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between two vectors to express the similarity of the temporal and spatial changes of two MRI biomarkers"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address spatio-temporal similarity measures, though related work on multi-task learning exists

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning with temporal smoothness regularization improves prediction accuracy across time points
- Mechanism: The TGL formulation includes a temporal smoothness term that ensures regression models at successive time points share common features, capturing the temporal progression of disease
- Core assumption: Disease progression at adjacent time points shares underlying feature patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "TGL contains a time smoothing term and a group Lasso term as constraints, which ensures that all regression models at different time points share a common set of features"
  - [section]: "the temporal smoothness term, which ensures a small deviation between two regression models at successive time points"
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - corpus includes papers on multi-task learning for AD prediction, though specific temporal smoothness regularization is not mentioned

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Stability selection identifies robust synergistic biomarker pairs that are critical for disease progression
- Mechanism: The method uses sub-sampling and multiple iterations to compute stability scores for feature pairs, identifying those that consistently appear across different samples and regularization parameters
- Core assumption: Critical biomarker relationships for disease progression are stable across different data subsets and model configurations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "stability selection was modified to meet our actual needs... To improve the interpretability and robustness of the results"
  - [section]: "the stability score Sj(f) for each feature f at task j: Sj(f) = max λ∈Λ {ˆπλ j}"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus does not contain papers specifically on stability selection for AD biomarker identification

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-task learning with structured regularization
  - Why needed here: AD progression involves multiple related prediction tasks (different time points, different cognitive measures) that can benefit from shared information
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between TGL and cFSGL regularization approaches?

- Concept: Spatio-temporal feature engineering
  - Why needed here: Traditional ROI-based methods ignore relationships between brain regions over time, which are crucial for understanding synergistic deterioration
  - Quick check question: How does the magnitude-velocity vector representation differ from raw biomarker values?

- Concept: Stability selection for feature identification
  - Why needed here: High-dimensional feature space (52975 pairs) requires robust feature selection to identify truly important biomarker relationships
  - Quick check question: Why use sub-sampling in stability selection rather than single model fitting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - MRI feature extraction (FreeSurfer) -> Temporal feature mapping (magnitude/velocity) -> Spatial feature mapping (cosine similarity) -> Feature selection (TGL + stability) -> Multi-task regression -> Prediction
  - Key modules: MRI feature extraction, similarity calculation, TGL solver, stability selection implementation

- Critical path:
  1. Extract cortical/subcortical features from MRI
  2. Compute magnitude and velocity for each biomarker pair
  3. Calculate cosine similarity between temporal vectors
  4. Apply TGL with stability selection to identify key features
  5. Train multi-task regression models
  6. Evaluate predictions and extract stable biomarker pairs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature dimensionality vs. sample size (curse of dimensionality)
  - Temporal smoothness vs. flexibility in capturing non-linear progression
  - Computational cost of stability selection vs. robustness of feature identification

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor prediction performance despite high-dimensional features
  - Instability in identified biomarker pairs across different runs
  - Overfitting when temporal smoothness is too strong

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline ROI-only multi-task learning without similarity features
  2. Full method with spatio-temporal similarity but without stability selection
  3. Comparison of different similarity measures (cosine vs. Euclidean vs. Mahalanobis)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed spatio-temporal similarity measure compare to other feature engineering approaches for AD progression prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare their cosine similarity approach to Mahalanobis Distance and Euclidean Distance, showing better performance, but do not compare to other potential feature engineering methods
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing different similarity measures rather than exploring alternative feature engineering strategies that could capture temporal and spatial relationships
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the spatio-temporal similarity measure to other feature engineering approaches like graph-based features, autoencoder representations, or attention mechanisms on the same ADNI dataset

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of time points to include for maximizing prediction performance while maintaining clinical feasibility?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that performance improves with more time points (baseline to M06, M12, M24, M36) but does not systematically explore the trade-off between prediction accuracy and practical constraints
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates specific time spans without exploring the relationship between number of time points, prediction accuracy, and practical considerations like patient burden and data availability
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis of prediction performance across different numbers of time points (2, 3, 4, 5+) while accounting for data sparsity and clinical practicality

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the identified synergistic deteriorating biomarker pairs vary across different AD progression stages or patient subgroups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify key biomarker pairs through stability selection but analyze them only at the population level without stratifying by disease stage or patient characteristics
- Why unresolved: The stability selection results are presented for the overall cohort without examining whether the synergistic relationships differ between early vs. late-stage patients, or between AD, MCI, and NL groups
- What evidence would resolve it: Stability selection analyses stratified by disease stage, cognitive status, or demographic factors to identify stage-specific or subgroup-specific synergistic biomarker patterns

## Limitations
- Spatio-temporal similarity measure assumes linear relationships between biomarker changes, which may not capture complex non-linear AD progression patterns
- Method's performance heavily depends on quality of FreeSurfer segmentations, which can vary across subjects and scanners
- Temporal smoothness regularization may oversimplify disease progression if non-linear trajectories exist between time points

## Confidence
- **High**: Multi-task learning framework with structured regularization improves prediction accuracy
- **Medium**: Spatio-temporal similarity measure captures meaningful synergistic relationships
- **Low**: Stability selection reliably identifies true disease progression biomarkers

## Next Checks
1. Compare spatio-temporal similarity features against raw biomarker features on a held-out test set to quantify added value
2. Perform ablation study removing temporal smoothness regularization to assess its true contribution
3. Validate identified biomarker pairs against independent AD progression studies and clinical literature
