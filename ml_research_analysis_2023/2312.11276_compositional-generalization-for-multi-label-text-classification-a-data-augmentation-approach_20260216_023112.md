# Compositional Generalization for Multi-label Text Classification: A Data-Augmentation Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2312.11276
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11276
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Data augmentation approach using LS-PT and LD-VAE significantly improves compositional generalization in MLTC, with BERT accuracy improving from 21.96% to 31.11% on AAPD CG split.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the compositional generalization (CG) challenge in multi-label text classification (MLTC), where models struggle to recognize novel and seldom-encountered complex label combinations. The authors propose a data augmentation approach that leverages two innovative text generation models - Label-specific Prefix-Tuning (LS-PT) and Label Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (LD-VAE) - to enhance the CG capability of MLTC models. By generating synthetic examples with novel label compositions, the approach improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen label combinations, as demonstrated by significant performance gains on three benchmarks (SemEval, AAPD, and IMDB).

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a data augmentation approach using two text generation models to improve compositional generalization in MLTC. The first model, LS-PT, uses label-specific prefix vectors as disentangled label representations, while the second, LD-VAE, employs disentanglement learning and variational autoencoders to extract disentangled label representations. These models generate synthetic examples with novel label compositions, which are then filtered by a quality control mechanism and used to train MLTC models. The approach is evaluated on three benchmarks (SemEval, AAPD, and IMDB) with unique data splits for CG evaluation, showing significant improvements in CG metrics compared to other text generation baselines.

## Key Results
- BERT classifier accuracy on AAPD CG split improves from 21.96% to 31.11% using LD-VAE
- Jaccard score increases from 52.24% to 58.50% on AAPD with the proposed approach
- Both LS-PT and LD-VAE outperform other text generation baselines in CG evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Disentangled label representations improve compositional generalization in MLTC.
- **Mechanism:** By ensuring each label has a unique, minimally entangled representation, the model can better associate specific labels with corresponding text phrases, enabling more accurate generation of novel label combinations.
- **Core assumption:** Entangled label representations hinder the model's ability to learn true associations between labels and text, leading to poor compositional generalization.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states LD-VAE uses disentanglement learning to extract label representations. Section discusses entangled representations as a significant hurdle.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Data augmentation with synthetic examples improves the model's robustness to input perturbations and reduces spurious correlations.
- **Mechanism:** By exposing the model to diverse synthetic examples with novel label compositions, the model learns to focus on true causal correlations between text and labels, rather than spurious correlations, and becomes more robust to variations in input text.
- **Core assumption:** Spurious correlations and vulnerability to input perturbations are major factors limiting the model's compositional generalization ability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions significant improvement in compositional generalization capabilities. Section notes models often learn spurious correlations or are vulnerable to input perturbations.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Label-specific prefix-tuning (LS-PT) and Label Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (LD-VAE) are effective methods for generating high-quality synthetic examples.
- **Mechanism:** LS-PT uses label-specific prefix vectors to encode each label with a distinct representation, while LD-VAE employs disentanglement learning and variational autoencoders to extract disentangled label representations. These methods enable the generation of coherent text that reflects the given label composition.
- **Core assumption:** The quality of synthetic examples generated by the data augmentation approach directly impacts the model's compositional generalization ability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes both LS-PT and LD-VAE models. Experiments show both models surpass other generation baselines regarding CG evaluation metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Compositional generalization (CG) in MLTC.
  - **Why needed here:** CG is the core challenge addressed by this paper, and understanding it is crucial for implementing the data augmentation approach.
  - **Quick check question:** What is compositional generalization, and why is it important for MLTC models?

- **Concept:** Disentanglement learning and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
  - **Why needed here:** These techniques are used by the LD-VAE model to extract disentangled label representations, which are essential for generating high-quality synthetic examples.
  - **Quick check question:** How do disentanglement learning and VAEs work, and how are they applied in the LD-VAE model?

- **Concept:** Prefix-tuning in transformer models.
  - **Why needed here:** LS-PT uses prefix-tuning to encode each label with a distinct representation, which is crucial for generating coherent text that reflects the given label composition.
  - **Quick check question:** What is prefix-tuning, and how is it used in the LS-PT model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Label generative model → Conditional text generative models (LS-PT and LD-VAE) → Quality control filter → MLTC classifier
- **Critical path:** Label generative model → Conditional text generative models → QC filter → MLTC classifier
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LS-PT vs. LD-VAE: LS-PT uses prefix-tuning, while LD-VAE uses disentanglement learning and VAEs. The choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task.
  - Synthetic data size: Larger synthetic datasets may improve performance but also increase computational costs and the risk of overfitting.
  - QC filter threshold: A stricter threshold may filter out more low-quality examples but also discard potentially useful ones.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance on novel label combinations: Indicates that the disentanglement or generation models are not effectively capturing the true associations between labels and text.
  - Overfitting to the training data: Suggests that the synthetic examples are not sufficiently diverse or that the QC filter is too lenient.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Evaluate the performance of LS-PT and LD-VAE on generating high-quality synthetic examples with novel label compositions.
  2. Assess the impact of the synthetic data size on the MLTC classifier's compositional generalization ability.
  3. Compare the performance of the MLTC classifier with and without the QC filter to determine the optimal filtering threshold.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The approach relies heavily on the quality of synthetic examples generated by LS-PT and LD-VAE models, which may fail to capture true label-text associations.
- The assumption that disentangled label representations are crucial for generating high-quality synthetic examples may not hold for all MLTC tasks or datasets.
- The paper does not fully specify implementation details and hyperparameters, potentially affecting reproducibility of results.

## Confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of each component (LS-PT, LD-VAE, and QC filter) on compositional generalization ability.
2. Investigate the robustness of the approach to variations in training data, such as different data splits or noise injection.
3. Compare the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art methods for improving compositional generalization in MLTC using a standardized evaluation protocol.
