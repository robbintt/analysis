# Identification of morphological fingerprint in perinatal brains using quasi-conformal mapping and contrastive learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.14955
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14955
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This study investigated the existence of morphological fingerprints in perinatal brains. A deep learning framework was developed to project 3D brain surfaces onto 2D planes using quasi-conformal mapping, then applied ResNet18 with contrastive learning for individual identification. The method achieved a Top1 accuracy of 71.37% and Top5 accuracy of 84.10% in identifying infants between birth and term-equivalent age. Cortical folding patterns, particularly mean curvature, demonstrated the strongest discriminative power, while cortical thickness showed minimal individual variation. The primary sensorimotor and visual cortices exhibited the highest inter-individual differences. These findings provide evidence that morphological fingerprints emerge during the third trimester and remain stable during early brain development.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that individual infants can be uniquely identified based on morphological fingerprints in their perinatal brain MRI scans. The research team developed a deep learning framework that combines quasi-conformal mapping for 3D-to-2D cortical surface projection with contrastive learning for individual identification. Using structural MRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, the method achieved 71.37% Top1 accuracy and 84.10% Top5 accuracy in distinguishing infants between birth and term-equivalent age. The results provide evidence that morphological fingerprints exist and remain stable during early brain development, with cortical folding patterns serving as the most discriminative features.

## Method Summary
The method employs quasi-conformal mapping (specifically TEMPO) to project 3D spherical cortical meshes onto 2D planes, enabling 2D CNN processing while preserving local geometry. ResNet18 serves as the feature extractor, trained within a contrastive learning framework (SimCLR) with data augmentation to learn individual-specific morphological representations. An excitation module with channel attention fuses features from four cortical partitions (left/right × medial/lateral). The model is trained on 682 cross-sectional subjects and validated on 101 longitudinal cases, with fine-tuning on longitudinal data. Key hyperparameters include batch size 128, learning rate 0.0001, and temperature τ=0.07 in the NT-Xent loss function.

## Key Results
- Achieved 71.37% Top1 accuracy and 84.10% Top5 accuracy in identifying infants between birth and term-equivalent age
- Cortical folding patterns (mean curvature) showed strongest discriminative power, while cortical thickness showed minimal individual variation
- Primary sensorimotor and visual cortices exhibited the highest inter-individual differences
- Top5 accuracy on cross-sectional validation set reached 84.10% (chance level 1%)
- Longitudinal test set achieved 60.10% Top1 accuracy and 83.82% Top5 accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Quasi-conformal mapping preserves local cortical geometry while enabling 2D CNN processing
- Mechanism: Teichmüller Extremal Mapping (TEMPO) projects 3D spherical cortical meshes to 2D rectangles with bounded conformal distortion, maintaining relative positions and local shapes of cortical features
- Core assumption: Bounded distortion during 3D-to-2D projection preserves discriminative morphological information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Teichmüller mapping is such a type of quasi-conformal mapping that can induce uniform conformality distortions in the target point cloud, thereby preserving stable relative positions and local shapes"
  - [abstract]: "projected three-dimensional spherical meshes of three morphological features... onto two-dimensional planes through quasi-conformal mapping"
- Break condition: If projection distortion exceeds acceptable bounds, local morphological features become unrecognizable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive learning on augmented data improves individual identification accuracy
- Mechanism: SimCLR framework maximizes similarity of augmented samples from same subject while minimizing similarity across different subjects, enabling model to learn robust morphological fingerprints
- Core assumption: Data augmentation creates meaningful positive pairs that preserve individual identity while introducing sufficient variation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We constructed positive sample pairs by using multiple data augmentation methods on single sampling data and used the other samples in the same batch to construct negative pairs"
  - [results]: "The training within the contrastive learning framework significantly enhanced the model's performance"
- Break condition: If augmentation introduces features that break subject identity or creates insufficient variation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Channel attention via excitation module improves feature fusion from different cortical partitions
- Mechanism: Excitation module learns channel-wise attention weights to combine features from four brain partitions (left/right × medial/lateral), prioritizing regions with high individual variability
- Core assumption: Different cortical regions contribute unequally to individual identification, and attention can learn optimal weighting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The excitation module aimed to enhance the overall representation capability of the feature vectors... through the channel attention mechanism"
  - [results]: "incorporation of the excitation module based on attention mechanisms also enhanced the Top 1 accuracy by over 50%"
- Break condition: If attention mechanism learns uniform weights or focuses on non-discriminative features

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quasi-conformal mapping theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding TEMPO's preservation of local geometry is crucial for validating that morphological fingerprints remain intact after 3D-to-2D projection
  - Quick check question: What property distinguishes quasi-conformal from conformal mapping, and why is it beneficial for cortical surface projection?

- Concept: Contrastive learning loss functions
  - Why needed here: The NT-Xent and custom contrastive losses directly determine how the model learns to distinguish individuals
  - Quick check question: How does the temperature parameter τ in NT-Xent loss affect the model's sensitivity to similarity scores?

- Concept: Channel attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The excitation module's attention weights indicate which brain regions contribute most to individual identification
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the excitation module's attention mechanism and standard SE-Net implementation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing → TEMPO projection → 2D CNN feature extraction → Channel attention fusion → Similarity calculation → Individual identification
  - Key components: TEMPO mapper, ResNet18 encoder, Excitation module, Contrastive loss functions

- Critical path:
  - TEMPO projection quality → Feature extraction accuracy → Attention module effectiveness → Contrastive learning stability
  - Bottleneck: TEMPO projection must preserve discriminative features while enabling 2D CNN processing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Projection choice: 3D CNNs preserve full geometry but require more data; TEMPO enables 2D CNNs with bounded distortion
  - Model complexity: ResNet18 balances parameter efficiency with feature extraction capability
  - Data augmentation: Improves contrastive learning but must preserve subject identity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Top-1 accuracy with high Top-5 suggests model captures some individual features but lacks discriminative precision
  - Poor performance on specific morphological features indicates projection or feature extraction issues
  - Attention weights clustering to uniform values suggests attention mechanism not learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate TEMPO projection preserves curvature features by comparing original vs projected curvature distributions
  2. Test contrastive learning without data augmentation to measure augmentation contribution
  3. Evaluate attention module by comparing performance with and without excitation module on validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the morphological fingerprint observed in the perinatal period remain stable and identifiable throughout childhood and adolescence, or does it undergo significant changes that could affect its utility for long-term individual identification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study notes that the fingerprint is stable "during the perinatal period" but does not address long-term stability beyond this timeframe
- Why unresolved: The study's validation period was limited to term-equivalent age, and longitudinal data beyond the perinatal period was not available
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term longitudinal studies tracking the same individuals from birth through childhood and adolescence, with repeated MRI scans at multiple developmental stages

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do environmental factors, such as early life stress, nutrition, or medical interventions, influence the development and stability of the morphological fingerprint during the perinatal period?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study identifies morphological fingerprints but does not explore the impact of external environmental factors on their development or stability
- Why unresolved: The dataset used was limited to healthy infants without detailed information on environmental exposures or interventions
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of infants with varying environmental exposures or interventions, analyzing differences in morphological fingerprint development and stability

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific genetic mechanisms underlying the individual variability in cortical folding patterns that contribute to the morphological fingerprint?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study identifies cortical folding patterns as key contributors to individual identification but does not investigate the genetic basis of these patterns
- Why unresolved: The study focused on imaging and machine learning analysis without integrating genetic data or exploring molecular mechanisms
- What evidence would resolve it: Genetic studies correlating specific gene variants or expression patterns with individual differences in cortical folding morphology, potentially using twin studies or genome-wide association studies

## Limitations

- Limited demographic diversity as dataset comes from single population (dHCP)
- 3D-to-2D projection may introduce distortions affecting long-range morphological relationships
- Validated only for healthy full-term infants, not tested on preterm or pathological populations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The existence of individual morphological differences in perinatal brains (Top5 accuracy of 84.10% is statistically significant and robust across multiple experiments)
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific contribution of cortical folding patterns over thickness (supported by ablation studies but could vary with different age ranges)
- **Medium Confidence**: The stability of fingerprints between birth and term-equivalent age (longitudinal validation is strong but limited to specific timeframe)

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on preterm infants to assess generalizability across gestational ages and identify whether morphological fingerprints emerge at different developmental stages
2. Conduct cross-cohort validation using independent datasets to evaluate robustness across different acquisition protocols and demographic populations
3. Perform lesion or feature ablation studies to quantify the minimum morphological information required for accurate identification and understand which specific cortical regions drive individual discrimination
