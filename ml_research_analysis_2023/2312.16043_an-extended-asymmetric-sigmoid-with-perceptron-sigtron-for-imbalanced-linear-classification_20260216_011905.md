# An extended asymmetric sigmoid with Perceptron (SIGTRON) for imbalanced linear classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16043
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16043
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SIC model achieves 83.96% test accuracy in binary classification, outperforming π-weighted convex focal loss by 0.16% and LIBLINEAR in many cases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SIGTRON, an extended asymmetric sigmoid function with Perceptron, and its virtualized loss function for imbalanced linear classification. The proposed SIGTRON-imbalanced classification (SIC) model uses internal two-dimensional parameters (α+, α−) instead of external π-weights to handle class imbalance. The model demonstrates superior performance on 118 diverse datasets compared to π-weighted convex focal loss and LIBLINEAR, with particular strength in binary classification tasks where the severity of relative scale-class imbalance is moderate.

## Method Summary
The SIC model employs an extended asymmetric sigmoid function (SIGTRON) with internal parameters α+, α− that control the steepness and inflection point of the sigmoid. The virtual SIGTRON-induced loss function has a gradient equal to sα,c(x) − 1, which is monotonic and bounded, ensuring convexity. The model is optimized using quasi-Newton (L-BFGS) with interval-based bisection line search. The approach preprocesses datasets with mean-zero and variance-one normalization, then evaluates 20×20 parameter combinations through cross-validation to select the optimal model for each dataset.

## Key Results
- TOP 1 SIC model achieves 83.96% test classification accuracy in binary classification, 0.74% better than LIBSVM and 0.16% better than π-weighted convex focal loss
- In multi-class classification, TOP 1 SIC achieves 77.30% accuracy, 0.62% better than π-weighted convex focal loss
- SIC model shows moderate resilience to variations in dataset balance through its skewed hyperplane equation when training data is close to well-balanced

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SIGTRON improves classification under dataset imbalance by embedding scale-class-imbalance ratio (rsc) directly into the loss function via internal parameters (α+, α−). Instead of applying an external π-weight, the model uses two parameters to control the steepness and inflection point of the sigmoid. These parameters modulate the gradient of the loss at the class centroids, allowing the learned hyperplane to shift toward the minority class when rsc is inconsistent between training and test sets. The gradient of SIGTRON at the class centroids determines the effective margin between classes, and internal parameterization is more robust to rsc mismatch than external weighting. Break condition: If class centroids are far from each other relative to feature variance, or if the imbalance is so severe that even internal tuning cannot recover minority class signals.

### Mechanism 2
The virtual SIGTRON-induced loss function is convex, enabling quasi-Newton (L-BFGS) optimization without convexity concerns. The loss gradient equals sα,c(x) − 1, which is monotonic and bounded. This guarantees that the Hessian approximation in L-BFGS remains positive definite, and the strong Wolfe condition ensures global convergence to the optimum. SIGTRON's gradient is monotonic decreasing and bounded, satisfying convexity of the virtual loss. Break condition: If the dataset contains overlapping classes with no clear gradient direction, or if the regularization parameter λ is set too low causing ill-conditioning.

### Mechanism 3
The internal polynomial parameters of SIC adapt the model to rsc inconsistency between training and test sets without retraining. Because the parameters (α+, α−) control the shape of the loss near decision boundary, the same trained model can generalize across datasets with different rsc values, unlike π-weighted methods that must recompute weights per dataset. The polynomial order of SIGTRON modulates the effective loss sensitivity to class imbalance in a way that is invariant to absolute sample counts. Break condition: If rsc changes drastically between training and test sets beyond the range of internal parameter adjustments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Scale-class-imbalance ratio (rsc)
  - Why needed here: rsc captures both class imbalance (rc) and scale imbalance between class centroids. The SIC model uses it to tune internal parameters so the hyperplane adapts to minority class positioning.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between rc and rsc, and why does rsc include centroid distances?

- Concept: Virtual loss function
  - Why needed here: The SIGTRON-induced loss is defined as the negative integral of the probability function, ensuring convexity and compatibility with gradient-based optimization.
  - Quick check question: Why does defining the loss as the negative integral of a probability function guarantee convexity?

- Concept: Quasi-Newton (L-BFGS) optimization with strong Wolfe conditions
  - Why needed here: L-BFGS approximates the Hessian efficiently; the strong Wolfe condition with interval-based bisection line search ensures descent without expensive loss evaluations.
  - Quick check question: How does the strong Wolfe condition differ from Armijo, and why is it preferred for virtual convex losses?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  SIGTRON -> Virtual SIGTRON-induced loss -> SIC model with (α+, α−) parameters -> L-BFGS optimizer with interval-based bisection line search -> Regularization

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess dataset (mean-zero, variance-one normalization)
  2. For each candidate (α+, α−) pair, solve SIC via L-BFGS
  3. Evaluate cross-validation accuracy
  4. Select model with best CV accuracy

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Internal parameters vs. external π-weight: flexibility vs. simplicity
  - Polynomial order of SIGTRON: higher order → more expressive but more sensitive to initialization
  - L-BFGS memory m: larger m → better Hessian approximation but more memory/time

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence in L-BFGS: check step length ρt and strong Wolfe parameters
  - Poor accuracy: verify rsc values; consider more extreme (α+, α−) combinations
  - Overfitting: increase λ regularization or reduce number of (α+, α−) candidates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SIC with (α+, α−) = (1, 1) (canonical sigmoid) on a balanced dataset; compare to logistic regression
  2. Use (α+, α−) = (0.5, 1.5) on a moderately imbalanced dataset; observe shift toward minority class
  3. Fix λ, sweep α+ = α− over {0.5, 1, 1.5}; plot accuracy vs. α to visualize X-shaped pattern

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the SIC model compare to other advanced cost-sensitive learning methods like focal loss with modified hyperparameters or novel loss functions designed specifically for class imbalance? The paper compares the SIC model to the π-weighted convex focal loss and LIBLINEAR but does not explore a wide range of cost-sensitive learning methods or variations in focal loss hyperparameters. Conducting experiments comparing the SIC model to a broader range of cost-sensitive learning methods, including variations in focal loss hyperparameters and other novel loss functions designed for class imbalance, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the proposed interval-based bisection line search be extended to other optimization algorithms beyond quasi-Newton methods? The paper introduces the interval-based bisection line search as a component of the quasi-Newton optimization framework, suggesting its potential applicability to other optimization algorithms. Investigating the performance of the interval-based bisection line search in conjunction with other optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent, and comparing its efficiency and convergence properties to traditional line search methods would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of regularization parameter λ affect the performance of the SIC model, and what strategies can be employed for effective hyperparameter tuning? The paper mentions the use of cross-validation for selecting the regularization parameter λ but does not provide a detailed analysis of its impact on model performance or explore alternative hyperparameter tuning strategies. Conducting experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the SIC model's performance to different values of the regularization parameter λ and investigating the effectiveness of various hyperparameter tuning strategies, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The claim that internal parameters (α+, α−) generalize better than external π-weights across varying rsc is supported by cross-validation but lacks theoretical bounds on performance degradation when rsc mismatch is extreme
- Numerical stability for extreme α values (e.g., <0.5 or >2) is not quantified
- Runtime comparisons and scalability analysis between cubic interpolation vs. interval-based bisection line search are absent

## Confidence
- High confidence: SIC's internal parameterization improves accuracy on moderately imbalanced datasets
- Medium confidence: Virtual loss convexity ensures L-BFGS convergence
- Low confidence: SIC's superiority over LIBSVM in multi-class problems, as differences are marginal (77.30% vs. 76.68%)

## Next Checks
1. **Extreme rsc mismatch test**: Train SIC on datasets with rsc = 10, then evaluate on test sets with rsc = 100 to quantify degradation vs. π-weighted methods
2. **Runtime profiling**: Compare cubic interpolation vs. interval-based bisection line search for L-BFGS across dataset sizes (10² to 10⁶ samples)
3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Sweep α+ and α− over non-grid values (e.g., 0.3, 0.7, 1.3) to verify the X-shaped accuracy pattern is robust, not an artifact of discrete sampling
