# Exploring Social Choice Mechanisms for Recommendation Fairness in SCRUF

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.08621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08621
- Reference count: 30
- This paper investigates fairness-aware recommendation using a multi-agent social choice framework

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SCRUF-D, a fairness-aware recommendation architecture that frames fairness as a two-phase social choice problem. The framework represents different fairness concerns as agents that interact through allocation and choice mechanisms to rerank recommendations. Through experiments with synthetic and real-world data, the study demonstrates that different combinations of allocation and choice mechanisms yield distinct fairness-accuracy tradeoffs, with the Weighted allocation mechanism generally performing best. The research highlights the importance of considering multiple fairness definitions and the need for further investigation into larger agent collections.

## Method Summary
The SCRUF-D architecture implements fairness-aware recommendation through a two-phase social choice framework. In Phase 1, allocation mechanisms (Least Fair, Lottery, Weighted) distribute fairness agents to recommendation opportunities based on fairness scores and compatibility measures. In Phase 2, choice mechanisms (Rescoring, Borda, Copeland, RankedPairs) aggregate agent preferences to rerank recommendations. The system tracks fairness over time windows and uses fairness targets for agent allocation decisions. Experiments were conducted on both synthetic data (500 users, 5,000 items) and the Microlending 2017 dataset (4,005 lenders, 2,673 items).

## Key Results
- Different combinations of allocation and choice mechanisms yield distinct but consistent fairness-accuracy tradeoffs
- The Weighted allocation mechanism generally performs best, while the Least Fair mechanism can lead to agent starvation
- Choice mechanisms significantly impact the system's ability to adapt to changing user populations
- The Lottery mechanism is associated with lower accuracy but greater fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different choice mechanisms yield distinct fairness/accuracy tradeoffs due to their underlying aggregation logic
- Mechanism: Choice mechanisms integrate agent preferences through different aggregation logics - score-based (Rescoring), ordinal-based (Borda), consistency-based (Copeland), and pairwise-preference (RankedPairs)
- Core assumption: The differences in aggregation logic create fundamentally different tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "different classes of choice and allocation mechanisms yield different but consistent fairness / accuracy tradeoffs"
  - [section 6] "There are clear groupings of the choice mechanisms at different tradeoff points" and "choice mechanisms yield quite different accuracy / fairness tradeoffs"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't directly discuss choice mechanism aggregation logic
- Break condition: If all choice mechanisms converge to similar outcomes under certain conditions, the claimed differences would not hold

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Weighted allocation mechanism's performance is significantly influenced by its interaction with pair-wise choice mechanisms
- Mechanism: Weighted allocation assigns all agents with weights based on unfairness and compatibility products, which affects how pair-wise methods (Copeland, RankedPairs) aggregate preferences
- Core assumption: The distribution of weights among agents changes the tie-breaking dynamics in pair-wise methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "Weighted allocation breaks this pattern in interaction with the two concordance-based mechanisms" and "Copeland effectively scores a tie as 0.5 of a concordant pair, while Ranked Pairs breaks ties randomly"
  - [section 6] "Many of these orderings are ones in which the recommender's rankings dominate"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't discuss Weighted allocation's interaction with pair-wise methods
- Break condition: If Weighted allocation performs consistently across different choice mechanisms, the interaction effect would be minimal

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Least Fair allocation mechanism can lead to agent starvation, affecting system fairness over time
- Mechanism: Least Fair always allocates the agent with lowest fairness score, potentially ignoring compatibility and leading to persistent allocation of struggling agents
- Core assumption: Agents with slow fairness improvement will continue to be allocated, preventing other agents from receiving opportunities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "This mechanism ignores compatibility and focuses on the agent most in need of improvement. However, this approach can lead to starvation"
  - [section 6] "we find that the Lottery mechanism is associated with lower accuracy and greater fairness" and "we see that Least Fair is associated with a greater difference in fairness results across agents so the difference may have to do a certain amount of starvation occurring"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't discuss starvation in fairness allocation
- Break condition: If all agents receive approximately equal allocation opportunities over time, starvation would not occur

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Social choice theory and voting rules
  - Why needed here: The paper's core approach uses social choice mechanisms (voting rules) to aggregate agent preferences for fairness-aware recommendation
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Borda, Copeland, and RankedPairs voting rules?

- Concept: Multi-agent systems and dynamic allocation
  - Why needed here: The architecture represents fairness concerns as agents that are dynamically allocated to recommendation opportunities
  - Quick check question: How does the dynamic allocation of agents allow the system to adapt to changing user populations?

- Concept: Fairness metrics and measurement
  - Why needed here: The system tracks fairness over time windows and uses fairness targets for agent allocation decisions
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the fairness metric used by agents versus the normalized fairness metric reported in results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base recommender system -> Allocation mechanism -> Fairness agents -> Choice mechanism -> Output reranking
- Critical path: User arrives → Allocation mechanism selects agents → Agents generate preferences → Choice mechanism aggregates preferences → Recommendations reranked → Output delivered
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single agent allocation (Least Fair, Lottery) vs. multiple agent allocation (Weighted)
  - Compatibility consideration (Lottery, Weighted) vs. fairness-only focus (Least Fair)
  - Different choice mechanisms offer different fairness/accuracy balances
- Failure signatures:
  - All agents converging to same fairness levels (potential starvation)
  - Significant accuracy degradation across all configurations
  - Inability to adapt to user population changes
  - Dominance of recommender system preferences in final output
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline with no fairness intervention to establish reference points
  2. Test all three allocation mechanisms with a single choice mechanism to isolate allocation effects
  3. Test all four choice mechanisms with the same allocation mechanism to isolate choice effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the SCRUF-D framework perform when fairness agents use different fairness definitions and metrics (beyond the single group proportional fairness used in this study)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states: "As we expand the scope of fairness considerations, we will inevitably find ourselves in a situation with a larger collection of agents than the 2 deployed in these experiments" and "It will be important to explore how SCRUF operates in the presence of different fairness metrics and logics, including non-binary and continuous definitions and consumer-side fairness."
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses a single fairness definition (group proportional fairness) across all agents, which is typical of fairness-aware recommendation research but not practical fairness settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing SCRUF-D performance with agents using diverse fairness definitions (e.g., individual fairness, consumer-side fairness, continuous fairness metrics) and measuring how different combinations affect fairness-accuracy tradeoffs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does SCRUF-D scale to larger collections of fairness agents (5-10 agents) and what are the emergent properties of these larger agent interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states: "Additional research is needed to examine the characteristics of larger agent collections" and "we expect that between 5-10 will be needed in the Kiva context."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only used 2 agents, and while the paper expects scalability, the actual behavior with larger agent collections is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from experiments with 5-10 agents showing how fairness-accuracy tradeoffs, allocation dynamics, and choice mechanism effectiveness change as agent count increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal dynamic balance between fairness agents and the recommender system, and how should this balance adapt over time?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states: "we will explore the use of bandit mechanisms to establish appropriate policies for striking this balance" and "We will also explore how this may change as more agents are added."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses a static weight for the recommender system, but the paper suggests this should be dynamic and adaptive.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing static vs. bandit-based dynamic weighting strategies, showing how adaptive weighting affects fairness-accuracy tradeoffs across different recommendation scenarios and time periods.

## Limitations

- Experimental scope limited to relatively small agent collections (8 agents), which may not capture complexity of real-world recommendation scenarios
- Synthetic data experiments may not fully represent the complexity of real-world recommendation scenarios
- Paper doesn't explore performance when agent preferences are more diverse or when number of agents scales significantly

## Confidence

- High confidence in the basic framework architecture and its ability to integrate social choice mechanisms for fairness-aware recommendation
- Medium confidence in the specific tradeoffs observed between different mechanism combinations, as results may vary with different data characteristics
- Medium confidence in the interpretation of starvation effects, as the experimental setup may not fully stress-test the Least Fair mechanism

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework with a larger collection of agents (e.g., 20-30) to validate whether the observed tradeoffs scale and whether certain mechanisms become more or less effective
2. Implement a variant of the Weighted allocation mechanism that includes minimum allocation guarantees to test whether this prevents starvation while maintaining good tradeoffs
3. Conduct experiments with varying levels of preference diversity among agents to assess how robust the choice mechanisms are to heterogeneous preference patterns
