# CPL-NoViD: Context-Aware Prompt-based Learning for Norm Violation Detection in Online Communities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.09846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09846
- Reference count: 8
- CPL-NoViD outperforms baselines in norm violation detection with superior cross-rule-type and cross-community generalization

## Executive Summary
CPL-NoViD introduces a novel context-aware prompt-based learning approach for detecting norm violations in online communities. By leveraging natural language prompts that incorporate conversation context, subreddit information, and rule text, CPL-NoViD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NORMVIO dataset. The approach demonstrates exceptional generalizability across different rule types and communities, while also excelling in few-shot learning scenarios where labeled data is limited.

## Method Summary
CPL-NoViD uses T5 as its base language model with prompt-based learning to detect norm violations in online community discussions. The method constructs natural language prompts that embed the subreddit name, rule text, conversation context, and target comment. Context is incorporated through conversational narratives rather than complex LSTM-based encoding. The model is fine-tuned using OpenPrompt with a masked token prediction objective, employing a "Yes"/"No" verbalizer for binary classification of violations.

## Key Results
- CPL-NoViD outperforms baselines by incorporating context through natural language prompts
- Demonstrates superior generalizability in cross-rule-type and cross-community scenarios
- Exhibits adaptability in few-shot learning settings with limited training examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CPL-NoViD leverages the pretrained knowledge of T5 to interpret natural language prompts, aligning the task with language modeling pretraining
- Mechanism: The model is fine-tuned on prompts formatted as natural language questions that embed the subreddit name, rule text, and context, enabling it to use its existing language understanding capabilities rather than learning new parameters from scratch
- Core assumption: T5's pretraining on diverse text data enables it to understand the relationships between comments and rules when presented in natural language format
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CPL-NoViD outperforms the baseline by incorporating context through natural language prompts"
  - [section] "By leveraging the inherent capabilities of language models in understanding language constructs, this approach aims to improve domain-transferability"
- Break condition: If the prompt format fails to capture the essential relationships between context, rule, and violation, the model's pretraining becomes irrelevant

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Natural language context incorporation eliminates the need for complex LSTM-based context encoding and its associated issues
- Mechanism: Context is embedded directly within the prompt as a conversational narrative, allowing T5 to process temporal dependencies through its attention mechanisms rather than requiring sequential processing
- Core assumption: T5's attention mechanism can effectively capture the relationships between comments in a conversation without requiring explicit sequential encoding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CPL-NoViD outperforms the baseline by incorporating context through natural language prompts"
  - [section] "By embedding the context directly within the prompt, we leverage the inherent capability of state-of-the-art language models to understand contextual relationships and dependencies"
- Break condition: If conversation threads exceed T5's attention span or contain complex temporal dependencies that attention mechanisms cannot capture effectively

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt-based learning with natural language context enables superior cross-rule-type and cross-community generalization
- Mechanism: The model learns to recognize violation patterns through natural language understanding rather than memorizing specific rule formats, allowing it to apply knowledge to unseen rules and communities
- Core assumption: Natural language understanding of rules and context transfers across different community contexts better than learned rule-specific representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Significantly, it not only excels in cross-rule-type and cross-community norm violation detection but also exhibits adaptability in few-shot learning scenarios"
  - [section] "Our results demonstrate that CPL-NoViD significantly outperforms the baselines in cross-rule-type and cross-community norm violation detection tasks"
- Break condition: If rule interpretation requires community-specific knowledge that cannot be captured through general natural language understanding

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt-based learning and its advantages over traditional fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Understanding why prompting works better than standard classification fine-tuning for this task
  - Quick check question: Why does aligning the fine-tuning task with pretraining task (language modeling) improve performance?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and their ability to capture long-range dependencies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how T5 processes context without explicit sequential encoding
  - Quick check question: How does T5's attention mechanism handle the temporal relationships between comments differently from LSTMs?

- Concept: Few-shot learning and its relationship to prompt-based approaches
  - Why needed here: Understanding why CPL-NoViD performs well with limited training data
  - Quick check question: How does leveraging pretrained knowledge through prompting reduce the need for extensive labeled data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt construction (subreddit, rule, context, comment) -> T5 encoding -> Masked token prediction -> Classification decision
- Critical path: Prompt construction → T5 encoding → Masked token prediction → Classification decision
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. context inclusion (balancing detail with model capacity)
  - Natural language prompts vs. structured input (interpretability vs. precision)
  - Encoder-only vs. encoder-decoder architecture (efficiency vs. generation capabilities)
- Failure signatures:
  - Low performance on complex rule types: May indicate prompt format doesn't capture rule nuances
  - Poor cross-community performance: May indicate insufficient generalization in prompt design
  - High variance in few-shot settings: May indicate instability in prompt-based learning approach
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with and without context in prompts to validate Mechanism 2
  2. Test cross-rule-type generalization by training on all but one rule type
  3. Evaluate few-shot learning performance with varying numbers of training examples per rule type
