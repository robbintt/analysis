# Evaluating Spiking Neural Network On Neuromorphic Platform For Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00787
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- SNN on Loihi achieves 87.5% accuracy, comparable to ANN on GAP8 (88.1%), with 2x better energy-delay product (0.66 µJ s vs. 1.32 µJ s)

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates the effectiveness of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic processors for human activity recognition. A multi-threshold delta modulation approach encodes sensor data into spike trains, which are then processed by a spiking neural network with direct-event training. The trained model is deployed on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic platform to evaluate energy and latency efficiency. The spike-based workout recognition system achieves 87.5% accuracy, comparable to a traditional neural network on the GAP8 processor (88.1%), while offering two times better energy-delay product (0.66 µJ s vs. 1.32 µJ s).

## Method Summary
The method uses multi-threshold delta modulation to encode IMU sensor data into spike trains, which are fed to a spiking neural network trained with SLAYER direct-event training. The network architecture consists of two convolutional layers followed by two dense layers. The trained model is deployed on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic processor for evaluation. The approach aims to leverage neuromorphic hardware's energy efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy comparable to traditional neural networks.

## Key Results
- SNN on Loihi achieves 87.5% accuracy on workout recognition task
- Comparable accuracy to ANN on GAP8 processor (88.1%)
- Two times better energy-delay product (0.66 µJ s vs. 1.32 µJ s)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-threshold delta modulation preserves signal dynamics better than single-threshold encoding.
- Mechanism: Using multiple thresholds generates spike trains that capture both slow trends and fast variations in the input signal, reducing information loss during spike encoding.
- Core assumption: The original signal's dynamic range and temporal resolution can be sufficiently captured by a small set of empirically chosen thresholds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A multi-threshold delta modulation approach is utilized for encoding the input sensor data into spike trains to move the pipeline into the event-based approach."
  - [section] "To address the accuracy degradation caused by information loss during the encoding, we gave multiple thresholds for spike train generation."
- Break condition: If threshold values are poorly chosen relative to the signal characteristics, the encoding will lose critical temporal information, causing accuracy to degrade below acceptable levels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Direct training with SLAYER preserves temporal information better than ANN-to-SNN conversion.
- Mechanism: SLAYER's temporal credit assignment policy distributes error back through both layers and time, allowing the network to learn from spike timing rather than just accumulated spikes.
- Core assumption: The temporal structure of spike trains contains sufficient information for accurate classification when properly trained with gradient approximation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "SLAYER evaluates the gradient of the convolutional and linear layers in an SNN by a temporal credit assignment policy, which distributes the error credit of an error back both through layers and in time."
  - [abstract] "The spikes trains are then fed to a spiking neural network with direct-event training"
- Break condition: If the temporal resolution is too coarse or the surrogate gradient approximation is poor, the network cannot effectively learn temporal patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neuromorphic processing provides energy efficiency through sparse event-driven computation.
- Mechanism: Loihi's asynchronous architecture processes only active spikes, avoiding computation on inactive neurons and reducing power consumption compared to continuous ANN processing.
- Core assumption: The sparsity of spike trains translates directly to reduced computational load and energy consumption on neuromorphic hardware.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The neuromorphic approach of HAR using SNNs on Loihi outperforms the ANN method in terms of inference energy on GAP8 while falling behind lightly in latency."
  - [section] "benefitting from the sparsity of the spike trains and the in-memory computing of Loihi"
- Break condition: If spike activity is too dense, the energy efficiency advantage diminishes and may approach that of traditional ANN processing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Networks and their biological inspiration
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental difference between traditional ANNs and SNNs is crucial for appreciating why direct-event training and neuromorphic hardware are relevant for energy-efficient HAR
  - Quick check question: How do spiking neurons differ from traditional artificial neurons in terms of activation function and learning approach?

- Concept: Delta modulation encoding
  - Why needed here: This encoding scheme transforms continuous sensor data into spike trains, which is the critical first step in making traditional HAR data compatible with SNN processing
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of delta modulation compared to other spike encoding methods like rate encoding or latency encoding?

- Concept: Neuromorphic hardware architecture (Loihi)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Loihi processes spikes asynchronously and in-memory is essential for interpreting the energy and latency results and for designing efficient SNN models
  - Quick check question: How does Loihi's many-core mesh architecture with local memory access contribute to its energy efficiency compared to traditional processors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Sensor data → Multi-threshold encoding → Spike train generation → SNN inference on Loihi → Classification output

- Critical path:
  Sensor data → Multi-threshold encoding → Spike train generation → SNN inference on Loihi → Classification output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of thresholds vs. encoding complexity and information preservation
  - Network depth and width vs. accuracy and hardware resource constraints
  - Direct training vs. ANN-to-SNN conversion for accuracy-latency trade-off

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy: Thresholds poorly chosen, network architecture too shallow, direct training not converging
  - High latency: Dense spike activity, inefficient network topology, hardware limitations
  - High energy consumption: Non-sparse spike patterns, inefficient hardware mapping, continuous neuron activation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different threshold configurations (1, 3, 5 thresholds) to find optimal balance between information preservation and encoding complexity
  2. Compare direct-trained SNN accuracy with ANN-to-SNN converted model on the same encoded spike data
  3. Profile spike activity density on Loihi to verify energy efficiency assumptions and identify potential bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of neuromorphic processors like Loihi scale to more complex human activity recognition tasks with larger numbers of activities or more subtle activity distinctions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that Loihi is not specifically designed for edge computing and that "there is still space for raising the neuromorphic performance," suggesting that current evaluations are limited to relatively simple activity recognition tasks.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated a limited set of gym activities. It's unclear how well the approach would generalize to more complex or diverse activities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the same approach on larger and more diverse HAR datasets (e.g., with 20+ activity classes) and comparing the accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency against traditional approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal threshold selection strategy for multi-threshold delta modulation in different sensor modalities and signal characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the thresholds were empirically set" and "a systematical exploration of choosing the best threshold value and element number will be explored" in future work, indicating that current threshold selection is heuristic rather than optimized.
- Why unresolved: Threshold selection significantly impacts information loss during spike encoding, yet the paper uses fixed, empirically-chosen thresholds without optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different threshold selection strategies (adaptive, learned, activity-specific) and their impact on accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency across multiple sensor types and signal characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do end-to-end neuromorphic solutions compare to traditional approaches when considering the entire pipeline from sensing to classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "to have a more fair comparison, end-to-end solutions of neuromorphic and traditional approaches should be developed, adopting the newly released edge neuromorphic processors," suggesting current comparisons may not be entirely fair.
- Why unresolved: Current comparisons focus on inference only, without considering how neuromorphic sensing solutions might integrate with the classification pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking complete systems that include neuromorphic sensors (like event-based cameras or specialized IMUs) with neuromorphic processors against traditional sensor-processor combinations, measuring total system energy, latency, and accuracy.

## Limitations
- The work assumes that multi-threshold delta modulation optimally preserves signal dynamics without systematic evaluation of threshold selection methods or comparison with alternative encoding schemes
- The SLAYER training implementation details are underspecified, making it difficult to assess whether the temporal credit assignment is properly configured
- The energy measurements are limited to dynamic energy consumption without accounting for leakage or supporting circuitry

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism that neuromorphic hardware provides energy efficiency through sparse event-driven computation is well-established in the literature and the reported energy-delay product advantage is consistent with known neuromorphic benefits.

- **Medium confidence**: The accuracy claim of 87.5% being comparable to the 88.1% ANN baseline is reasonable given the similar classification task, though the exact experimental conditions differ. The direct training with SLAYER preserving temporal information better than ANN-to-SNN conversion is plausible but lacks systematic ablation studies.

- **Low confidence**: The specific threshold values (0.00005 x (i + 1) for inertial data) are presented as empirically chosen without justification for why these particular values were selected or how they were optimized.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold optimization study**: Systematically evaluate accuracy across different threshold configurations (1, 3, 5, 7 thresholds) and compare with alternative encoding methods like rate encoding or latency encoding to establish the optimality of the multi-threshold approach.

2. **Controlled comparison experiment**: Reproduce the exact GAP8 ANN baseline using identical preprocessing, dataset splits, and evaluation metrics on the same hardware to verify the claimed energy-delay product advantage.

3. **Spike activity profiling**: Measure and report the actual spike density (average spikes per neuron per inference) on Loihi to quantify how close the system operates to the theoretical sparsity limit and identify potential inefficiencies in spike generation or network design.
