# Deep Generative Methods for Producing Forecast Trajectories in Power Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.15137
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15137
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Deep autoregressive models and normalizing flows effectively generate realistic forecast trajectories, with DGP-VAR achieving best MiVo scores on French wind forecast data.

## Executive Summary
This study explores deep generative models for producing energy production and load forecast trajectories in power systems, addressing the challenge of capturing spatiotemporal correlations in multivariate time series. The authors adapt autoregressive networks and normalizing flows, demonstrating their effectiveness against traditional copula-based approaches. Using French TSO RTE wind forecast data, they show that DGP-VAR achieves the best performance in terms of MiVo metric while copula-based methods excel in energy and variogram scores.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes deep learning models to generate forecast trajectories by modeling forecast updates rather than direct predictions. The approach uses autoregressive networks and normalizing flows to capture spatiotemporal correlations, transforming forecast updates into realistic trajectories through cumulative subtraction from pseudo-observations. Models are trained on normalized data using stochastic gradient descent, with evaluation focusing on similarity metrics (MiVo) and trajectory quality measures (ES, VS).

## Key Results
- DGP-VAR model achieves the best MiVo metric scores, indicating superior similarity between real and generated data
- Copula-based approach excels in energy and variogram scores, demonstrating better forecast trajectory quality
- Generated time series are less smooth than original ones due to the reconstruction process from updates
- Limited data availability constrains model complexity and performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Deep autoregressive models learn spatiotemporal correlations by factorizing joint distributions using the chain rule, modeling each timestep conditioned on all previous timesteps. Recurrent layers encode past information into fixed-length vectors used by emission models to generate subsequent timesteps. The approach assumes forecast updates are uncorrelated between timesteps but positively correlated within timesteps across spatial dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
Normalizing flows transform data distribution into simpler Gaussian noise through invertible transformations. Applying inverse transformations to sampled Gaussian noise generates synthetic data following the learned distribution. This requires the data distribution to be well-approximated by invertible transformations of a simple base distribution.

### Mechanism 3
The MiVo metric evaluates similarity by finding closest generated time series for each real one and vice versa, computing mean and variance of minimal distances. Good models produce realistic data (low minimal distances) and diverse samples (low variance), assuming closest generated series capture essential real data characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multivariate time series modeling**: Needed because forecast updates are multivariate time series with multiple spatial dimensions and temporal evolution. Quick check: What are the key differences between univariate and multivariate time series modeling?

- **Generative modeling**: Essential for generating realistic forecast trajectories rather than just predicting next values. Quick check: What is the main difference between generative and discriminative models?

- **Probabilistic forecasting**: Required since forecast updates are inherently probabilistic, capturing forecasting uncertainty. Quick check: How does probabilistic forecasting differ from point forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing (normalize spatial dimensions) -> Model (autoregressive or normalizing flow) -> Sampling (generate new updates) -> Trajectory reconstruction (cumulatively subtract updates from pseudo-observations) -> Evaluation (MiVo, ES, VS metrics)

- **Critical path**: Model training -> Sampling -> Trajectory reconstruction -> Evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Model complexity vs. data availability (complex models like RNN-NF may overfit with limited data); model expressiveness vs. training stability (e.g., Gaussian copula vs. normalizing flows); evaluation metrics: MiVo (directly on updates) vs. ES/VS (on reconstructed trajectories)

- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting (poor performance on held-out data, unrealistic samples); underfitting (high MiVo/ES/VS scores, samples don't capture data distribution); mode collapse (generated samples lack diversity, low variance in MiVo); training instability (diverging loss, NaN values)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train a simple autoregressive model (e.g., vanilla LSTM) on the data and evaluate MiVo score
  2. Train a normalizing flow model on the data and compare MiVo score to the autoregressive model
  3. Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., deeper networks, different flow types) and evaluate their impact on MiVo score

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the optimal deep learning architectures and hyperparameters for generating forecast trajectories in power systems, considering the trade-off between model complexity and data availability? The paper discusses limitations of data availability and challenges in training complex models like RNN-NF, indicating that more data would allow for more complex models and better results, but doesn't provide specific recommendations for architectures or hyperparameters that could work well with limited data.

### Open Question 2
How can the smoothness of generated forecast trajectories be improved while maintaining the ability to capture forecast errors and variability? The paper mentions that the method of rebuilding trajectories from updates yields less smooth trajectories and suggests that a carefully designed post-processing step could solve this issue, but doesn't propose or test specific post-processing techniques or alternative methods.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective data augmentation strategies and techniques to reduce overfitting in deep learning models for generating forecast trajectories in power systems? While the paper highlights the need for more data and mentions that dropout was used, it doesn't explore or evaluate specific data augmentation strategies or techniques to reduce overfitting in the context of generating forecast trajectories.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (5 substations, hourly data) may not capture complexity of larger power systems
- Generated time series are less smooth than original ones due to reconstruction process from updates
- Complex models like RNN-NF have too many parameters to learn correctly with available data

## Confidence

**Model Performance**: Medium - Results are promising but rely on synthetic metrics rather than real-world operational validation
**Autoregressive Effectiveness**: Medium - Reasonable theoretical foundation but assumption of uncorrelated timesteps may not hold in all scenarios
**Normalizing Flow Realism**: Medium - Experimental results support claims but power system complexity may exceed chosen architectures
**Evaluation Metrics**: Medium - Appropriate for task but don't fully account for operational constraints and reliability requirements

## Next Checks

1. Test the models on a larger dataset covering more substations and time periods to assess scalability and robustness to increased complexity
2. Implement cross-validation with temporal splits to better evaluate generalization performance across different weather patterns and seasonal variations
3. Compare the generated trajectories against operational constraints and grid stability requirements to ensure practical applicability beyond statistical similarity metrics
