# Benchmarking and Analyzing Robust Point Cloud Recognition: Bag of Tricks for Defending Adversarial Examples

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16361
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive benchmark for evaluating adversarial robustness in 3D point cloud recognition, achieving 83.45% average accuracy against various attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating adversarial robustness in 3D point cloud recognition systems. The authors address the challenge of defending against diverse adversarial attacks that manipulate point clouds through adding, shifting, or removing points. They establish a practical evaluation framework with unified settings including black-box attackers, evasion attacks, and untargeted objectives. Through systematic analysis of existing defense strategies, they propose a hybrid training augmentation method that jointly considers multiple attack types and construct a robust defense framework combining preprocessing (SOR), hybrid training, and reconstruction (ConvONet). Their approach achieves an average accuracy of 83.45% against various attacks, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating practical effectiveness in defending against real-world adversarial threats to point cloud recognition systems.

## Method Summary
The authors establish a unified benchmark for evaluating 3D point cloud adversarial robustness using black-box, untargeted, evasion attacks on the ModelNet40 dataset. They systematically analyze existing defense strategies including preprocessing (SOR), hybrid training with multiple attack types, and reconstruction networks (ConvONet). The defense framework combines these three components: SOR preprocessing to remove noise, hybrid training augmentation to improve model robustness against diverse attacks, and ConvONet reconstruction to project adversarial examples back onto a clean data manifold. The hybrid training approach jointly considers adding, removing, and shifting point attacks during training to create a robust model.

## Key Results
- Achieves average accuracy of 83.45% against various attacks, outperforming existing methods
- Demonstrates that reconstruction networks like ConvONet significantly improve adversarial robustness
- Shows hybrid training with multiple attack types provides substantial robustness gains compared to single-attack training
- Establishes first comprehensive benchmark with unified black-box evaluation setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid training with multiple attack types significantly improves adversarial robustness.
- Mechanism: By jointly considering adding, removing, and shifting point attacks during training, the model learns to recognize and resist diverse adversarial perturbations rather than overfitting to a single attack type.
- Core assumption: The distribution of adversarial examples encountered during training should reflect the diversity of attacks expected in deployment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training, significantly improving the adversarial robustness."
  - [section] "Based on our adversarial robustness analyses with our benchmark, we proposed a hybrid training approach that jointly consider different types of adversarial examples, including adding, shifting, and removing points, to perform adversarial training."
- Break condition: If the attack types used in hybrid training don't match real-world threat patterns, the model may still fail against novel attack strategies not included in the training mix.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reconstruction networks like ConvONet improve adversarial robustness by projecting adversarial examples back onto a clean data manifold.
- Mechanism: Adversarial examples often distort geometric features; reconstruction networks trained on clean data can denoise and restore these features before classification.
- Core assumption: The adversarial perturbations are small enough that the clean manifold is a good approximation for the true data distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In contrast to DUP-Net, IF-Defense employs the ConvONet [31] as its reconstruction network. The ConvONet uses the point cloud as input for shape latent code extraction, while the encoder produces a learned implicit function network."
  - [section] "We find that both reconstruction networks can improve adversarial robustness. Especially, ConvONet, with its superior 3D reconstruction performance, exhibits better adversarial robustness in most attacks."
- Break condition: If adversarial perturbations are too large or fundamentally alter the object's geometry, reconstruction may fail to restore the correct structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Black-box evaluation setting provides a realistic assessment of adversarial robustness.
- Mechanism: By restricting attackers to query-based black-box access without model knowledge, the benchmark better reflects real-world attack scenarios where attackers cannot directly access model internals.
- Core assumption: Real-world attackers typically lack detailed knowledge of model architectures and parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In our benchmark, we make the following assumptions for a unified and practical adversarial robustness evaluation protocol: (1) Black-box: the attacker does not know the defender's strategies, and vice versa."
  - [section] "In real-world, the victim model is usually trained in a confidential manner, and the attacker is hard to modified the model meaning that white-box and poisoning setting are normally infeasible."
- Break condition: If attackers can obtain white-box access through other means (model extraction, etc.), the black-box assumption may be violated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Point cloud data representation and processing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how 3D point clouds are structured and processed by neural networks is fundamental to grasping why they're vulnerable to attacks and how defenses work
  - Quick check question: How does PointNet achieve permutation invariance in point cloud processing?

- Concept: Adversarial attack and defense taxonomy
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between attack types (adding, removing, shifting), attack knowledge levels (black-box vs white-box), and attack stages (poisoning vs evasion)
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between black-box and white-box attacks in terms of attacker knowledge?

- Concept: 3D reconstruction networks and their role in defense
  - Why needed here: Reconstruction networks like ConvONet are used as a defense mechanism to project adversarial examples back to a clean data manifold
  - Quick check question: How does ConvONet use implicit functions to reconstruct point clouds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SOR preprocessing -> Hybrid training augmentation -> ConvONet reconstruction -> Classification
- Critical path: The critical path for implementing this defense is: 1) Apply SOR pre-processing to clean input point clouds, 2) Classify using a model trained with hybrid training augmentation, 3) Apply ConvONet reconstruction if needed for additional robustness.
- Design tradeoffs: SOR provides fast noise reduction but may lose important geometric details; ConvONet offers better reconstruction quality but at higher computational cost; hybrid training improves robustness but requires training on multiple attack types, increasing computational overhead.
- Failure signatures: If the defense fails, check for: 1) Hybrid training not covering the actual attack types used, 2) Reconstruction network failing on adversarial examples that significantly alter object geometry, 3) Pre-processing removing too many points or not enough noise.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement SOR pre-processing alone and test against various attacks to establish baseline improvement
  2. Add ConvONet reconstruction to the pipeline and compare robustness improvements
  3. Implement hybrid training with a single attack type (e.g., PGD only) and gradually add more attack types to measure improvement curves

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design more transferable adversarial examples for 3D point cloud DNNs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies limited transferability of point cloud adversarial examples compared to 2D examples, and calls for designing more transferable examples as a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: Current methods show poor transferability between different models, limiting real-world applicability where the attacker doesn't know the target model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating significantly improved attack success rates across multiple unseen victim models while maintaining imperceptibility.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What advanced reconstruction networks can further improve adversarial robustness beyond ConvONet?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows ConvONet achieves SOTA robustness but suggests investigating and implementing advanced reconstruction networks to improve adversarial robustness.
- Why unresolved: While ConvONet performs well, the paper suggests there's potential for even better performance with more advanced reconstruction techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing a new reconstruction network achieving higher defense accuracy against the same suite of attacks while maintaining reconstruction quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively reduce the training costs of hybrid training methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that hybrid training achieves promising accuracy results but comes with significantly higher training costs, identifying this as a potential research direction.
- Why unresolved: The computational expense of generating multiple types of adversarial examples during training limits practical deployment of hybrid training approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of alternative training strategies that achieve comparable defense accuracy with reduced computational overhead.

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide complete implementation details for the ConvONet reconstruction network or the exact hybrid training augmentation ratios, making direct reproduction challenging.
- The benchmark focuses exclusively on black-box settings, potentially limiting generalizability to white-box scenarios where attackers have full model access.
- While the hybrid training approach shows improvements, the specific contributions of each component (SOR, hybrid training, ConvONet) to the overall 83.45% accuracy are not clearly isolated.

## Confidence

- High confidence in the benchmark framework design and evaluation methodology (clear experimental setup and results)
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of the hybrid training approach (demonstrates improvement but lacks ablation studies)
- Medium confidence in the reconstruction-based defense mechanism (ConvONet shows promise but implementation details are sparse)

## Next Checks

1. **Component Ablation**: Run controlled experiments removing each defense component (SOR, hybrid training, ConvONet) individually to quantify their individual contributions to robustness
2. **White-Box Extension**: Extend the benchmark to include white-box attack scenarios to test whether the defense maintains effectiveness when attackers have full model knowledge
3. **Computational Cost Analysis**: Measure and compare the computational overhead of each defense component during both training and inference to assess practical deployment feasibility
