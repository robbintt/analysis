# MenatQA: A New Dataset for Testing the Temporal Comprehension and Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05157
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: This paper introduces MenatQA, a new dataset designed to evaluate the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MenatQA, a new dataset designed to evaluate the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). MenatQA consists of 2,853 samples categorized into three temporal factors: scope factor, order factor, and counterfactual factor. The dataset tests LLMs on their ability to understand and reason about time, including answering questions with varying temporal scopes, recognizing the chronological order of events, and handling hypothetical propositions about time. Experiments conducted on MenatQA reveal that most LLMs fall behind smaller temporal reasoning models in terms of performance on these factors, indicating significant vulnerability to temporal biases and heavy reliance on provided temporal information for reasoning about time.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces MenatQA, a dataset containing 2,853 samples across three temporal factors: scope, order, and counterfactual. The evaluation method involves zero-shot prompting of various LLMs on this dataset using base prompts, scope prompts, counterfactual prompts, and rerank prompts. Additionally, a time comparison tool is integrated with LLMs to enhance their temporal reasoning capabilities. Performance is measured using F1 and Exact Match (EM) metrics across different question types and temporal factors.

## Key Results
- Most LLMs show significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on explicit temporal information provided in questions
- Larger parameter sizes generally lead to stronger temporal reasoning ability within the same series of LLMs
- Specific prompting strategies and tool learning methods can significantly improve LLM performance on temporal reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs show significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on precise temporal information provided in questions.
- Mechanism: LLMs rely on surface-level pattern matching of temporal expressions rather than deep understanding of temporal relationships, causing performance degradation when temporal information is altered or missing.
- Core assumption: Temporal reasoning requires understanding relationships between events across time, which LLMs have not fully mastered despite general language proficiency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs show a significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on the temporal information provided in questions for reasoning about time"
  - [section 3.3] "LLMs still have limitations in effectively processing implicit temporal information, as indicated by their inadequate performance and sensitivity to different temporal factors"
  - [corpus] "Test of Time: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Temporal Reasoning" (suggests this is a known limitation)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Larger parameter sizes generally lead to stronger temporal reasoning ability in the same series of LLMs.
- Mechanism: Increased model capacity allows for better pattern recognition and retention of temporal relationships across larger contexts, improving performance on complex temporal reasoning tasks.
- Core assumption: More parameters enable the model to store and process more nuanced temporal relationships and patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "larger parameter sizes generally lead to a stronger temporal reasoning ability in the same series of LLMs"
  - [section 3.3] "LLMs with larger parameter sizes have a stronger capacity for utilizing tools" (shows enhanced capability with scale)
  - [corpus] "Revealing the structure of language model capabilities" (suggests scaling impacts capabilities)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Specific prompting strategies and tool learning can significantly improve LLM performance on temporal reasoning tasks.
- Mechanism: Tailored prompts help LLMs structure their reasoning approach, while tools provide external computation for temporal comparisons that the model cannot perform internally.
- Core assumption: LLMs can benefit from structured guidance and external computation to overcome their inherent limitations in temporal reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "we propose scope prompting, counterfactual prompting and rerank prompting methods"
  - [section 4.2] "we explore the integration of time comparison tool with LLMs"
  - [section 5] "utilizing special prompting methods and a tool learning method for three temporal factors can enhance the performance of LLMs"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal reasoning and understanding of event relationships across time
  - Why needed here: The core task involves understanding how events relate temporally, requiring comprehension of scope, order, and counterfactual scenarios
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between temporal scope (when events occur) and temporal order (sequence of events)?

- Concept: Pattern matching vs. deep understanding in LLMs
  - Why needed here: LLMs often rely on surface patterns rather than true understanding, which is crucial for identifying why they struggle with temporal reasoning
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a model recognizing "2020" in a question and understanding that this represents a specific time period relative to other events?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and tool integration techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that specific prompts and tools can improve performance, requiring understanding of how to structure inputs and leverage external computation
  - Quick check question: How would you design a prompt to help an LLM reason about whether one event occurred before another?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MenatQA dataset -> Baseline LLMs -> Base prompts -> Evaluation -> Specific prompts/tools -> Re-evaluation
- Critical path: 1) Load MenatQA dataset, 2) Select baseline LLM, 3) Apply base prompt, 4) Evaluate performance, 5) Apply specific prompting or tool, 6) Re-evaluate performance, 7) Compare improvements
- Design tradeoffs: Using zero-shot prompting avoids fine-tuning but may limit performance gains. The time comparison tool adds complexity but provides concrete temporal reasoning. Larger models perform better but are more resource-intensive.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on reasoning questions vs. extraction questions indicates temporal bias vulnerability. Significant drops when temporal information is altered suggest surface-level pattern matching. Lack of improvement with tool integration may indicate incorrect understanding of tool outputs.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a base LLM on extraction vs. reasoning questions in MenatQA to establish baseline performance and identify temporal bias
  2. Apply scope prompting to the same LLM and measure improvement on scope factor questions
  3. Integrate the time comparison tool and evaluate its impact on scope factor performance, comparing with scope prompting results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LLMs on MenatQA vary with different prompting strategies beyond the scope, counterfactual, and rerank prompts evaluated in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the scope prompting method is not universal and that the time comparison tool has stronger robustness compared to the scope prompting method. This suggests that there may be other prompting strategies that could be more effective.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates a limited set of prompting strategies and does not explore the full space of possible prompts. There could be other prompts that are more effective for certain types of questions or models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of a wider range of prompting strategies on MenatQA, comparing their performance across different models and question types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the size of the pre-training corpus impact the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs, and how does this compare to the impact of model size?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that larger parameter sizes generally lead to stronger temporal reasoning ability in the same series of LLMs. However, it does not investigate the impact of the size of the pre-training corpus.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on model size as a factor influencing temporal reasoning ability, but does not consider the size of the pre-training corpus. The size of the pre-training corpus could also play a role in the model's ability to reason about time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLMs trained on different sized pre-training corpora, controlling for model size, on MenatQA.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs compare to those of humans on MenatQA, and what are the key differences in their approaches to solving temporal reasoning problems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the performance of LLMs on MenatQA but does not compare their performance to that of humans. It also does not investigate the strategies used by LLMs and humans to solve temporal reasoning problems.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a benchmark for evaluating the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs but does not contextualize these abilities relative to humans. Understanding the differences between LLM and human reasoning could provide insights into how to improve LLM performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLMs and humans on MenatQA, along with analyses of the strategies used by each to solve the problems.

## Limitations

- The dataset size (2,853 samples) may be insufficient to capture the full complexity of temporal reasoning scenarios encountered in real-world applications
- The effectiveness of prompting strategies may be limited by LLMs' inherent pattern-matching nature rather than genuine temporal understanding
- The time comparison tool integration methodology lacks detailed implementation specifications, making it difficult to assess its full potential or limitations

## Confidence

- High confidence: LLMs show vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on explicit temporal information, supported by multiple experimental results
- Medium confidence: Larger parameter sizes generally lead to stronger temporal reasoning ability, though the relationship may not hold for all reasoning complexities
- Medium confidence: Specific prompting strategies and tool integration improve performance, but underlying mechanisms for effectiveness remain unclear

## Next Checks

1. Test the same prompting strategies and time comparison tool on a larger, more diverse temporal reasoning dataset to validate whether improvements generalize beyond MenatQA's specific construction

2. Conduct ablation studies where temporal information is systematically removed or altered from questions to quantify the exact degree of LLMs' dependency on explicit temporal cues versus genuine understanding

3. Compare the performance of the best-prompted LLM against specialized temporal reasoning models on identical tasks to determine whether LLMs can truly close the gap or if they remain fundamentally limited despite optimization
