core_contribution: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating the total user
  experience of web search by conceptualizing the various costs and benefits involved
  in the search process as "Delphic" - named after the ancient oracle at Delphi. The
  framework considers costs like access, cognitive, interactivity, time, and impairments
  like misunderstanding, misinformation, and privacy concerns.

# Delphic Costs and Benefits in Web Search: A utilitarian and historical analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07525
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07525
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Introduces a framework for evaluating web search experience by conceptualizing costs and benefits as "Delphic" factors

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for evaluating web search by conceptualizing various costs and benefits as "Delphic" factors - named after the ancient oracle at Delphi. The framework argues that user satisfaction with search engines is primarily determined by their utility, which is influenced by Delphic costs (access, cognitive, interactivity, time) and impairments (misunderstanding, misinformation, privacy). The authors show how search engine evolution over the past 25 years has been driven by efforts to reduce these costs and increase benefits.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework for evaluating web search experience by identifying and cataloging various Delphic costs and benefits. While no specific quantitative methodology is provided, the approach involves analyzing search interactions to identify non-monetary costs, impairments, and benefits that impact user utility. The framework is then applied to analyze the historical development of search engines and their evolution over the past 25 years.

## Key Results
- User satisfaction with search engines is primarily determined by utility, influenced by Delphic costs and benefits
- The framework can be applied beyond traditional web search to domains like virtual assistants and chatbots
- Search engine evolution over 25 years correlates with efforts to reduce Delphic costs and increase benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Users' satisfaction with search engines is primarily determined by their utility, which is influenced by Delphic costs and benefits.
- Mechanism: The framework conceptualizes various non-monetary costs (access, cognitive, interactivity, time) and impairments (misunderstanding, misinformation, privacy) as Delphic factors that directly impact user utility. By reducing these costs and increasing benefits, search engines can improve overall user satisfaction.
- Core assumption: User satisfaction can be modeled as a utility function that incorporates these Delphic factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our main thesis is that the users' satisfaction with a search engine mostly depends on their experience of Delphic cost and benefits, in other words on their utility."
  - [section] "This characterization of total costs and benefits appears to be inherent to the human search for information: most of the costs can be identified in interactions with any web search engine..."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.444, indicating moderate relevance to the Delphic costs framework.
- Break condition: If users' satisfaction is primarily driven by factors outside the Delphic framework (e.g., purely aesthetic preferences), the model would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The evolution of search engines over the past 25 years has been driven by efforts to reduce Delphic costs and increase Delphic benefits.
- Mechanism: Historical analysis shows that improvements in search engines (e.g., spelling correction, query suggestions, multimedia integration) were motivated by reducing cognitive, interactivity, and time costs for users.
- Core assumption: Search engine development decisions can be traced back to reducing Delphic costs and increasing benefits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To argue our thesis, we catalog the Delphic costs and benefits and show how the development of search engines over the last quarter century..."
  - [section] "The trend towards facilitating task completion coupled on one hand with major scientific advances in Natural Language Processing..."
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers on web search evolution and generative AI, supporting the historical perspective.
- Break condition: If major search engine developments were driven by factors unrelated to Delphic costs (e.g., purely competitive reasons), the mechanism would break.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Delphic costs framework can be applied beyond traditional web search to other domains like virtual assistants and chatbots.
- Mechanism: The framework's applicability extends to voice assistants (reducing interactivity costs) and chatbots (synthesizing information to reduce cognitive load), demonstrating its broad relevance.
- Core assumption: The Delphic costs framework is domain-agnostic and can be applied to various information-seeking interfaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This 'utilitarian' perspective applies not only to text focused search engines (e.g. Bing, Google) but also to video search (e.g. YouTube, TikTok), product search (e.g. Amazon), people search, virtual assistants, etc."
  - [section] "Over the past year, there has been a dramatic growth in the use of Generative and Interactive AI ('chatbots') for search..."
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers on generative AI and chatbots, supporting the framework's extension to these domains.
- Break condition: If the framework fails to capture key aspects of user experience in new domains (e.g., social media feeds), its applicability would be limited.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Utility theory in economics
  - Why needed here: The framework models user satisfaction as a utility function incorporating Delphic costs and benefits.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how utility theory applies to consumer behavior in the context of web search?

- Concept: Information retrieval fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding classic IR concepts (ranking, precision, recall) is crucial for contextualizing the Delphic framework's relationship to traditional search quality metrics.
  - Quick check question: How do classic IR metrics like precision and recall relate to user utility in web search?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
  - Why needed here: Many Delphic cost reductions (e.g., spelling correction, query understanding) rely on NLP and ML techniques.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify NLP techniques that could reduce cognitive or interactivity costs in web search?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Delphic Cost Calculator -> Utility Estimator -> Historical Analyzer -> Domain Adapter

- Critical path:
  1. Identify Delphic costs and benefits for a given search interaction
  2. Quantify these factors (e.g., time spent, cognitive load)
  3. Combine into a utility score
  4. Compare utility across different search experiences or engines

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. Complexity: More detailed Delphic cost categories provide better insights but increase complexity
  - Quantitative vs. Qualitative: Some Delphic factors (e.g., privacy concerns) are hard to quantify but important to capture
  - Domain Specificity vs. Generality: Balancing framework applicability across domains with capturing domain-specific nuances

- Failure signatures:
  - Utility scores that don't correlate with user satisfaction surveys
  - Inability to explain major shifts in search engine development
  - Poor performance when applied to new search paradigms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple Delphic cost calculator for a text-based search engine and compare its utility scores with user satisfaction ratings
  2. Analyze historical search engine improvements and categorize them based on which Delphic costs they address
  3. Apply the framework to a voice assistant and identify unique Delphic factors that emerge in this domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively measure and quantify the various Delphic costs (cognitive, interactivity, time, access, etc.) and benefits (task completion facilitation, information synthesis, etc.) to create a comprehensive utility metric for web search?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the Delphic costs framework but acknowledges that measuring these costs and benefits is a key challenge that needs to be addressed.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the Delphic costs framework but does not provide specific methods for measuring and quantifying these costs and benefits in a way that can be used to calculate a utility metric.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies that develop and validate methods for measuring Delphic costs and benefits, and demonstrate how these measurements can be used to calculate a utility metric that correlates with user satisfaction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different user contexts (e.g., location, expertise level, prior domain knowledge, end task) affect the perception of Delphic costs and benefits, and how can search engines adapt to these contexts to optimize utility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how different users may experience vastly different costs and benefits depending on their specific situation and context.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the importance of user context, it does not provide specific methods for identifying and adapting to different user contexts to optimize utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies that investigate the relationship between user context and perceived Delphic costs and benefits, and develop methods for search engines to adapt to different user contexts to optimize utility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the Delphic costs framework be applied to evaluate and improve the user experience of non-search scenarios, such as content feeds and recommender systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the utilitarian analysis approach could be applied to situations that do not involve explicit search, such as content feeds and recommender systems.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methods for applying the Delphic costs framework to non-search scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies that apply the Delphic costs framework to evaluate and improve the user experience of content feeds and recommender systems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in these contexts.

## Limitations
- The framework remains conceptual without quantitative validation
- Difficulty in accurately measuring and weighting different Delphic costs
- Uncertainty about whether all relevant factors affecting user satisfaction are captured

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The historical analysis linking search engine evolution to Delphic cost reduction
- **Medium confidence**: The utility-based model of user satisfaction
- **Medium confidence**: Applicability to new domains like chatbots and voice assistants

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies comparing utility scores from the Delphic framework with traditional satisfaction metrics across multiple search engines
2. Develop a pilot quantitative model for measuring key Delphic costs (time, cognitive load) and test its predictive power for user satisfaction
3. Apply the framework to analyze a specific search engine feature update to verify if Delphic cost reduction correlates with adoption metrics
