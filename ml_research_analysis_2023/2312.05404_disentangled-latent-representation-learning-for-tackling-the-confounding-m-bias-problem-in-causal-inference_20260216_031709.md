# Disentangled Latent Representation Learning for Tackling the Confounding M-Bias Problem in Causal Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.05404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05404
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DLRCE significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art causal effect estimators in terms of estimation bias and precision of heterogeneous effect, particularly when both confounding bias and M-bias are present.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a novel causal inference problem where a single variable simultaneously causes both confounding bias and M-bias. The authors propose DLRCE, a disentangled latent representation learning framework that learns three sets of latent representations from proxy variables to adjust for both types of bias. Using variational autoencoders, DLRCE recovers latent representations of confounders and disentangles them to block backdoor paths in the causal graph. Extensive experiments on synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate that DLRCE significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art causal effect estimators in terms of estimation bias and precision of heterogeneous effect.

## Method Summary
DLRCE uses three variational autoencoders to learn latent representations Z, L, and F from proxy variables Q and M. The framework disentangles the representation of M into L and F to block backdoor paths while avoiding spurious associations from M-bias. The algorithm combines the VAE evidence lower bound with auxiliary prediction tasks that encourage the learned representations to capture necessary information for causal effect estimation. DLRCE can estimate both average treatment effects (ATE) using {Z, L} as adjustment variables and conditional treatment effects (CATE) using {Z, M, F}.

## Key Results
- DLRCE outperforms nine state-of-the-art causal effect estimators on synthetic datasets with both confounding bias and M-bias
- Significant improvements in estimation bias (lower values indicate better performance) across linear and nonlinear outcome functions
- Superior Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE) for CATE estimation on real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DLRCE learns disentangled latent representations that allow unbiased estimation of causal effects in the presence of both confounding bias and M-bias.
- Core assumption: Proxy variables contain sufficient information to recover latent confounders Z, L, and F.
- Evidence: Weak - related papers focus on latent representation learning but don't specifically address the M-bias problem.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The disentangled representations enable valid covariate adjustment without introducing M-bias.
- Core assumption: Markov property and faithfulness assumptions hold for the causal DAG.
- Evidence: Missing - related papers don't discuss using disentangled representations to specifically address M-bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The variational inference framework with auxiliary predictors ensures accurate recovery of latent representations.
- Core assumption: Variational posteriors can accurately approximate true posterals of latent variables.
- Evidence: Weak - while VAE-based causal effect estimation exists, the specific combination with auxiliary predictors for disentanglement isn't well-established.

## Foundational Learning

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and causal graphical models**
  - Why needed: The entire framework relies on understanding the causal structure represented as a DAG, including concepts like backdoor paths, d-separation, and conditional independence.
  - Quick check: Given a DAG with variables W, Y, and S where W → S → Y and W ← Z → Y, what set satisfies the back-door criterion for estimating the effect of W on Y?

- **Confounding bias vs M-bias**
  - Why needed: The paper addresses a novel problem where a single variable simultaneously causes both types of bias, requiring different handling than traditional approaches.
  - Quick check: In the M-structure W ← L → M ← F → Y, why does conditioning on M create M-bias?

- **Variational autoencoders and representation learning**
  - Why needed: The DLRCE framework is built on VAEs to learn and disentangle latent representations from proxy variables, which is central to the proposed solution.
  - Quick check: What is the key difference between a standard autoencoder and a variational autoencoder in terms of the latent space representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Inference network (qθZ(Z|Q), qθL(L|M), qθF(F|M)) → Latent representations (Z, L, F) → Generative network (pφQ(Q|Z), pφM(M|L,F), pφW(W|Z,L)) → Auxiliary predictors → Classification network (Y|W,Z,M,F)

- **Critical path:** Inference network → Latent representations → Generative network → Auxiliary predictors → Classification network

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latent dimension sizes (∣L∣, ∣F∣, ∣Z∣) affect computational cost and representation quality
  - Weights (α, β, γ) on auxiliary predictors must balance representation learning with predictive accuracy
  - Separate encoders for L and F from M enable disentanglement but increase model complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High estimation bias indicates poor recovery of latent representations
  - Poor reconstruction of proxy variables Q and M suggests VAE component isn't learning effectively
  - Instability in training may indicate poor choice of hyperparameters or architecture

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test on synthetic data with known ground truth to verify framework can recover accurate causal effects when assumptions hold
  2. Ablation study removing auxiliary predictors to measure their impact on disentanglement and estimation accuracy
  3. Vary latent dimension sizes to find optimal tradeoff between model complexity and performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can DLRCE effectively handle confounding M-bias problems in real-world datasets with high-dimensional proxy variables?
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates DLRCE on three real-world datasets, which may not be representative of all real-world scenarios with high-dimensional proxy variables.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does DLRCE's performance compare to other state-of-the-art methods when the number of latent confounders increases?
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of DLRCE's performance as the number of latent confounders increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the DLRCE algorithm be extended to handle time-varying treatments and outcomes?
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on static settings and does not discuss potential extensions to time-varying scenarios.

## Limitations
- The assumption that proxy variables contain sufficient information to recover latent confounders may not hold in real-world scenarios
- The disentanglement mechanism relies heavily on the faithfulness assumption, which can be violated in practice
- Theoretical identification results assume perfect recovery of latent representations, which is unlikely in practical implementations

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1: Medium confidence - supported by experimental results but lacks theoretical guarantees for disentanglement quality
- Mechanism 2: Medium confidence - relies on strong assumptions that may not hold in real data
- Mechanism 3: Medium confidence - standard VAE approaches with auxiliary predictors show promise but require more rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the faithfulness assumption by systematically varying the strength of dependencies between latent variables and measuring impact on estimation accuracy
2. Test DLRCE on additional real-world datasets with known ground truth to verify generalizability beyond the three datasets presented
3. Perform ablation studies removing the disentanglement component to quantify its specific contribution to performance improvements
