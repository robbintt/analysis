# UID as a Guiding Metric for Automated Authorship Obfuscation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.03709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03709
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: UID did not effectively guide authorship obfuscation; detectors performed poorly

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using Uniform Information Density (UID) theory as a guiding metric for authorship obfuscation. Three novel methods - Synonym Swap, UID Word Swap (UWS), and UID Paraphrase (UP) - were developed to alter text while preserving semantic meaning. Experiments on 50 human and 50 GPT-3 generated articles showed that while obfuscation quality was high, UID did not effectively guide the process. The detectors used (ZeroGPT and DetectGPT) performed poorly, often mislabeling machine-generated text as human-written, leading to inconclusive results. The study highlights the need for improved detector accuracy and suggests future work to refine UID-guided methods.

## Method Summary
The study employed three obfuscation methods based on UID theory: Synonym Swap (using WordNet and GPT-2), UID Word Swap (UWS, using DistilBERT), and UID Paraphrase (UP, using T5 with diverse beam search). These methods were applied to articles from the TuringBench dataset containing 50 human and 50 GPT-3 generated articles. UID metrics (variance and difference2 of surprisal values) were calculated alongside semantic similarity (cosine similarity). The obfuscated articles were then evaluated using ZeroGPT and DetectGPT authorship attributors to assess effectiveness.

## Key Results
- UID did not effectively guide the obfuscation process
- Detectors (ZeroGPT and DetectGPT) performed poorly, often misclassifying machine-generated text as human-written
- Due to limited sample size and detector inaccuracies, results were inconclusive
- High obfuscation quality was achieved in terms of semantic preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: UID theory can be leveraged to guide authorship obfuscation by altering text while preserving semantic content
- Mechanism: UID theory suggests humans evenly distribute information across text to maximize efficiency. By quantifying UID metrics like variance and difference2 of surprisal values, the system can measure and manipulate information distribution. The algorithms use these metrics to select word substitutions or paraphrases that preserve meaning but alter UID patterns, potentially misleading attribution models.
- Core assumption: Human-authored and machine-generated text exhibit distinct UID patterns, and altering these patterns while maintaining semantic similarity can fool attribution systems
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Utilizing this theory in our three obfuscation methods, we attempted to see how successfully we could deceive two separate attributors"; [section] "UID theory suggests that humans evenly distribute information amongst speech or text so as to maximize efficiency"
- Break condition: If attribution systems don't rely on UID patterns or if UID alterations don't significantly affect attribution results

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Language model-based text generation can effectively obfuscate authorship while maintaining semantic similarity
- Mechanism: The algorithms use DistilBERT and T5 to generate candidate words or paraphrased sentences that are semantically similar to original text. Replacements are selected based on UID metrics and semantic similarity scores to make changes subtle enough to preserve meaning but alter authorship indicators.
- Core assumption: Language models can generate high-quality paraphrases or word replacements that maintain semantic similarity, sufficient to deceive attribution models
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Synonym Swap, UID Word Swap (UWS), and UID Paraphrase (UP)—were developed to alter text while preserving semantics"; [section] "Utilizing DistilBERT to generate the candidate words for a particular target word, UWS not only generates higher quality results that are more semantically similar"
- Break condition: If language models fail to generate semantically similar replacements or if attribution models are robust to such changes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Authorship attribution models can be deceived by altering text to change classification labels
- Mechanism: By applying obfuscation methods and using attribution models like ZeroGPT and DetectGPT to classify altered text, the system can evaluate obfuscation success based on changes in classification labels.
- Core assumption: Attribution models are sensitive to changes made by obfuscation methods, and altering text results in different classification outcomes
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Experiments on 50 human and 50 GPT-3 generated articles showed that the obfuscation quality was high, but UID did not effectively guide the obfuscation process"; [section] "The classifiers seemed to fair poorly at detecting machine generated text and seemed to label almost all of the articles human"
- Break condition: If attribution models aren't sensitive to changes or have inherent biases affecting classification accuracy

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Uniform Information Density (UID) theory
  - Why needed here: UID theory guides development of obfuscation methods by understanding how humans distribute information in text
  - Quick check question: What does UID theory suggest about how humans distribute information in text, and why is this relevant to authorship obfuscation?

- Concept: Language model-based text generation and paraphrasing
  - Why needed here: Obfuscation methods rely on DistilBERT and T5 to generate semantically similar word replacements and paraphrased sentences
  - Quick check question: How do language models like DistilBERT and T5 generate semantically similar text, and what are key considerations when using them for authorship obfuscation?

- Concept: Semantic similarity and cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: Measuring semantic similarity between original and altered text ensures obfuscation preserves meaning
  - Quick check question: What is semantic similarity, and how is cosine similarity used to measure semantic similarity between texts in authorship obfuscation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Source (TuringBench dataset) -> UID Metrics Calculator -> Language Models (DistilBERT, T5) -> Semantic Similarity Calculator -> Authorship Attributors (ZeroGPT, DetectGPT) -> Obfuscation Algorithms (Synonym Swap, UWS, UP) -> Candidate Selection

- Critical path:
  1. Load articles from TuringBench dataset
  2. Apply obfuscation algorithms to generate alternate articles
  3. Calculate UID metrics and semantic similarity scores for alternate articles
  4. Select best-obfuscated articles based on UID and semantic similarity criteria
  5. Classify original and obfuscated articles using authorship attributors
  6. Evaluate obfuscation effectiveness based on changes in classification labels

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing semantic similarity and UID alteration: Ensuring obfuscated text is semantically similar while significantly altering UID patterns
  - Computational efficiency vs. quality: More sophisticated language models may improve quality but increase computational cost
  - Sample size and diversity: Limited articles and authors may affect generalizability of results

- Failure signatures:
  - Authorship attributors consistently label obfuscated articles the same as original articles
  - Generated paraphrases or word replacements are semantically dissimilar to original text
  - UID metrics don't show significant variation between original and obfuscated articles

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply Synonym Swap to a subset of articles and evaluate semantic similarity and UID changes
  2. Implement UWS and compare its performance with Synonym Swap in terms of semantic preservation and UID alteration
  3. Test UP with different diversity penalty hyperparameters and assess their impact on UID variation and semantic similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would tuning the parameters of authorship attributors (ZeroGPT and DetectGPT) affect detection accuracy of machine-generated versus human-written text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they used out-of-the-box models with no tuning, which may have led to poor detection performance
- Why unresolved: The study explicitly states detector tuning was not performed due to time constraints
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with tuned detectors and comparing performance to original results would clarify impact of parameter optimization

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating UID scores directly into the obfuscation process, rather than using them only for candidate selection, improve effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest UID scores are not currently used within the obfuscation process itself, only for selecting candidates
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore integration of UID scores into obfuscation algorithms
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing UID scores as part of the obfuscation process and evaluating impact on success would provide insights into potential effectiveness

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would increasing sample size and including more authors beyond human and GPT-3 affect generalizability of findings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge small sample size and limited author diversity as a limitation
- Why unresolved: The study only tested 100 articles from two author categories
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanding dataset to include more articles and diverse author categories would test robustness and generalizability of findings

## Limitations
- Detector reliability concerns: ZeroGPT and DetectGPT performed poorly at distinguishing between human and machine-generated text, limiting validity of obfuscation effectiveness claims
- Sample size constraints: Only 50 human and 50 GPT-3 generated articles, insufficient for robust conclusions about UID's effectiveness
- UID theory application ambiguity: No clear evidence established that UID patterns differ significantly between human and machine-generated text

## Confidence
- High confidence: Implementation of three obfuscation methods using established language models is technically sound and well-documented
- Medium confidence: Observation that UID did not effectively guide the obfuscation process is reasonably supported, though limited by detector unreliability and small sample size
- Low confidence: Claims about overall effectiveness of UID-guided obfuscation are weak given inconclusive results from detector performance issues and insufficient sample size

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment using multiple authorship attribution tools on the same dataset to establish baseline accuracy rates and identify most reliable detectors
2. Replicate the study using a larger, more diverse dataset with articles from multiple authors and domains to determine if UID-guided obfuscation shows different effectiveness patterns
3. Design an experiment that explicitly tests whether systematic UID alterations (with controlled semantic preservation) can successfully deceive authorship attribution systems, independent of current detector limitations
