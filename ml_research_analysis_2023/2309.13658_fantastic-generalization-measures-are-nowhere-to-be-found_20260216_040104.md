# Fantastic Generalization Measures are Nowhere to be Found

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.13658
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13658
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proves that no algorithm-independent generalization bound can be uniformly tight in overparameterized settings

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fundamental impossibility results for generalization bounds in the overparameterized regime. The authors prove that no estimator can accurately predict the population loss of empirical risk minimization algorithms across all possible distributions when the hypothesis class has finite VC dimension and is overparameterized. They introduce the concept of estimability to formalize when tight generalization bounds can exist, and show there is an inherent trade-off between an algorithm's performance and the tightness of its generalization bounds. The paper illustrates these results with a detailed analysis of linear functions over finite fields.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a combination of mathematical analysis and case studies to establish its impossibility results. The authors define estimability as the ability of an estimator to accurately predict population loss from training data alone, and prove that no hypothesis class is uniformly estimable in overparameterized settings. They analyze when estimators fail using properties of the hypothesis class and learning algorithms, and show that this failure is linked to the algorithm's performance on certain distributions. The analysis is illustrated with a detailed study of linear functions over finite fields, where they prove specific bounds on estimability and learnability.

## Key Results
- No algorithm-independent generalization bound can be uniformly tight in overparameterized settings
- There exists a fundamental trade-off between an algorithm's learning performance and the tightness of generalization bounds for that algorithm
- Linear functions over finite fields provide a clean mathematical setting to demonstrate these impossibility results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Generalization bounds that depend only on training data, learned hypothesis, and hypothesis class cannot be uniformly tight in overparameterized settings.
- Mechanism: In overparameterized regimes, multiple hypotheses perfectly fit the training data. For any such bound that estimates population loss from these quantities, there exist distributions where the bound must be loose to accommodate cases where the bound is tight. This creates a fundamental trade-off.
- Core assumption: The hypothesis class has finite VC dimension and the training set size is less than half the VC dimension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting"
  - [section] "Theorem 1 states that any estimator E fails to predict the performance of many ERM algorithms over many scenarios"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on specific bounds rather than impossibility results
- Break condition: If the hypothesis class has infinite VC dimension or the setting is not overparameterized (i.e., the algorithm can PAC-learn the class)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: There exists a fundamental trade-off between an algorithm's learning performance and the tightness of generalization bounds for that algorithm.
- Mechanism: If an algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions in the overparameterized setting, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it. The algorithm's bias toward certain hypothesis subspaces prevents tight bounds from existing across all distributions.
- Core assumption: The hypothesis class can be partitioned into two subsets where the algorithm learns one subset well but not the other, and the distributions are sufficiently mixed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show a trade-off between the algorithm's performance and the bound's tightness"
  - [section] "Theorem 3 implies that generalization bounds for an algorithm are not tight only if the algorithm satisfies Item 1"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers don't discuss this algorithmic trade-off
- Break condition: If the algorithm's bias is insufficient to learn any meaningful subset of the hypothesis class well

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linear functions over finite fields provide a clean mathematical setting to demonstrate the impossibility of tight generalization bounds.
- Mechanism: For linear functions over finite fields, two distinct functions differ on exactly a fraction (1 - 1/E) of the space. This creates scenarios where empirical risk minimization algorithms must fail to estimate true risk accurately across many distributions.
- Core assumption: The finite field has prime size E and the algorithm is an ERM with linear bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We consider the class of linear functions over finite fields, which is a generalization of parities"
  - [section] "Theorem 4 shows that for this hypothesis class, the predicate of Theorem 3 holds, and many natural algorithms are not estimable"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers don't study finite field linear functions
- Break condition: If the field size is small (e.g., E=2 for binary classification) or the algorithm doesn't have linear bias

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: VC dimension and its relationship to learnability
  - Why needed here: The paper's impossibility results fundamentally rely on VC dimension bounds and when they become vacuous in overparameterized settings
  - Quick check question: What happens to VC bounds when the number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples?

- Concept: Estimability and its connection to generalization bounds
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces estimability as the key property that determines whether tight generalization bounds can exist
  - Quick check question: How does the definition of estimability relate to the tightness of generalization bounds?

- Concept: Bayes-like random ERM algorithms and their properties
  - Why needed here: The proof technique relies on showing that certain distributions over ERM algorithms are "Bayes-like" to establish the impossibility results
  - Quick check question: What property makes a distribution over ERM algorithms "Bayes-like" in the context of this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Theorem 1 (algorithm-independent bounds impossibility) -> Theorem 2 (generalization using Bayes-like distributions) -> Theorem 3 (algorithm-dependent bounds trade-off) -> Theorem 4 (finite field case study) -> Theorem 5 (binary classification special case)

- Critical path: Understand estimability definition → Prove impossibility for algorithm-independent bounds → Extend to algorithm-dependent bounds → Illustrate with concrete examples

- Design tradeoffs: The paper sacrifices generality of bounds for mathematical rigor in proving impossibility. This means the results are strong but may not apply to all practical scenarios.

- Failure signatures: If a generalization bound appears tight in practice but doesn't explicitly state assumptions about the algorithm or distribution, it likely falls prey to these impossibility results.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple ERM algorithm and test it on a finite field linear function class to verify Theorem 4's bounds
  2. Create synthetic distributions that satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3 and test whether any estimator can achieve the claimed accuracy
  3. Compare the empirical performance of various published generalization bounds on overparameterized neural networks against the theoretical limits established in this paper

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a hypothesis class to be estimable in the overparameterized setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces estimability as a framework to study generalization bounds, and shows that certain hypothesis classes are not estimable in the overparameterized setting. However, it does not provide a complete characterization of when a hypothesis class is estimable.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides examples of hypothesis classes that are not estimable, but does not give a full characterization of the conditions under which a hypothesis class is estimable.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theorem or proof that characterizes exactly when a hypothesis class is estimable in the overparameterized setting, in terms of properties of the hypothesis class.

### Open Question 2
- Question: For which combinations of learning algorithms and population distributions is estimability possible in the overparameterized setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that estimability is not possible for certain learning algorithms over certain distributions in the overparameterized setting. However, it does not characterize all combinations for which estimability is possible.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides examples of algorithm-distribution pairs for which estimability is not possible, but does not give a complete characterization of when estimability is possible.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theorem or proof that characterizes exactly which combinations of algorithms and distributions allow for estimability in the overparameterized setting.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the results on estimability in the overparameterized setting extend to other loss functions beyond the 0-1 loss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on the 0-1 loss function in its analysis of estimability. It is not clear how the results extend to other loss functions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the results on estimability extend to other loss functions beyond the 0-1 loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results showing how the bounds on estimability change for different loss functions, or a proof that the results extend to a broad class of loss functions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do the results on estimability in the overparameterized setting relate to practical neural network architectures and training algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses abstract hypothesis classes and algorithms in its analysis of estimability. It is not clear how the results relate to practical neural network architectures and training algorithms like SGD.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the implications of the results for practical neural network architectures and training algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results showing how the bounds on estimability change for practical neural network architectures and training algorithms, or a proof that the results extend to a broad class of practical algorithms.

### Open Question 5
- Question: What are the implications of the results on estimability for the design of generalization bounds for neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues that the results on estimability have implications for the design of generalization bounds for neural networks, and advocates for bounds to explicitly state their assumptions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete guidelines for how to design generalization bounds that take the results on estimability into account.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results showing how to design generalization bounds that are tight in the overparameterized setting while being aware of the limitations on estimability, or a proof that certain types of bounds are not possible given the results on estimability.

## Limitations
- The impossibility results rely on worst-case analysis over all possible distributions, which may not reflect typical data distributions encountered in practice
- The paper focuses on uniform tightness across all distributions, but practitioners may be satisfied with bounds that are tight for common data distributions
- The finite field case study, while mathematically clean, may not provide strong guidance for understanding generalization in continuous-valued neural networks

## Confidence
- Confidence: Medium for the core impossibility results. While the mathematical proofs appear sound, the practical implications for modern deep learning architectures remain unclear.
- Confidence: Low for the finite field case study. The paper provides theoretical analysis but lacks empirical validation of the claims.
- Confidence: High for the general framework of estimability and its relationship to generalization bounds. The conceptual contribution of formalizing when tight bounds cannot exist is valuable regardless of specific implementation details.

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical verification of finite field results**: Implement the specific finite field linear function case study and test whether empirical observations align with the theoretical impossibility results.

2. **Real-world dataset analysis**: Apply the estimability framework to popular deep learning benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) to determine if published generalization bounds violate the paper's impossibility constraints.

3. **Algorithm-dependent bound analysis**: For specific popular algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.), quantify the trade-off between their performance and the tightness of existing generalization bounds to validate Theorem 3's predictions.
