# On-ramp and Off-ramp Traffic Flows Estimation Based on A Data-driven Transfer Learning Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03538
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Proposed transfer learning framework estimates ramp flows with MAE 23.90-45.31 veh/h and RMSE 34.55-58.80 veh/h, outperforming conventional ML models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of estimating traffic flows at freeway on-ramps and off-ramps where physical sensors are not installed. The authors propose a data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages loop detector data from freeway mainlines to estimate missing ramp flows. The framework uses a Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 algorithm that relaxes the requirement for identical source and target domain distributions, enabling accurate flow estimation even when the source and target freeways have different traffic patterns. The approach was evaluated using real traffic data from two freeway corridors in Phoenix, Arizona, demonstrating promising performance compared to conventional machine learning models.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a transfer learning approach where traffic data from a source domain (SR 51) is used to estimate flows in a target domain (L101) without requiring actual target domain labels. The method involves three key components: ridge regression for identifying the most influential traffic variables from upstream and downstream segments, inter-corridor similar-location matching using Pearson correlation to find corresponding locations between source and target domains, and a Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 algorithm that first trains on source data then fine-tunes using a subset of similar instances from the source domain. The target domain data substitution approach uses cosine similarity to select the top 10% most similar instances, allowing the model to adapt to local traffic patterns without actual target labels.

## Key Results
- Flow estimation MAE ranges from 23.90 to 40.85 veh/h for on-ramps and 31.58 to 45.31 veh/h for off-ramps
- Flow estimation RMSE ranges from 34.55 to 57.77 veh/h for on-ramps and 41.75 to 58.80 veh/h for off-ramps
- The proposed framework outperforms conventional machine learning models including KNN, SVR, ANN, and XGB
- Ridge regression successfully identified upstream traffic variables as most influential for flow estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning with Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 enables accurate estimation of on-ramp and off-ramp flows by relaxing the requirement for identical source and target domain distributions.
- Mechanism: The model first trains on source domain data (SR 51), then fine-tunes on a small subset of similar instances from the source domain to approximate target domain characteristics, bypassing the need for actual target domain labels.
- Core assumption: Traffic patterns between different freeway corridors (SR 51 and L101) share sufficient statistical similarity to allow meaningful knowledge transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The transfer learning model relaxes the assumption that the underlying data distributions of the source and target domains must be the same."
  - [section 3.4] Describes the target domain data substitution approach using cosine similarity to select top 10% most similar instances.
  - [corpus] Weak/no direct corpus evidence for TrAdaBoost.R2 effectiveness in traffic flow estimation; corpus neighbors discuss reinforcement learning for on-ramp merging but not flow estimation transfer learning.
- Break condition: Source and target domains have drastically different traffic patterns, volumes, or sensor configurations that prevent meaningful similarity matching.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ridge regression identifies the most influential traffic variables for flow estimation, improving model accuracy and interpretability.
- Mechanism: By analyzing coefficient magnitudes, the method selects variables whose absolute values exceed a threshold (10), focusing the transfer learning model on the most impactful inputs.
- Core assumption: Linear relationships between upstream/downstream traffic variables and ramp flows can be effectively captured and ranked through ridge regression coefficients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] Provides the ridge regression formulation and coefficient interpretation method.
  - [section 4.3] Shows selected variables and their coefficients, demonstrating upstream variables dominate importance.
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for ridge regression in traffic flow estimation; literature focuses on ML/DL methods.
- Break condition: Nonlinear interactions dominate the relationship between mainline and ramp flows, making linear coefficient ranking insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Inter-corridor similar-location matching ensures the transfer learning model adapts to local traffic patterns at each target location.
- Mechanism: Pearson correlation is computed between each target location and all source locations for the selected traffic variables; the source location with the highest correlation becomes the match.
- Core assumption: Locations with high correlation in selected traffic variables exhibit similar ramp flow behavior, enabling accurate estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] Defines the matching function using Pearson correlation maximization.
  - [section 4.4] Implies location-specific matching through discussion of ramp-specific results.
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for inter-corridor matching in traffic flow estimation; literature focuses on homogeneous ML models.
- Break condition: Correlation in mainline variables does not translate to similar ramp flow patterns due to local factors like ramp geometry or nearby intersections.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning and domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: Enables estimation of ramp flows where no sensors exist by leveraging knowledge from a different but related freeway corridor.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between traditional ML and transfer learning in this context?

- Concept: Ridge regression and feature selection
  - Why needed here: Identifies the most important traffic variables from upstream and downstream segments to use as inputs for the transfer learning model.
  - Quick check question: How does ridge regression differ from ordinary least squares in handling multicollinearity?

- Concept: Traffic flow theory and ramp dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how mainline traffic conditions influence ramp flows is critical for interpreting model results and selecting appropriate variables.
  - Quick check question: What traffic flow variables are most likely to affect ramp flow rates in weaving areas?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Ridge regression variable selection → Inter-corridor matching → Target domain substitution → Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 estimation → Performance evaluation
- Critical path: The sequence from variable selection through transfer learning model training and evaluation is essential; skipping matching or substitution steps would break the framework.
- Design tradeoffs: Using transfer learning reduces data requirements but introduces dependency on source domain similarity; ridge regression simplifies variable selection but may miss nonlinear interactions.
- Failure signatures: High MAE/RMSE values indicate poor transfer; mismatched source-target pairs show low correlation in similar-location matching; unstable ridge coefficients suggest multicollinearity or insufficient data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ridge regression coefficient stability across multiple runs on source domain data.
  2. Validate inter-corridor matching by comparing selected source locations' traffic patterns to target locations.
  3. Evaluate transfer learning performance with and without target domain substitution to quantify its impact.

## Limitations
- Framework performance heavily depends on availability of a suitable source domain with similar traffic characteristics
- Selection of only 10% most similar instances may not fully capture variability in ramp flow patterns
- Linear assumption in ridge regression may miss important nonlinear interactions between traffic variables

## Confidence
- High confidence in the general transfer learning approach for traffic flow estimation when source and target domains have similar characteristics
- Medium confidence in the specific implementation details of the Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 algorithm and its hyperparameter settings
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of ridge regression for variable selection, though linear assumptions may limit performance
- Low confidence in the generalizability of inter-corridor matching across diverse freeway environments with varying ramp configurations

## Next Checks
1. **Source-Target Similarity Validation**: Systematically test the framework across multiple source-target domain pairs with varying degrees of similarity to quantify how traffic pattern differences affect estimation accuracy and establish clear similarity thresholds for reliable transfer.

2. **Nonlinearity Assessment**: Implement and compare alternative variable selection methods that capture nonlinear relationships (such as random forest feature importance) to validate whether ridge regression coefficients adequately represent the true variable importance in ramp flow estimation.

3. **Incremental Data Addition Study**: Evaluate the framework's performance as additional labeled target domain data becomes available, determining at what point the transfer learning approach becomes less beneficial compared to traditional supervised learning methods.
