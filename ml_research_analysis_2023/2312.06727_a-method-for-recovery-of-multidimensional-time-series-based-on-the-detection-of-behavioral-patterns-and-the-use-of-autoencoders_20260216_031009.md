# A method for recovery of multidimensional time series based on the detection of behavioral patterns and the use of autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06727
- Reference count: 0
- The SAETI method combines snippet-based behavioral pattern detection with autoencoder reconstruction to achieve high accuracy in recovering missing values in multidimensional time series.

## Executive Summary
The SAETI method addresses the challenge of recovering missing values in multidimensional time series data by leveraging neural network technologies and an algorithm for detecting behavioral patterns (snippets). The method consists of two neural network models: a Recognizer that identifies the most similar snippet to a given subsequence with missing values, and a Reconstructor that uses both the subsequence and the identified snippet to fill in the missing data. The Reconstructor is based on an autoencoder architecture, making the method adaptable to various conditions and capable of recovering missing values located randomly throughout the time series. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy of recovery and advantages over state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for datasets containing temporal activities.

## Method Summary
The SAETI method for multidimensional time series recovery involves preprocessing data by normalizing time series and extracting behavioral snippets using the PSF algorithm. The Recognizer, a neural network combining convolutional and recurrent layers, is trained to identify the most similar snippet for each coordinate of a subsequence with missing values. The Reconstructor, an autoencoder-based neural network, is then trained to reconstruct missing values using the subsequence and the identified snippet. During inference, the Recognizer identifies the most similar snippet, and the Reconstructor fills in the missing values, leveraging both the pattern recognition and learned reconstruction capabilities.

## Key Results
- SAETI demonstrates high accuracy in recovering missing values in multidimensional time series.
- The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for datasets containing temporal activities.
- SAETI is adaptable to various conditions and can recover missing values located randomly throughout the time series.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The SAETI method achieves high recovery accuracy by combining snippet-based behavioral pattern detection with autoencoder reconstruction. The Recognizer identifies the most similar snippet for each coordinate of a subsequence with missing values, while the Reconstructor uses both the subsequence and the identified snippet to fill in the missing values. This dual approach leverages both pattern recognition and learned reconstruction capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
The use of convolutional and recurrent neural network layers in the Recognizer enables effective feature extraction and temporal context analysis. Convolutional layers extract primary features from the input subsequence, while the recurrent layer (with GRU cells) analyzes these features with temporal context. The fully connected layer computes the final probability vector for snippet selection, allowing the Recognizer to capture both local patterns and temporal dependencies.

### Mechanism 3
The autoencoder-based Reconstructor can effectively learn to reconstruct missing values by compressing and decompressing the input data. The Encoder compresses the concatenated input (subsequence and identified snippet) into a hidden representation, which captures the key characteristics of the input data. The Decoder then uses this hidden representation to generate a subsequence similar to the input, with missing values replaced by synthetic values. This architecture allows the model to learn the underlying structure of the data and generate plausible reconstructions.

## Foundational Learning

Understanding how snippets are identified and used in time series analysis is essential for grasping the method's approach to missing value imputation.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Recognizer -> Reconstructor -> Snippet Finder -> Data Preprocessing

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing: Normalize data and find snippets.
  2. Recognizer training: Train the Recognizer to identify the most similar snippet for each coordinate.
  3. Reconstructor training: Train the Reconstructor to reconstruct missing values using the subsequence and identified snippet.
  4. Inference: For a new subsequence with missing values, use the Recognizer to identify the most similar snippet and the Reconstructor to fill in the missing values.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: The SAETI method uses complex neural network architectures, which may be harder to interpret compared to simpler statistical methods. However, this complexity allows for capturing more nuanced patterns in the data.
  - Computational cost: The method involves training two neural networks and performing snippet-based pattern recognition, which can be computationally expensive. However, this cost is offset by the improved accuracy in recovering missing values.
  - Flexibility vs. specificity: The method is designed to handle various types of missing value patterns and time series data. However, this flexibility may come at the cost of not being optimized for specific types of time series or missing value patterns.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor recognition accuracy: If the Recognizer fails to identify the most similar snippet accurately, the Reconstructor may not have the necessary guidance to fill in the missing values correctly.
  - Reconstruction artifacts: If the Reconstructor learns to generate unrealistic or inconsistent patterns, the imputed values may not be plausible or consistent with the overall time series structure.
  - Overfitting: If the neural networks are too complex or the training data is insufficient, the model may overfit to the training data and perform poorly on unseen data.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Compare the SAETI method's performance on a simple time series dataset with missing values against common baseline imputation methods (e.g., mean imputation, interpolation).
  2. Ablation study: Evaluate the impact of the Recognizer and Reconstructor components separately by removing one and assessing the performance impact.
  3. Robustness test: Introduce various types of missing value patterns (e.g., random, block, increasing) and assess the SAETI method's performance across these scenarios to understand its robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- The method's performance heavily depends on the quality and representativeness of behavioral snippets, which may not capture all temporal dynamics in complex datasets.
- The neural network architectures introduce computational overhead and potential overfitting risks.
- The method's robustness across diverse missing value patterns and data distributions requires further validation.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core mechanism combining snippet detection with autoencoder reconstruction
- Medium confidence in the generalizability across different time series domains
- Low confidence in scalability to very high-dimensional data (>100 dimensions)

## Next Checks
1. Test performance on synthetic time series with controlled missing value patterns to isolate method effectiveness from data-specific advantages
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the Recognizer and Reconstructor components
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and memory requirements for scaling to datasets with thousands of dimensions and millions of observations
