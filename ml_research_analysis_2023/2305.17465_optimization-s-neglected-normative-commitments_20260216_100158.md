# Optimization's Neglected Normative Commitments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.17465
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17465
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper identifies six neglected normative issues in optimization: misspecified values, problematic decision boundaries, neglecting multiple agents, mislabeling and mismeasurement, faulty use of relaxations and approximations, and treating optimization as justification for action.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically examines the normative commitments embedded in optimization processes across their full life cycle. The authors identify six critical issues where optimization can lead to ethically problematic outcomes: missing or incorrectly modeled values, faulty assumptions about decision boundaries and modularity, failure to account for multiple stakeholders, imprecise or biased measurements, inappropriate use of computational approximations, and treating optimization results as inherent justification for action. By tracing optimization from modeling through application, the paper demonstrates how these issues arise from choices and assumptions made at each stage.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a systematic analysis of the optimization life cycle to identify normative choices and assumptions at each stage. The authors trace the process from modeling (defining variables, objectives, and constraints) through measurement (defining what to measure and how), computing (relaxation, approximation, and solving algorithms), and application (deployment and impact assessment). They employ examples from various domains including operational decision-making, machine learning, and scientific research to illustrate how normative commitments manifest. The methodology focuses on identifying where value judgments and ethical considerations become embedded in the optimization process.

## Key Results
- Optimization models can systematically omit important values when designers fail to consider all stakeholders during the abstraction process
- Treating decisions as independent optimizations can lead to suboptimal or harmful outcomes due to ignored interactions and feedback effects
- Presenting optimization results without full context can lead to ethically dubious decisions by treating "optimal" as inherently justified
- The optimization life cycle contains multiple points where normative commitments become embedded in seemingly neutral technical processes
- Proper documentation and transparency about assumptions, context, and limitations are essential for ethical optimization deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optimization models can miss critical values when designers fail to consider all stakeholders.
- Mechanism: The modeling process abstracts complex real-world decisions into simplified variables, objectives, and constraints. This abstraction inherently omits information, and if designers do not deliberately consider all relevant values, some will be excluded.
- Core assumption: Designers have incomplete knowledge of all stakeholders and their values, or choose to prioritize certain values over others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Misspecified values can yield optimizations that omit certain imperatives altogether or incorporate them incorrectly as a constraint or as part of the objective"
  - [section 3.1.1] "Omitting values from an optimization problem can be either careless or deliberate... A company that makes custom shirts might decide where to source their textiles. An optimization problem that minimizes the cost of textiles might suggest changing which factory they contract with. However, it could be that the new factory has dangerous working conditions or otherwise harsh and unethical labor practices."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found.
- Break condition: The model breaks down when designers deliberately exclude values they know to be important, or when they are unaware of significant stakeholder groups whose values should be considered.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimizing for one objective without considering interactions with other decisions can lead to suboptimal or harmful outcomes.
- Mechanism: When decisions are modeled as independent optimizations, the solutions may ignore important interactions and feedback effects between decisions. This can lead to strategies that appear optimal in isolation but cause problems when implemented.
- Core assumption: Decision-makers incorrectly assume that their decisions are independent of other decisions or system components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.1] "It can be simpler or convenient to treat problems as separate optimizations when the number of decisions is too vast... Imprecise decision boundaries, including incorrect assumptions about modularity, lead to narrow optimizations that may not serve the broader function of a system or a society."
  - [section 3.2.2] "Optimizations may arise in a repeated fashion where it is unreasonable to assume each sequential decision is independent... the phenomenon of feedback in optimization is represented in Figure 1's depiction of the entire optimization life cycle as a loop."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when decision-makers correctly identify and model interdependencies between decisions, or when they use methods that account for feedback effects.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using optimization as justification for action without proper context can lead to ethically dubious decisions.
- Mechanism: When optimization results are presented without specifying the full context, assumptions, and limitations, decision-makers may treat the "optimal" solution as inherently justified, even when it may be harmful or unethical.
- Core assumption: Decision-makers and stakeholders trust optimization results without critically examining the underlying assumptions and context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "treating optimization as a justification for action, without specifying the necessary contextual information, can lead to ethically dubious or faulty decisions"
  - [section 3.6.2] "Even if an optimization model is defined and solved indicating that a particular decision is optimal, such a process does not morally justify making that decision... any decision can be framed as the solution to an optimization problem... Using optimal as justification, then, does not translate to ethical justification."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when decision-makers and stakeholders are educated about the limitations of optimization and insist on full transparency about assumptions, context, and potential impacts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Optimization life cycle
  - Why needed here: Understanding the complete process from modeling to application is crucial for identifying where normative commitments and potential harms can arise.
  - Quick check question: What are the main stages of the optimization life cycle as described in this paper?

- Concept: Abstraction and simplification in modeling
  - Why needed here: Optimization inherently involves simplifying complex real-world situations, which can lead to omitted values and missed considerations.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper argue that optimization is not ethically neutral simply because it is quantitative and scientific?

- Concept: Multiple agents and stakeholder interests
  - Why needed here: Optimization problems often involve multiple stakeholders with different interests, and failing to account for these can lead to suboptimal or unfair outcomes.
  - Quick check question: How can the objective function of an optimization problem reflect narrow interests, and what are the potential consequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Modeling (variables, objective, constraints) -> Measurement (define what/ how to measure) -> Computing (relaxation, approximation, solving) -> Application (deployment, impact assessment, iteration)
- Critical path: The most critical steps are modeling (to ensure all relevant values are included) and application (to ensure the solution is ethically justified and considers real-world impacts)
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between computational efficiency (using relaxations and approximations) and accuracy/closeness to the true problem
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include omitting important values, incorrect modularity assumptions, feedback loops, and using optimization results without proper context
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Take a simple optimization problem (e.g., portfolio optimization) and systematically vary which values are included/excluded to see how the optimal solution changes
  2. Create a simple model with two interdependent decisions and compare the results when the decisions are optimized separately vs. jointly
  3. Take an optimization result and attempt to frame it in different contexts to see how the ethical justification changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific empirical methods can be used to document optimization usage patterns and impacts across different industries and domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for empirical studies to document optimization usage and impacts, noting that available traces and artifacts are crucial for such studies.
- Why unresolved: While the paper emphasizes the need for empirical documentation, it does not specify particular methods or frameworks for conducting such studies across diverse optimization applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Published empirical studies employing systematic documentation methods, case studies across multiple domains, and comparative analyses of optimization impacts would provide concrete evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop normative frameworks to evaluate when optimization's embedded commitments are appropriate or problematic in different contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for conceptual work to theorize when optimization's normative commitments are justified, noting that this requires careful consideration of contextual parameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for normative analysis but does not provide specific frameworks or criteria for evaluating optimization's appropriateness across different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Published frameworks for contextual evaluation of optimization use, along with case studies demonstrating their application, would provide concrete evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific documentation standards and transparency mechanisms would best enable accountability for optimization systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of documentation in making optimization use transparent and enabling audits, referencing work on model cards and dataset documentation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes the importance of documentation, it does not specify what specific standards or mechanisms would be most effective for optimization systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Published documentation standards specific to optimization, along with case studies of their implementation and impact on accountability, would provide concrete evidence.

## Limitations

- The analysis relies heavily on theoretical arguments and examples rather than empirical validation of the identified mechanisms
- The paper's core claims about normative commitments in optimization remain largely conceptual, with limited systematic evidence demonstrating how frequently these issues manifest in practice
- The corpus search yielded minimal relevant literature, suggesting either these issues are genuinely understudied or the search methodology needs refinement

## Confidence

High confidence in the identification of specific mechanisms through which optimization can embed normative commitments, particularly regarding misspecified values and problematic decision boundaries. Medium confidence in the general framework connecting optimization life cycle stages to normative issues. Lower confidence in the practical prevalence and severity of these issues across real-world optimization applications, as this requires empirical validation beyond the paper's theoretical treatment.

## Next Checks

1. Empirical prevalence study: Conduct a systematic review of published optimization studies across multiple domains to quantify how often the six identified issues appear and their stated impacts on outcomes.

2. Decision boundary impact analysis: Create a controlled experiment comparing optimization results when decisions are modeled as independent vs. interdependent, measuring performance degradation and ethical implications.

3. Stakeholder value mapping exercise: Apply the framework to a real optimization problem by explicitly mapping all stakeholder groups and values, then analyze how omitting certain values changes the optimal solution and its ethical justification.
