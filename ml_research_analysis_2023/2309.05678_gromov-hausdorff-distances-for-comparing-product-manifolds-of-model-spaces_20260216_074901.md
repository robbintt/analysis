# Gromov-Hausdorff Distances for Comparing Product Manifolds of Model Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.05678
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05678
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Novel approach using Gromov-Hausdorff distance to determine optimal configuration of product manifolds for representing data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for determining optimal latent geometry configurations for machine learning models by leveraging Gromov-Hausdorff distances from metric geometry. The authors propose a graph search space that uses estimated Gromov-Hausdorff distances between product manifolds to navigate the space of possible latent geometries. The approach enables principled comparison of product manifolds without requiring them to be embedded in a common ambient space.

The primary contribution is an algorithm for computing Gromov-Hausdorff distances between model spaces (Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical) and its computational implementation. By discretizing continuous manifolds and using isometric embeddings, the method provides a practical way to compare and optimize latent geometries for data representation.

## Method Summary
The method involves discretizing model spaces into finite point sets, computing Gromov-Hausdorff distances between these spaces using isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional Euclidean space, and constructing a graph search space where nodes represent product manifolds and edges are weighted by inverse Gromov-Hausdorff distances. The search algorithm then navigates this graph to find optimal latent geometry configurations for downstream machine learning tasks.

## Key Results
- Presents an algorithm to compute Gromov-Hausdorff distances between model spaces
- Demonstrates the computational implementation of the algorithm using discretized point sets
- Introduces a graph search space using Gromov-Hausdorff-informed edge weights
- Shows the approach enables comparison of product manifolds without common ambient space embedding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Gromov-Hausdorff distance enables principled comparison of product manifolds without requiring common ambient space embedding
- **Mechanism:** Measures minimal distortion when embedding two metric spaces into a common space, allowing direct comparison of latent geometries
- **Core assumption:** Product manifolds can be approximated by finite discrete point sets representing geometric structure
- **Break condition:** Coarse discretization leads to poor approximation of true distances between continuous manifolds

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Graph search space using Gromov-Hausdorff-informed edge weights enables efficient navigation of latent geometry search space
- **Mechanism:** Encodes relationships between product manifolds where edge weights represent inverse Gromov-Hausdorff distances
- **Core assumption:** Gromov-Hausdorff distance between product manifolds can be decomposed into distances between constituent model spaces
- **Break condition:** If Gromov-Hausdorff distance doesn't accurately reflect performance differences in downstream tasks

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Proposed algorithm for computing Gromov-Hausdorff distances enables practical implementation of latent geometry search
- **Mechanism:** Discretizes continuous model spaces into well-distributed point sets and uses isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional Euclidean space
- **Core assumption:** Exponential map can generate well-distributed point sets in hyperbolic and spherical spaces
- **Break condition:** Exponential map fails to generate uniform distributions in hyperbolic space

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Differential Geometry and Constant Curvature Spaces**
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding geometric properties of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces in product manifolds
  - Quick check question: What is the sectional curvature of hyperbolic space, and how does it differ from spherical space?

- **Concept: Metric Space Theory and Hausdorff Distance**
  - Why needed here: Hausdorff distance forms foundation for computing Gromov-Hausdorff distances
  - Quick check question: How is the Hausdorff distance defined between two subsets A and B in a metric space X?

- **Concept: Graph Search Algorithms**
  - Why needed here: Required for navigating the graph search space of product manifolds
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search in graph traversal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Discretization module -> Embedding module -> Distance computation module -> Graph construction module -> Search algorithm module

- **Critical path:**
  1. Discretize model spaces into point sets
  2. Compute pairwise Gromov-Hausdorff distances between model spaces
  3. Construct graph with product manifolds as nodes and Gromov-Hausdorff-informed edge weights
  4. Apply search algorithm to find optimal latent geometry

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Discretization granularity vs. computational efficiency
  - Graph connectivity vs. search space complexity
  - Dimensionality of embedding space vs. computational tractability

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Inaccurate Gromov-Hausdorff distances due to poor discretization
  - Search algorithm getting stuck in local minima due to insufficient graph connectivity
  - Numerical instabilities in exponential map calculations for hyperbolic space

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compute Gromov-Hausdorff distances between E2, H2, and S2 using proposed discretization and embedding approach
  2. Construct graph search space for product manifolds of dimension 2 and visualize connectivity patterns
  3. Implement breadth-first search on graph to identify optimal latent geometry for simple downstream task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of product manifolds
- Limited empirical validation with only one synthetic dataset example
- Discretization approach introduces approximation errors that may not be well-characterized
- Assumption that Gromov-Hausdorff distance correlates with downstream task performance remains unverified

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Mathematical framework for computing Gromov-Hausdorff distances between model spaces is sound
**Medium Confidence**: Graph search space construction using Gromov-Hausdorff-informed edge weights is theoretically justified
**Low Confidence**: Overall methodology's ability to identify optimal latent geometries for real-world ML tasks remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Compute Gromov-Hausdorff distances between simple manifolds (E1, H1, S1) where analytical solutions exist and compare against proposed approach
2. Implement full graph search algorithm for product manifolds up to dimension 4 and measure computational time and memory usage
3. Apply method to real-world dataset (e.g., MNIST) with simple autoencoder architecture, comparing performance against standard baselines
