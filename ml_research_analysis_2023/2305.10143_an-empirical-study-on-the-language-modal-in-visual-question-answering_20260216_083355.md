# An Empirical Study on the Language Modal in Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.10143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10143
- Reference count: 40
- This paper identifies that post-fix related bias contributes more to language bias than question type co-occurrence, and training with word-sequence-variant questions improves out-of-distribution performance, achieving up to 10-point gains on VQA-CPv2 without debiasing methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the influence of language modality on Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance through empirical analysis. The authors conduct experiments on six VQA models and identify two key findings: (1) post-fix related bias contributes more to language bias than question type co-occurrence, and (2) training with word-sequence-variant questions improves out-of-distribution performance. Notably, the LXMERT model achieves a 10-point gain on the VQA-CPv2 benchmark without debiasing methods. The authors propose simple proposals to reduce models' dependency on language priors, including contrastive learning and data augmentation approaches. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements on the VQA-CPv2 benchmark for base models equipped with their proposed methods. The study provides novel insights for designing bias-reduction approaches in VQA.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts empirical analysis on six VQA models (SAN, UpDn, BAN, LXMERT, MCAN, Q-only) using the VQA-CPv2 benchmark for out-of-distribution evaluation. The authors create three types of question variants: variant-1 (swapped prefix/postfix), variant-2 (randomly shuffled words), and variant-3 (inverse word sequence). They implement data augmentation by combining features of original and variant questions, and use contrastive learning with original questions as positive samples and random samples from mini-batch as negative samples. The method involves training VQA models with original and variant questions separately, then evaluating on VQA-CPv2 and VQAv2 benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Post-fix related bias contributes more to language bias than question type co-occurrence across multiple VQA models
- Training with word-sequence-variant questions improves out-of-distribution performance, with LXMERT achieving 10-point gain on VQA-CPv2 without debiasing methods
- Models trained with variant questions show improved generalization on out-of-distribution data compared to those trained with original questions only

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Post-fix related bias contributes more to language bias than question type co-occurrence.
- Mechanism: By analyzing incomplete question forms, the study shows that models trained on post-fix (the visually-grounded part of the question) achieve higher performance on out-of-distribution data than those trained on pre-fix (question type), indicating that post-fix co-occurrence with answers is a stronger bias source.
- Core assumption: The visual grounding in the post-fix provides more exploitable correlations with answers than the abstract question type alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "apart from prior bias caused by question types, there is a notable influence of postfix-related bias in inducing biases"
  - [section] "we decompose the question into two parts: the question type (also known as the prefix) and the concepts (which include objects and other visually-grounded words or phrases in the question, also known as the postfix)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training with word-sequence-variant questions improves out-of-distribution performance.
- Mechanism: Variant questions disrupt the fixed word order, forcing the model to rely less on question-type priors and more on the actual visual content and semantics, improving generalization.
- Core assumption: The model's dependency on language priors (e.g., "what color is" → color answers) is reduced when the syntactic structure is varied.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "training VQA models with word-sequence-related variant questions demonstrated improved performance on the out-of-distribution benchmark, and the LXMERT even achieved a 10-point gain without adopting any debiasing methods"
  - [section] "models trained with variant questions outperformed those trained with original questions... the LXMERT even achieved a 10-point gain without adopting any debiasing methods"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contrastive learning with variant questions as positive samples reduces language bias.
- Mechanism: By treating the original question and its variant as semantically similar, the model learns to focus on the underlying meaning rather than superficial linguistic patterns, reducing bias dependency.
- Core assumption: The semantic content remains constant across variants, so aligning their representations encourages the model to ignore surface-level linguistic cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "one approach is to use the contrastive learning paradigm to combine the two encodings... the variant question is treated as the positive sample"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: VQA requires fusing visual and textual information; understanding how models encode and align these modalities is crucial to diagnosing bias.
  - Quick check question: How does a typical VQA model combine image features with question embeddings before classification?

- Concept: Bias and generalization in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The study focuses on reducing language priors bias to improve out-of-distribution performance; understanding the nature of bias is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization?

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: The proposed debiasing method uses contrastive learning to align representations of original and variant questions, reducing reliance on linguistic shortcuts.
  - Quick check question: In contrastive learning, what is the role of positive and negative samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Image encoder (CNN or vision transformer) -> Fusion module (attention, bilinear, or co-attention) -> Classifier head (fully connected layers) -> Optional: bias branch or contrastive loss module
- Critical path:
  1. Encode image and question
  2. Fuse multimodal features
  3. Apply classification
  4. Compute loss (CE + optional contrastive)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using BERT for questions increases capacity but adds computation
  - Adding contrastive loss improves OOD generalization but may slightly hurt ID accuracy
  - Data augmentation with variants increases training time but reduces bias
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops on ID data after adding variants
  - Contrastive loss dominates and hurts convergence
  - Model overfits to variant patterns instead of semantics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline model on original VQA v2, evaluate on VQA-CPv2
  2. Train with variant questions, evaluate on VQA-CPv2, compare accuracy gain
  3. Add contrastive loss with variants as positives, measure impact on bias metrics and OOD accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific mechanisms cause post-fix related bias to contribute more to language bias than question type co-occurrence in VQA models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that post-fix related bias has a greater impact on language bias than question type co-occurrence through empirical analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates this empirically, it does not provide a detailed theoretical explanation of why post-fix bias has stronger influence than question type co-occurrence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed ablation studies isolating the contribution of different question components, and analysis of model attention patterns when processing prefixes vs post-fixes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the robustness of VQA models to word-sequence-related disturbances be further improved beyond the proposed contrastive learning and data augmentation methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that training with word-sequence-variant questions improves robustness, but seeks additional methods to leverage this trait.
- Why unresolved: The proposed methods (contrastive learning and feature combination) are preliminary solutions, and the paper acknowledges the need for more advanced approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of novel architectural modifications or training strategies specifically designed to enhance robustness to word order variations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the improved performance on VQA-CPv2 using variant questions and the underlying multimodal bias in VQA models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests there may exist multimodal bias and observes that variant questions improve OOD performance, but does not explicitly analyze the connection.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies multimodal bias exists but does not explore how variant questions affect this specific type of bias or whether they address it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring changes in multimodal attention patterns and bias metrics when using variant questions, compared to unimodal debiasing approaches.

## Limitations

- Several critical implementation details remain underspecified, particularly regarding the contrastive learning paradigm's exact configuration and the feature combination method for data augmentation
- The study focuses on language bias but doesn't comprehensively address visual bias or dataset-specific artifacts that might confound the results
- The claim of a 10-point gain with LXMERT requires careful scrutiny, as it may be influenced by the model's pre-training scale rather than the proposed method alone

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The observation that post-fix related bias exists and is measurable across multiple models (SAN, UpDn, BAN, LXMERT, MCAN, Q-only). The experimental methodology for decomposing questions and measuring performance is clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of variant questions for OOD generalization. While results show improvements, the mechanism is not fully explained, and the 10-point gain with LXMERT may be model-specific rather than generalizable across architectures.
- **Low confidence**: The contrastive learning approach's impact on bias reduction. The paper provides minimal details on implementation, making it difficult to assess whether the observed improvements are directly attributable to this method or confounded by other factors.

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism isolation**: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each variant type (prefix/postfix swap, word shuffling, inverse sequence) to determine which mechanism drives the most improvement in OOD performance.

2. **Dataset artifact analysis**: Test whether the observed gains persist when applying the same methodology to a VQA dataset with different bias distributions or a synthetic dataset with controlled bias patterns.

3. **Model architecture dependency**: Replicate the 10-point LXMERT gain on smaller, non-pretrained models to determine whether the improvement is architecture-dependent or generalizable across model scales.
