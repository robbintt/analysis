# See Through the Fog: Curriculum Learning with Progressive Occlusion in Medical Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.15574
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15574
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Novel curriculum learning approach with progressive occlusion improves model robustness and diagnostic accuracy on occluded medical images

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training deep learning models to handle occluded medical images, a common scenario in clinical practice. The authors propose a novel curriculum learning-based approach that progressively introduces occlusion, starting from clear images and gradually increasing occlusion levels. This allows the model to first grasp simple patterns and then build upon this knowledge to understand more complicated, occluded scenarios. The approach is evaluated on diverse medical image datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in model robustness and diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional training methodologies.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs progressive occlusion synthesis with three novel curriculum learning strategies: Wasserstein Curriculum Learning (WCL), Information Adaptive Learning (IAL), and Geodesic Curriculum Learning (GCL). These methods leverage concepts from optimal transport, information theory, and differential geometry to optimize the training process. The approach is evaluated on brain tumor datasets using a MobileNetV2 backbone with custom top layers. The training process involves progressive occlusion synthesis based on the current training stage, feature extraction through the backbone, classification through custom top layers, and loss computation with curriculum learning terms.

## Key Results
- Substantial improvements in model robustness and diagnostic accuracy on occluded medical images
- Three novel occlusion synthesis methods: Wasserstein Curriculum Learning (WCL), Information Adaptive Learning (IAL), and Geodesic Curriculum Learning (GCL)
- Demonstrated effectiveness on diverse medical image datasets, particularly brain tumor classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Progressive occlusion increases model robustness by allowing initial learning on clean images before exposure to occluded data
- Mechanism: The curriculum starts with unobstructed images, enabling the model to learn foundational patterns. As occlusion increases, the model can build upon this foundation to interpret more complex scenarios
- Core assumption: Models can better learn from simple to complex examples in a structured progression
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This ordered learning process, akin to human learning, allows the model to first grasp simple, discernable patterns and subsequently build upon this knowledge to understand more complicated, occluded scenarios"
  - [section] "This staged learning process enables the model to initially grasp the simple, discernable patterns in the data and subsequently apply this foundational knowledge to understand more complicated, occluded scenarios"
- Break condition: If the model fails to generalize from simple to complex examples, or if the occlusion progression is too steep

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Wasserstein distance-based curriculum learning ensures smoother transitions between occlusion levels
- Mechanism: The Wasserstein distance measures the discrepancy between occlusion distributions at successive stages, encouraging minimal jumps in occlusion complexity
- Core assumption: Minimizing Wasserstein distance between successive stages creates a smoother learning trajectory
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "By using this method, the model experiences a smooth increase in complexity, since the occlusion levels between two successive stages have minimal distance, and no sudden jumps are experienced"
  - [section] "The Wasserstein distance offers an effective way of comparing probability distributions, taking into account not only the discrepancies in the distribution values but also their locations"
- Break condition: If the Wasserstein regularization term dominates the loss function or if occlusion transitions remain abrupt

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Information Adaptive Learning dynamically adjusts occlusion levels based on mutual information maximization
- Mechanism: The model optimizes occlusion levels to maximize mutual information between true labels and predictions, ensuring appropriate challenge levels
- Core assumption: Mutual information between predictions and true labels is a valid proxy for optimal occlusion difficulty
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This adaptive occlusion optimization strategy adds another layer of sophistication to our curriculum learning approach. By dynamically adjusting the level of occlusion based on the model's current performance, we can ensure that the model is always presented with the right amount of challenge"
  - [section] "The mutual information is a measure of the statistical dependence between two variables, giving a clear and intuitive quantification of how much the model's output depends on the input"
- Break condition: If mutual information optimization leads to suboptimal occlusion levels or computational inefficiency

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Curriculum Learning
  - Why needed here: Enables structured progression from simple to complex examples, mimicking human learning patterns
  - Quick check question: How does curriculum learning differ from random sampling in training data order?

- Concept: Optimal Transport (Wasserstein Distance)
  - Why needed here: Provides a geometrically meaningful way to compare occlusion distributions between training stages
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Wasserstein distance and other probability distribution metrics like KL divergence?

- Concept: Mutual Information
  - Why needed here: Quantifies the dependence between model predictions and true labels, guiding adaptive occlusion optimization
  - Quick check question: How does mutual information differ from correlation in measuring statistical dependence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  MobileNetV2 backbone -> Custom top layers (Dropout, Dense, Batch Normalization) -> Progressive occlusion synthesis module -> WCL/IAL/GCL strategies -> Loss function

- Critical path:
  1. Input image preprocessing and resizing
  2. Progressive occlusion synthesis based on current training stage
  3. Feature extraction through MobileNetV2 backbone
  4. Classification through custom top layers
  5. Loss computation with curriculum learning terms
  6. Backpropagation and parameter updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. performance improvement
  - Complexity of occlusion synthesis vs. model robustness
  - Number of curriculum stages vs. training time
  - Balance between cross-entropy loss and regularization terms

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to clear images if occlusion progression is too slow
  - Poor generalization if occlusion levels jump too abruptly
  - Training instability if Wasserstein or mutual information terms dominate
  - Computational bottlenecks in optimal transport calculations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline test: Train standard MobileNetV2 without progressive occlusion on Br35H dataset
  2. Progressive occlusion test: Implement basic progressive occlusion without curriculum learning terms
  3. Wasserstein curriculum test: Add WCL component to progressive occlusion and compare performance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the computational complexity of optimal transport-based methods be reduced for real-time medical imaging applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "our methodology requires a substantial amount of computational resources due to the complexity of the optimal transport computation" and suggests exploring "more efficient optimal transport algorithms, parallel computing techniques, or hardware accelerators."
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the computational challenges, it does not provide specific solutions or evaluate the performance of any proposed efficiency improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different optimal transport algorithms or hardware implementations in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource usage in medical imaging tasks would provide concrete evidence of potential solutions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the proposed curriculum learning approach be extended to handle multiple types of occlusions simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a single type of occlusion (random or border) but acknowledges that real-world medical images may contain various types of occlusions simultaneously.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the challenges or potential solutions for handling multiple occlusion types within the curriculum learning framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed method with and without simultaneous multi-type occlusion handling would demonstrate the effectiveness of such an extension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the geodesic path optimization be adapted to handle non-convex loss surfaces commonly found in deep learning models for medical image analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "casting the learning process in the framework of differential geometry provides a geometric interpretation to curriculum learning" but does not address the challenges posed by non-convex loss surfaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the geodesic path optimization would behave in the presence of multiple local minima or saddle points in the loss landscape.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical results showing the convergence properties of the geodesic path optimization method in non-convex loss landscapes would provide insights into its applicability in complex medical image analysis tasks.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of optimal transport calculations may limit scalability to larger datasets or more complex models
- Effectiveness depends heavily on hyperparameter tuning (λ, λ1, λ2, λ3, α) for different medical imaging tasks
- Generalizability to other medical imaging modalities and pathologies beyond brain tumors remains unproven

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The fundamental premise that progressive exposure to increasingly complex data can improve model learning, supported by established curriculum learning literature and the intuitive alignment with human learning patterns.

**Medium Confidence:** The specific implementation of Wasserstein Curriculum Learning, Information Adaptive Learning, and Geodesic Curriculum Learning methods, as these novel approaches require further empirical validation across diverse datasets and tasks.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim of substantial improvements in model robustness and diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional training, based on reported results on specific datasets that may not generalize to all medical imaging scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Testing:** Evaluate the proposed curriculum learning approach on additional medical imaging datasets beyond brain tumors, including different imaging modalities (CT, X-ray, ultrasound) and pathologies to assess cross-domain robustness.

2. **Ablation Studies:** Conduct systematic ablation experiments to isolate the contributions of each curriculum learning component (WCL, IAL, GCL) and determine the optimal balance of their contributions to overall performance.

3. **Computational Efficiency Analysis:** Quantify the computational overhead introduced by the proposed methods compared to standard training approaches and explore optimization techniques (e.g., approximation methods for Wasserstein distance) to improve scalability.
