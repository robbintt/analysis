# Vamos: Versatile Action Models for Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.13627
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13627
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Vamos demonstrates that text-based video representations, particularly free-form captions, consistently achieve competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming or matching visual embeddings, while a token selector achieves nearly 5x inference speedup.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of creating effective video representations for video understanding tasks by proposing "versatile action models" (Vamos), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to reason about videos using different types of input representations. Vamos shows that text-based representations, particularly free-form captions, consistently achieve competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming or matching visual embeddings. The authors also introduce a lightweight token selector to compress video captions into a smaller subset of relevant tokens, achieving nearly 5x inference speedup while maintaining strong performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks and highlights the potential of text-based video representations in the era of LLMs.

## Method Summary
Vamos is a framework that unifies video dynamic modeling tasks using LLMs with different input representations: visual embeddings from CLIP, discrete action labels from Ego4D-trained models, and free-form captions from BLIP-2 or LLaVA. The framework treats video understanding tasks as sequence modeling problems, leveraging LLM next-token prediction capability. A lightweight token selector module can optionally compress long captions by selecting relevant tokens based on task-specific queries. LoRA fine-tuning is used to adapt the LLM to video understanding tasks. The framework demonstrates that text-based representations often match or exceed visual embeddings across benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Text-based representations (action labels and captions) consistently achieve competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, often matching or exceeding visual embeddings
- A lightweight token selector can compress long video captions into a small subset of relevant tokens while maintaining competitive performance and achieving nearly 5x inference speedup
- Vamos achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks (Ego4D, NeXT-QA, and EgoSchema) and demonstrates the potential of text-based video representations in the era of LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Text-based representations (action labels and captions) are sufficient for strong video understanding performance, often matching or exceeding visual embeddings.
- Mechanism: Large language models can reason about video content using textual descriptions that encode essential semantic information, allowing them to perform tasks like action anticipation and question answering without needing raw visual features.
- Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to interpret and use text descriptions of video content effectively for downstream tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement"
  - [section] "we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement"
- Break condition: If the generated captions or action labels miss critical visual information that cannot be inferred from context, performance would degrade significantly compared to visual embeddings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A lightweight token selector can compress long video captions into a small subset of relevant tokens while maintaining competitive performance.
- Mechanism: The token selector identifies the most relevant tokens from video captions for answering specific questions by using task-specific queries to rank and select tokens, effectively creating a bottleneck that preserves only essential information.
- Core assumption: Not all tokens in a video caption are equally important for answering any given question, and a small subset can capture the necessary information for reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also demonstrate that our token bottleneck model is able to select relevant evidence from free-form text, support test-time intervention, and achieves nearly 5 times inference speedup while keeping a competitive question answering performance"
  - [section] "we observe that not only the video question answering performance remains competitive, outperforming the visual embedding baseline, but the selected tokens are indeed highly related to answering the questions"
- Break condition: If the token selector fails to identify truly relevant tokens or if the remaining tokens lose contextual coherence needed for reasoning, performance would degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can serve as effective temporal reasoners for video understanding tasks by treating video representation as sequential text input.
- Mechanism: By prepending task-specific inputs (questions, instructions, target actions) to video representations and leveraging the LLM's next token prediction capability, Vamos can perform both video question answering and long-term action anticipation as sequence modeling tasks.
- Core assumption: LLMs trained on large text corpora have learned sufficient temporal and causal reasoning patterns that can be transferred to video understanding when provided with appropriate textual video representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Vamos can directly leverage an LLM's next token prediction capability for action anticipation" and "we ask Vamos to perform video question answering by prepending the question to the video representation"
  - [section] "Vamos, a simple yet effective framework to utilize LLMs to unify video dynamic modeling tasks, including comprehending historical content (video question answering, VQA) and future prediction (long-term action anticipation, LTA)"
- Break condition: If the video representation lacks sufficient temporal structure or the LLM's reasoning capabilities are insufficient for the complexity of video understanding tasks, performance would degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models as Universal Reasoners
  - Why needed here: Vamos relies on LLMs to perform reasoning across different video understanding tasks without task-specific architectures
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how an LLM trained on text can reason about video content when given text descriptions of videos?

- Concept: Sequence Modeling for Temporal Tasks
  - Why needed here: Both action anticipation and video question answering are formulated as sequence modeling problems where the LLM predicts next tokens
  - Quick check question: How does treating video understanding as sequence modeling enable the use of LLM next-token prediction for both future action prediction and answering questions?

- Concept: Information Bottleneck and Compression
  - Why needed here: The token selector creates an information bottleneck by compressing long captions into fewer tokens while preserving essential information for reasoning
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between compression ratio and information retention in the context of video understanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video input → Text representation generator (action labels or captions) → Word embedding layer → Optional visual projection layer → Token selector (optional) → LLM reasoner → Task-specific output

- Critical path:
  1. Generate text representation of video (action labels or captions)
  2. Convert to token embeddings via word embedding layer
  3. Optionally project visual features to language space and concatenate
  4. If using token selector, apply it to compress tokens using task queries
  5. Feed final token sequence to LLM
  6. Generate output based on task-specific objective

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Text-only vs. visual+text: Text-only is faster and more interpretable but may miss visual details; visual+text adds complexity but can improve performance on tasks requiring fine-grained visual distinctions
  - Token compression level: Higher compression (fewer tokens) improves speed but risks losing information; lower compression preserves more information but reduces speed benefits
  - Caption granularity: More frames sampled for captioning provides more detail but increases computational cost and may introduce redundancy

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drops when using only visual embeddings compared to text: indicates captions/action labels capture essential information
  - Poor performance after aggressive token compression: suggests critical information is being lost
  - Inconsistent performance across different tasks: may indicate task-specific requirements not being met by the text representation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of action labels vs. captions vs. visual embeddings on a single benchmark to verify the main claim about text superiority
  2. Test token selector with varying compression ratios (20, 40, 80 tokens) on the same benchmark to find the optimal balance
  3. Evaluate the impact of adding visual embeddings to text representations on a task where text alone performs well to test the marginal improvement claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the properties of free-form video captions influence the performance of LLM-based video understanding models across different tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper extensively discusses the effectiveness of text-based representations, particularly free-form captions, across multiple benchmarks, showing that captions consistently achieve competitive performance. The authors also explore the impact of caption granularity and the use of a token selector to compress captions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of captions, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how specific caption properties (e.g., length, descriptiveness, focus on objects vs. actions) influence performance across different tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying caption properties and measuring their impact on performance across different video understanding tasks would provide evidence to answer this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can visual embeddings provide complementary information to text-based representations in LLM-based video understanding models, and if so, under what conditions?
- Basis in paper: The paper investigates whether visual embeddings can provide complementary information to text-based representations by training models that incorporate both. The results show that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement when combined with text-based representations, particularly captions, across various benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that visual embeddings do not consistently improve performance, it does not fully explore the conditions under which they might be beneficial.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experiments exploring the impact of visual embeddings on performance across a wider range of video understanding tasks, and when combined with different types of text-based representations, would provide evidence to answer this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of using free-form text descriptions as video representations, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that while free-form text descriptions are effective, they have limitations. For example, the authors show that suboptimal captions can lead to incorrect predictions, and that the token selector can only compress captions to a certain extent before performance degrades.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of free-form text descriptions as video representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research exploring the limitations of free-form text descriptions, such as their ability to capture complex visual information or their susceptibility to errors in caption generation, would provide evidence to answer this question.

## Limitations

- The claim that text-based representations consistently outperform or match visual embeddings across all benchmarks has medium confidence due to limited comparative analysis between modalities on identical video samples
- The token selector's effectiveness has medium confidence because evaluation focuses primarily on question answering tasks without thorough exploration of edge cases requiring detailed visual context
- The generalization of LLM-based video reasoning across diverse benchmarks has low confidence due to evaluation on only five specific datasets without testing on out-of-distribution video content or tasks requiring fine-grained spatial reasoning

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework's architectural design and implementation details are clearly specified, with reproducible methodology for generating text representations and integrating them with LLMs
- **Medium confidence**: Performance claims across benchmarks are supported by experimental results, but comparative analysis between modalities could be more rigorous
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the universality of text-based representations and the sufficiency of LLM reasoning capabilities across all video understanding tasks require broader validation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate Vamos on a diverse set of video understanding tasks beyond the five benchmarks, including fine-grained action recognition, temporal localization, and spatial reasoning tasks to assess the limits of text-based representations.

2. **Visual information necessity analysis**: Systematically identify video segments where visual embeddings provide critical information that text representations miss, by comparing model performance on visually ambiguous versus visually distinctive content within the same semantic categories.

3. **Token selector robustness evaluation**: Test the token selector on adversarially constructed captions where relevant information is embedded in less obvious tokens, and measure performance degradation when critical tokens are removed versus when irrelevant tokens are retained.
