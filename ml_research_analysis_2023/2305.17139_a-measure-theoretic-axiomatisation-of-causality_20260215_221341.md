core_contribution: This paper proposes a measure-theoretic axiomatisation of causality,
  arguing that Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic axiomatisation of probability should
  be taken as the starting point. The authors introduce the notion of a causal space,
  consisting of a probability space along with a collection of transition probability
  kernels called causal kernels that encode the causal information.

- Primary result: Introduces a measure-theoretic framework for causality based on causal spaces that generalize interventional aspects of existing frameworks while handling cycles, latent variables, and continuous-time stochastic processes

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a measure-theoretic axiomatisation of causality by introducing the notion of a causal space, consisting of a probability space along with a collection of transition probability kernels called causal kernels that encode causal information. The framework aims to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for causality that is grounded in measure theory and can seamlessly support situations where existing frameworks struggle, such as cycles, latent variables, and continuous-time stochastic processes. By defining causal kernels as transition probability kernels that encode interventional distributions directly, the framework sidesteps the need for structural equations to derive interventional distributions.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing causal spaces by enriching probability spaces with causal kernels encoding interventional information. The key steps are: 1) Define the probability space as a product space ⊗t∈T (Et, Et) for the desired index set T, 2) Specify causal kernels KS for each sub-σ-algebra HS of H that satisfy the axioms of Definition 2.2, and 3) Verify that the constructed causal space can represent interventional distributions and causal effects as intended. The framework provides a measure-theoretic foundation that avoids issues with acyclicity assumptions and variable enumeration present in existing approaches like structural causal models.

## Key Results
- Causal spaces provide a measure-theoretic foundation for causality that generalizes interventional aspects of SCMs and potential outcomes
- The framework can handle cycles, latent variables, and continuous-time stochastic processes that existing frameworks struggle with
- Causal kernels enable representation of interventions without structural equations by directly encoding interventional distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal kernels enable representation of interventions without structural equations
- Mechanism: By defining causal kernels as transition probability kernels that encode interventional distributions directly, the framework sidesteps the need for structural equations to derive interventional distributions. This allows natural handling of cycles, latent variables, and continuous-time processes.
- Core assumption: Probability spaces can be extended with causal kernels while preserving measure-theoretic rigor
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proposes the notion of a causal space, consisting of a probability space along with a collection of transition probability kernels, called causal kernels, that encode the causal information of the space"
  - [section 2] "A causal space is defined as the quadruple (Ω, H, P, K), where (Ω, H, P) = (×t∈TEt,⊗t∈T Et, P) is a (product) probability space and K = {KS : S ∈ P(T)}... causal kernels that encode the causal information of the space"
- Break condition: If the product probability space construction fails for non-standard measurable spaces or if causal kernels cannot be uniquely specified

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Causal spaces strictly generalize interventional aspects of SCMs and potential outcomes
- Mechanism: By constructing causal kernels that directly encode interventional distributions, causal spaces can represent any interventional distribution achievable in SCMs or potential outcomes frameworks. The framework provides a measure-theoretic foundation that avoids issues with acyclicity assumptions and variable enumeration.
- Core assumption: Any interventional distribution from existing frameworks can be encoded as a causal kernel
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our proposed framework is not only rigorously grounded in measure theory, but it also sheds light on long-standing limitations of existing frameworks including, for example, cycles, latent variables and stochastic processes"
  - [section 3.1] "we show that a unique causal space that corresponds to such an SCM can be constructed" and "causal spaces strictly generalise (interventional aspects of) SCMs"
- Break condition: If there exist interventional distributions in existing frameworks that cannot be represented as probability kernels over product spaces

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Time-respecting causal mechanisms naturally handle continuous-time stochastic processes
- Mechanism: By structuring the index set T = W × T̃ with W representing time and defining causal kernels that respect temporal ordering, the framework can encode causal relationships in continuous-time processes where future cannot affect past, unlike conditioning which does affect past values.
- Core assumption: Time can be embedded as a totally ordered component in the index set
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "Let W be a totally-ordered set... we consider causal spaces of the form (×t∈TEt,⊗t∈T Et, P, K), where the index set T can be written as T = W × T̃"
  - [section 4.3] "We say that the causal mechanism K respects time, or that K is a time-respecting causal mechanism, if, for all w1,w2 ∈ W with w1 < w2, we have that Hw2×T̃ has no causal effect... on Hw1×T̃"
- Break condition: If non-temporal causal influences exist that violate the time-respecting assumption or if the time component cannot be cleanly separated

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transition probability kernels
  - Why needed here: Causal kernels are defined as transition probability kernels, so understanding their properties is essential for working with causal spaces
  - Quick check question: What are the two key properties that define a transition probability kernel?

- Concept: Product probability spaces
  - Why needed here: Causal spaces are built on product probability spaces, which provide the foundation for defining causal kernels over different subspaces
  - Quick check question: How is the product σ-algebra on Ω = ×t∈TEt constructed from the component σ-algebras Et?

- Concept: Sub-σ-algebras and measurable rectangles
  - Why needed here: Causal kernels are defined on sub-σ-algebras of the form HS, and understanding how these interact with measurable rectangles is crucial for working with interventions
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between HS and the measurable rectangles that generate it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Probability space (Ω, H, P) + causal mechanism K = {KS : S ∈ P(T)}. The probability space provides the observational distribution, while causal kernels encode interventional information. Interventions modify both the probability measure and causal mechanism.

- Critical path: 1) Define the probability space as a product space 2) Specify causal kernels for each sub-σ-algebra HS 3) Implement intervention operation that modifies both probability measure and causal mechanism 4) Verify axioms are satisfied

- Design tradeoffs: Measure-theoretic rigor vs. interpretability (SCMs are more intuitive but less general), direct intervention encoding vs. structural equation derivation, generality vs. practical implementation complexity

- Failure signatures: Non-unique or non-existent interventional distributions, inability to represent certain causal relationships, violation of time-respecting constraints, kernel specification conflicts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Example 2.5 (altitude-temperature) to verify basic causal kernel construction
  2. Construct Example 4.1 (ice cream sales/shark attacks) to test confounder handling
  3. Build Example 4.4 (Brownian motion) to verify time-respecting mechanism behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to incorporate backtracking counterfactuals, where we consider what would have happened if background conditions were different while keeping causal laws the same?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions backtracking counterfactuals as an important concept and suggests this as essential future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a tentative proposal for extending the framework to interventional counterfactuals and leaves the definition of backtracking counterfactual causal spaces as future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of a backtracking counterfactual causal space, along with examples and theorems showing how it relates to the existing framework.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the causal space framework be used to develop a theory of actual causality, which determines whether a particular event was caused by a particular action?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions actual causality as an interesting area of research that has far-reaching implications, and suggests investigating how it can be embedded into causal spaces as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions actual causality and does not provide any formal definitions or theorems related to it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of actual causality within the causal space framework, along with examples and theorems showing how it relates to the existing notions of interventional and counterfactual causality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the causal space framework be used to develop a theory of causal abstraction, which studies how causal relationships can be preserved when simplifying or aggregating variables?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions causal abstraction as a topic that should benefit from the proposed framework and suggests extending homomorphisms of probability spaces to causal spaces as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions causal abstraction as a potential application and does not provide any formal definitions or theorems related to it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of causal abstraction within the causal space framework, along with examples and theorems showing how it relates to the existing notions of causal kernels and interventions.

## Limitations
- The uniqueness and consistency of causal kernels across different interventions is not fully established
- The computational complexity of implementing interventions in this framework is not addressed
- The relationship between observational and interventional distributions under this axiomatisation requires further exploration

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The measure-theoretic foundation and definition of causal spaces are mathematically rigorous and well-specified.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that causal spaces strictly generalize interventional aspects of existing frameworks, while theoretically supported, lacks complete proof verification.
- **Medium Confidence**: The framework's ability to handle cycles, latent variables, and continuous-time stochastic processes is demonstrated through examples but not exhaustively proven.

## Next Checks

1. Construct and verify causal kernels for a non-trivial SCM with multiple confounders and mediators to test the framework's generalization claims.
2. Implement a cyclic causal system (e.g., predator-prey model) and verify that the causal space correctly represents interventional distributions without violating the acyclicity constraints of SCMs.
3. Develop a continuous-time stochastic process example (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) to validate the time-respecting causal mechanism construction and demonstrate how conditioning differs from intervention in this framework.
