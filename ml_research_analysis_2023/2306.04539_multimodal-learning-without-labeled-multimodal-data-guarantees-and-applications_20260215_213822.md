# Multimodal Learning Without Labeled Multimodal Data: Guarantees and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.04539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04539
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces theoretical bounds on multimodal synergy that enable performance estimation and self-supervised learning without labeled multimodal data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of quantifying multimodal interactions when only labeled unimodal data and unlabeled multimodal data are available. The authors propose a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the synergy between modalities using information-theoretic bounds. These bounds enable two key applications: estimating the performance of multimodal models without requiring labeled multimodal data, and designing self-supervised learning objectives that capture the disagreement between modalities. The framework is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that the bounds accurately track true synergy and lead to performance improvements in self-supervised learning.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a framework for quantifying multimodal interactions using only labeled unimodal data and unlabeled multimodal data. It proposes two lower bounds on synergy - one based on shared information and another based on modality disagreement - and an upper bound via min-entropy couplings. The approach involves training unimodal classifiers on labeled data, computing modality disagreement on unlabeled multimodal data, and using information-theoretic estimators to bound synergy. These bounds are then applied to estimate multimodal model performance and guide self-supervised learning objectives that capture modality disagreement.

## Key Results
- The proposed lower and upper bounds accurately track true synergy on synthetic bitwise datasets and real-world multimodal datasets
- Allowing disagreement during self-supervised pre-training improves performance on datasets with high disagreement and synergy, particularly on MUS TARD
- The framework successfully estimates optimal multimodal performance without requiring labeled multimodal data
- Agreement synergy emerges when conditioning on the label increases dependence between modalities beyond their unconditional dependence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The lower bound on synergy based on modality disagreement accurately estimates true synergy when disagreement is driven by non-unique information.
- **Mechanism**: Disagreement between unimodal classifiers arises from either unique information in one modality or synergistic information requiring both modalities. If uniqueness is small, the disagreement must be due to synergy.
- **Core assumption**: Unimodal classifiers are Bayes-optimal or near-optimal, so their disagreement reflects the underlying information structure.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Our second lower bound introduces the concept of modality disagreement which quantifies the differences of classifiers trained separately on each modality."
  - [section]: "If uniqueness is small, then disagreement must be accounted for by synergy, thereby yielding a lower bound Sdisagree."
- **Break condition**: If unimodal classifiers are poorly trained or if uniqueness dominates disagreement, the lower bound will be loose or misleading.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Agreement synergy exists when conditioning on the label increases dependence between modalities beyond their unconditional dependence.
- **Mechanism**: When modalities share information but their dependence increases given the label (I(X1;X2|Y) > I(X1;X2)), synergy emerges from the conditional relationship.
- **Core assumption**: The label acts as a common cause that induces conditional dependence between modalities.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "agreement synergy happens when two modalities agree in predicting the label and synergy arises within this agreeing information."
  - [section]: "This setting is reminiscent of common cause structures... S = 4.92, R= 0.79 for the VQA 2.0 dataset."
- **Break condition**: If modalities are independent given the label or if the label doesn't induce conditional dependence, agreement synergy will be minimal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The upper bound on synergy via min-entropy couplings provides a tight constraint when synergy is low or when the approximation method is accurate.
- **Mechanism**: The upper bound is derived by finding the minimum entropy coupling that satisfies marginal constraints, which limits the maximum possible synergy.
- **Core assumption**: The approximation algorithm for min-entropy coupling provides a close estimate to the true minimum entropy.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings."
  - [section]: "Some of the other examples in Table 1 show bounds that are quite weak. This could be because... our approximation used in Theorem 4 is mathematically loose."
- **Break condition**: If the approximation algorithm is loose or if high synergy distributions exist that match the constraints, the upper bound will be weak.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Partial Information Decomposition (PID)**
  - Why needed here: PID provides the theoretical framework for decomposing mutual information into redundant, unique, and synergistic components, which is essential for quantifying multimodal interactions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between redundancy and synergy in the context of two modalities predicting a label?

- **Concept: Information Theory and Mutual Information**
  - Why needed here: Mutual information quantifies the amount of information one variable provides about another, which is fundamental for measuring interactions between modalities.
  - Quick check question: How does conditional mutual information differ from regular mutual information, and why is it important for understanding modality interactions?

- **Concept: Bayes Optimal Classifiers**
  - Why needed here: The theoretical guarantees rely on unimodal classifiers being optimal to ensure that disagreement reflects true information structure rather than classifier error.
  - Quick check question: What properties must a classifier have to be considered Bayes optimal, and why is this important for the disagreement-based bounds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Unimodal classifiers (f1, f2) trained on labeled unimodal data -> Modality disagreement metric (α) -> Information-theoretic estimators for redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy -> Optimization solvers for max-entropy problems (for lower bounds) -> Min-entropy coupling approximation algorithm (for upper bound) -> Multimodal performance estimator based on total information

- **Critical path**:
  1. Train unimodal classifiers on labeled data
  2. Compute modality disagreement on unlabeled multimodal data
  3. Estimate redundancy and uniqueness from labeled unimodal data
  4. Calculate lower and upper bounds on synergy
  5. Use bounds to estimate multimodal performance or guide self-supervised learning

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Tradeoff between bound tightness and computational complexity (exact vs. approximate methods)
  - Choice of distance function for disagreement (affects bound quality)
  - Number of clusters for approximating continuous modalities (impacts information estimates)
  - Whether to prioritize agreement or disagreement in self-supervised learning objectives

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor classifier performance leading to inaccurate disagreement estimates
  - Bounds not tracking true synergy (indicating model assumptions violated)
  - Negative lower bounds on synergy (suggesting high uniqueness dominates)
  - Computational intractability for large modality spaces

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify bounds on synthetic bitwise datasets with known synergy values
  2. Test disagreement-based synergy estimation on a real dataset with high disagreement (e.g., MUS TARD)
  3. Apply self-supervised disagreement objective to a multimodal dataset and compare with agreement-based baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise relationship between the tightness of the upper bound S and the actual synergy S across different types of interactions (agreement vs. disagreement synergy)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how the upper bound performs better on high synergy data but shows some weakness in certain datasets like ENRICO, where synergy is distributed across all interaction types.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while the upper bound is often tight for high synergy datasets, its performance varies, especially when datasets like ENRICO have distributed interactions. The exact mathematical or empirical reasons for this variability are not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis comparing the upper bound's tightness across datasets with varying interaction types (e.g., high agreement synergy vs. high disagreement synergy) would clarify the conditions under which the bound is tight or loose.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of distance function d in the modality disagreement definition affect the lower bound on synergy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes certain properties for the distance function (relaxed triangle inequality and inverse Lipschitz condition) but does not explore how different choices of d might impact the tightness of the lower bound.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical framework relies on specific properties of the distance function, but empirical tests with different distance functions (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) are not provided to assess their impact on the bound's tightness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the lower bound's performance using different distance functions across multiple datasets would reveal how sensitive the bound is to the choice of d.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework be extended to more than two modalities, and how would the bounds generalize?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on two modalities and mentions that extending the definitions and bounds to three or more modalities is an important open question.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comprehensive framework for two modalities, the mathematical and computational challenges of extending it to more modalities are not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical extension of the bounds to three or more modalities, along with empirical validation on multimodal datasets (e.g., text, image, and audio), would demonstrate the framework's scalability.

## Limitations
- The bounds' tightness depends heavily on the approximation quality of min-entropy couplings, which may be loose for high-dimensional or complex modality distributions
- The disagreement-based lower bound assumes unimodal classifiers are near-optimal, but real-world classifier errors could propagate into synergy estimates
- The framework assumes discrete modalities or sufficient discretization of continuous modalities, which may introduce approximation errors

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical foundations connecting information theory concepts (PID, conditional mutual information) to multimodal learning
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical validation showing bounds track true synergy on tested datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Applications to self-supervised learning performance improvements, though results show mixed effects across datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test bound accuracy on additional synthetic distributions with known synergy values, particularly those with high dimensionality or complex conditional dependencies
2. Validate robustness of disagreement-based bounds when unimodal classifiers are deliberately suboptimal (varying levels of classifier error)
3. Apply the framework to multimodal datasets with different characteristics (text-image, audio-video, sensor-fusion) to assess generalizability across modality pairs
