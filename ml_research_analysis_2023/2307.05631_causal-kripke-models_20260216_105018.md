# Causal Kripke Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.05631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05631
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sound and complete axiomatization of modal logic of actual causality using causal Kripke models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces causal Kripke models, extending Halpern and Pearl's causal models to a possible world semantics framework. The framework uses a modal logic with operators to reason about causality in scenarios involving uncertainty, temporality, and knowledge. The key contribution is a sound and complete axiomatization that generalizes Halpern and Pearl's definitions of actual causality to the possible world setting, allowing for more intuitive definitions of sufficient causality by considering nearby contexts.

## Method Summary
The method involves defining causal Kripke models as tuples (S, W, R, F) where S is the signature, W is a finite set of possible worlds, R is an accessibility relation, and F assigns structural equations to endogenous variables at each world. A modal language is developed with hybrid features including atomic propositions, Boolean connectives, modal operators □ and ♦, and intervention formulas. The Halpern-Pearl definitions of actual causality are extended to this setting, and a sound and complete axiomatization is provided by adding modal axioms to the existing axiomatization.

## Key Results
- Introduction of causal Kripke models as a framework for reasoning about causality under uncertainty
- Development of a modal language with hybrid operators for causal reasoning across possible worlds
- Sound and complete axiomatization of the modal logic of actual causality
- Illustration of how sufficient causality can be defined using nearby contexts rather than all contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The causal Kripke model extends Halpern-Pearl causality by adding possible worlds with accessibility relations.
- Mechanism: The framework introduces a modal language that allows reasoning about causality under uncertainty, knowledge, and temporality by treating each world as a possible context with its own structural equations.
- Core assumption: The structural equations are world-dependent, allowing the same variable to have different dependencies across worlds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a logic of actual causality with modal operators, which allows for reasoning about causality in scenarios involving multiple possibilities, temporality, knowledge and uncertainty."
  - [section 4] "For any causal Kripke model K = (S ,W, R, F ) we refer to S as its signature... Note that we allow the same endogenous variable to have different structural equations associated with it in different worlds."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on causal models and counterfactuals but don't directly discuss Kripke extensions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The modal language with hybrid operators enables reasoning about both local world facts and global accessibility.
- Mechanism: The language includes both propositional variables and world-indexed variables (X, w), plus modal operators □ and ♦ to capture necessity and possibility across accessible worlds.
- Core assumption: The accessibility relation R captures the "nearby contexts" intuition for sufficient causality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "the language LM has two types of atomic propositions, using variables of the form X and of the form (X, w)... the satisfaction of (X, w') = x is independent of the world it is evaluated at."
  - [section 5.1] "Sufficient causality... in terms of nearby contexts instead of all the contexts (as suggested by Halpern) in the following way... we only require that the intervention [Y←y] makes α true in nearby (not all) contexts."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on causality definitions but not on modal extensions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The sound and complete axiomatization ensures the logic correctly captures the intended semantics.
- Mechanism: The axiomatization extends Halpern's logic with modal axioms (K, necessitation, G-axiom) and provides a filtration argument to prove completeness.
- Core assumption: The finite set of formulas allows for a canonical model construction and filtration argument.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "axiomatization can be extended to the modal logic of causality by adding the following axioms... All substitution instances of axioms of basic modal logic K... Necessitation rule: from φ infer □φ"
  - [appendix C] "Showing that the axiomatization is sound is routine... To prove that the axiomatization is weakly complete, we show contrapositively that if ⊬ ψ then there exists a model satisfying ¬ψ."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss causality and counterfactuals but not axiomatization completeness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kripke models and possible world semantics
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on Kripke semantics to represent multiple possible contexts and their relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the accessibility relation R in a standard Kripke model and the one used in causal Kripke models?

- Concept: Structural equations and interventions
  - Why needed here: The causal reasoning depends on how variables depend on each other, and interventions allow testing counterfactuals.
  - Quick check question: How does an intervention [Y←y]α differ from simply assuming Y=y in the original model?

- Concept: Modal logic operators (□, ♦) and their interaction with interventions
  - Why needed here: These operators capture necessity and possibility across worlds, which is essential for reasoning about causality under uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: Why is the G-axiom necessary in this axiomatization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Signature S = (U, V, R) -> Worlds W -> Accessibility relation R ⊆ W×W -> Structural equations F -> Modal language with hybrid variables -> Axiomatization

- Critical path:
  1. Define the causal Kripke model (S, W, R, F)
  2. Define the modal language with hybrid variables
  3. Extend HP definitions of causality to this setting
  4. Develop axiomatization and prove soundness/completeness
  5. Apply to examples and illustrate sufficient causality

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Allowing world-dependent structural equations increases expressiveness but complicates reasoning
  - Using hybrid language (both propositional and world-indexed variables) enables richer reasoning but requires careful axiomatization
  - Focusing on finite models ensures completeness but may limit applicability to infinite scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent satisfaction relations across worlds
  - Cycles in the accessibility relation when only recursive models are intended
  - Interventions that cannot be properly evaluated due to missing structural equations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the umbrella example (Example 5.1) and verify that the possibility of rain is captured as a cause
  2. Test the stalemate example (Example 5.2) to confirm that certainty of king's fate is properly modeled
  3. Verify the police example (Example 5.3) shows that Bob's knowledge affects causation differently than his actual presence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the relationship between the three HP definitions of causality be generalized to the causal Kripke model framework, particularly for cases where the definitions do not coincide?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions that the three HP definitions (original, updated, and modified) do not necessarily coincide in causal Kripke models, and provides an example (stalemate detailed) where the modified definition may not coincide with the original and updated definitions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a complete generalization of the relationship between the three HP definitions in the causal Kripke model framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or counterexample showing the relationship between the three HP definitions in the causal Kripke model framework, particularly for cases where they do not coincide.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the notions of normality (or typicality) and graded causation be described in a nuanced and multiple ways using the causal modal language developed in this paper?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions that other notions related to actual causality like normality and graded causation can be described in more nuanced and possibly multiple ways using the causal modal language.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed exploration of how normality and graded causation can be described using the causal modal language.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition and examples of how normality and graded causation can be described using the causal modal language, along with a discussion of the nuances and multiple interpretations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework of causal Kripke models be extended to allow for interventions on the relation R, particularly in scenarios where the cause for some event is accessibility to some possible world?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions that allowing interventions on R would allow us to model scenarios where the cause for some event is accessibility to some possible world.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed exploration of how interventions on R can be incorporated into the causal Kripke model framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition and examples of how interventions on R can be incorporated into the causal Kripke model framework, along with a discussion of the implications and applications.

## Limitations
- The three HP definitions of causality may not coincide in causal Kripke models, requiring careful verification of each definition separately
- The precise definition of "nearby contexts" for sufficient causality remains open research with only a suggested approach
- The framework focuses on finite models, which may limit applicability to scenarios requiring infinite possible worlds

## Confidence

- High confidence: The basic framework of causal Kripke models and the modal language construction are well-defined and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: The extension of causality definitions and the axiomatization are logically sound but require careful verification against specific examples
- Low confidence: The practical applicability and computational tractability of the framework for real-world scenarios involving uncertainty and knowledge

## Next Checks

1. Verify that all three Halpern-Pearl definitions of actual causality (original, updated, modified) behave consistently in the causal Kripke model framework, particularly examining Example B.1 where they diverge
2. Test the framework's ability to handle scenarios with temporal dependencies and knowledge updates, as suggested in the discussion of combining uncertainty, temporality, and knowledge
3. Implement a systematic comparison between the proposed "nearby contexts" approach to sufficient causality and Halpern's original formulation across multiple example scenarios
