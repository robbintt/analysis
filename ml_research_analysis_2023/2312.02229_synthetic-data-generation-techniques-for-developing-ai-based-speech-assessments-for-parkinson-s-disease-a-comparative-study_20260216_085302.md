# Synthetic Data Generation Techniques for Developing AI-based Speech Assessments for Parkinson's Disease (A Comparative Study)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02229
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02229
- Reference count: 19
- Using CopulaGAN synthetic data generation leads to 90.6% accuracy and 90.6% F1-score with ExtraTrees classifier using only 12 interpretable features

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates deep learning-based synthetic data generation techniques to enhance machine learning classifiers for Parkinson's Disease (PD) speech assessment. The authors generate synthetic speech data using TVAE, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN methods from a dataset of 195 acoustic features from 31 participants. They then train and evaluate various traditional ML algorithms on these generated datasets. The results demonstrate that CopulaGAN-generated data, when used with the ExtraTrees classifier and a reduced set of 12 features focused on "Shimmer" and pitch characteristics, achieves 90.6% accuracy and F1-score. This approach provides both high performance and interpretability, as the selected features align with known PD-related speech impairments.

## Method Summary
The study employs three synthetic data generation techniques (TVAE, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN) to create additional training samples from an original dataset containing 195 acoustic features from 31 participants (8 healthy, 23 PD patients). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Random Forest as the base estimator is applied to identify the most relevant features for classification. Various traditional ML algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and SVM) are trained on the generated datasets. The performance of these classifiers is evaluated using accuracy and F1-score metrics, with the CopulaGAN technique combined with the ExtraTrees classifier showing the best results at 90.6% accuracy and F1-score using only 12 features.

## Key Results
- CopulaGAN synthetic data generation combined with ExtraTrees classifier achieves 90.6% accuracy and 90.6% F1-score
- The high-performing classifier uses only 12 features focused on "Shimmer" related features and pitch height/range reduction
- This approach provides better interpretability than classifiers trained with more features, aligning with known PD speech impairments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CopulaGAN technique generates high-quality synthetic speech data that improves classifier performance
- Mechanism: Combines Gaussian Copula with conditional GANs to capture complex feature dependencies and correlations, producing synthetic samples that maintain statistical properties of real speech features
- Core assumption: Synthetic data preserves underlying distributions and relationships between acoustic features relevant to PD diagnosis
- Evidence anchors: Study reports 90.6% accuracy with CopulaGAN; quality scores indicate TVAE generates highest quality data (82.43%) compared to CopulaGAN (68.92%)
- Break condition: If synthetic data fails to preserve critical feature relationships, classifier performance would degrade

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RFE with Random Forest identifies most relevant features for PD classification
- Mechanism: Iteratively removes least important features based on Random Forest's feature importance scores
- Core assumption: Random Forest's feature importance scores accurately reflect relevance for distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls
- Evidence anchors: Authors state RFE suggested by literature for feature selection; selected cross-fold validations for most accurate results
- Break condition: If feature importance scores are unreliable or important combinations are removed, classifier performance suffers

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Smaller set of interpretable features (shimmer and pitch-related) leads to explainable classifier without accuracy sacrifice
- Mechanism: Focuses on features known to be affected by PD, making classifier decisions more interpretable to clinicians
- Core assumption: Selected features (shimmer and pitch) are most indicative of PD-related speech impairments
- Evidence anchors: Literature indicates PD influences shimmer features and reduces pitch height/range; classifier focuses on these features
- Break condition: If selected features aren't most relevant or other important features are overlooked, accuracy compromised

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation techniques (TVAE, CTGAN, CopulaGAN)
  - Why needed here: Address data scarcity by generating additional training samples maintaining original data's statistical properties
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between TVAE and CTGAN in terms of their synthetic data generation approach?

- Concept: Recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Random Forest as base estimator
  - Why needed here: Identify most relevant features for PD classification, improving both performance and interpretability
  - Quick check question: How does RFE determine which features to eliminate at each iteration?

- Concept: Machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, XGBoost, SVM)
  - Why needed here: Develop accurate and interpretable models for distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls based on speech features
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting over a single Decision Tree?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preprocessing -> Synthetic Data Generation (TVAE/CTGAN/CopulaGAN) -> Feature Selection (RFE with RF) -> Model Training (ML classifiers) -> Model Evaluation (Accuracy/F1-score) -> Interpretability Analysis
- Critical path: 1. Preprocess original dataset 2. Generate synthetic data using CopulaGAN 3. Apply RFE to select most relevant features 4. Train ExtraTrees classifier on generated dataset with selected features 5. Evaluate classifier's performance and interpretability
- Design tradeoffs: Synthetic data addresses scarcity but may not capture real-world complexity; fewer features improve interpretability but may reduce performance if important features omitted; different classifiers have varying accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency
- Failure signatures: Poor performance indicates ineffective synthetic data generation or feature selection; lack of interpretability suggests features don't align with domain knowledge; overfitting occurs when model performs well on training but poorly on unseen data
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare classifier performance on real vs. synthetic data (TVAE/CTGAN/CopulaGAN) 2. Evaluate impact of different feature selection methods on performance and interpretability 3. Test best classifier's robustness on separate validation set using cross-validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How would increasing sample size of speech data from both PD patients and healthy controls impact performance and generalizability of AI-based classifiers? (Basis: Authors note more data needed for accurate, robust classifiers; current study limited by small dataset)
- What is the impact of demographic factors (age, gender, race) on performance of AI-based classifiers for PD speech assessment? (Basis: Authors note age, gender, race might influence speech features and suggest need for fairness mechanisms)
- How do advanced data augmentation techniques (MTR, ELiEC) compare to synthetic data generation techniques used in this study in terms of improving classifier performance? (Basis: Authors mention future directions including MTR, ELiEC, and transfer learning techniques)

## Limitations
- Study relies on small dataset (31 participants), limiting generalizability of findings
- Synthetic data generation techniques may not fully capture complexity and variability of real-world speech data
- Clinical relevance and interpretability of generated data are not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence

- High: Mechanism of using synthetic data to address data scarcity in PD speech assessment is well-established in literature
- Medium: Specific implementation details and hyperparameters for synthetic data generation and ML algorithms are not fully disclosed
- Low: Interpretability of classifier decisions based on selected features is asserted but not empirically validated with clinicians

## Next Checks

1. Conduct thorough evaluation of synthetic data's quality and clinical relevance, including comparison with real-world speech data and expert validation
2. Collaborate with clinicians to assess interpretability and clinical relevance of selected features (shimmer and pitch-related) in PD diagnosis context
3. Test best-performing classifier on larger, more diverse dataset to evaluate generalizability and robustness across different populations and recording conditions
