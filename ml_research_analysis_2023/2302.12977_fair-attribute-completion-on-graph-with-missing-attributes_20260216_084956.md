# Fair Attribute Completion on Graph with Missing Attributes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.12977
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12977
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: FairAC framework achieves significant improvements in fairness metrics (∆SP and ∆EO) while maintaining comparable accuracy in fair attribute completion on graphs with missing attributes.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving fairness in graph learning when node attributes are partially missing. The proposed FairAC framework jointly tackles attribute completion and fairness mitigation through an autoencoder with adversarial learning for fair feature embeddings and an attention mechanism for attribute completion that considers topological information. Evaluated on three real-world datasets, FairAC demonstrates significant improvements in fairness metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable accuracy.

## Method Summary
FairAC is a framework for fair attribute completion on graphs with missing attributes. It employs an autoencoder with adversarial learning to generate fair feature embeddings for nodes with available attributes, while using an attention mechanism to complete missing attributes by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. The framework addresses both feature unfairness (from biased attributes) and topological unfairness (introduced during attribute completion). The autoencoder is adversarially trained to remove sensitive information, and the attention mechanism is designed to mitigate unfairness while leveraging topological structure.

## Key Results
- FairAC achieves 23.45% improvement in ∆SP and 11.32% improvement in ∆EO on average across datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods
- The framework maintains comparable node classification accuracy (within 2-3% of non-fair baselines) despite the fairness constraints
- FairAC demonstrates robustness to high attribute missing rates (up to 80% missing attributes) while still improving fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: FairAC can recover fair node embeddings for nodes with missing attributes by leveraging topological embeddings and an attention mechanism.
- **Mechanism**: The framework first generates topological embeddings for all nodes using DeepWalk. For nodes with missing attributes, FairAC uses an attention mechanism to aggregate attribute information from their neighbors, weighted by attention scores learned to mitigate unfairness. The attention mechanism is trained adversarially to fool a sensitive classifier, ensuring the completed attributes do not encode sensitive information.
- **Core assumption**: Topological structure contains semantic information that correlates with node attributes, enabling attribute recovery even when direct attributes are missing.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion."
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Given a pair of nodes (u,v) which are neighbors, the contribution of node v is the attention attu,v, which is defined as: attu,v = Attention(Tu,Tv), where Tu,Tv are the topological embeddings of nodes u and v, respectively."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing direct evidence in corpus; the paper provides the theoretical mechanism but lacks empirical validation in the corpus of related work.
- **Break condition**: If the topological structure does not correlate with attributes (e.g., in graphs where edges are formed independently of attributes), the attention mechanism cannot effectively recover attributes.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: FairAC mitigates feature unfairness by using an adversarial learning framework to remove sensitive information from node embeddings.
- **Mechanism**: An autoencoder encodes node attributes into embeddings. A sensitive classifier is trained to predict sensitive attributes from these embeddings. The autoencoder is adversarially trained to minimize the classifier's ability to predict sensitive attributes, thus producing embeddings invariant to sensitive attributes.
- **Core assumption**: Non-sensitive attributes may implicitly encode sensitive information, leading to biased predictions; adversarial training can remove this implicit encoding.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "FairAC adopts an autoencoder with adversarial learning to generate fair feature embeddings for nodes with available attributes."
  - [section 3.2.1]: "With the sensitive classifier Cs, we could leverage it to adversarially train the autoencoder, such that fE is able to generate fair feature embeddings that can fool Cs. The loss LF is written as: LF = Lae−βLCs."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing direct evidence; the paper describes the adversarial framework but does not provide extensive empirical validation in the corpus.
- **Break condition**: If the sensitive classifier cannot effectively detect sensitive information (e.g., due to weak correlation between attributes and sensitive attributes), the adversarial training will not succeed.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: FairAC mitigates topological unfairness introduced during attribute completion by updating attention parameters to fool the sensitive classifier.
- **Mechanism**: After initial attribute completion using attention, the framework further updates the attention parameters to minimize the sensitive classifier's ability to predict sensitive attributes from the completed embeddings. This ensures that the attribute completion process itself does not introduce bias.
- **Core assumption**: The attribute completion process can introduce bias if the attention mechanism assigns higher weights to neighbors with similar sensitive attributes.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion."
  - [section 3.2.3]: "To address this issue, FairAC leverages sensitive classifier Cs to help mitigate topological unfairness by further updating the attention parameter matrix W and thus obtaining fair feature embeddings H."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing direct evidence; the paper describes the mechanism but does not provide extensive empirical validation in the corpus.
- **Break condition**: If the attention mechanism cannot effectively update to remove sensitive information (e.g., due to limited training data or weak signals), topological unfairness will persist.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DeepWalk -> Autoencoder -> Sensitive Classifier -> Attention Mechanism -> Attribute Completion
- **Critical path**:
  1. Generate topological embeddings using DeepWalk.
  2. Train autoencoder to encode attributes into embeddings and reconstruct them.
  3. Train sensitive classifier to predict sensitive attributes from embeddings.
  4. Adversarially train autoencoder to fool sensitive classifier.
  5. For nodes with missing attributes, use attention mechanism to aggregate neighbor information.
  6. Further update attention parameters to mitigate topological unfairness.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using DeepWalk for topological embeddings vs. other methods (e.g., node2vec).
  - Using adversarial training to remove sensitive information vs. other methods (e.g., reweighting).
  - Using attention mechanism to aggregate neighbor information vs. other methods (e.g., averaging).
- **Failure signatures**:
  - If autoencoder cannot effectively reconstruct attributes, attribute completion will fail.
  - If sensitive classifier cannot effectively detect sensitive information, adversarial training will not succeed.
  - If attention mechanism cannot effectively aggregate neighbor information, attribute completion will fail.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train autoencoder to encode attributes into embeddings and reconstruct them, evaluate reconstruction loss.
  2. Train sensitive classifier to predict sensitive attributes from embeddings, evaluate classification accuracy.
  3. Adversarially train autoencoder to fool sensitive classifier, evaluate fairness metrics (∆SP and ∆EO).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several important questions arise from the research:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does FairAC's performance change when using different attention mechanisms, such as self-attention or graph attention networks (GAT), instead of the current attention mechanism?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses an attention mechanism to aggregate feature information from neighbors, but it does not explore alternative attention mechanisms or compare their performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of FairAC with its current attention mechanism, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other attention mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments using different attention mechanisms and compare their performance in terms of fairness and accuracy metrics on the same datasets used in the paper.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does FairAC handle dynamic graphs where node attributes and connections change over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static graphs with missing attributes, but it does not discuss how FairAC would adapt to dynamic graphs with evolving attributes and connections.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any insights into how FairAC can be extended or modified to handle dynamic graphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigate the performance of FairAC on dynamic graphs with changing attributes and connections, and propose modifications or extensions to the framework to handle such scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different graph structures on FairAC's performance, such as scale-free networks, small-world networks, or random graphs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates FairAC on three real-world datasets with different structures, but it does not systematically explore the impact of different graph structures on its performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how FairAC's performance varies with different graph structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments on synthetic graphs with different structures and compare FairAC's performance across these structures in terms of fairness and accuracy metrics.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is conducted on only three real-world datasets, which may not generalize to all graph types and domains
- The computational complexity of the adversarial training framework and attention mechanism is not thoroughly discussed
- The paper does not extensively validate the robustness of FairAC under different graph structures or attribute distributions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of FairAC (autoencoder with adversarial learning for fair feature embeddings) is well-defined and theoretically sound. The evaluation shows consistent improvements in fairness metrics across datasets.
- **Medium confidence**: The attribute completion mechanism using attention is plausible but lacks extensive empirical validation. The claim that topological structure contains sufficient information for attribute recovery is not fully proven.
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of FairAC in mitigating topological unfairness due to attribute completion is not thoroughly validated. The paper does not provide strong evidence that the attention mechanism effectively updates to remove sensitive information.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness check**: Evaluate FairAC on additional graph datasets with varying structures and attribute distributions to validate its generalization capability.
2. **Scalability check**: Analyze the computational complexity of FairAC and evaluate its performance on large-scale graphs to ensure practical applicability.
3. **Ablation study**: Conduct an ablation study to isolate the contributions of the autoencoder, attention mechanism, and adversarial learning components to the overall fairness improvements.
