# Explainable Machine Learning for Categorical and Mixed Data with Lossless Visualization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.18437
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18437
- Reference count: 0
- This work develops methods for explainable machine learning with heterogeneous data and lossless visualization of n-D non-numeric data.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for explainable machine learning with categorical and mixed data types. The authors develop the Sequential Rule Generation (SRG) algorithm that uses monotone Boolean functions to efficiently generate interpretable rules while avoiding exponential complexity. A novel approach to lossless visualization of high-dimensional non-numeric data using frequency-based parallel coordinates enables visual rule discovery. The framework addresses the interpretability challenges of one-hot encoding and provides methods for handling various data types including nominal, ordinal, and cyclical data.

## Method Summary
The methodology introduces a classification of mixed data types and their appropriate encoding schemes for ML interpretability. The core contribution is the Sequential Rule Generation (SRG) algorithm that builds Hansel chains of attribute subsets using monotone Boolean functions to filter unpromising rules, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Multiple SRG variants (SRG0-SRG5) are presented with different attribute grouping and rule selection strategies. For visualization, frequency-based and reference frequency-based approaches in parallel coordinates preserve information while enabling visual pattern recognition. The toolkit integrates these components for mixed data visualization and explainable rule discovery.

## Key Results
- SRG algorithm successfully generates interpretable rules with high precision (75%-95%) and coverage on mushroom dataset
- Frequency-based parallel coordinates enable lossless visualization of n-D non-numeric data without information loss
- Different SRG variants show varying performance based on dataset characteristics and attribute grouping strategies
- Visual rule discovery demonstrated through parallel coordinates showing frequency distributions and class dominance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Encoding nominal attributes with one-hot keys corrupts interpretability in distance-based algorithms like kNN.
- Mechanism: One-hot encoding assigns equal Hamming distances to all attribute values, losing semantic relationships and making distance calculations meaningless for nominal data.
- Core assumption: Nominal attribute values do not have inherent order or measurable distance between them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The problem with one hot key is that it dramatically increases the sizes of the space... It creates a scaling problem to make the total distances meaningful."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct match in corpus, but related concepts exist in distance metrics for mixed data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential Rule Generation (SRG) algorithm reduces computational complexity from exponential to tractable by using monotone Boolean functions to filter unpromising rules.
- Mechanism: The algorithm builds Hansel chains of attribute subsets and uses monotonicity properties to eliminate rules that cannot improve precision or coverage based on their subrules.
- Core assumption: If a rule with fewer attributes fails to meet precision/coverage thresholds, any rule extending it with additional attributes will also fail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The filtering methods in the Sequential Rule Generation algorithm is based on the principle of monotone Boolean functions... an additional requirement will at most keep the number of cases that satisfy R2 the same as for R1 but most typically it will be less than R1."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct match, but clustering via kernel metric learning (paper 218777) uses similar filtering concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lossless visualization of n-D non-numeric data using frequency-based parallel coordinates preserves information while enabling visual rule discovery.
- Mechanism: The visualization assigns bar heights based on value frequencies and uses color coding for target attribute dominance, allowing users to identify high-purity attribute-value combinations that form rules.
- Core assumption: Visual patterns in frequency distributions correlate with class boundaries in the data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate advantages of reference frequency-based visualization... This method computes the number of bars, and their heights based on the relations of these values with values of another reference attribute Xt (e.g., target attribute)."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct match, but high-dimensional classification in concentric coordinates (paper 32250) uses similar visualization principles.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Measurement data types (absolute, ratio, interval, cyclical, ordinal, nominal)
  - Why needed here: Different data types require different operations and encoding schemes for explainable ML
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why cyclical data like azimuth needs special handling compared to interval data?

- Concept: Monotone Boolean functions and their application to rule generation
  - Why needed here: SRG algorithm uses monotonicity properties to reduce computational complexity
  - Quick check question: If a rule with 2 attributes has 80% precision, what can you say about a rule with the same 2 attributes plus a third attribute?

- Concept: Parallel coordinates visualization and its limitations with binary attributes
  - Why needed here: Standard parallel coordinates struggle with binary attributes due to lack of variability
  - Quick check question: Why do binary attributes create occlusion problems in standard parallel coordinates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Type Editor -> SRG Algorithm -> Visualization Engine -> Rule Combination Module -> Evaluation Framework
- Critical path: Data → Encoding → Rule Generation → Visualization → Rule Discovery
- Design tradeoffs:
  - One-hot vs. frequency encoding: Space vs. interpretability
  - Rule complexity vs. coverage: Simpler rules are more interpretable but may miss cases
  - Visualization density vs. clarity: More information vs. occlusion
- Failure signatures:
  - Exponential runtime: Indicates SRG filtering not working properly
  - Poor rule precision: Suggests encoding scheme not preserving data semantics
  - Visual clutter: Indicates frequency visualization parameters need adjustment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SRG0 on mushroom dataset with sequential attribute triples to verify basic functionality
  2. Test frequency-based visualization on census income dataset to validate visual patterns
  3. Compare SRG1 vs SRG2 on mushroom data to understand rule overlap benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the precision and coverage of SRG algorithms compare on datasets other than mushroom data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Further experiments are needed to test SRG algorithms, which will allow to discover other limitations of current versions of SRG and to develop new versions of SRG algorithm which will fit different datasets."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated SRG algorithms on mushroom data, so their performance on other datasets is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running SRG algorithms on multiple other datasets and comparing precision, coverage, and rule complexity to results on mushroom data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of attribute grouping strategies on SRG algorithm performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents different versions of SRG algorithms with different attribute grouping strategies and states "Analysis of these results shows that selecting a specific SRG algorithm for the task at hand depends on a combination of several properties of the task and data."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not directly compare the performance of different attribute grouping strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically testing SRG algorithms with different attribute grouping strategies on the same datasets and comparing precision, coverage, and rule complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SRG algorithms be extended to handle more complex data types like graphs and text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses mixed data types including graphs and text, but focuses on SRG algorithms for categorical data. It states "This study provides a user with the adaptation of mixed data types and their coding schemas for lossless visualization of multidimensional mixed data in parallel coordinates."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how SRG algorithms can be adapted to handle graph and text data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing SRG algorithm extensions that can handle graph and text data, and comparing their performance to the original SRG algorithms.

## Limitations

- Lack of detailed algorithmic specifications for the monotone Boolean function filtering mechanism in SRG
- Missing quantitative metrics for "lossless" preservation in visualization approaches
- No comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art explainable ML methods
- Limited experimental validation to primarily mushroom dataset

## Confidence

- High confidence: The data type classification framework and the general approach to encoding categorical data for interpretability
- Medium confidence: The Sequential Rule Generation algorithm's filtering mechanism and visualization approaches
- Low confidence: Specific parameter settings, performance benchmarks, and comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods

## Next Checks

1. Implement a minimal SRG algorithm with monotone filtering on a small synthetic dataset to verify the computational complexity claims
2. Test the frequency-based visualization approach on a known dataset (e.g., Iris) to confirm that visual patterns align with actual class boundaries
3. Compare one-hot encoding vs. frequency encoding performance on kNN classification to validate the interpretability claims for nominal data handling
