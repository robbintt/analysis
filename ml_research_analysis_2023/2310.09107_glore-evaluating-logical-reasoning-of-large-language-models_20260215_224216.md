# GLoRE: Evaluating Logical Reasoning of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09107
- Authors: Multiple
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Commercial LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT) outperform open-source models on logical reasoning tasks, but all models show sensitivity to data distribution and rely on superficial patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GLoRE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark consolidates 12 diverse datasets across three task types: multi-choice reading comprehension, natural language inference, and true-or-false questions. Experiments on models including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and open-source LLMs reveal that commercial models outperform open-source ones in zero-shot settings, with GPT-4 approaching human-level performance on some datasets. However, performance varies significantly across datasets, indicating sensitivity to data distribution. The study demonstrates that techniques like in-context learning, instruction tuning, and self-consistency probing can improve performance, though LLMs still rely on superficial patterns rather than deep logical understanding for reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The GLoRE benchmark evaluates LLMs across 12 datasets spanning multi-choice reading comprehension, natural language inference, and true-or-false questions. Models are tested using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction-tuned evaluation paradigms. The study employs self-consistency probing to test stability against context perturbations and chain-of-thought prompting to encourage step-by-step reasoning. Instruction tuning is performed on LLaMA-7B using LogiQA 2.0 training data converted to an instruction-prompting framework. Performance is measured using classification accuracy, with human evaluation of generated responses based on coherence, completeness, correctness, and relevance.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 and ChatGPT achieve significantly higher accuracy than open-source models like LLaMA and Falcon in zero-shot settings
- Self-consistency probing and chain-of-thought prompting provide limited but measurable improvements in performance
- Model performance drops substantially on new data distributions (LogiQA vs LogiQA22), indicating poor generalization
- LLMs struggle with complex reasoning types, particularly disjunctive reasoning, with accuracy below 50%
- Instruction-tuned LLaMA-7B achieves competitive performance on some datasets, suggesting transfer learning potential

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-consistency probing improves logical reasoning accuracy by leveraging the inherent stability of logical conclusions to minor perturbations
- Mechanism: The method generates K unique contexts by randomly rearranging sentences from the original context, each fed to the LLM to generate an answer, and the final response is chosen based on majority vote
- Core assumption: Logical conclusions remain unchanged regardless of the order of facts or the specific structuring of sentences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "self-consistency probing, a technique useful for testing stability against minor context perturbations"
  - [section]: "These tasks require understanding the interplay between different pieces of information rather than treating them independently"
  - [corpus]: Weak - No direct corpus evidence for this specific self-consistency mechanism, but related works exist on consistency analysis of LLMs
- Break condition: If the logical reasoning task is highly sensitive to sentence order or context structure, the shuffling approach may not improve performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompting enhances logical reasoning by providing multi-step reasoning chains that guide the model toward correct conclusions
- Mechanism: The prompt "Let's think step by step" is added to encourage the LLM to generate longer reasoning texts exemplifying the reasoning steps before providing the final answer
- Core assumption: LLMs can benefit from explicit step-by-step reasoning guidance, even if the reasoning process itself may rely on superficial patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "chain-of-thought reasoning can be helpful to, but only to a limited extent"
  - [section]: "the CoT reasoning process works mostly by leveraging GPT-4 with more relevant context"
  - [corpus]: Weak - Related work on CoT exists but no direct corpus evidence for this specific application
- Break condition: If the model relies too heavily on superficial patterns rather than deep abstractions, CoT may not lead to meaningful reasoning improvements

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Instruction tuning improves zero-shot logical reasoning performance through transfer learning from similar task distributions
- Mechanism: The LogiQA 2.0 training set is converted into an instruction-prompting framework and used to fine-tune LLaMA-7B, improving its performance on related logical reasoning tasks
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning on one logical reasoning dataset can generalize to improve performance on other logical reasoning datasets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "instruction tuning, and self-consistency probing improve performance"
  - [section]: "the instruction-tuned model's performance on LogiQA22 (35.16%) even surpassed that of the RoBERTa-based classification model"
  - [corpus]: Weak - No direct corpus evidence for this specific instruction tuning approach, but related works on instruction tuning exist
- Break condition: If the target tasks have significantly different distributions or reasoning types than the training data, transfer learning may be limited

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logical reasoning types (categorical, sufficient conditional, necessary conditional, conjunctive, disjunctive)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these types helps explain why models perform differently across datasets and tasks
  - Quick check question: Which reasoning type showed the best performance for both ChatGPT and GPT-4 according to the results?

- Concept: Zero-shot vs few-shot vs instruction-tuned evaluation paradigms
  - Why needed here: These different evaluation methods reveal different aspects of model capabilities and learning efficiency
  - Quick check question: Which evaluation method showed the highest performance gain for GPT-4?

- Concept: Self-consistency and chain-of-thought techniques
  - Why needed here: These are the key methods proposed to improve logical reasoning performance
  - Quick check question: What is the core difference between self-consistency probing and chain-of-thought prompting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GLoRE benchmark consists of 12 datasets across 3 task types (MRC, NLI, TF), evaluation framework with multiple prompting strategies, and comparison models (commercial LLMs, open-source LLMs, fine-tuned baselines)
- Critical path: Data preparation → Prompt engineering → Model evaluation → Result analysis → Performance improvement through various techniques
- Design tradeoffs: Standardized format enables comparison but may lose task-specific nuances; comprehensive coverage vs. manageable scope; commercial vs. open-source model comparison
- Failure signatures: Performance drops on new data distributions (LogiQA vs LogiQA22); poor performance on complex reasoning types (disjunctive reasoning); sensitivity to context perturbations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run zero-shot evaluation on all datasets with standard prompts to establish baseline performance
  2. Apply self-consistency probing to ChatGPT on a subset of datasets to measure improvement
  3. Fine-tune LLaMA-7B on LogiQA 2.0 training set and evaluate zero-shot performance on other datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do variations in data distribution across different logical reasoning datasets affect the performance of large language models (LLMs), and can this sensitivity be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: Explicit. The paper discusses how GPT-4's performance significantly drops on LogiQA22 compared to LogiQA 2.0, indicating sensitivity to data distribution.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the issue, it does not explore potential methods to mitigate this sensitivity or adapt models to handle varying data distributions effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing LLM performance on datasets with controlled variations in distribution, alongside techniques like domain adaptation or data augmentation, would clarify the impact and potential mitigation strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improve the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and does it rely on superficial patterns rather than deep understanding?
- Basis in paper: Explicit. The paper notes that CoT prompting leads to limited improvements in performance and suggests that it might work by leveraging more relevant context rather than deep abstractions.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the limited effectiveness of CoT but does not thoroughly investigate whether it aids in genuine logical reasoning or merely provides superficial context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis comparing CoT responses with and without reasoning chains, and evaluating the logical consistency of intermediate steps, would determine whether CoT contributes to deeper understanding or relies on surface-level patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective are self-consistency probing methods in improving the robustness of LLMs for logical reasoning tasks, and do they generalize across different languages and tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit. The paper introduces self-consistency probing as a method to test stability against context perturbations, showing mixed results across datasets and languages.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of self-consistency probing varies, and the paper does not explore its generalizability across different languages or task types in depth.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing of self-consistency methods across diverse datasets, languages, and task types, with analysis of performance improvements, would clarify its effectiveness and generalizability.

## Limitations

- Model performance shows high sensitivity to data distribution changes, with significant accuracy drops on similar logical reasoning tasks
- Even the best-performing models achieve only ~50% accuracy on complex reasoning types like disjunctive reasoning
- LLMs rely on superficial patterns rather than deep logical understanding, as evidenced by limited improvement from chain-of-thought prompting
- The study focuses primarily on English datasets, limiting generalizability to other languages

## Confidence

- High confidence: Dataset consolidation methodology and overall performance trends across models
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of self-consistency probing (limited empirical validation)
- Low confidence: Claims about LLMs' deep logical understanding (contradicted by pattern-matching behaviors observed)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic experiments varying training data distribution for instruction-tuned models to quantify the generalization gap observed between LogiQA and LogiQA22 datasets.

2. Perform detailed error analysis on GPT-4's reasoning failures, specifically categorizing mistakes by logical reasoning type to identify systematic weaknesses.

3. Compare self-consistency probing against other perturbation-based methods (e.g., context paraphrasing, alternative fact ordering) to validate whether shuffling is the optimal approach for testing reasoning stability.
