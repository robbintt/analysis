# Automated Planning Techniques for Elementary Proofs in Abstract Algebra

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06490
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Automated planning techniques can construct elementary proofs in abstract algebra by modeling ring axioms as planning actions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an automated planning approach to construct elementary proofs in abstract algebra, specifically for commutative rings. The authors model ring axioms and equalities as planning actions, using planners to generate proofs of results like uniqueness of additive inverses and the identity −1 × 𝑎 = −𝑎. The study demonstrates that planning techniques can effectively handle axiomatic mathematical reasoning and produce valid proofs, suggesting automated planning as a promising approach for automated theorem proving. The work also identifies abstract algebra as a new benchmark domain for planners, though challenges remain with undeclared variables and non-deterministic domains.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves encoding ring axioms and equalities as planning actions in a PDDL-style representation. The domain definition module implements 28 actions covering core axioms, equality operations, operations with zeros, sums, products, and inverses. The approach uses both deterministic and non-deterministic planning domains, with undeclared variables to model existential axioms. Planners like LAMA and PRP are used to generate proofs from initial states and goals, with results translated into human-readable mathematical proofs.

## Key Results
- Automated planners successfully generate valid proofs for elementary theorems in commutative rings
- The approach handles both deterministic proofs (like uniqueness of additive inverses) and non-deterministic case analysis (like integral domain proofs)
- Undeclared variables enable existential instantiation but introduce challenges for planner scalability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The planning approach works because abstract algebra axioms can be modeled as deterministic actions in a state-space search.
- Mechanism: Each ring axiom (e.g., associativity, commutativity, distributivity) is encoded as a planning action with preconditions matching the current state and effects producing new equalities. The planner searches through these actions to construct valid proofs.
- Core assumption: Mathematical proofs in elementary abstract algebra can be decomposed into a sequence of elementary rule applications that correspond to planning actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We implement basic implications, equalities, and rules in both deterministic and non-deterministic domains to model commutative rings and deduce elementary results about them."
  - [section 4] "Thus, given two elements that are sums of 𝑎 and 𝑏, we set them equal."
- Break condition: If proofs require non-local reasoning patterns that cannot be decomposed into local action sequences, or if the state space becomes too large for practical search.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Undeclared variables extend the planner's reasoning capability by allowing existential instantiation.
- Mechanism: Variables representing unknown elements (e.g., 𝑎 + 𝑏 for arbitrary 𝑎, 𝑏) are introduced as "undeclared" predicates that can be instantiated during search when needed for a proof step.
- Core assumption: The existence of certain elements in ring theory (guaranteed by closure axioms) can be modeled as variables that become concrete when the proof requires them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.1] "Undeclared variables are often used to model existential axioms. For example, in a commutative ring 𝑅 we have that for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅, there is an element 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅."
  - [section 4.2.2] "The LAMA planner is able to find the following solution, in which the undeclared variable 𝑥 is assigned a value to aid in the proof."
- Break condition: When proofs require multiple interdependent undeclared variables or when the instantiation pattern becomes too complex for the planner to handle efficiently.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-deterministic planning enables case-based reasoning for proofs requiring proof-by-contradiction or case analysis.
- Mechanism: The integral domain axiom "if 𝑎𝑏 = 0 then 𝑎 = 0 or 𝑏 = 0" is modeled as a non-deterministic action with multiple possible outcomes, allowing the planner to explore different proof branches.
- Core assumption: Mathematical case analysis can be represented as non-deterministic choice points in the planning model, with each branch leading to different proof paths.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "In the FOND model, we introduce the notion of contradictions. Contradictions are represented by a predicate that, once added, cannot be removed."
  - [section 5.2] "The non-determinism in this planning problem is induced by the integral domain axiom, namely the latter 𝑎 = 0 or 𝑏 − 𝑐 = 0 statement."
- Break condition: When the branching factor becomes too large or when the planner cannot efficiently manage the state space explosion from multiple non-deterministic choices.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Commutative ring axioms and their formalization
  - Why needed here: The entire planning domain is built on modeling these algebraic structures, so understanding the axioms is essential for implementing the actions correctly.
  - Quick check question: What are the five core axioms that define a commutative ring with identity?

- Concept: Planning domain modeling (PDDL-style representation)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a planning language to encode mathematical reasoning, requiring understanding of how predicates, actions, preconditions, and effects work.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the commutative property of addition as a planning action with parameters, preconditions, and effects?

- Concept: Non-deterministic planning and FOND models
  - Why needed here: The integral domain proofs require case analysis that is naturally modeled using non-deterministic actions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a deterministic action and a non-deterministic action in planning, and how does this relate to case analysis in proofs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Domain definition module -> Problem generator -> Planner interface -> Proof translator -> Result validation
- Critical path: Domain definition → Problem generator → Planner execution → Proof translation → Result validation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Action granularity: More fine-grained actions enable shorter proofs but increase search space; fewer coarse actions reduce search but may miss valid proof paths.
  - Variable handling: Predeclaring all possible variables simplifies the domain but increases state space; undeclared variables reduce state space but add complexity to the planner.
  - Determinism vs. non-determinism: Deterministic domains are easier to plan in but cannot handle case analysis; non-deterministic domains can handle more proof types but are computationally harder.
- Failure signatures:
  - Planner timeout without solution: Likely indicates the proof requires reasoning patterns not captured by the current action set.
  - Multiple solutions found: May indicate redundancy in the action definitions or that the proof has multiple valid approaches.
  - Planner finds solution but proof is unreadable: Suggests the planner is optimizing for path length rather than human-understandable proof structure.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prove the uniqueness of additive inverses using only the core ring axioms (no undeclared variables) to verify basic functionality.
  2. Add undeclared variables and prove that 𝑎 × 0 = 0 to test existential instantiation capabilities.
  3. Model an integral domain and prove the cancellative law to test non-deterministic case analysis functionality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can automated planners effectively handle more complex algebraic structures beyond commutative rings, such as groups, fields, and modules?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention extending the methodology to other algebraic structures and suggest this as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the approach on commutative rings, leaving the applicability to more complex structures untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and proof generation for groups, fields, and modules using the same planning approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the introduction of undeclared variables impact the scalability and performance of automated planners in theorem proving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that planners struggled with proofs involving multiple undeclared variables and consider this a novel challenge.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates simple cases with one undeclared variable, and more complex scenarios remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of planner performance with varying numbers of undeclared variables and proof complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can planning-based approaches generate proofs that are both optimal in length and readable for human mathematicians?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the tension between plan length and proof readability, noting that shorter plans don't always produce more intuitive proofs.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't propose a method to balance optimality and readability, nor does it evaluate human readability of generated proofs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of planner-generated proofs versus human-written proofs in terms of both length and perceived readability.

## Limitations

- Scalability concerns for complex algebraic structures beyond commutative rings
- Performance degradation with multiple undeclared variables in non-deterministic domains
- Generated proofs may be technically correct but difficult for humans to read or understand

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The claim that automated planning techniques can generate valid elementary proofs in commutative rings is well-supported by the experimental results showing successful proofs of basic theorems like uniqueness of additive inverses and the identity -1 × 𝑎 = -𝑎.

**Medium Confidence**: The assertion that abstract algebra offers a new benchmark domain for planners is plausible but requires broader validation across multiple planners and problem types. The paper provides initial evidence but doesn't demonstrate comprehensive benchmarking.

**Low Confidence**: The claim about planning's potential for automated theorem proving in general mathematics is speculative, as the work focuses specifically on commutative rings and elementary proofs. Extension to broader mathematical domains remains unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Expansion**: Test the planning approach on a larger suite of 20-30 elementary theorems in commutative rings, including both deterministic and non-deterministic problems, to assess scalability and identify failure patterns.

2. **Planner Comparison**: Implement the same domain and problems using multiple planning systems (including both classical and modern planners) to determine whether success depends on specific planner capabilities or is a general property of the approach.

3. **Human Readability Analysis**: Conduct a systematic evaluation comparing the readability and pedagogical value of generated proofs versus traditional mathematical proofs, using both expert mathematicians and students as evaluators to assess practical utility.
