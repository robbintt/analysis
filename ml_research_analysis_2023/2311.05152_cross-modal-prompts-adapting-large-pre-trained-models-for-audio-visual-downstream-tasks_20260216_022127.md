# Cross-modal Prompts: Adapting Large Pre-trained Models for Audio-Visual Downstream Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.05152
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05152
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: State-of-the-art performance on four audio-visual tasks with significant improvements over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Dual-Guided Spatial-Channel-Temporal (DG-SCT) attention, a mechanism that uses audio and visual modalities as soft prompts to adaptively adjust pre-trained model parameters for multi-modal audio-visual downstream tasks. The approach injects trainable cross-modal interaction layers into frozen audio-visual encoders, enabling adaptive extraction of crucial information across spatial, channel, and temporal dimensions. Experimental results on four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS, AVQA) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over baselines while maintaining parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
The DG-SCT mechanism leverages audio and visual modalities as mutual soft prompts by incorporating trainable cross-modal interaction layers into pre-trained audio-visual encoders. These layers use intermediate layer information from audio and video as prompts to guide each other across spatial, channel, and temporal dimensions. The approach preserves frozen pre-trained models while adding limited trainable parameters through bidirectional attention mechanisms that emphasize informative features and significant time segments. The method is evaluated across four audio-visual tasks with consistent performance improvements.

## Key Results
- Achieved 2.5% improvement on Audio-Visual Event localization (AVE) task
- Obtained 3.9% improvement on Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task
- Demonstrated strong performance in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios
- Outperformed baselines while adding only limited parameters to frozen models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DG-SCT uses audio and visual modalities as soft prompts to dynamically adjust the parameters of pre-trained models for multi-modal tasks.
- Mechanism: The DG-SCT module incorporates trainable cross-modal interaction layers into pre-trained audio-visual encoders. These layers use the intermediate layer information of audio and video as prompts to guide each other through spatial, channel, and temporal dimensions. This allows the model to adaptively extract crucial information from the current modality based on the counterpart modality's semantics.
- Core assumption: Audio and visual modalities can serve as effective prompts to guide feature extraction in their counterpart modalities, and this guidance is beneficial across spatial, channel, and temporal dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This mechanism leverages audio and visual modalities as soft prompts to dynamically adjust the parameters of pre-trained models based on the current multi-modal input features."
  - [section 3.3] "we take advantage of the fact that audio-visual pairs can provide mutual guidance for each other, and utilize different modalities as prompts to help pre-trained models focus more on specific aspects of opposite modal inputs across spatial, channel, and temporal dimensions."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. Related works focus on prompt tuning for single modalities (text, audio, video) but not specifically on using audio-visual pairs as mutual prompts in pre-trained encoders.
- Break condition: If the cross-modal interaction layers do not effectively capture the mutual guidance between audio and visual modalities, or if the guidance is not beneficial across all three dimensions (spatial, channel, temporal).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The channel-wise attention mechanism allows audio and video to adaptively emphasize informative features of the corresponding modality.
- Mechanism: The model uses convolutional and linear projection layers to encode audio and visual inputs as prompts. It then uses element-wise multiplication and projection layers to generate channel-guidance maps that highlight important features in each channel. These maps are combined with the original features using a sigmoid function to create channel attention maps.
- Core assumption: Different channels represent different aspects of features, and emphasizing informative channels can improve the quality of representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "We let the audio and video serve as mutual guidance signals and explicitly model the dependencies between channels on each other's modality."
  - [section 3.3] "Different channels represent different aspects of features. The introduction of channel attention can facilitate the model to ignore irrelevant features and improve the quality of representations [11]."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. While channel attention is a known technique, the specific application to cross-modal guidance in audio-visual tasks is not well-established in the corpus.
- Break condition: If the channel attention mechanism does not effectively identify and emphasize informative channels, or if it introduces noise or irrelevant information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The temporal-gated attention mechanism emphasizes significant time segments in audio and visual information.
- Mechanism: The model uses an RNN to capture temporal information from frequency-channel attentive audio features and spatial-channel attentive visual features. It then passes this information through a projection layer with a sigmoid function to obtain temporal attention gates. These gates are combined with the original features to emphasize important segments.
- Core assumption: In audio and visual information, significant time segments should be emphasized while background information should be attenuated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Given an audio, significant time segments (e.g., 'engine sound') should be emphasized, while background information (e.g., 'silence') should be attenuated. The same holds for the visual information as well [36]."
  - [section 3.3] "Inspired by this, we add temporal-gated attention in the final layer."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence. Temporal attention mechanisms are known, and the reference to [36] suggests prior work on temporal attention in audio-visual tasks.
- Break condition: If the RNN does not effectively capture temporal dependencies, or if the temporal attention gates do not accurately identify and emphasize significant segments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To enable the model to use audio and visual modalities as mutual prompts, guiding feature extraction in their counterpart modalities.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-modal attention differ from self-attention, and why is it important for multi-modal tasks?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
  - Why needed here: To adapt large pre-trained models to downstream tasks without full retraining, which would be computationally expensive.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of parameter-efficient fine-tuning compared to full fine-tuning or prompt tuning?

- Concept: Audio-visual feature extraction and representation
  - Why needed here: To understand how audio and visual information is encoded and processed in the model, and how cross-modal guidance affects these representations.
  - Quick check question: How do audio and visual features differ in their structure and representation, and how does this impact cross-modal interactions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input audio/visual → Frozen HTS-AT/Swin-T encoders → DG-SCT modules → Task-specific output layers

- Critical path:
  1. Audio and visual inputs are processed by their respective frozen encoders.
  2. The DG-SCT modules use the intermediate layer information as prompts to guide feature extraction in the counterpart modality.
  3. The guided features are passed through the rest of the encoder layers.
  4. The final audio-visual features are used for downstream tasks.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using frozen pre-trained models preserves their knowledge but limits adaptation.
  - Adding trainable DG-SCT modules increases parameter count but allows for task-specific guidance.
  - Bidirectional guidance (A2V and V2A) provides more comprehensive cross-modal interactions but increases complexity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on downstream tasks despite good pre-training.
  - Overfitting to the training data due to excessive adaptation of the frozen encoders.
  - Degraded performance on single-modality tasks due to over-reliance on cross-modal guidance.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove each component of DG-SCT (spatial, channel, temporal attention) and evaluate performance on a downstream task.
  2. Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different values for the α, β, and γ hyperparameters and evaluate their impact on performance.
  3. Comparison with baselines: Compare the performance of DG-SCT with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on a range of downstream tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DG-SCT mechanism generalize to other multi-modal tasks beyond the four tested (AVE, AVVP, AVS, AVQA)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates strong performance on four specific audio-visual tasks but does not explore generalization to other domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on specific tasks and does not test the method's adaptability to different multi-modal scenarios or domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DG-SCT on diverse multi-modal tasks such as action recognition, emotion recognition, or medical imaging analysis would provide evidence of its broader applicability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the hyperparameters α, β, and γ on the performance of DG-SCT across different tasks and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper includes a hyperparameter analysis section (Fig. 8) but only tests one task (AVE) and does not explore cross-task or cross-dataset effects.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is limited to a single task, leaving uncertainty about how optimal hyperparameter settings transfer across different tasks and datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying α, β, and γ across all tested tasks and multiple datasets would clarify the robustness and transferability of hyperparameter choices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational efficiency of DG-SCT compare to other prompt-based methods when scaling to larger pre-trained models or higher-resolution inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides efficiency analysis for one task (AVE) but does not explore scaling effects.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is limited to a single task and model size, leaving uncertainty about how computational costs scale with model size or input resolution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DG-SCT with larger pre-trained models (e.g., Swin-L, HTS-AT-large) and higher-resolution inputs while measuring computational costs would provide insights into scalability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the performance of DG-SCT change when applied to different pre-trained audio and visual encoder architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses specific pre-trained models (HTS-AT for audio, Swin-T/Swin-V2-L for visual) but does not test other architectures.
- Why unresolved: The choice of pre-trained models may influence DG-SCT's effectiveness, and testing with other architectures would reveal the method's robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replacing the pre-trained encoders with alternatives (e.g., ViT for visual, ResNet for audio) and evaluating performance would clarify the dependency on specific architectures.

### Open Question 5
- Question: What is the contribution of each attention mechanism (spatial, channel, temporal) to the overall performance of DG-SCT, and are there interactions between them?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The ablation study shows individual contributions but does not explore interactions between mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: While the paper tests each mechanism separately, it does not investigate how they interact or combine in different ways.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing all possible combinations of the three attention mechanisms and analyzing their interactions would reveal their relative importance and potential synergies.

## Limitations
- The method requires careful hyperparameter tuning for different tasks
- Performance gains in few-shot scenarios may not scale well to more complex datasets
- Computational overhead could become prohibitive for larger models

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core mechanism: Strong experimental results and detailed ablation studies across four distinct tasks
- Medium confidence in generalization claims: Limited validation on diverse audio-visual domains
- Low confidence in computational efficiency claims: Insufficient analysis of training time and inference latency compared to alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Perform a more comprehensive ablation study by removing each DG-SCT component (spatial, channel, temporal) individually across all four tasks to quantify their individual contributions and identify potential redundancies.

2. Evaluate DG-SCT on additional audio-visual datasets beyond the four presented tasks, particularly datasets with different characteristics to assess the method's robustness and generalizability.

3. Conduct a detailed computational analysis comparing DG-SCT's training time, inference latency, and memory usage against other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including a breakdown of the overhead introduced by the DG-SCT modules at each layer.
