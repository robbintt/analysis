# Prompt-based Learning for Text Readability Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.13139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13139
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: Joint training with multiple datasets improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to text readability assessment using prompt-based learning with pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models like T5 and BART. Instead of traditional classification methods, the authors reformulate readability as a pairwise ranking task where models determine which of two given texts is more difficult. They explore nine different input-output formats and demonstrate that this approach enables leveraging multiple parallel text simplification datasets while achieving strong generalization across domains. The best models achieve 99.6% accuracy on Newsela and 98.7% on OneStopEnglish using joint training.

## Method Summary
The authors adapt pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models (T5 and BART) for text readability assessment by reformulating it as a pairwise ranking task. They create pairwise instances from parallel and distinct datasets through permutation, fine-tuning the models in a text-to-text format with nine different input-output formats. The approach involves formatting two texts as input and training the model to output which text is more difficult. They conduct experiments on four datasets: Newsela, OneStopEnglish, Common Core Standards, and Cambridge English Readability, using joint training to improve cross-domain generalization.

## Key Results
- Best models achieve 99.6% accuracy on Newsela and 98.7% on OneStopEnglish using joint training
- Text-to-text fine-tuning requires more training steps than expected (up to 30 epochs vs 3-5 for classification)
- Input-output format significantly affects performance, with no single format working best across all models
- Joint training with multiple datasets improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pairwise ranking reformulation simplifies the readability task by removing the need for consistent label mapping across datasets
- Mechanism: By comparing two texts and outputting which is more difficult, the model learns a relative ordering concept rather than absolute labels. This makes it possible to combine datasets with different annotation schemes
- Core assumption: Relative difficulty judgments are consistent enough across different annotation standards to be useful for learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we argue that the combination of text-to-text training and pairwise ranking setup 1) enables leveraging multiple parallel text simplification data for teaching readability"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Our dataset processing strategy... and pairwise comparison approach force the model to learn label-agnostic, the global concept of relative difficulties of texts"
- Break condition: If the relative ordering is inconsistent within datasets or if texts differ significantly in topic/genre rather than readability level

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Text-to-text formulation enables leveraging pre-training knowledge more effectively than classification approaches
- Mechanism: By keeping the model in its native text-to-text format rather than adapting it to classification, we preserve the architecture's strengths in handling text generation and understanding
- Core assumption: The pre-trained knowledge in seq2seq models is more applicable to text-to-text tasks than classification tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A pretrained sequence-to-sequence model could be fine-tuned for text readability, in a text-to-text style"
  - [section 4, point 1]: "A pretrained sequence-to-sequence model could be fine-tuned for text readability, in a text-to-text style"
- Break condition: If the task doesn't benefit from the generative capabilities of seq2seq models or if classification would be more efficient

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint training with multiple datasets improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance
- Mechanism: Combining NEWS and OSEN during training exposes the model to more varied text difficulty levels and annotation schemes, creating a more robust understanding of readability
- Core assumption: Exposure to diverse data improves generalization more than training on a single dataset
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the combination of text-to-text training and pairwise ranking setup... trains a neural model for the general concept of readability (therefore, better cross-domain generalization)"
  - [section 4, point 3]: "Joint training has the potential to help both in-domain and cross-domain performances"
- Break condition: If the datasets have contradictory labeling standards or if one dataset dominates training due to size differences

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pairwise ranking and comparison
  - Why needed here: The entire approach is built on comparing two texts rather than classifying a single text
  - Quick check question: If given Text A (labeled level 2) and Text B (labeled level 4), what should the model output and why?

- Concept: Text-to-text fine-tuning mechanics
  - Why needed here: The approach requires understanding how to format inputs and outputs for seq2seq models
  - Quick check question: How does the "Question" format differ from the "Statement" format in terms of model input and expected output?

- Concept: Dataset permutation and construction
  - Why needed here: Creating pairwise instances from both parallel and distinct datasets is crucial for the methodology
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between permuting a parallel dataset versus a distinct dataset, and why does this matter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: T5/BART model → Input formatter → Pairwise comparator → Output formatter → Accuracy metric
- Critical path: Dataset permutation → Model fine-tuning → Cross-domain evaluation → Performance analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Text-to-text format vs classification format (generative capabilities vs efficiency), joint training vs single dataset training (generalization vs simplicity)
- Failure signatures: Low accuracy on cross-domain tests indicates overfitting to training data, poor performance on longer texts indicates input length limitations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune T5 on OSEN using "Question" format, evaluate on validation set
  2. Fine-tune BART on NEWS using "Reverse-F" format, evaluate on validation set
  3. Jointly train T5 on both OSEN and NEWS, evaluate on CCSB dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal input sequence length for T5 and BART models when applied to text readability assessment, and how does this affect performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that both BART and T5 support longer input sequences compared to other models like BERT or RoBERTa, but the current setup limits text length to 256 tokens per text due to the max sequence length of 512 tokens. The authors note that most texts from OSEN had to be truncated before training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence on how performance is affected when using longer max sequence lengths. The authors state they must "empirically confirm if good performance can be achieved when BART and T5 are used with longer max sequence length."
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying max sequence lengths (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048) on the same datasets and comparing model performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) would provide concrete evidence of the optimal input length for these models in readability assessment tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of input-output format affect model performance when using different pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models for text readability assessment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Input-output format significantly affected the final performance, especially when fine-tuning T5 with lesser training steps (OSEN)." It also notes that "Performance deviations caused by input-output format changes were larger than we expected" and that "no certain format generally ensured good results across models."
- Why unresolved: While the paper tests nine different input-output formats and observes significant performance variations, it does not provide a theoretical explanation for why certain formats work better than others. The authors mention the need for "additional 'format-tuning' processes when exploring new models."
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting ablation studies where different components of the input-output format (e.g., question vs. statement, difficulty vs. ease orientation) are systematically varied and tested across multiple pre-trained models would help identify which format elements are most critical for performance. Additionally, analyzing attention patterns in the models when using different formats could provide insights into why certain formats work better.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal training duration for T5 models when fine-tuning for text readability assessment, and how does this compare to encoder-only models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Text-to-text style fine-tuning required more training steps than expected. The majority of our OSEN fine-tuning experiments showed that the model's validation set performance continues to increase up to epoch 30. This is contrastive to how usual classification approaches, using encoder-only models, only fine-tune up to epoch 3∼5 even on smaller datasets like OSEN or CAMB."
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that performance continues to increase up to epoch 30 for OSEN, but does not explore whether even longer training would yield further improvements. The comparison to encoder-only models suggests a fundamental difference in training requirements, but the reasons for this difference are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with T5 models trained for extended periods (e.g., 50, 100, or 200 epochs) on the OSEN dataset and plotting validation performance over time would reveal whether there is a point of diminishing returns. Comparing these learning curves with those of encoder-only models (BERT, RoBERTa) trained on the same task would provide quantitative evidence of the difference in training requirements between architecture types.

## Limitations

- Performance uncertainty on longer documents (>1,000 tokens) due to input length limitations
- Reliance on relatively consistent relative difficulty judgments across different annotation schemes
- Potential efficiency concerns due to longer training requirements for text-to-text fine-tuning

## Confidence

- High confidence: The pairwise ranking reformulation as a distinct methodological contribution is well-supported by both theoretical reasoning and experimental evidence. The claim that joint training improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance has strong empirical backing from the reported results.
- Medium confidence: The assertion that text-to-text formulation enables better leveraging of pre-training knowledge is plausible but could benefit from more direct comparison with classification baselines. The claim about text-to-text fine-tuning requiring more steps is supported but lacks detailed analysis of the underlying causes.

## Next Checks

1. Test the approach on longer documents (2,000+ tokens) to verify if the pairwise ranking framework maintains accuracy when input length limitations become more significant.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the text-to-text approach directly against classification-based approaches using identical model architectures and datasets to isolate the impact of the reformulation.

3. Evaluate cross-domain performance on datasets with different annotation schemes (e.g., lexile levels vs grade levels) to test the robustness of the relative difficulty assumption across more diverse standards.
