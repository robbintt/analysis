# Split Learning in 6G Edge Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.12194
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12194
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Introduces split learning (SL) for collaborative ML at the 6G edge, proposing efficient parallel split learning (EPSL) that reduces training latency and communication costs while preserving data privacy.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents split learning (SL) as a privacy-preserving alternative to federated learning for 6G edge networks. SL partitions deep neural networks between edge devices and servers, allowing servers to handle most computation while devices retain early layers and raw data. The authors propose an efficient parallel split learning (EPSL) framework that reduces back-propagation computing and communication costs from O(M) to O(1) per training round. Experimental results on the HAM10000 dataset show EPSL reduces resource usage without significantly impacting learning accuracy.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes implementing split learning on 6G edge networks using parallel split learning (PSL) and an efficient variant called EPSL. The approach involves partitioning ResNet-18 models at intermediate layers, with clients handling early layers and servers handling deeper layers. EPSL introduces back-propagated gradient aggregation to reduce server-side computation from O(M) to O(1) where M is the number of clients. The method is evaluated on the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset with 5 client devices under non-IID and IID data distributions, comparing performance against vanilla SL, split federated learning (SFL), and traditional federated learning (FL).

## Key Results
- EPSL reduces back-propagation computing and communication costs from O(M) to O(1) per training round
- EPSL achieves 0.46% accuracy deterioration when model converges, compared to baseline SL
- Parallel split learning (PSL) enables simultaneous client-side training, reducing wall-clock training time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Edge split learning reduces device-side model training workload while preserving privacy.
- Mechanism: By partitioning deep neural networks and placing early layers on resource-constrained devices and deeper layers on edge servers, the client only processes a fraction of the model's computation, lowering memory and CPU demands.
- Core assumption: The data privacy requirement is satisfied as long as the cut layer is deep enough to obscure raw data from the server.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SL allows a server to handle the major workload of deep neural networks (DNNs) based on model splitting while still retaining a few early layers and raw data at local devices for privacy preservation."
  - [section II.B] "By splitting a model and placing a part of it at an edge server, SL allows a server to handle the major workload of deep neural networks (DNNs) based on model splitting while still retaining a few early layers and raw data at local devices for privacy preservation."
  - [corpus] Weak—no corpus evidence directly supports the claim; relies on internal paper description.
- Break condition: If the cut layer is too shallow, raw data may be exposed; if too deep, client-side computation may still exceed device capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parallel split learning reduces overall training latency by enabling simultaneous client-side computation.
- Mechanism: Multiple clients train their split models in parallel rather than sequentially, cutting down the wall-clock time for each training round.
- Core assumption: Network and server resources are sufficient to handle concurrent transmissions and gradient aggregation without becoming new bottlenecks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.B] "To address these issues, split federated learning (SFL) [6] and parallel split learning (PSL) [7], [8] have been devised to parallelize client-side model training, empowering clients to train their sub-models simultaneously."
  - [section IV.C] "Compared with existing state-of-the-art SL benchmarks, such as SFL and PSL, this method can reduce back-propagation computing and communication costs from O(M) (number of clients) to O(1)."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; inferred from paper's internal discussion.
- Break condition: If server-side processing or network bandwidth cannot scale with the number of parallel clients, latency improvements vanish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Back-propagated gradient aggregation in EPSL reduces server-side computation load without significantly impacting accuracy.
- Mechanism: Instead of back-propagating full gradients from all clients, EPSL aggregates the last-layer activation gradients into a single dimension, lowering computation from O(M) to O(1) per round.
- Core assumption: Aggregating gradients in this way preserves the statistical information needed for model updates, so convergence is not harmed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.C] "This method can reduce back-propagation computing and communication costs from O(M) (number of clients) to O(1). Note that EPSL can also control the aggregation ratio φ in the backpropagation process to strike a balance between the reduction in communications/computing costs and learning accuracy."
  - [section IV.C] "Fig. 4, where the back-propagated gradients are reduced without noticeably impacting the learning accuracy (i.e., with 0.46% deterioration when the model converges)."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence; relies on internal paper data.
- Break condition: If the aggregation ratio is too aggressive, gradient information loss may degrade convergence speed or final accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated learning basics (local training + global aggregation)
  - Why needed here: Split learning is positioned as an alternative to federated learning; understanding FL clarifies the motivation for SL.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main stages in federated learning, and how does this differ from split learning's data flow?

- Concept: Neural network forward and backward propagation
  - Why needed here: SL relies on splitting the forward pass at an intermediate layer and the backward pass at the same or related point; understanding these processes is critical to grasping SL's design.
  - Quick check question: In a typical CNN, where might you place the split layer to minimize client-side computation while preserving privacy?

- Concept: Network latency and bandwidth constraints at the edge
  - Why needed here: Edge split learning must balance computation offloading with communication costs; these constraints drive many design choices in the paper.
  - Quick check question: How does the size of intermediate activations change as data flows through deeper layers of a CNN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clients (IoT devices) → Split layer (model cut) → Edge server (gradient aggregation, deeper layers) → Central controller (SDN for resource orchestration). Multi-edge extends with multiple edge servers and hierarchical placement.
- Critical path: Data flow: Client forward pass → activation upload → server forward/backward → gradient download → client backward → repeat. Bottlenecks often at activation uploads or gradient aggregation.
- Design tradeoffs: More layers at client → higher privacy but higher computation; deeper split → lower computation but larger activations to upload; more parallel clients → faster rounds but higher server load.
- Failure signatures: High straggler impact → slow rounds; large activation sizes → network congestion; poor cut layer choice → privacy leaks or excessive client load.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline test: Run vanilla SL with a small CNN split at layer 5; measure client computation time and accuracy.
  2. Parallel scaling test: Increase number of clients in PSL; record per-round latency and convergence behavior.
  3. Gradient aggregation test: Implement EPSL with different φ values; compare server computation time and accuracy degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the convergence behavior of parallel split learning (PSL) without client-side model synchronization, and how does it compare to SFL and FL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies convergence analysis for PSL as an open problem in Section VII-A.
- Why unresolved: While empirical results show PSL performs well, there is no theoretical analysis of its convergence properties, especially compared to synchronized approaches like SFL and FL.
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous theoretical analysis proving convergence bounds for PSL under various data distributions and network conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can asynchronous PSL be implemented effectively while managing model staleness and ensuring convergence in resource-heterogeneous wireless edge networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VII-B discusses asynchronous PSL as an open problem, noting challenges with model staleness and convergence.
- Why unresolved: Asynchronous updates can improve resource utilization but may lead to poor convergence due to under-representation of stragglers, requiring careful management of update frequency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental and theoretical results demonstrating convergence guarantees for asynchronous PSL with adaptive staleness management strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can edge SL frameworks effectively balance the tradeoff between edge storage capacity and communication/computation costs when implementing partial model placement and migration?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section VI-C discusses model placement and migration as challenges, noting the tradeoff between storage usage and reduced communication costs for larger model portions at edge nodes.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a key challenge but does not provide specific solutions for optimizing this tradeoff across varying edge network topologies and application requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive framework quantifying the storage-communication-computation tradeoff and providing optimal placement strategies for different edge SL scenarios.

## Limitations

- Performance claims rely entirely on internal experiments without independent validation
- Key hyperparameters (split layer, gradient aggregation ratio φ, client data distribution) are underspecified for exact reproduction
- Limited discussion of how edge network heterogeneity or mobility affects convergence and scalability

## Confidence

- **High**: The core concept of split learning as a privacy-preserving alternative to federated learning.
- **Medium**: The proposed parallel split learning (PSL) architecture and its ability to reduce training latency.
- **Low**: Quantitative claims about EPSL's performance improvements without independent validation or clear hyperparameter disclosure.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate EPSL experiments with varied aggregation ratios φ to verify claimed trade-off between communication cost reduction and accuracy degradation.
2. Benchmark PSL vs SFL under heterogeneous device compute capabilities to assess straggler impact.
3. Validate privacy guarantees by testing whether shallow split layers in SL expose raw data patterns in intermediate activations.
