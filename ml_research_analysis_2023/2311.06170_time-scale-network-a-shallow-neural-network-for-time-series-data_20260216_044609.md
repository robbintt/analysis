# Time Scale Network: A Shallow Neural Network For Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06170
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel shallow network architecture for efficient time series classification using learned wavelet-like kernels at multiple scales

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Time Scale (TiSc) Network, a novel and efficient architecture for time series data classification. TiSc Net combines the translation and dilation sequence of discrete wavelet transforms with traditional convolutional neural networks and back-propagation. This approach enables the network to learn features at multiple time scales simultaneously, leading to superior accuracy-per-parameter and accuracy-per-operation compared to other shallow networks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TiSc Net on two biomedical applications: Atrial Dysfunction detection using ECG signals and Seizure Prediction using EEG signals.

## Method Summary
The Time Scale (TiSc) Network is a shallow neural network designed for time series data classification. It consists of three main components: the TiSc Input Layer, which applies learned waveform kernels at exponentially increasing scales in parallel; the TiSc Hidden Layers, which combine activations according to time-scaled receptive fields; and a Dense Layer, which maps the combined features to the output classes. The network is trained using back-propagation and optimized for efficiency in terms of parameters and operations. The authors evaluate the performance of TiSc Net on two biomedical datasets: the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for Atrial Dysfunction detection and the CHB-MIT dataset for Seizure Prediction.

## Key Results
- TiSc Net achieves superior accuracy-per-parameter and accuracy-per-operation compared to other shallow networks on biomedical time series classification tasks.
- The network demonstrates impressive results on Atrial Dysfunction detection using ECG signals and Seizure Prediction using EEG signals, with significantly fewer parameters and operations than baseline methods.
- The interpretability of the learned features, as visualized using Grad-CAM, provides insights into the underlying signal patterns and facilitates potential clinical applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The network learns optimal wavelet-like shapes for each scale without numerical constraints.
- Mechanism: The TiSc Net uses learned waveform kernels at each scale that slide across the data in parallel, avoiding the constraints of traditional wavelets (orthogonality, perfect reconstruction). Backpropagation optimizes these shapes specifically for the classification task, extracting only the most relevant features for the objective.
- Core assumption: The optimal wavelet-like shape for a given classification task is not known a priori and can be learned through backpropagation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We harness the power of DL and back-propagation to design custom wavelet shapes at many time scales without numerical constraints."
  - [section]: "Waveform kernels are learned via back-propogation without any numerical constraints, where each scale is independent from the others, allowing for optimized feature extraction specific to the task at hand."
- Break condition: If the classification task requires features that are better captured by traditional wavelet bases with specific properties (e.g., orthogonality for signal reconstruction), the unconstrained learned shapes may be suboptimal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The architecture enables efficient consideration of both short and long-term features in a single layer.
- Mechanism: TiSc Net uses exponentially increasing window sizes in parallel, allowing immediate access to multi-scale features without stacking multiple layers of short-duration kernels (as in CNNs) or relying on subsampling schemes (as in DWTs). This avoids the computational burden of processing long-term features through many sequential layers.
- Core assumption: The signal contains relevant information at multiple time scales that can be effectively captured by parallel processing with exponentially increasing window sizes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The network simultaneously learns features at many time scales for sequence classification with significantly reduced parameters and operations."
  - [section]: "This architecture enables full-scale receptive fields immediately after the first layer, keeping long-term features from having to be processed through many sequential layers of short-duration kernels as in CNNs."
- Break condition: If the relevant features in the signal are primarily localized in time or frequency and do not require multi-scale analysis, the parallel exponential windowing may be unnecessary and computationally wasteful.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hidden layers combine features of different scales that occur together, allowing consideration of independent features in the greater context of the rest of the signal.
- Mechanism: The TiSc Hidden Layers combine activations according to the same time-scaled receptive field, ensuring that only activations contained in a particular time scale are combined. This allows the network to consider features at different scales in their proper temporal context.
- Core assumption: The relevant features in the signal are not independent across scales and require context from other scales for accurate classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "TiSc Hidden Layers combine activations according to the same time-scaled receptive field, assuring consideration of strictly time-limited features."
  - [section]: "The resulting equation is the same as Equation 1, but x represents the embedded space and w[m] selects activations at all λ whose receptive fields are entirely contained in 0 ≤ n < m in the raw data."
- Break condition: If the relevant features in the signal are independent across scales and do not require context from other scales, the hidden layers may introduce unnecessary complexity and computational overhead.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TiSc Input Layer → TiSc Hidden Layers → Dense Layer
- Critical path: TiSc Input Layer → TiSc Hidden Layers → Dense Layer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - The use of learned waveform kernels instead of traditional wavelets allows for task-specific optimization but may lead to suboptimal performance for tasks requiring specific wavelet properties.
  - The parallel processing of exponentially increasing window sizes enables efficient multi-scale feature extraction but may be computationally wasteful for signals with primarily localized features.
  - The combination of features across scales in the hidden layers allows for contextual consideration but may introduce unnecessary complexity for signals with independent features across scales.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on tasks requiring specific wavelet properties (e.g., orthogonality for signal reconstruction)
  - Overfitting or underfitting due to inappropriate choice of hyperparameters (e.g., number of scales, number of hidden layers)
  - Failure to converge during training due to improper initialization or optimization settings
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the TiSc Input Layer with a single scale and compare its performance to a traditional convolutional layer on a simple time series classification task.
  2. Vary the number of scales in the TiSc Input Layer and observe the impact on performance and computational efficiency.
  3. Add TiSc Hidden Layers and compare the performance to a network with only the TiSc Input Layer, observing the impact of multi-scale feature combination.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the physiological mechanisms behind the 16 Hz spiking pattern identified in the seizure prediction EEG signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions observing consistent 16 Hz spiking patterns in the learned waveforms for seizure prediction, but reserves deeper analysis for a future publication.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the pattern but doesn't explore the underlying biological reasons or potential clinical significance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed physiological studies correlating the 16 Hz spiking patterns with known seizure mechanisms or clinical observations could explain the phenomenon.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Time Scale Network perform on non-medical time series data with varying temporal characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests the method is applicable to any time series data containing features at multiple time scales, but only demonstrates it on biomedical signals.
- Why unresolved: The authors focus on biomedical applications and don't test the network on diverse non-medical datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the Time Scale Network on various non-medical time series datasets (e.g., financial, environmental, or internet traffic data) and comparing performance with other methods would demonstrate its broader applicability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of time scales (Λ) for different types of time series data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors experimented with different Λ values for the ECG and EEG datasets but didn't provide a general guideline for selecting the optimal number of time scales.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that performance varies with Λ but doesn't establish a systematic approach for determining the best Λ for different applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting extensive experiments across diverse time series datasets and developing a methodology to determine the optimal Λ based on signal characteristics would answer this question.

## Limitations
- The performance of TiSc Network on other time series classification tasks beyond the two biomedical applications studied remains unclear, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The sensitivity of the network's performance to hyperparameter choices is not extensively explored, and the optimal settings may vary across different datasets and tasks.
- The scalability of TiSc Network to very long time series or high-dimensional multivariate data is not discussed, and the computational efficiency gains may diminish with increasing sequence length or number of channels.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The theoretical justification for the TiSc Network's design choices, including the use of learned waveform kernels and parallel multi-scale processing, is well-founded based on established principles in signal processing and deep learning.
- Medium Confidence: The claims about the network's efficiency and accuracy compared to other shallow architectures are supported by the experimental results on the two biomedical datasets. However, further validation on a wider range of tasks is needed.
- Low Confidence: The interpretability of the learned features and their clinical relevance for the biomedical applications is not thoroughly investigated. The Grad-CAM visualizations provide some insights, but a deeper analysis of the feature representations is necessary.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of each component of the TiSc Network (learned waveform kernels, multi-scale processing, hidden layers) on performance and efficiency.
2. Compare the performance of TiSc Network with state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., deep CNNs, Transformers) on the same biomedical datasets.
3. Evaluate the TiSc Network on a diverse set of time series classification tasks, including non-biomedical applications, to assess its generalizability and robustness.
