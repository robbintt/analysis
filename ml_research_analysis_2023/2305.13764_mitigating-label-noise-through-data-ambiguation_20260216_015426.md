# Mitigating Label Noise through Data Ambiguation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.13764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13764
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Robust Data Ambiguation (RDA), a method to mitigate label noise in deep learning by deliberately ambiguating target labels.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Robust Data Ambiguation (RDA), a method to mitigate label noise in deep learning by deliberately ambiguating target labels. The core idea is to construct set-valued targets using credal sets, adding complementary candidate labels when the model is sufficiently confident about the true class. This is implemented via a confidence-thresholded possibility distribution that retains full plausibility for the original training label while incorporating plausible alternatives. RDA is realized as a simple off-the-shelf loss function that dynamically derives target sets from model predictions without requiring additional parameters.

## Method Summary
Robust Data Ambiguation (RDA) mitigates label noise by constructing set-valued targets using credal sets based on model confidence. The method adds complementary candidate labels to the original training label when model predictions exceed a threshold β, creating possibility distributions that capture label ambiguity. This is implemented as a loss function that compares model predictions against these ambiguous targets using optimistic superset loss, without requiring additional model parameters or training procedure modifications.

## Key Results
- Accuracies of up to 91.71% on CIFAR-10N and 70.23% on WebVision
- Consistent improvements over baseline robust loss functions across multiple datasets
- Effectively detects and corrects erroneous training labels while avoiding overfitting to noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Robust Data Ambiguation (RDA) prevents overfitting to noisy labels by introducing set-valued targets that retain plausibility for both the original label and highly confident predictions.
- Mechanism: RDA uses a confidence-thresholded possibility distribution to add complementary candidate labels when model predictions exceed a threshold β. This creates credal sets where the original training label retains full plausibility while plausible alternatives are included. The optimistic superset loss then compares model predictions against these ambiguous targets, allowing the model to avoid committing to incorrect labels while still learning from clean data.
- Core assumption: Model predictions in early training phases contain useful information about the true labels, even when training labels are corrupted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The core idea is to construct set-valued targets using credal sets, adding complementary candidate labels when the model is sufficiently confident about the true class."
  - [section 3.3]: "Starting from a credal set Q centered at py1 (left plot), the prediction bp predicts a probability mass greater than β for y2. Consequently, full possibility is assigned to y2, leading to Q as shown to the right."
- Break condition: If β is set too high, no additional labels are added and the method degenerates to standard loss functions. If β is too low, excessive ambiguity may slow learning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RDA effectively distinguishes between clean and noisy training instances by leveraging the memorization dynamics of deep learning.
- Mechanism: During early training phases, models learn to correctly classify most instances including the ground-truth of mislabeled instances. RDA captures this behavior by using model confidence to identify when the predicted class (different from the training label) is likely the true class. This allows the method to correct label noise implicitly without explicit label correction mechanisms.
- Core assumption: Deep neural networks exhibit two distinct learning phases - initial correct concept learning followed by memorization of noisy labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This is completely in line with data imprecisiation in the context of so-called superset learning [Lienen and Hüllermeier, 2021a]."
  - [section 3.1]: "Looking closer at the learning dynamics in an idealized setting, one can observe that overparameterized models project instances of the same ground-truth class y* to a similar feature embedding, regardless of having observed a correct or corrupted training label in the first training phase."
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks the clean-dirty separation property or if noise is uniformly distributed across all instances.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RDA combines the simplicity of robust loss functions with the expressiveness of label correction methods without requiring additional model parameters.
- Mechanism: RDA operates entirely within the loss function by dynamically constructing target sets from model predictions during training. This avoids the complexity of separate label correction models while maintaining the robustness benefits of imprecise target modeling.
- Core assumption: The model's own predictions during training can serve as a reliable source for identifying plausible alternative labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This way, we combine the simplicity of robust losses with the data modeling capabilities of more complex label correction approaches."
  - [section 3.3]: "Our robust loss formulation RDA captivates with no adjustment to the training procedure – all computations can be encapsulated in the loss formulation itself with only accessing the model output to derive the possibility distributions."
- Break condition: If model predictions are unreliable in early training phases, the confidence threshold mechanism may select incorrect alternative labels.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Superset learning and credal sets
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for representing ambiguous target information as sets of probability distributions rather than single labels.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a degenerate probability distribution and a credal set?

- Concept: Possibility theory and possibility measures
  - Why needed here: Offers the mathematical framework for constructing the confidence-thresholded possibility distributions used in RDA.
  - Quick check question: How does a possibility distribution differ from a probability distribution?

- Concept: Kullback-Leibler divergence and its properties
  - Why needed here: The optimistic superset loss using KL divergence provides the optimization objective for training with credal set targets.
  - Quick check question: Why is the KL divergence appropriate for comparing probability distributions in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Receives training instances (xi, yi)
  - Model prediction: Outputs probability distribution bp(xi)
  - Possibility distribution construction: Creates πi based on confidence threshold β
  - Credal set derivation: Generates Qπi from πi
  - Loss calculation: Computes L*(Qπi, bp(xi)) using optimistic superset loss
  - Output: Scalar loss value for backpropagation

- Critical path: Model prediction → Possibility distribution → Credal set → Loss calculation → Backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - β parameter: Higher values make the method more conservative but may miss corrections; lower values increase corrections but risk introducing errors
  - α parameter: Controls label relaxation but setting it too high may undermine the method's effectiveness
  - Computational overhead: Additional operations for constructing possibility distributions and credal sets

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on clean datasets: β may be too low, causing unnecessary ambiguity
  - Minimal improvement over baseline: β may be too high, preventing effective corrections
  - Training instability: α parameter may be poorly tuned or β schedule may be inappropriate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test RDA on CIFAR-10 with 25% symmetric noise using default β schedule to establish baseline performance
  2. Vary β parameter (e.g., β=0.5, 0.75, 0.9) to observe sensitivity and find optimal value
  3. Compare RDA with and without label relaxation (α=0.05 vs α=0) to assess impact of the relaxation parameter

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does RDA perform in extreme noise regimes (e.g., 90%+ label noise) compared to other robust methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows RDA becomes less effective with higher noise levels, but does not test extreme cases.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests up to 75% noise on CIFAR-10/-100, leaving a gap in understanding performance at higher noise levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing RDA on datasets with 90%+ noise and comparing accuracy/behavior to other methods like ELR and SOP.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the β parameter be learned dynamically during training rather than using a fixed schedule?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses cosine decaying for β and mentions this as a future direction for "more informed determination of β."
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores fixed schedules for β and does not investigate adaptive learning methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating adaptive β learning mechanisms that adjust based on model uncertainty or loss patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does RDA compare to ensemble-based methods for label noise robustness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions ensemble methods as a potential source for label correction but does not compare to them.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on single-model approaches and does not benchmark against ensemble-based noise-robust methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of RDA with ensemble methods like SELFIE or co-teaching on the same benchmark datasets.

## Limitations

- Method depends on the memorization dynamics of deep learning, which may not hold uniformly across all datasets and noise types
- Performance critically depends on careful tuning of the confidence threshold β parameter
- Assumes model predictions in early training phases contain useful information about true labels, which may not hold for extremely noisy datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental results showing consistent improvements over baseline methods across multiple datasets and noise types. The theoretical framework using credal sets and possibility theory is well-established.

**Medium Confidence**: The claims about mechanism 2 (distinguishing clean from noisy instances via memorization dynamics) and mechanism 3 (combining simplicity with expressiveness). While the experimental results support these claims, the theoretical justification could be more rigorous.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the method to datasets with different characteristics than those tested, particularly for instance-dependent label noise patterns not covered in the evaluation.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on β schedule**: Systematically vary the β initialization, decay rate, and minimum value to determine sensitivity and identify optimal configurations across different noise levels and dataset types.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate RDA on additional datasets with different characteristics (e.g., medical imaging, satellite data, or tabular data) to assess performance beyond standard image classification benchmarks.

3. **Instance-dependent noise validation**: Test the method on datasets with instance-dependent label noise patterns (rather than the symmetric/asymmetric noise used in the paper) to verify effectiveness against more realistic noise scenarios.
