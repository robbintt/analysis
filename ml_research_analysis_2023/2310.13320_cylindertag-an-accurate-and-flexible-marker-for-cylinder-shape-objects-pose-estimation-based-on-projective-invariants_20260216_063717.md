# CylinderTag: An Accurate and Flexible Marker for Cylinder-Shape Objects Pose Estimation Based on Projective Invariants

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13320
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13320
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 0.69 mm translation and 0.46° rotation pose estimation accuracy on cylindrical objects

## Executive Summary
CylinderTag introduces a novel visual marker system specifically designed for cylindrical and other developable surfaces. By leveraging cross-ratio projective invariants along the zero-curvature direction of cylinders, the system maintains encoding stability across various viewing angles and surface curvatures. The marker features a cyclic strip design with a sliding window encoding scheme that enables omnidirectional reading and exponentially large dictionary sizes. Experimental results demonstrate superior detection rates, reduced localization jitter, and higher pose estimation accuracy compared to traditional markers like AprilTag and ArUco.

## Method Summary
CylinderTag utilizes the geometric property that cylindrical surfaces have zero curvature along their axis, allowing cross-ratios to remain invariant under perspective projection. The marker consists of multiple feature subregions arranged in a cyclic pattern, with each feature defined by four corner points whose cross-ratio encodes information. A heuristic search-based generator creates markers by sliding a window of k consecutive features to ensure unique identification. The real-time recognizer employs adaptive thresholding, connected component labeling, and an Extended Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm for fast quad fitting. Cross-ratio values are extracted from detected features and matched against a precomputed dictionary to decode the marker ID and estimate pose.

## Key Results
- Average pose estimation errors: 0.69 mm (translation) and 0.46° (rotation)
- Superior detection rates across various viewing angles compared to AprilTag and ArUco
- Reduced localization jitter with standard deviation of 0.34 mm
- Supports real-time detection with extensive dictionary size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CylinderTag's cross-ratio encoding remains stable under curved surface projection.
- Mechanism: On a developable cylindrical surface, the direction along the cylinder axis has zero curvature, so any strip parallel to this axis can be treated as a plane. Cross-ratio is a projective invariant for collinear points, so the four corner points defining each feature subregion maintain constant cross-ratio values regardless of viewing angle or surface curvature.
- Core assumption: The cylindrical surface is developable and the marker is attached without significant distortion in the zero-curvature direction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Leveraging the manifold assumption, the cross-ratio in projective invariance is utilized for encoding in the direction of zero curvature on the surface."
  - [section]: "The property of zero curvature in a given direction is satisfied. That is, a straight line in the direction of zero curvature can be kept straight. Therefore, some projective invariants associated with lines can be considered to participate in the design of the marker."
- Break condition: Severe surface deformation in the zero-curvature direction or marker attachment that distorts the feature subregion geometry.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The cyclic feature field design allows CylinderTag to be read from any starting point and in either direction.
- Mechanism: Each marker consists of multiple feature subregions arranged in a cycle. The encoding uses a sliding window of k consecutive features to generate a unique marker ID. This means that no matter where the camera first sees the marker or which direction it's facing, the decoder can reconstruct the full ID from any contiguous sequence of features.
- Core assumption: The feature field length is sufficient to ensure unique identification of each marker regardless of starting position.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CylinderTag is a cyclic marker that can be firmly attached to objects with a cylindrical shape."
  - [section]: "CylinderTag introduces 'feature fields' that promise that k consecutive encodings of feature subregions can only decode a unique marker ID, thus exponentially increasing the size of the marker dictionary."
- Break condition: Feature field length too short to guarantee unique identification across the entire marker dictionary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The extended Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm provides accurate and fast quad fitting for the cyclic strip design.
- Mechanism: The ERDP algorithm processes connected component boundaries by iteratively identifying the longest straight segments that approximate the border within a tolerance. This is particularly suited to CylinderTag's quadrilateral features, allowing accurate corner localization even when the marker is viewed at an angle or when there is partial occlusion.
- Core assumption: The connected components representing features are approximately quadrilateral in shape.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a high-performance recognizer as well."
  - [section]: "To enhance the performance of the marker recognizer, we propose a fast quad-fitting mechanism called Extended Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (ERDP) algorithm."
- Break condition: Features become too distorted or fragmented to be approximated by four straight segments within the tolerance threshold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Projective invariants and cross-ratio
  - Why needed here: CylinderTag relies on cross-ratio being invariant under perspective projection to maintain encoding consistency on curved surfaces.
  - Quick check question: What mathematical property makes cross-ratio useful for visual marker encoding on curved surfaces?

- Concept: Manifold assumption and developable surfaces
  - Why needed here: The marker design assumes cylindrical surfaces are locally planar in the zero-curvature direction, which is essential for the cross-ratio approach to work.
  - Quick check question: What is a developable surface, and why does zero curvature in one direction matter for CylinderTag?

- Concept: Connected component labeling and contour processing
  - Why needed here: The marker recognizer needs to identify and extract the quadrilateral features from the binary image, which requires efficient connected component analysis and boundary extraction.
  - Quick check question: How does connected component labeling help in isolating individual marker features from the background?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image -> Adaptive thresholding -> Connected component labeling -> ERDP quad fitting -> Feature recovery -> Marker organization -> Cross-ratio extraction -> ID decoding -> Pose estimation
- Critical path: Image acquisition -> Feature detection (CCL + ERDP) -> ID decoding -> Pose recovery. Delays in any of these stages directly impact real-time performance.
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Cross-ratio encoding provides geometric robustness but requires precise corner localization
  - Cyclic design enables omnidirectional reading but increases computational complexity
  - Extended RDP provides fast quad fitting but may fail on highly distorted features
- Failure signatures: 
  - False positives: Non-marker regions incorrectly identified as features
  - False negatives: Marker features missed due to poor contrast or extreme viewing angles
  - Decoding errors: Incorrect cross-ratio calculation due to corner localization errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify cross-ratio invariance by imaging a printed CylinderTag at various angles and confirming consistent ID decoding.
  2. Test ERDP quad fitting accuracy by comparing detected corners against ground truth on a known CylinderTag image.
  3. Measure detection rate across a range of viewing angles and distances to identify performance limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CylinderTag's performance compare to deep learning-based marker systems like DeepFormableTag on highly deformable surfaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that deep learning-based markers are still limited to square shapes and do not account for the nature of the deformed surface. However, it does not provide a direct comparison between CylinderTag and deep learning-based markers on highly deformable surfaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between CylinderTag and deep learning-based markers on highly deformable surfaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study between CylinderTag and deep learning-based markers like DeepFormableTag on highly deformable surfaces, evaluating detection rate, localization accuracy, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CylinderTag be extended to handle non-developable surfaces like spheres or tori?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that CylinderTag can be extended to various other surface types, including domed surfaces, conical surfaces, and some profiled surfaces. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of its performance on non-developable surfaces like spheres or tori.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of CylinderTag's performance on non-developable surfaces like spheres or tori.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating CylinderTag's performance on non-developable surfaces like spheres or tori, comparing its detection rate, localization accuracy, and computational efficiency to other marker systems designed for such surfaces.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CylinderTag's performance degrade under extreme lighting conditions, such as very bright or very dark environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly discuss CylinderTag's performance under extreme lighting conditions. However, it mentions that the recognizer uses an adaptive thresholding method, which suggests that it may be robust to some variations in lighting.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of CylinderTag's performance under extreme lighting conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating CylinderTag's performance under extreme lighting conditions, comparing its detection rate, localization accuracy, and computational efficiency to other marker systems under the same conditions.

## Limitations
- Cross-ratio invariance claim is medium confidence due to potential real-world surface deformation issues
- ERDP quad fitting performance not thoroughly tested on severe occlusions or low-contrast environments
- Practical dictionary size versus computational cost during real-time decoding not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Cross-ratio invariance on curved surfaces: Medium
- Cyclic marker design enabling omnidirectional detection: High
- Real-time performance with accurate pose estimation: Medium
- Dictionary size scalability: High

## Next Checks
1. **Surface deformation stress test**: Apply CylinderTag to progressively deformed cylindrical objects (from ideal cylinders to irregular curved surfaces) and measure the degradation in detection rate and ID accuracy. This would validate the robustness of the zero-curvature assumption.

2. **Extreme viewing condition evaluation**: Test CylinderTag at very low viewing angles (near-grazing incidence), extreme distances causing pixelation, and under variable lighting conditions to identify the practical limits of the ERDP quad fitting and cross-ratio extraction.

3. **Dictionary collision analysis**: Systematically generate and test the full marker dictionary (or a statistically significant sample) to verify that no two markers share identical k-length feature sequences, ensuring the claimed exponential scalability is actually achieved in practice.
