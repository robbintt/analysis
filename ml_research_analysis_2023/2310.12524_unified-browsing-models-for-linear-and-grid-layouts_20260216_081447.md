# Unified Browsing Models for Linear and Grid Layouts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12524
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12524
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: A unified probabilistic framework for user browsing behavior that generalizes linear and grid-based ranking layouts through configurable parameters.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified probabilistic model for user browsing behavior that addresses both linear and grid-based ranking layouts. The authors identify that existing user browsing models share similar underlying concepts but differ in components and parameter settings. They propose a generalized framework that unifies these models by decomposing them into configurable parameters such as selection probability, abandonment probability, and row-skipping probability. The model is extended to handle grid layouts by incorporating layout-specific behaviors like slower decay and middle-bias, providing a flexible framework for researchers to configure browsing models based on their specific needs.

## Method Summary
The method presents a state transition model that captures user actions (examine, select, abandon, continue) in ranked lists. The core mechanism uses a unified formula to compute examination probabilities, which can be configured to implement various browsing models by adjusting selection probability functions (constant for geometric, relevance-dependent for cascade) and abandonment probability. For grid layouts, the model adds row-skipping probability and slower-decay parameters to account for different browsing patterns. The framework is designed to be extensible to more complex ranking scenarios while maintaining mathematical consistency across different layout types.

## Key Results
- The unified framework can replicate both geometric and cascade browsing models through parameter configuration
- Grid layout extension successfully incorporates slower decay and row-skipping behaviors
- The model provides a foundation for configuring and extending browsing models to handle various ranking scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: User attention decays exponentially with ranking position in both linear and grid layouts.
- Mechanism: The model represents user attention as a probabilistic function that decreases multiplicatively with each successive position, capturing the diminishing likelihood of user engagement.
- Core assumption: Users browse from top to bottom and are more likely to examine items at higher positions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "User attention decays with ranking positions."
  - [section] "For a given linear ranking 𝐿, the generalized model for predicting the probability of user examining the item 𝑑 at a particular position 𝑖 when user attention decays exponentially is: 𝑃[𝐸𝑖 ] = (1 − 𝛼)𝑖 −1 Y 𝑗 ∈[1,𝑖−1) (1 − 𝜓 (𝑗))"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citation of exponential decay studies in corpus.
- Break condition: When user behavior deviates from top-to-bottom browsing, such as when middle-bias or F-shaped patterns dominate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grid layouts exhibit slower decay and row-skipping behaviors compared to linear layouts.
- Mechanism: The model introduces additional parameters (𝛽 for slower decay and 𝛾 for row-skipping) that modify the attention decay function specifically for grid layouts.
- Core assumption: Users interact with grid layouts differently than linear lists, showing distinct browsing patterns like central fixation and slower attention decay.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Xie et al. [23] observed several user browsing behavior tendencies through eye-tracking study; (1) slower-decay where user attention decays at a slower rate in grid layout than in linear layout, (2) row-skipping where users skip row and moves to the next row, and (3) middle-bias where users put more attention to items at the middle positions."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus does not directly cite the Xie et al. studies but mentions related grid layout research.
- Break condition: When grid layout patterns do not follow the assumed slower decay and row-skipping behaviors, such as when users follow strict left-to-right patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The unified model can be parameterized to represent both geometric and cascade browsing models.
- Mechanism: By configuring selection probability (with or without relevance dependence) and abandon probability parameters, the model can replicate existing browsing models or create new ones.
- Core assumption: Different browsing models share common underlying concepts that can be decomposed into configurable components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We can see that the geometric and cascade browsing models are capturing the same fundamental ideas, with the difference that the cascade model incorporates item relevance into selection probabilities."
  - [section] "Our generalized browsing model can be configured to implement various browsing models in the following ways: To use geometric browsing model, the relevance component of selection probability function and the abandon probability will be ignored (setting the value as 𝛼 = 0)."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions fairness in grid layouts but not the unification of browsing models.
- Break condition: When browsing behaviors require fundamentally different structural assumptions that cannot be captured by adjusting the existing parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probabilistic modeling of user behavior
  - Why needed here: The paper builds a unified framework by decomposing browsing behaviors into probabilistic components that can be configured.
  - Quick check question: How does the geometric model differ from the cascade model in terms of selection probability formulation?

- Concept: Position-based attention decay
  - Why needed here: Understanding how user attention decreases with ranking position is fundamental to the model's core mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What mathematical form does the exponential decay take in the unified model?

- Concept: Grid layout specific behaviors
  - Why needed here: The extension to grid layouts requires understanding how user behavior differs from linear layouts, including slower decay and row-skipping.
  - Quick check question: How does the row-skipping probability parameter modify the basic linear layout model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Core probability engine: Selection probability (𝜓), abandon probability (𝛼), row-skipping probability (𝛾)
  - Layout-specific modifiers: Decay parameter (𝛽) for slower decay in grids
  - Relevance integration: Optional relevance-dependent selection probability
  - Position tracking: Row and column position for grid layouts

- Critical path:
  1. Input: Ranking layout (linear or grid) and item relevance information
  2. Parameter configuration: Set 𝜓, 𝛼, 𝛾, and 𝛽 based on layout and desired model behavior
  3. Probability calculation: Compute examination probabilities for each position using the unified formula
  4. Output: Probability distribution of user attention across all positions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. expressiveness: More parameters allow better fitting to real data but increase complexity
  - Relevance dependence vs. independence: Including relevance makes the model more accurate but requires more data
  - Grid vs. linear focus: The unified model handles both but may be optimized for one use case

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor fit to eye-tracking data suggests incorrect parameter values
  - Violation of top-to-bottom assumption indicates need for alternative browsing patterns
  - Inability to capture grid-specific behaviors suggests missing parameters

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the basic geometric model (𝜓 constant, 𝛼 = 0) and validate against known metrics like RBP
  2. Add abandon probability to create the extended cascade model and compare with ERR metric
  3. Extend to grid layout with slower decay (𝛽 > 1) and validate against grid-specific eye-tracking studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal parameter values for different ranking layouts and user behaviors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that user studies are needed to estimate optimal parameter values for realistic evaluation beyond ranked lists.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a unified framework but acknowledges that parameter values need to be determined through empirical user studies across various ranking layouts and scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies across multiple ranking layouts (linear, grid, multi-list) with different content types, measuring actual user attention patterns and selection behaviors to calibrate the model parameters (selection probability, abandonment probability, row-skipping probability, decay parameters).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does user behavior differ between wrapped grid layouts and multi-list grid layouts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "Users' browsing behavior in multi-list grid-layout is still under-studied and the categories or genres can have affect on users browsing behavior."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that current models for wrapped grid layouts may not be applicable to multi-list grid layouts where items are categorized by genres.
- What evidence would resolve it: Eye-tracking and interaction studies comparing user behavior across wrapped grid layouts versus multi-list grid layouts, measuring differences in row-skipping patterns, attention decay rates, and the influence of categorical boundaries.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should the model be extended to account for multi-select behavior where users select an item but return to browse further?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest this as a future research direction, noting that "users may select an item and return to the result page" and current models assume the process ends after selection.
- Why unresolved: The unified framework assumes a single selection ends the browsing process, but real-world user behavior often involves multiple selections with return visits to the results page.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies tracking multi-selection patterns, including time spent between selections, return frequencies, and the probability of continuing to browse after a selection, to calibrate an additional probability parameter for continuation after selection.

## Limitations

- Lack of empirical validation for optimal parameter values across different ranking layouts
- Model assumes standard top-to-bottom browsing patterns and may not capture complex behaviors
- Extension to grid layouts lacks validation against real eye-tracking data for specific parameter values

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical unification of geometric and cascade models through configurable parameters
- **Medium Confidence**: The extension to grid layouts incorporating slower decay and row-skipping behaviors
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the model's ability to capture F-shaped browsing patterns and middle-bias in grid layouts

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with eye-tracking to empirically estimate the selection probability (𝜓), abandonment probability (𝛼), and row-skipping probability (𝛾) parameters across different layout types and verify the assumed exponential decay patterns.

2. Validate the grid layout extension by comparing model predictions against real user interaction data from wrapped and multi-list grid layouts, specifically testing the slower-decay parameter (𝛽) and middle-bias effects.

3. Implement the unified model to replicate existing metrics (RBP, ERR) and demonstrate that the configurable framework can reproduce results from established browsing models while maintaining computational efficiency.
