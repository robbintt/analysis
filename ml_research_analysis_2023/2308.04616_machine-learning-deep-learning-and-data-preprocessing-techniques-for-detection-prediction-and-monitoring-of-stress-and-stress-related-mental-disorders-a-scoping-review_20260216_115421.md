# Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Preprocessing Techniques for Detection, Prediction, and Monitoring of Stress and Stress-related Mental Disorders: A Scoping Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04616
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SVM, NN, and RF models showed highest accuracy using physiological signals (HR, HRV, skin response) as key predictors.

## Executive Summary
This scoping review systematically analyzed 98 studies on machine learning methodologies for detecting, predicting, and monitoring stress and stress-related mental disorders. The findings reveal that physiological signals—especially heart rate variability, heart rate, and skin response—are the most prevalent and effective predictors. Among machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Random Forests demonstrated the highest accuracy and robustness. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and ICA were critical preprocessing steps before model training.

## Method Summary
The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included 98 studies from PubMed and Scopus databases, focusing on ML methodologies for stress detection and monitoring. Data sources included physiological signals (ECG, PPG, HRV, EEG, EMG), behavioral measures, and questionnaire data. Common ML algorithms analyzed included SVM, NN, RF, LR, KNN, NB, and boosting methods, with preprocessing techniques such as PCA, ICA, and feature selection. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, AUROC, F1-score, precision, recall, and MSE.

## Key Results
- SVM, NN, and RF models demonstrated highest accuracy and robustness in stress detection
- Physiological parameters (HR, HRV, skin response) were most prevalent predictors due to explanatory value and ease of acquisition
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, ICA, feature selection) were critical preprocessing steps before model training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Physiological signals like heart rate and HRV are strong predictors of stress because they reflect autonomic nervous system changes in real time.
- Mechanism: Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, which increases heart rate and alters HRV. These measurable changes in physiological signals allow ML models to detect stress events as they happen.
- Core assumption: The physiological response to stress is consistent enough across individuals to be captured by generalized ML models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Physiological parameters—particularly heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and skin response—were the most prevalent predictors due to their explanatory value and ease of acquisition."
  - [section] "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) contains time and frequency domain features that can indicate mental health problems including stress and its related MDs."
- Break condition: If individual variability in autonomic responses is too high or if stress manifests without detectable physiological changes, model accuracy will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, ICA, feature selection) improve model performance by filtering noise and focusing on the most informative features.
- Mechanism: High-dimensional physiological data often contains redundant or noisy signals. Dimensionality reduction extracts the core variance relevant to stress detection, improving signal-to-noise ratio and reducing overfitting.
- Core assumption: The most relevant stress indicators are captured in a lower-dimensional subspace of the full feature set.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, ICA, feature selection) were critical preprocessing steps before model training."
  - [section] "PCA is a method for lowering the dimensionality of such datasets while maximizing interpretability and minimizing loss of information."
- Break condition: If key stress indicators are distributed across many weakly correlated features, aggressive dimensionality reduction may discard useful information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ensemble and tree-based models (Random Forest, SVM) outperform other ML algorithms in stress detection due to their ability to handle nonlinear relationships and feature interactions.
- Mechanism: Stress responses are complex and nonlinear. Ensemble methods combine multiple weak learners to capture these patterns, while SVMs with appropriate kernels can separate stress vs. non-stress classes in high-dimensional space.
- Core assumption: The stress detection problem has enough structure and regularity for ensemble methods to learn generalizable patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Random Forests (RF) demonstrated the highest accuracy and robustness."
  - [section] "Among classic ML algorithms (excluding DL approaches), supervised models of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forest (RF), have been used more often and achieved better performance in terms of model accuracy and robustness."
- Break condition: If the dataset is too small or noisy, ensemble methods may overfit; if relationships are truly linear, simpler models may perform equally well.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
  - Why needed here: HRV is one of the most important physiological markers for stress detection and is used across nearly all reviewed studies.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main domains (time and frequency) in which HRV features are typically extracted?

- Concept: Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: Raw physiological data is high-dimensional and noisy; reducing dimensions improves model accuracy and efficiency.
  - Quick check question: Name two common preprocessing techniques used to reduce dimensionality before ML model training.

- Concept: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
  - Why needed here: Most stress detection models are supervised (trained on labeled data), but some unsupervised methods (like clustering) are used for preprocessing or labeling.
  - Quick check question: In what scenario would you use unsupervised learning in the context of stress detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data acquisition (wearable sensors) -> Preprocessing (filtering, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction) -> Model training (SVM/RF/NN) -> Validation (cross-validation, AUROC) -> Deployment (real-time or offline)
- Critical path: The most critical path is ensuring high-quality labeled physiological data and effective preprocessing, as errors here propagate to model performance.
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time detection requires lightweight models and fast preprocessing, while offline analysis can use more complex models and deeper feature engineering.
- Failure signatures: Low AUROC or precision-recall imbalance suggests poor feature selection or class imbalance; high variance across folds indicates overfitting.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare SVM vs. Random Forest performance on the same HRV feature set.
  2. Test different dimensionality reduction methods (PCA vs. ICA) on model accuracy.
  3. Evaluate the impact of class imbalance correction techniques (SMOTE) on minority class detection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do physiological signals (HRV, HR, skin response) perform in real-world settings compared to controlled laboratory environments for stress detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review highlights that most studies use lab settings with controlled stimuli, while real-time and naturalistic studies remain limited.
- Why unresolved: Lab conditions reduce environmental variability, potentially overestimating model performance. Real-world deployment requires models to handle diverse contexts and unknown disturbances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating stress detection models in both controlled and naturalistic environments, with performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) across settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relative effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for stress detection compared to traditional machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review notes that DL approaches like RNNs and CNNs have potential to capture time-series relationships in physiological data but are underutilized, with most studies still relying on SVM and RF.
- Why unresolved: While traditional models perform well, DL methods may better capture temporal dynamics and complex patterns in stress-related physiological signals, but evidence is limited.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparative studies using identical datasets and preprocessing, evaluating DL models (RNNs, CNNs) against SVM and RF on stress detection accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can personalization be effectively integrated into stress detection models without significantly increasing computational complexity or requiring extensive per-user training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review identifies personalization as a key gap, noting that most studies do not use model baselines adjusted for individual users, limiting generalizability.
- Why unresolved: Physiological responses vary across individuals, but methods like training separate models per user are computationally expensive, and simple baseline adjustments may not suffice for non-resting conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of scalable personalization techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholds, transfer learning, multi-task learning) that maintain or improve detection accuracy across diverse populations.

## Limitations
- Limited research on real-time stress detection in naturalistic environments
- Most studies focus on short-term acute stress rather than chronic stress patterns
- High heterogeneity in stress definitions and measurement protocols across studies

## Confidence
- Physiological signals as predictors: High
- Comparative performance of ML algorithms: Medium
- Real-time detection claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic evaluation of model performance across different stress contexts (acute vs. chronic, lab vs. real-world) using standardized datasets and evaluation protocols.
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of physiological features (HRV, heart rate, skin response) versus questionnaire data to model accuracy.
3. Test the reproducibility of top-performing ML models (SVM, RF) on held-out datasets from multiple studies to assess generalizability across different populations and stress measurement protocols.
