# A Quantitative Approach to Understand Self-Supervised Models as Cross-lingual Feature Extractors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.15954
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15954
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Proposed PSR metric correlates with ASR performance and contrastive loss improves cross-lingual transfer

## Executive Summary
This work examines the cross-lingual transfer performance of English self-supervised learning (SSL) models by using automatic speech recognition (ASR) as a downstream task. The authors propose a new metric called Phonetic-Syntax Ratio (PSR) that uses deep generalized canonical correlation analysis to quantify phonetic and syntactic information in the representations extracted by SSL models. Experimental results show that the contrastive loss in the wav2vec2.0 objective facilitates more effective cross-lingual feature extraction compared to masked reconstruction or prediction objectives. There is a positive correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance, indicating that phonetic information extracted by monolingual SSL models can be used for downstream tasks in cross-lingual settings. The proposed PSR metric is an effective indicator of the quality of the representations and can be useful for model selection.

## Method Summary
The paper investigates cross-lingual transfer of English SSL models by extracting features from multilingual speech data and evaluating them on ASR tasks. The authors propose the Phonetic-Syntax Ratio (PSR) metric to quantify phonetic vs. syntactic information in representations using deep generalized canonical correlation analysis (DGCCA). They compare five SSL models (HuBERT, wav2vec2.0, NPC, TERA, VQ-APC) across five target languages (German, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese). Features are extracted using frozen SSL models and fed into a Conformer encoder + Transformer decoder ASR model. PSR scores are computed by comparing SSL features with Mel Spectrum and BERT representations, and correlated with ASR performance.

## Key Results
- wav2vec2.0 with contrastive loss outperforms HuBERT with predictive loss for cross-lingual ASR across multiple language pairs
- PSR scores positively correlate with ASR performance, validating the metric as a quality indicator
- Larger SSL models generally improve ASR performance but may learn more source-language syntax that hinders transfer
- The layer-wise weight analysis reveals that lower layers contain more phonetic information across target languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive loss in wav2vec2.0 facilitates more effective cross-lingual feature extraction compared to masked reconstruction or prediction objectives.
- Mechanism: The contrastive objective explicitly learns to distinguish between true and corrupted speech segments, creating representations that capture phonetic content more robustly across languages.
- Core assumption: Phonetic information is more transferable across languages than syntactic information, and the model can learn to isolate phonetic features during pre-training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show the contrastive loss in the wav2vec2.0 objective facilitates more effective cross-lingual feature extraction."
  - [section]: "HuBERT as a cross-lingual feature extractor does not perform as well due to its predictive loss compared to the contrastive loss of wav2vec2.0."
- Break condition: If phonetic content is not actually more transferable than syntactic content, or if the contrastive objective overfits to English phonetic patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Higher Phonetic-Syntax Ratio (PSR) scores correlate with better ASR performance in cross-lingual settings.
- Mechanism: The PSR metric quantifies the ratio of phonetic to syntactic information in extracted representations, and representations with more phonetic content are more useful for cross-lingual ASR tasks.
- Core assumption: Phonetic information is more useful than syntactic information for cross-lingual ASR, and the PSR metric accurately captures this composition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "There is a positive correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance, suggesting that phonetic information extracted by monolingual SSL models can be used for downstream tasks in cross-lingual settings."
  - [section]: "Combined with the information in Table 3, we show that there is a positive correlation between the PSR scores of the feature group and the ASR performance of the model in that language."
- Break condition: If syntactic information becomes more important for ASR in certain language pairs, or if the PSR metric does not accurately reflect the composition of the representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger model size generally improves cross-lingual ASR performance, but may also learn more syntactic information that is less useful for cross-lingual transfer.
- Mechanism: Scaling SSL models results in improvements in both L1 loss and accuracy on downstream tasks, but larger models may also learn more language-specific syntactic patterns during pre-training.
- Core assumption: Model scaling follows a power law relationship with performance, and larger models can learn more complex representations but may overfit to source language syntax.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Larger models are also more data-efficient when labeled data is scarce. The advantage of the LARGE model over the BASE model is especially apparent on the wav2vec2.0 pair, as wav2vec2.0-LARGE consistently performs better across all languages."
  - [section]: "The more efficient use of data in HuBERT-LARGE may have caused it to learn even more syntactic and semantic representation, which does not benefit cross-lingual speech feature extraction."
- Break condition: If model scaling does not follow a power law, or if larger models do not learn more syntactic information that hinders cross-lingual transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech representations
  - Why needed here: SSL models are used as feature extractors for cross-lingual ASR tasks, and understanding their training objectives and architectures is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between contrastive, masked reconstruction, and predictive objectives in SSL models?

- Concept: Cross-lingual transfer learning
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates the cross-lingual generalizability of English SSL models, and understanding the factors that facilitate or hinder transfer is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How does linguistic distance between source and target languages affect cross-lingual transfer performance?

- Concept: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and deep generalized CCA (DGCCA)
  - Why needed here: DGCCA is used to quantify the phonetic and syntactic content in the extracted speech representations, and understanding its mechanism is crucial for interpreting the PSR metric.
  - Quick check question: How does DGCCA measure the nonlinear relationship between different views of the data, and how is it applied to compare SSL features with phonetic and syntactic representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - SSL models (HuBERT, wav2vec2.0, NPC, TERA, VQ-APC) -> ASR model (Conformer encoder + Transformer decoder) -> Language model (stacked RNN)

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train SSL models on English speech data
  2. Extract features from target language speech data using SSL models
  3. Train ASR model on extracted features for each target language
  4. Compute PSR scores using DGCCA for each SSL-target language pair
  5. Analyze correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. cross-lingual transfer: Larger models may perform better on ASR but also learn more source language syntax that hinders transfer.
  - Training objective: Contrastive objectives may be more effective for cross-lingual transfer than masked reconstruction or predictive objectives.
  - Feature extraction vs. fine-tuning: Freezing SSL model parameters during ASR training focuses on feature extraction quality, while fine-tuning may improve adaptation to target languages.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor ASR performance despite high PSR scores: Indicates that phonetic information alone is not sufficient for ASR, and syntactic information may be necessary for certain language pairs.
  - High ASR performance despite low PSR scores: Suggests that the PSR metric may not accurately capture the composition of useful information in the representations.
  - Inconsistent results across language pairs: Implies that the factors facilitating cross-lingual transfer may vary depending on the linguistic distance and similarity between source and target languages.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare ASR performance of wav2vec2.0 vs. HuBERT on a language pair with high linguistic distance to English (e.g., Russian) to isolate the effect of training objective on cross-lingual transfer.
  2. Analyze the layer-wise weights of HuBERT on a language pair with low linguistic distance to English (e.g., German) to identify the layers containing the most phonetic information and their contribution to ASR performance.
  3. Compute PSR scores for a diverse set of SSL models and target languages to validate the positive correlation between PSR and ASR performance and identify the factors influencing the metric.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed Phonetic-Syntax Ratio (PSR) metric correlate with downstream ASR performance across all SSL models (not just HuBERT)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "PSR scores of HuBERT-BASE on English and the target languages are shown in Table 4" and shows a positive correlation between PSR and ASR performance for HuBERT, but acknowledges the limitation that "the value of our PSR was only tested on HuBERT due to limited computing resources."
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents PSR results for HuBERT, leaving the question of whether this metric generalizes to other SSL models unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Compute PSR scores for the other SSL models (wav2vec2.0, NPC, TERA, VQ-APC) and correlate them with their respective ASR performance on the multilingual tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would unfreezing some or all layers of the SSL feature extractor during ASR training affect the observed multilingual adaptability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions as a limitation that "the parameters in the SSL models are frozen during ASR training. Multilingual adaptability might be evaluated differently by unfreezing some or all layers of the SSL feature extractor."
- Why unresolved: The study uses frozen SSL models to isolate the effect of feature extraction, but this may not reflect the true potential of these models in practical applications where fine-tuning is common.
- What evidence would resolve it: Perform the same multilingual ASR experiments with various unfreezing strategies (e.g., unfreeze the last N layers, all layers) and compare the results to the frozen baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do spurious correlations among language pairs, such as phonotactic similarities between Chinese and English, influence cross-lingual transfer in speech models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes as a future direction that "exploring spurious correlations among language pairs (e.g. phonotactical similarities between Chinese and English) is a fruitful direction that might shed light on language selection during cross-lingual transfer in speech models." This suggests that such correlations exist and may play a role, but their specific impact is not investigated.
- Why unresolved: While the paper touches on linguistic distance and phylogenetic relationships, it does not delve into more subtle correlations that could influence model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyze the ASR performance of SSL models on language pairs with known phonotactic similarities (e.g., English and Chinese) and compare it to pairs with less similarity, controlling for other factors like resource availability.

## Limitations

- The study relies on automatic speech recognition as the sole downstream task for evaluating cross-lingual transfer, which may not fully capture the generalizability of SSL representations across different task types.
- The analysis focuses on a specific set of target languages (German, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese) that may not represent the full diversity of linguistic structures globally.
- The PSR metric's effectiveness depends on the quality of the external phonetic and syntactic representations used for comparison, but the paper does not thoroughly validate these reference representations or discuss potential mismatches in representation spaces.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that wav2vec2.0 with contrastive loss outperforms HuBERT with predictive loss for cross-lingual ASR is well-supported by consistent experimental results across multiple language pairs. The correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance is also robustly demonstrated with statistical significance.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which larger model sizes improve cross-lingual transfer while potentially learning more source-language-specific syntactic information is plausible but requires more detailed analysis of the learned representations to confirm. The interpretation of PSR scores as primarily reflecting phonetic vs. syntactic information content is reasonable but could be more rigorously validated.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that phonetic information is universally more transferable than syntactic information across all language pairs is an overgeneralization not fully supported by the current experimental scope, which focuses on specific Indo-European languages.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments with non-Indo-European languages (e.g., Japanese, Arabic, Swahili) to test whether the phonetic-transfer advantage holds across greater typological distances.

2. Implement ablation studies that systematically vary the amount of target language data during ASR training to determine whether PSR scores predict performance differently under varying data regimes.

3. Develop additional downstream tasks beyond ASR (e.g., speech translation, emotion recognition) to assess whether PSR scores generalize as predictors of cross-lingual transfer quality across task types.
