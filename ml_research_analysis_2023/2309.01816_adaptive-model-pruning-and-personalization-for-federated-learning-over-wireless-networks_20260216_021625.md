# Adaptive Model Pruning and Personalization for Federated Learning over Wireless Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.01816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01816
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Proposed FL framework reduces computation and communication latency by approximately 50% while increasing learning accuracy for non-IID data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an efficient federated learning framework that addresses communication and computation challenges in wireless networks through partial model pruning and personalization. The approach splits the learning model into a globally shared pruned component and a device-specific personalized component, reducing both transmission overhead and local computation requirements. By jointly optimizing pruning ratios and wireless resource allocation, the framework achieves faster convergence rates while maintaining learning accuracy, particularly for scenarios with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across devices.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework implements partial model personalization by splitting the model into global and personalized parts, with pruning applied to the global component before transmission. A LocalAlt update scheme alternates between updating the personalized part (with larger iteration count τv) and the global part (with smaller iteration count τu and ˆτu). Model pruning is performed using an importance score based on weight differences between local and global models, with a pruning mask applied to remove less significant weights. The framework optimizes both pruning ratios and wireless resource allocation (bandwidth and power) using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to maximize convergence rates under latency constraints, balancing model accuracy with communication efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 50% reduction in computation and communication latency compared to standard federated learning with partial personalization
- Improves learning accuracy for devices with non-IID data distributions
- Demonstrates effectiveness on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets with 10 devices in a simulated wireless network environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Splitting the model into global and personalized parts enables adaptation to data heterogeneity while reducing communication overhead.
- Mechanism: The global part, shared across devices, learns common data representations, while the personalized part is fine-tuned for each device's specific data distribution. Only the global part is transmitted between server and devices, reducing communication load.
- Core assumption: Data heterogeneity exists across devices and affects learning accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework splits the learning model into a global part with model pruning shared with all devices to learn data representations and a personalized part to be fine-tuned for a specific device"
  - [section] "This framework splits the learning model into a global part with model pruning shared with all devices to learn data representations and a personalized part to be fine-tuned for a specific device"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains related works on federated pruning and personalization, but none directly confirm the specific mechanism of splitting models for heterogeneous data adaptation.
- Break condition: If data distributions across devices become too dissimilar, the shared global part may not capture useful representations, leading to poor personalization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model pruning reduces both computation and communication latency while maintaining learning accuracy.
- Mechanism: Pruning removes less important weights based on calculated importance scores, reducing the number of weights that need to be updated and transmitted. The pruning ratio is dynamically adjusted based on latency constraints and channel conditions.
- Core assumption: Model pruning can significantly reduce model size without severely impacting learning accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework splits the learning model into a global part with model pruning shared with all devices to learn data representations and a personalized part to be fine-tuned for a specific device, which adapts the model size during FL to reduce both computation and communication latency"
  - [section] "In order to solve these problems, the strategy of model pruning is employed to reduce the size of the learning model"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - several papers in the corpus discuss federated pruning, but none provide direct experimental validation of the specific pruning mechanism described in this paper.
- Break condition: Excessive pruning leads to significant loss of model accuracy and poor convergence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint optimization of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation maximizes convergence rate under latency constraints.
- Mechanism: The optimization problem jointly determines the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation for each device to minimize the upper bound of gradient norms while satisfying latency thresholds. This balances the trade-off between model accuracy and communication efficiency.
- Core assumption: The convergence rate can be expressed as a function of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To maximize the convergence rate and guarantee learning accuracy, Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions are deployed to jointly optimize the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation"
  - [section] "Based on the convergence analysis, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the convergence rate under a latency threshold by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while the corpus contains papers on resource allocation in federated learning, none specifically address the joint optimization of pruning and wireless resources using KKT conditions.
- Break condition: If the optimization problem becomes too complex or the latency constraints are too tight, the solution may become infeasible or suboptimal.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Edge server with multiple antennas -> Multiple mobile devices with single antennas -> Global model with pruning and personalization capabilities -> Optimization module for pruning ratio and resource allocation -> Communication interface for model transmission

- Critical path:
  1. Edge server broadcasts global model to devices
  2. Devices update personalized and global parts
  3. Devices prune global part based on calculated importance
  4. Devices transmit pruned global part back to server
  5. Server aggregates received models and updates global model
  6. Optimization module adjusts pruning ratio and resource allocation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model accuracy vs. communication efficiency (pruning ratio)
  - Convergence speed vs. resource utilization (optimization parameters)
  - Privacy preservation vs. learning performance (amount of personalization)

- Failure signatures:
  - High communication latency despite pruning (insufficient pruning or poor resource allocation)
  - Poor learning accuracy (excessive pruning or inadequate personalization)
  - Slow convergence (suboptimal pruning ratio or resource allocation)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the basic federated learning framework without pruning or personalization to establish a baseline.
  2. Add model pruning to the global part and measure the impact on communication latency and learning accuracy.
  3. Introduce personalization and evaluate its effect on learning accuracy across devices with different data distributions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but raises several implicit considerations about scalability and practical deployment challenges.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation on complex datasets beyond MNIST and Fashion-MNIST
- Theoretical assumptions about smoothness constants may not hold in practice
- Optimization framework may face computational challenges in dynamic wireless environments

## Next Checks
1. Validate the pruning mechanism on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) to assess scalability and performance trade-offs
2. Implement the framework in a real-world wireless testbed to evaluate performance under practical channel conditions and mobility scenarios
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of pruning, personalization, and wireless optimization to the overall performance improvement
