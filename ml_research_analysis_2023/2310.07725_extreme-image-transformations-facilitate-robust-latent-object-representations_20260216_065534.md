# Extreme Image Transformations Facilitate Robust Latent Object Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07725
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Extreme Image Transformations (EIT) during training significantly improve adversarial robustness of deep networks by encouraging focus on object features rather than background context.

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates that Extreme Image Transformations (EIT) applied during training can significantly improve the adversarial robustness of deep networks. By breaking spatial correlations in the input, EIT encourages the network to focus on the core features of an object rather than background context or spurious correlations. When ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 are finetuned on Caltech256 using EIT, they exhibit higher activation in the object regions and lower activation in the background, even under strong Gaussian noise corruption. The finetuned networks show test accuracies of over 70% on noisy data, compared to less than 1% for the original ImageNet models. These results indicate that EIT effectively promotes robust latent object representations, improving generalization to diverse adversarial attacks.

## Method Summary
The method involves finetuning ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 models on the Caltech256 dataset using Extreme Image Transformations (EIT). EIT applies seven different block-wise shuffling transforms to the training images to break spatial correlations between object and background features. The models are trained with SGD (lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9) using either full finetuning or feature extraction approaches. Performance is evaluated on a test set corrupted with Gaussian noise at severity levels 1, 3, and 5. The key hyperparameter is the probability of applying EIT transforms during training.

## Key Results
- ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 finetuned with EIT achieved over 70% accuracy on Caltech256 test set under Gaussian noise, compared to less than 1% for original ImageNet models
- EIT-trained networks showed higher activation in object regions and lower activation in background regions compared to baseline models
- EIT training improved robustness to Gaussian noise corruption while maintaining performance on clean images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Extreme Image Transformations (EIT) break spatial correlations between object and background, forcing networks to focus on object features rather than context.
- Mechanism: By shuffling blocks or segments of the input image, EIT disrupts the natural co-occurrence of object and background features, compelling the network to learn object representations that are invariant to background changes.
- Core assumption: The network can learn to recognize objects based on their intrinsic features rather than relying on background context or spurious correlations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By breaking spatial correlations in the input, EIT encourages the network to focus on the core features of an object rather than background context or spurious correlations."
  - [section]: "To this end, Extreme Image Transformations (EIT) [12, 43] help by selecting variably sized blocks or segments and moving them around, thus breaking the spatial correlations between the foreground and background."
- Break condition: If the object is too small relative to the block size, shuffling may destroy object integrity and prevent recognition.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: EIT induces feature selection by forcing the network to extract the minimal set of features necessary for object recognition.
- Mechanism: EIT's block-wise shuffling mimics the human ability to focus on essential object features by presenting the network with incomplete or fragmented object views, encouraging it to learn robust representations based on the most discriminative features.
- Core assumption: Networks can adapt to learn from incomplete or fragmented object views and still extract the essential features for recognition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our work is motivated by the fact that such minimal features can be used to learn the right latent representation of the presented object given the natural reduction of non-useful information like background and other parts that might be common in multiple objects."
  - [section]: "Our work is motivated by the idea of uncovering "objectness" in the visual input being fed to machines to facilitate learning a robust set of features for object recognition."
- Break condition: If the network overfits to the specific shuffling patterns, it may not generalize to natural images.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EIT training improves robustness to adversarial attacks by promoting invariant representations.
- Mechanism: By training on transformed images, the network learns to recognize objects under various spatial arrangements, making it less susceptible to attacks that exploit spatial biases or background context.
- Core assumption: Robustness to adversarial attacks can be improved by training on data that breaks common spatial biases and spurious correlations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "When ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 are finetuned on Caltech256 using EIT, they exhibit higher activation in the object regions and lower activation in the background, even under strong Gaussian noise corruption."
  - [section]: "Our EIT trained networks show strong activations in the object regions even when tested with more intense noise, showing promising generalizations across different kinds of adversarial attacks."
- Break condition: If the adversarial attack is specifically designed to exploit the shuffling patterns, EIT may not provide protection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatial correlation and its role in object recognition
  - Why needed here: Understanding how spatial relationships between object and background features influence network performance is crucial for grasping how EIT works.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between learning object features based on spatial context versus learning them based on intrinsic properties?

- Concept: Feature selection and its importance in machine learning
  - Why needed here: EIT aims to improve feature selection by forcing the network to focus on the most relevant features for object recognition, discarding redundant or irrelevant information.
  - Quick check question: How does feature selection improve model performance and robustness?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and their impact on deep learning models
  - Why needed here: EIT is proposed as a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks, so understanding the nature of these attacks and their vulnerabilities is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are some common types of adversarial attacks, and how do they exploit weaknesses in deep learning models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image transformation module -> Neural network (ResNet50/EfficientNetB0) -> Training pipeline with Caltech256 dataset
- Critical path: Apply EIT to training images → Feed to network → Compute loss → Update weights → Repeat for each epoch
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between the intensity of EIT and the network's ability to learn object features. Too much shuffling may destroy object integrity, while too little may not effectively break spatial correlations.
- Failure signatures: Failure to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, high activation in background regions instead of object regions, and poor generalization to natural images.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply EIT with different block sizes and shuffling probabilities to Caltech256 images and observe the effect on network performance.
  2. Compare the saliency maps of networks trained with and without EIT on noisy images to assess the focus on object regions.
  3. Evaluate the robustness of EIT-trained networks against different types of adversarial attacks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the parameters of EIT be learned and adjusted for different inputs using meta-learning?
- How do Extreme Image Transformations (EIT) affect the robustness of recurrent neural networks to adversarial attacks?
- How does validating with one type of image corruption (e.g., Gaussian noise) generalize to other types of corruptions and their intensities?

## Limitations

- Lack of implementation details for the seven EIT transforms makes exact reproduction difficult
- Results only tested against Gaussian noise corruption, not other common adversarial attack types
- Claims about improved "objectness" based on qualitative saliency maps rather than quantitative metrics
- Study focuses on single dataset (Caltech256) and two model architectures, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that EIT improves robustness to Gaussian noise corruption is supported by specific accuracy metrics (over 70% vs. under 1%) on the Caltech256 test set.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that EIT encourages networks to focus on object regions rather than background is supported by saliency map visualizations, but lacks quantitative metrics for comparison.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that EIT effectively breaks spatial correlations and promotes invariant representations is based on theoretical motivation rather than direct empirical evidence linking the mechanism to the observed robustness gains.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the seven EIT transforms (Full Random Shuffle, Grid Shuffle, Within Grid Shuffle, Local Structure Shuffle, Color Flatten, Segmentation Displacement Shuffle, Segmentation Within Shuffle) and verify their effect on spatial correlations in sample images.
2. Evaluate EIT-trained networks against multiple adversarial attack types (e.g., FGSM, PGD, DeepFool) to assess robustness beyond Gaussian noise corruption.
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the contribution of each EIT transform to the overall robustness improvement and to identify the minimal set of transforms needed for effective performance.
