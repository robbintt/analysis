# Ontology in Hybrid Intelligence: a concise literature review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.17262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17262
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Ontologies play significant role in over 70% of hybrid intelligence systems, primarily in knowledge representation and automated reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a concise literature review examining how ontologies are adopted in hybrid intelligence systems. The review identifies key conceptual contributions including interoperability, explainability, system engineering, and quality/accuracy improvements. Application analysis shows ontologies play a significant role in over 70% of studied systems, primarily enabling knowledge representation and automated reasoning. The paper highlights major research gaps, particularly the lack of holistic discussion on next-generation hybrid-intelligent environments and insufficient focus on automatic reasoning capabilities. While ontologies are widely adopted, their full potential in hybrid intelligence systems remains underexplored.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review using specific search criteria ("Hybrid Intelligence" OR "Hybrid Intelligent") AND ("Ontology" OR "Semantic Web") across scientific databases. The author screens 56 selected papers against three selection criteria: explicit focus on Hybrid Intelligence, explicit addressing of Ontology role, and relevance of Ontology role to the work. Papers are categorized by conceptual vs. application focus and domain, with qualitative assessment of ontology contributions to interoperability, explainability, system engineering, and quality/accuracy.

## Key Results
- Ontologies play significant role in over 70% of hybrid intelligence systems studied
- Primary applications are knowledge representation and automated reasoning
- Major research gaps exist in next-generation hybrid-intelligent environments and automatic reasoning focus
- Ontologies contribute to quality/accuracy and enable interoperability, explainability, and system engineering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Ontologies serve as semantic bridge that reduces gap between human and artificial intelligence in hybrid systems
- Provide shared, machine-processable conceptualization of knowledge that both humans and AI systems can understand and use for reasoning
- Core assumption: Ontological models can be designed to match human conceptual understanding while remaining machine-interpretable
- Evidence: 70% adoption rate in hybrid systems for knowledge representation and reasoning

### Mechanism 2
- Ontologies enhance system quality and accuracy by providing formal, consistent knowledge representation
- Formal ontological models reduce ambiguity and inconsistency in knowledge bases
- Core assumption: Consistent formal representations directly translate to improved reasoning quality
- Evidence: Significant contribution to quality and accuracy identified in literature review

### Mechanism 3
- Ontologies enable automatic reasoning and inference in hybrid systems
- Provide formal structure needed for automated inference engines to derive new knowledge
- Core assumption: Automated reasoning requires formal semantic structures to operate effectively
- Evidence: Current implementations underutilize automated reasoning capabilities

## Foundational Learning

- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: Fundamental to understanding ontologies as machine-processable knowledge structures. Quick check: What is the difference between a taxonomy and an ontology in terms of reasoning capabilities?

- Semantic Web Technologies: Provides technological foundation for ontologies in hybrid systems. Quick check: How do RDF and OWL differ in their approach to representing ontological knowledge?

- Hybrid Intelligence Systems: Understanding the balance between human and artificial intelligence is central to evaluating ontology's role. Quick check: What distinguishes hybrid intelligence from pure artificial intelligence or collective intelligence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Hybrid Intelligence System = (Human Interface) + (AI Reasoning Engine) + (Ontology Knowledge Base) + (Data Integration Layer)
- Critical path: Ontology → Knowledge Representation → Automated Reasoning → Decision Support → Human Interface
- Design tradeoffs: Rich, expressive ontologies vs. computational efficiency; comprehensive coverage vs. maintainability
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent reasoning results, poor human-AI communication, inability to integrate new knowledge
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple domain ontology for a specific application and measure reasoning accuracy
  2. Compare human-AI collaboration with and without shared ontological framework
  3. Test ontology-based interoperability between two heterogeneous AI systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the key methodological approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of ontologies in reducing the gap between human and artificial intelligence within hybrid intelligent systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper highlights the lack of a holistic discussion on the establishment of next-generation hybrid-intelligent environments with balanced co-existence of human and artificial intelligence
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methodologies or criteria for assessing effectiveness of ontologies in bridging human-AI gap
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or frameworks demonstrating impact of ontologies on improving human-AI interaction and co-existence

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can ontologies be effectively integrated into the design and development process of hybrid intelligent systems to enhance explainability and transparency?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies role of ontologies in enabling explainable and transparent models
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions potential for explainability but lacks detailed guidelines or case studies on integration into system design
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or design patterns showcasing successful integration of ontologies to enhance explainability

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific challenges and limitations of using ontologies for automatic reasoning and inference in hybrid intelligent systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes relatively low explicit focus on automatic reasoning and inference
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the gap but doesn't delve into specific challenges or limitations of applying ontologies for reasoning
- What evidence would resolve it: Research identifying and addressing technical and conceptual challenges of using ontologies for reasoning in hybrid systems

## Limitations
- 56-paper corpus may miss emerging approaches, particularly those emphasizing automatic reasoning
- Qualitative assessment approach introduces potential subjectivity in evaluating ontology relevance
- Analysis focuses heavily on current implementations rather than future potential

## Confidence
- Ontologies' role in knowledge representation and interoperability: Medium
- Claims about quality improvements and automated reasoning benefits: Low (rely more on theoretical arguments than empirical evidence)
- Systematic literature review methodology providing reasonable coverage: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Expand corpus search to include recent preprints and conference proceedings focusing on automated reasoning with ontologies in hybrid systems
2. Conduct empirical validation measuring reasoning accuracy and system quality improvements when ontologies are integrated into specific hybrid intelligence applications
3. Interview practitioners to identify real-world challenges in ontology adoption beyond what's captured in published literature
