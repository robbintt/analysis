# Does Your Model Think Like an Engineer? Explainable AI for Bearing Fault Detection with Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12967
- Reference count: 0
- The paper proposes a feature attribution framework that aligns deep learning model reasoning with domain expert reasoning for bearing fault detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explaining deep learning models for bearing fault detection in industrial applications, where the lack of model transparency hinders real-world deployment. The authors propose a novel feature attribution framework that leverages domain-specific knowledge and signal processing techniques to evaluate how well a model's reasoning aligns with expert reasoning. The framework translates model attributions into the envelope spectrum domain, which is most informative for domain experts analyzing bearing faults. The authors demonstrate the utility of their framework by evaluating different deep learning models on real vibration data from the Paderborn University dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a domain-specific feature attribution framework that translates model attributions into the envelope spectrum domain for bearing fault detection. The method involves preprocessing vibration signals, training deep learning models (CNN, FCN, LSTM) on raw signals, computing feature attributions using backpropagation-based methods like Integrated Gradients and GradSHAP, and evaluating alignment with domain knowledge using proposed metrics IAS (Informative Attribution Share) and ISNR (Informative Signal-to-Noise Ratio). The framework is evaluated on the Paderborn University bearing fault dataset, comparing different models' performance on both training and generalization datasets.

## Key Results
- The proposed IAS and ISNR metrics effectively quantify the alignment between model attributions and expert reasoning in the envelope spectrum domain
- Models with higher domain knowledge alignment on detectable faults show better generalization to unseen operating conditions
- The CNN model outperforms FCN and LSTM in terms of domain knowledge alignment and generalization ability, making it a more trustworthy choice for deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Translating model attributions into the envelope spectrum domain aligns the model's reasoning with domain expert reasoning.
- Mechanism: The paper defines domain mappings that convert raw vibration signals to interpretable envelope spectra using the Hilbert transform and Fourier analysis. By applying feature attribution methods to this interpretable domain, the model's reasoning becomes comparable to classical envelope analysis used by engineers.
- Core assumption: The envelope spectrum is the most informative feature space for domain experts analyzing bearing faults, and model attributions in this space can be meaningfully interpreted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel and domain-specific feature attribution framework that allows us to evaluate how well the underlying logic of a model corresponds with expert reasoning."
  - [section 3] "To retrieve attributions based on the representation z and residual r one can simply consider the original model f and adjust its input domain post-hoc."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains related papers on bearing fault diagnosis but lacks direct discussion of envelope spectrum domain translation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models that align with domain knowledge on detectable faults generalize better to unseen operating conditions.
- Mechanism: The paper introduces metrics IAS (Informative Attribution Share) and ISNR (Informative Signal-to-Noise Ratio) to quantify how well a model's attributions focus on the BPFO frequency and its harmonics. Higher alignment on detectable faults correlates with better generalization performance.
- Core assumption: Models that reason similarly to domain experts on known fault patterns will also perform well on new, unseen fault patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "To quantify the alignment we propose two metrics... IAS(x) = ∥ϕIm (x)∥1/∥ϕ(x)∥1"
  - [section 5.2] "Models that are more in line with expert reasoning on detectable faults also generalize better when switching from artificial conditions to authentic faults."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus lacks papers discussing generalization performance correlation with domain knowledge alignment.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Backpropagation-based feature attribution methods are well-defined and applicable after domain mapping.
- Mechanism: The paper shows that the domain mapping adds a linear layer at the beginning of the model without bias. Since the original model is differentiable, the adjusted model remains differentiable, allowing backpropagation-based methods like Integrated Gradients and GradSHAP to be directly applied.
- Core assumption: The domain mapping is a linear transformation, and the model's differentiability is preserved after this transformation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "In particular, if the considered model f is a neural network this can be thought of as adding an extra linear layer without bias at the beginning."
  - [section 5.2] "To retrieve the underlying informative feature attributions with respect to the envelope spectrum we utilize in total four different methods... Integrated Gradients (IntGrad) and GradSHAP as backpropagation-based methods."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus does not provide direct support for the applicability of backpropagation-based methods after domain mapping.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal processing techniques for vibration analysis
  - Why needed here: Understanding envelope analysis and the Hilbert transform is crucial for interpreting the domain-specific feature attributions and their alignment with expert reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of using the envelope spectrum in bearing fault detection, and how does it differ from analyzing raw vibration signals?

- Concept: Explainable AI and feature attribution methods
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with different feature attribution techniques (perturbation-based and backpropagation-based) is necessary to understand how the proposed framework evaluates model reasoning and trust.
  - Quick check question: How do perturbation-based methods like LIME differ from backpropagation-based methods like Integrated Gradients in terms of their approach to computing feature importance?

- Concept: Deep learning architectures for time-series analysis
  - Why needed here: Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different neural network architectures (CNN, FCN, LSTM) is essential for interpreting the model evaluation results and their generalization performance.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Convolutional Neural Networks, Fully-Connected Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Networks when applied to vibration signal analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Domain mapping module -> Feature attribution module -> Alignment metrics module -> Model evaluation module

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess vibration signals and apply domain mapping to obtain envelope spectra
  2. Train deep learning models on raw vibration signals
  3. Compute feature attributions for model predictions using backpropagation-based methods
  4. Calculate IAS and ISNR metrics to evaluate alignment with domain knowledge
  5. Compare models based on their alignment and generalization performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity vs. interpretability: Domain mapping and feature attribution computation can be computationally expensive, but they provide valuable insights into model reasoning.
  - Choice of informative features: The selection of BPFO frequency and its harmonics as informative features may not capture all relevant information for fault detection, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the alignment metrics.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low IAS and negative ISNR values indicate that the model is not reasoning in line with domain expert knowledge, which may lead to poor generalization performance.
  - If the domain mapping is incorrectly defined, the feature attributions may not be meaningful, leading to unreliable alignment metrics and model evaluations.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the domain mapping module and verify that it correctly converts raw vibration signals to envelope spectra using the Hilbert transform and Fourier analysis.
  2. Train a simple deep learning model (e.g., CNN) on raw vibration signals and compute feature attributions using Integrated Gradients to ensure the backpropagation-based method works as expected.
  3. Calculate the IAS and ISNR metrics for the trained model on a subset of the Paderborn dataset and analyze the alignment with domain knowledge to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well does the proposed framework generalize to other domains beyond bearing fault detection?
- What is the impact of different signal processing techniques on the feature attribution results?
- How does the framework perform when applied to more complex fault patterns or multi-fault scenarios?
- What is the optimal balance between model complexity and interpretability in the context of bearing fault detection?

## Limitations
- The exact implementation details of the domain mapping between time domain and envelope spectrum are not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility.
- The correlation between domain knowledge alignment and generalization performance, while observed in this study, requires validation across different datasets and fault types to ensure generalizability.
- The applicability of backpropagation-based feature attribution methods after domain mapping is assumed but not explicitly validated in the paper.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mechanism of translating model attributions to the envelope spectrum domain is well-founded, as it leverages established signal processing techniques and interpretable feature spaces.
- Medium confidence: The correlation between domain knowledge alignment and generalization performance is supported by the experimental results but requires further validation on diverse datasets.
- Low confidence: The applicability of backpropagation-based feature attribution methods after domain mapping is assumed but not explicitly validated in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the domain mapping implementation using the Hilbert transform and Fourier analysis to ensure accurate conversion of raw vibration signals to envelope spectra.
2. Conduct experiments on multiple bearing fault datasets to validate the consistency of the correlation between domain knowledge alignment and generalization performance across different fault types and operating conditions.
3. Perform ablation studies to assess the impact of different feature attribution methods and domain mapping configurations on the IAS and ISNR metrics, and their ability to capture relevant information for fault detection.
