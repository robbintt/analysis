# A Survey for Biomedical Text Summarization: From Pre-trained to Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.08763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08763
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of PLM-based biomedical text summarization methods, datasets, and evaluations

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic review of recent advances in biomedical text summarization using pre-trained language models. The paper categorizes existing approaches into feature-based, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation strategies, examining their performance across various biomedical domains including literature, electronic health records, medical conversations, and questions. It identifies PubMedBERT-based methods as particularly effective for biomedical literature summarization, with encoder-decoder models like BART and PEGASUS excelling at abstractive tasks. The survey also highlights critical challenges including handling long documents, incorporating domain knowledge, and ensuring factual consistency in generated summaries.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes biomedical text summarization approaches that leverage pre-trained language models, covering three main methodological categories: feature-based methods that use PLMs as feature extractors, fine-tuning approaches that adapt PLMs to summarization tasks, and domain adaptation strategies that combine domain-specific pre-training with task-specific fine-tuning. The methods are evaluated across multiple biomedical domains using various datasets including PubMed abstracts, MIMIC-CXR for radiology reports, and medical conversation corpora. Evaluation metrics span traditional ROUGE scores, BERTScore for semantic similarity, and domain-specific measures for factual consistency and PICO element extraction.

## Key Results
- PLMs significantly outperform traditional methods in biomedical text summarization, with domain-specific models showing superior performance
- Encoder-decoder models like BART and PEGASUS are widely used for abstractive summarization, while encoder-based models like BERT excel at extractive tasks
- PubMedBERT-based methods outperform general PLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, BioBERT) in biomedical literature summarization tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Fine-tuning domain-specific PLMs (BioBERT, PubMedBERT) on biomedical datasets significantly outperforms general-domain PLMs (BERT) in biomedical text summarization.
- **Mechanism**: Domain-specific PLMs are pre-trained on biomedical corpora, capturing specialized terminology, syntax, and semantic structures. Fine-tuning adapts these representations to the summarization task, leveraging both general and domain-specific knowledge.
- **Core assumption**: Biomedical corpora used for pre-training contain sufficient domain-specific linguistic patterns and terminology to enhance performance on downstream summarization tasks.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "PLMs significantly outperform traditional methods in biomedical text summarization, with fine-tuning and domain adaptation strategies showing superior performance."
  - [section]: "PubMedBERT-based methods outperform methods based on BERT, RoBERTa, and BioBERT." (Discussion, Comparison section)
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus data doesn't directly address pre-training corpora composition.
- **Break condition**: If biomedical corpora lack sufficient domain-specific content or if fine-tuning doesn't adequately leverage pre-trained knowledge.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Encoder-decoder PLMs (BART, T5, PEGASUS) excel in abstractive summarization tasks compared to encoder-only or decoder-only models.
- **Mechanism**: Encoder-decoder architecture allows joint modeling of input and output sequences, facilitating the generation of coherent, contextually relevant summaries. Pre-training objectives (e.g., denoising, gap-sentence generation) are tailored for summarization.
- **Core assumption**: The architectural design and pre-training objectives of encoder-decoder models are better suited for generating abstractive summaries than other model types.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Encoder-decoder models like BART and PEGASUS are widely used for abstractive summarization..."
  - [section]: "For biomedical literature, Deyoung et al [9] develop the BART-based method for multi-document summarization... Su et al [68] also propose the query-focused multi-document summarizer... that is able to generate abstractive and extractive summaries..." (Fine-tuning based Methods, Encoder-decoder language models section)
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus data doesn't provide direct evidence on model architecture performance differences.
- **Break condition**: If task-specific fine-tuning doesn't adequately leverage the encoder-decoder architecture's strengths.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Domain adaptation through continual pre-training on target biomedical corpora improves summarization performance over direct fine-tuning of general PLMs.
- **Mechanism**: Continual pre-training on biomedical data allows PLMs to adapt to domain-specific language patterns before task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in more effective knowledge transfer.
- **Core assumption**: Pre-training on task-relevant data before fine-tuning enhances the model's ability to capture domain-specific nuances.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "...with fine-tuning and domain adaptation strategies showing superior performance."
  - [section]: "For biomedical literature, Xie et al [58] propose the KeBioSum... It proposes to refine PLMs with the domain adaption tasks... They find that PubMedBERT-based methods outperform methods based on BERT, RoBERTa, and BioBERT." (Fine-tuning with domain-adaption-based methods, Bi-directional encoder language models section)
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus data doesn't directly address continual pre-training strategies.
- **Break condition**: If the additional pre-training step doesn't significantly improve performance or if computational costs outweigh benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and their architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder).
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding PLM architectures is crucial for selecting appropriate models for different summarization tasks (extractive vs. abstractive).
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key differences between BERT, GPT, and BART architectures, and how do these differences influence their suitability for extractive versus abstractive summarization?

- **Concept**: Fine-tuning and domain adaptation strategies for PLMs.
  - **Why needed here**: These strategies are essential for adapting general PLMs to specific biomedical summarization tasks and domains.
  - **Quick check question**: How do fine-tuning and domain adaptation differ, and what are the benefits of each approach for biomedical text summarization?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metrics for text summarization (ROUGE, BERTScore, factual consistency measures).
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding evaluation metrics is crucial for assessing the performance of summarization models and comparing different approaches.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the strengths and limitations of ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, and why is factual consistency an important consideration in biomedical text summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Datasets (PubMed, MIMIC-CXR, CORD-19, S2ORC, MS^2, HET-MC, MeQSum, CHQ-Summ) -> Methods (feature-based, fine-tuning, domain adaptation + fine-tuning) -> Evaluations (ROUGE, BERTScore, factual consistency, human evaluation)
- **Critical path**: Understanding the relationship between datasets, methods, and evaluations is critical. Different datasets require different methods, and evaluations should align with task goals (e.g., factual consistency for abstractive summarization).
- **Design tradeoffs**: Choosing between feature-based, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation + fine-tuning methods involves tradeoffs between computational cost, performance, and domain specificity. Similarly, selecting evaluation metrics involves balancing comprehensiveness and practicality.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance may indicate issues with dataset quality, inappropriate method selection, or inadequate evaluation. For example, using a general PLM without domain adaptation may lead to poor performance on biomedical texts.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate a baseline method (e.g., BERTSum) on a standard dataset (e.g., PubMed) to establish a performance benchmark.
  2. Fine-tune a domain-specific PLM (e.g., PubMedBERT) on the same dataset to assess the impact of domain adaptation.
  3. Compare different evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE vs. BERTScore) on the generated summaries to understand their strengths and limitations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can biomedical text summarization models be improved to better handle long documents without sacrificing factual accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that most PLMs are limited by input length and that truncating long biomedical texts results in loss of important information and long-range dependencies.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods like Longformer have shown limited improvement when applied to biomedical texts, indicating the need for more effective approaches tailored to this domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new models or techniques specifically designed to handle long biomedical documents while maintaining factual consistency, tested on benchmarks like PubMed-Long.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the most effective way to incorporate domain-specific knowledge (e.g., biomedical ontologies, taxonomies) into PLM-based biomedical text summarization models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that existing methods capture some domain knowledge but struggle with factual errors and lack integration of structured biomedical knowledge sources like UMLS.
- Why unresolved: Limited research has been done on effectively integrating external domain-specific knowledge into summarization models, particularly for complex biomedical texts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing improved performance and factual accuracy when using models that integrate domain-specific knowledge bases versus those that do not, validated across multiple biomedical summarization datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the factual consistency of generated summaries be effectively controlled and evaluated in biomedical text summarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes that factual correctness is critical in biomedical applications but existing abstractive methods often generate factually inconsistent summaries, and current evaluation metrics are inadequate.
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of effective automatic evaluation metrics for factual consistency, and few methods focus on controlling factual accuracy during generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new automatic evaluation metrics for factual consistency validated against human judgments, and demonstration of summarization models that explicitly optimize for factual accuracy while maintaining other quality metrics.

## Limitations

- Limited implementation details provided for domain adaptation strategies and specific hyperparameter settings
- Performance comparisons may not be directly reproducible due to variations in experimental conditions across cited studies
- Focus primarily on method categorization rather than providing detailed ablation studies or implementation specifications

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The fundamental assertion that PLMs outperform traditional methods in biomedical summarization is well-established in the literature and consistently supported across multiple studies.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about specific model performance rankings (e.g., PubMedBERT outperforming BERT, RoBERTa, and BioBERT) are based on aggregated comparisons across multiple studies with varying experimental conditions.

**Low Confidence:** Specific numerical performance metrics and relative rankings between methods may not be directly reproducible due to variations in implementation details, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation protocols across studies.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate a baseline method (e.g., BERTSum) on PubMed abstracts following the survey's methodological guidelines and compare results against reported performance ranges in the literature.

2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing PubMedBERT with BERT on biomedical summarization tasks while holding all other variables constant to isolate the impact of domain-specific pre-training.

3. Generate summaries using abstractive methods described in the survey and systematically evaluate factual consistency using multiple metrics (Factual F1 score, CheXbert) to validate the survey's emphasis on this challenge.
