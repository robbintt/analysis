# Textual-Knowledge-Guided Numerical Feature Discovery Method for Power Demand Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00095
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00095
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Discovers 43-48 features improving power demand forecasting by 16.84% to 36.36% MAPE

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for short-term power demand forecasting that leverages textual knowledge to discover numerical features. The approach addresses the challenge of limited known features and unavailable theoretical mechanisms by accumulating qualitative textual knowledge, expanding it into a candidate feature-type set, and building four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking databases. The method employs a two-level quantitative feature identification strategy to discover 43-48 features, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art feature schemes.

## Method Summary
The TKNFD method accumulates qualitative textual knowledge through web crawling of power system reports, expands this into a candidate feature-type set using a Dual-Correlated Words algorithm, and collects numerical data to build four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking databases. It then applies a two-level quantitative feature identification strategy combining SHAP analysis and LV-KB filtering to identify dominant features independent of forecasting models. The method is validated through benchmark experiments in two different regions, showing reliable performance improvements over existing feature schemes.

## Key Results
- Discovers 43-48 features for power demand forecasting
- Outperforms state-of-the-art feature schemes by 16.84% to 36.36% MAPE
- Identifies dominant features in energy and astronomical dimensions
- 4DM-STDs can serve as public baseline databases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Textual-knowledge-guided feature discovery significantly expands the candidate feature set beyond traditional empirical methods.
- Mechanism: The TKNFD method uses web crawling to gather qualitative textual reports on power consumption behaviors of different user groups, then employs a Dual-Correlated Words (DCW) algorithm to extract and weight features that affect power load fluctuation. This process identifies three main dimensions (geography, astronomy, integrated energy) and their associated features, which are then expanded into a four-dimensional candidate feature-type set including historical load data.
- Core assumption: Textual knowledge from official reports contains comprehensive and relevant information about power demand influencing factors that are not captured by existing feature schemes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TKNFD extensively accumulates qualitative textual knowledge, expands it into a candidate feature-type set"
  - [section] "By crawling the text reports of the power system official websites extensively on the power consumption behaviors of four target user groups...the first power demand feature corpus is constructed"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: Corpus contains only 8 related papers, which is relatively small to fully validate the comprehensiveness of textual knowledge

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking database (4DM-STD) enables comprehensive feature analysis independent of forecasting models.
- Mechanism: TKNFD collects numerical data for the expanded candidate feature-type set from various sources worldwide, constructing 4DM-STDs for different regions. These databases serve as numerical modality feature databases that are used for two-level quantitative feature identification strategy, which is independent of forecasting models.
- Core assumption: The numerical data collected for the candidate features accurately represents the real-world relationships between these features and power demand.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TKNFD presents a two-level quantitative feature identification strategy independent of forecasting models, finds 43-48 features"
  - [section] "Guided by the discovered candidate feature-type set, we then attempted to collect numerical data of these different features to build a four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking database (4DM-STD)"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about the quality or completeness of numerical data collection

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-level quantitative feature identification strategy effectively identifies dominant dimensions and features that significantly improve forecasting accuracy.
- Mechanism: TKNFD employs SHAP analysis to identify dominant dimensions and LV-KB (a combination of Variance Thresholding and Select-K-Best) for dominant feature identification on the 4DM-STDs. This strategy results in the discovery of 43-48 features that outperform state-of-the-art feature schemes by 16.84% to 36.36% MAPE.
- Core assumption: The combination of SHAP analysis and LV-KB effectively ranks features based on their contribution to forecasting accuracy without being biased by the choice of forecasting model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TKNFD presents a two-level quantitative feature identification strategy independent of forecasting models, finds 43-48 features"
  - [section] "LV-KB, a numerical feature filter algorithm, is chosen for dominant feature identification on 4DM-STD"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about the effectiveness of the specific two-level identification strategy

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Textual knowledge mining and feature extraction from unstructured data
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on extracting meaningful features from textual reports, which requires understanding of natural language processing techniques and the DCW algorithm
  - Quick check question: How does the DCW algorithm differentiate between words with high similarity but low independence in the context of power demand features?

- Concept: Multivariate data collection and database construction
  - Why needed here: Building the 4DM-STDs requires gathering numerical data from diverse sources for multiple dimensions, which involves data integration and quality assurance skills
  - Quick check question: What challenges might arise when collecting numerical data for astronomical and integrated energy dimensions from different global sources?

- Concept: Model-independent feature importance analysis
  - Why needed here: The paper uses SHAP analysis and LV-KB for feature identification, which requires understanding of model-agnostic methods for evaluating feature contributions
  - Quick check question: How does SHAP analysis provide a unified measure of feature importance across different forecasting models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Textual knowledge accumulation (web crawling + DCW) -> 4DM-STD construction -> Two-level feature identification (SHAP + LV-KB) -> Benchmark validation
- Critical path: Corpus collection → Feature extraction → Database building → Feature identification → Performance validation
- Design tradeoffs: Trades comprehensiveness of feature discovery against complexity and resource requirements of data collection and processing
- Failure signatures: Poor forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art schemes, inability to identify dominant features in integrated energy and astronomical dimensions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the DCW algorithm on a small sample of textual reports to verify its ability to extract relevant power demand features and distinguish between high-similarity, low-independence words
  2. Construct a mini 4DM-STD for a single region using a subset of candidate features to validate the data collection and integration process
  3. Apply the two-level feature identification strategy to the mini 4DM-STD to confirm that it can effectively rank features based on their contribution to forecasting accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the 4DM-STDs (four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking databases) be made more comprehensive by including additional features that are currently difficult to obtain numerical data for?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that while a large number of features were qualitatively identified in the candidate feature-type set, some features are not included in the 4DM-STDs due to the unavailability of numerical data. The authors acknowledge that the 4DM-STDs are not complete and could serve as public baseline feature databases for SPDF.
- Why unresolved: Obtaining numerical data for certain features, especially those related to astronomy and integrated energy dimensions, can be challenging due to their unavailability or inaccessibility. The paper does not provide a clear strategy for addressing this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic approach to acquiring or estimating numerical data for the missing features, along with an assessment of the impact of including these features on the forecasting accuracy, would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the TKNFD method be adapted to discover features for other sectors or domains beyond power demand forecasting, such as energy systems or epidemic forecasting, where the mechanism remains unclear and public feature databases are unavailable?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the proposed TKNFD is not limited to power demand forecasting and is applicable to feature discovery in other sectors where the mechanism remains unclear and public feature databases are unavailable.
- Why unresolved: While the authors claim the adaptability of TKNFD, they do not provide specific examples or guidelines for adapting the method to other domains. The effectiveness of TKNFD in different contexts remains to be demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of TKNFD to feature discovery in other domains, along with a comparison of the discovered features and their impact on forecasting accuracy, would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the dependency correlation analysis between features and power demand be further refined to identify more complex relationships, such as non-linear interactions or feedback loops?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper employs partial dependence graphs and beeswarm plots to explore the relationships between load fluctuation and dominant factors. However, the analysis focuses on simple linear relationships and does not consider more complex interactions or feedback loops.
- Why unresolved: The current analysis methods may not capture the full complexity of the relationships between features and power demand. More advanced techniques, such as machine learning models or network analysis, could be used to identify non-linear interactions or feedback loops.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of more advanced analysis techniques to the 4DM-STDs, along with an interpretation of the results in the context of power demand forecasting, would help resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of the textual knowledge corpus, with only 8 related papers identified
- The two-level feature identification strategy may not capture complex interactions between features that could be revealed through model-specific analysis
- The generalizability of the discovered features to other regions or time periods is uncertain due to dependence on specific characteristics of the data used for the 4DM-STDs

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The general framework of using textual knowledge to guide numerical feature discovery is well-established and the reported performance improvements (16.84%-36.36% MAPE reduction) are significant and consistent across different regions.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific implementation details of the DCW algorithm and the completeness of the 4DM-STD construction are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the discovered features to other regions or time periods is uncertain, as the method's performance depends heavily on the specific characteristics of the data used for the 4DM-STDs.

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Expansion Test:** Validate the feature discovery process using an expanded corpus of 50+ power demand-related papers to assess whether the current 8-paper corpus is sufficient for comprehensive feature discovery.

2. **Cross-Regional Validation:** Apply the TKNFD method to a third, independent region not used in the original study to test the generalizability of the discovered features and their performance impact.

3. **Feature Importance Robustness:** Conduct sensitivity analysis by systematically removing features identified as dominant in one dimension (e.g., astronomy) and measuring the impact on forecasting accuracy to validate their true contribution.
