# A spectrum of physics-informed Gaussian processes for regression in engineering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.10656
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10656
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Physics-informed GP models can significantly reduce data requirements and increase interpretability in engineering regression tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a spectrum of Gaussian process regression models that combine physics-derived and data-driven components to address predictive modeling challenges with limited data in engineering systems. The framework ranges from fully physics-derived models to hybrid approaches that blend physical insight with data-driven components. The authors demonstrate through several examples that incorporating physical knowledge can significantly reduce reliance on extensive data collection while increasing model interpretability, particularly valuable when training data are incomplete or noisy.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a spectrum of GP models that incorporate varying levels of physics-based reasoning into regression tasks. This includes models with fully physics-derived means and covariances, combined physics and data-driven components, and constrained data-driven covariance functions. The approach explicitly links domain knowledge with machine learning, allowing engineers to leverage their understanding of physical systems within the GP framework. The methodology involves selecting appropriate mean and covariance functions based on available physical insights, learning hyperparameters from training data, and making predictions that reflect both the data and underlying physics.

## Key Results
- Physics-informed GP models significantly reduce reliance on data collection while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy
- Incorporating physical insight increases model interpretability by linking predictions to known physical principles
- The spectrum approach provides flexibility to incorporate different levels of physical understanding, from complete laws to general constraints
- Examples demonstrated on vibrating structures, bridge deck displacement, and acoustic emission source localization show consistent improvements over black-box approaches

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gaussian Processes (GPs)
  - **Why needed here:** GPs provide a flexible and powerful framework for regression tasks, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge through the choice of mean and covariance functions.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a Gaussian Process, and how do they define the prior distribution over functions?

- **Concept:** Physics-derived covariance functions
  - **Why needed here:** Physics-derived covariance functions allow for the incorporation of known physical laws and principles into the GP regression framework, reducing reliance on data and increasing interpretability.
  - **Quick check question:** How can covariance functions be derived from physical laws, and what are some examples of physics-derived covariance functions?

- **Concept:** Constrained covariance functions
  - **Why needed here:** Constrained covariance functions allow for the incorporation of general physical constraints or laws into the GP regression framework, even when the complete physical understanding of the system is not available.
  - **Quick check question:** How can covariance functions be constrained to obey known physical laws or constraints, and what are some examples of constrained covariance functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Mean function -> Covariance function -> Hyperparameters -> Training data -> Prediction function

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define the mean and covariance functions based on available physical insights and data
  2. Learn the hyperparameters of the mean and covariance functions from training data
  3. Use the learned mean and covariance functions to make predictions on new data

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models may provide better predictions but are harder to interpret
  - Data-driven vs. physics-driven: Models that rely more on data may be more flexible but require more data, while models that rely more on physics may be more interpretable but require more physical insight

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overfitting: If the model is too complex or relies too much on the training data, it may not generalize well to new data
  - Underfitting: If the model is too simple or relies too much on the physics, it may not capture the full complexity of the system
  - Incorrect physics: If the physical insights incorporated into the model are incorrect, the predictions may be inaccurate

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a simple GP regression model with a physics-derived covariance function for a known physical system (e.g., a mass-spring-damper system)
  2. Implement a GP regression model with a combined physics-derived and data-driven covariance function for a system with partial physical understanding (e.g., a complex structure with some known modes of vibration)
  3. Implement a GP regression model with a constrained covariance function for a system with general physical constraints (e.g., a fluid flow with known boundary conditions)
