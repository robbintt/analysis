# On the Convergence of No-Regret Learning Dynamics in Time-Varying Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.11241
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11241
- Reference count: 40
- This paper establishes a framework for understanding the convergence of optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in time-varying games, particularly two-player zero-sum games.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a framework for analyzing the convergence of optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in time-varying games by connecting it to the concept of dynamic regret. The key insight is that OGD's convergence to Nash equilibria in time-varying zero-sum games is governed by variation measures of the game sequence, specifically the first-order variation of Nash equilibria and second-order variation of payoff matrices. The authors prove that if these variation measures grow sublinearly, then OGD's iterates (with high probability) approximate the sequence of Nash equilibria. The framework extends to general-sum multi-player games via a bilinear formulation of correlated equilibria, and provides insights on dynamic regret guarantees in static games.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes the convergence of optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in time-varying games by establishing a connection between OGD's performance and dynamic regret. The method involves computing variation measures (first-order variation of Nash equilibria and second-order variation of payoff matrices) to parameterize convergence bounds. For general-sum multi-player games, the approach uses a bilinear formulation of correlated equilibria, while strong convexity-concavity enables improved bounds when games are repeated multiple times. The framework requires that each game admits a minimax theorem and that variation measures grow sublinearly.

## Key Results
- Establishes sharp convergence bounds for OGD in time-varying zero-sum games parameterized on variation measures
- Extends results to general-sum multi-player games via bilinear formulation of correlated equilibria
- Proves improved second-order variation bounds under strong convexity-concavity when games are repeated

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: OGD convergence in time-varying games is governed by the first-order variation of Nash equilibria and second-order variation of payoff matrices.
- Mechanism: The dynamic regret framework connects OGD's performance to variation measures, with Property 3.2 ensuring nonnegativity when using Nash equilibria as comparators.
- Core assumption: The sequence of games admits a minimax theorem (Property A.3) and variation measures grow sublinearly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our framework yields sharp convergence bounds for the equilibrium gap of OGD in zero-sum games parameterized on the minimal first-order variation of the Nash equilibria and the second-order variation of the payoff matrices"
  - [section] "We derive a variation-dependent bound for the second-order path length of OGD in time-varying games"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on convergence to coarse correlated equilibria rather than the specific variation-based framework presented here
- Break condition: If the minimax theorem fails or variation measures grow linearly, the convergence guarantees break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Strong convexity-concavity enables improved convergence bounds under repeated game conditions.
- Mechanism: The sum of players' regrets becomes strongly nonnegative (Lemma A.15), allowing refined second-order variation bounds when each game is repeated multiple times.
- Core assumption: Each objective function is µ-strongly convex-concave and games are repeated for m ≥ 2/ηµ iterations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we establish improved second-order variation bounds under strong convexity-concavity, as long as each game is repeated multiple times"
  - [section] "Under strong convexity-concavity the sum of the players' regrets are strongly nonnegative (Lemma A.15)"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work on no-regret dynamics in general-sum Markov games suggests similar techniques could apply
- Break condition: If strong convexity-concavity is absent or games are not repeated sufficiently, the improved bounds do not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The bilinear formulation of correlated equilibria extends convergence results to general-sum multi-player games.
- Mechanism: By expressing correlated equilibria as a zero-sum game between players and a mediator, Property 3.11 ensures nonnegative dynamic regret, enabling application of Theorem 3.5.
- Core assumption: The correlated equilibrium formulation admits a sequence guaranteeing nonnegative dynamic regret.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results also apply to time-varying general-sum multi-player games via a bilinear formulation of correlated equilibria"
  - [section] "Crucially, we show that the structure of the induced bilinear problem (12) is such that there is a sequence of correlated equilibria that guarantee nonnegative dynamic regret"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - most related papers focus on convergence to coarse correlated equilibria rather than the specific bilinear formulation approach
- Break condition: If the bilinear formulation fails to capture the correlated equilibrium structure or nonnegative dynamic regret cannot be guaranteed, the extension breaks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dynamic regret and its relationship to Nash equilibrium convergence
  - Why needed here: Dynamic regret measures algorithm performance against changing comparators, which is essential for understanding convergence in time-varying games
  - Quick check question: How does dynamic regret differ from external regret in the context of time-varying games?

- Concept: Variation measures (first-order and second-order) for game sequences
  - Why needed here: These measures parameterize the convergence bounds and capture how much the games change over time
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between V(T)_NE and V(T)_A, and why are both needed?

- Concept: Optimistic gradient descent (OGD) update rule and its properties
  - Why needed here: OGD is the primary algorithm analyzed, and understanding its update rule is crucial for implementing the convergence framework
  - Quick check question: How does the OGD update rule incorporate the "optimistic" element compared to standard gradient descent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Game sequence → OGD updates → Dynamic regret calculation → Variation measure computation → Convergence bound evaluation
- Critical path: Game sequence → OGD updates → Dynamic regret calculation → Variation measure computation → Convergence bound evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using OGD vs. other no-regret algorithms (OGD provides last-iterate convergence but requires more computation), choosing between exact vs. approximate Nash equilibria as comparators (exact gives tighter bounds but may be harder to compute)
- Failure signatures: Linear growth in variation measures, violation of minimax theorem conditions, insufficient game repetitions under strong convexity-concavity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement OGD for a simple time-varying bilinear saddle-point problem and verify dynamic regret calculation
  2. Compute variation measures V(T)_NE and V(T)_A for a synthetic sequence of games
  3. Test convergence bounds by varying the rate of game changes and measuring equilibrium gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the O(logT) dynamic regret bound for static zero-sum games (Observation 3.14) be improved to O(1)?
- Can the per-player K-DReg(T) bound of O(K^(3/4)T^(1/4)n^(1/4)√L) (Theorem 3.16, Item 2) be improved to Õ(K)?
- Can the O(poly(1/ϵ)) iteration complexity bounds for variational inequalities (Proposition A.14) be extended to a broader class of VIs beyond those with C(F) ≤ CT^(1-ω)?

## Limitations

- Theoretical framework assumes the existence of a minimax theorem for each game, which may not hold in all game classes
- Extension to general-sum games relies on specific correlated equilibrium sequences that guarantee nonnegative dynamic regret
- Variation measures may be difficult to compute or bound in practice

## Confidence

- High confidence: Dynamic regret bounds for OGD in time-varying zero-sum games (Theorem 3.5, Corollary 3.6)
- Medium confidence: Extension to general-sum games via bilinear formulation (Section 4.1)
- Medium confidence: Improved bounds under strong convexity-concavity (Section 4.2)
- Low confidence: Applicability to potential games (Section 4.3) due to limited empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Implement the OGD algorithm for a concrete time-varying bilinear saddle-point problem and verify dynamic regret calculation empirically
2. Compute variation measures V(T)_NE and V(T)_A for synthetic game sequences and test how they affect convergence rates
3. Validate the bilinear formulation approach on a multi-player game with known correlated equilibria structure
