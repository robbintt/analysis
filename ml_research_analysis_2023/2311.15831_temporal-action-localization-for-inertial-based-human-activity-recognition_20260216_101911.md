# Temporal Action Localization for Inertial-based Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.15831
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15831
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TAL models outperform popular inertial models on 4 out of 6 datasets, with improvements reaching as much as 26% in F1-score.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that state-of-the-art Temporal Action Localization (TAL) models, originally designed for video-based activity recognition, can be effectively applied to inertial-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). By vectorizing raw sensor data into 1D feature embeddings, TAL models are trained to predict activity segments with start, end, and class labels, using mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric. Experiments on six popular HAR benchmark datasets show that TAL models produce more coherent activity segments, achieve higher NULL-class accuracy, and can recognize activities of arbitrary length without requiring fixed-size windows.

## Method Summary
The authors apply TAL models to inertial HAR data by converting 2D sliding windows (time x sensor axes) into 1D feature vectors through concatenation of sensor axes. Three TAL models (ActionFormer, TemporalMaxer, TriDet) and four inertial models (DeepConvLSTM, shallow variant, Attend-and-Discriminate, TinyHAR) are trained using LOSO cross-validation on six benchmark datasets. The TAL models are trained with focal loss and IoU loss for classification and boundary regression, while inertial models use standard cross-entropy loss. Predictions are post-processed with score thresholds and majority filters before evaluation using mAP@0.3:0.1:0.7, F1-score, and misalignment metrics.

## Key Results
- TAL models outperform inertial models on 4 out of 6 datasets in terms of F1-score and mAP
- TAL models achieve higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets
- Improvements reach as much as 26% in F1-score on certain datasets
- TAL models produce more coherent activity segments with fewer fragmented predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TAL models produce more coherent activity segments by leveraging context-aware temporal modeling instead of per-window classification.
- Mechanism: TAL models are trained to predict activity segments as (class, start, end) tuples using a sequence labeling formulation, allowing them to learn temporal dependencies across entire sequences rather than within isolated windows. This leads to fewer fragmented predictions and better NULL-class discrimination.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies and context across multiple windows improve segment coherence compared to independent window-wise classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TAL models can produce more coherent segments and achieve higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets, alleviating the need for fixed-size windows and enabling algorithms to recognize activities of arbitrary length."
  - [section] "With researchers such as Pellatt and Roggen [36] and Guan and Plötz [18] having worked on implementing improved training strategies, inertial architectures by default still lack to incorporate context-aware information into their models."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence comparing temporal modeling vs. window-wise classification.
- Break condition: If input sequences lack sufficient context (e.g., very short or highly variable activity patterns), TAL models may underperform due to reliance on broader temporal patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vectorization of inertial data allows TAL models, originally designed for video features, to process raw sensor data effectively.
- Mechanism: 2D sliding windows (time x sensor axes) are flattened into 1D vectors, converting inertial data into a format compatible with TAL model input requirements. This preserves temporal and sensor axis information while enabling TAL architectures to process inertial streams.
- Core assumption: Flattening preserves sufficient discriminative information for TAL models to learn activity boundaries and classes from inertial data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This step converts the 2-dimensional, windowed inertial data, as used by inertial architectures, into a 1-dimensional feature embedding suitable for training TAL models."
  - [section] "The preprocessing method as detailed in Figure 2 involves concatenating the different sensor axes of each window, converting the input data to be a collection of 1-dimensional feature embedding vectors."
  - [corpus] Missing - no corpus evidence on vectorization impact on model performance.
- Break condition: If vectorization loses critical temporal or cross-axis relationships, model performance may degrade, especially for complex multi-sensor activities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TAL models achieve higher mAP scores due to optimized boundary prediction and segment-level evaluation.
- Mechanism: TAL models optimize both classification (activity label) and regression (onset/offset distance) losses, directly aligning with evaluation metrics like mAP that reward accurate boundary detection and segment overlap.
- Core assumption: Optimizing for boundary regression improves segment localization accuracy, which is directly rewarded by mAP evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Introducing the TAL community’s most popular metric to inertial-based HAR, namely mean Average Precision (mAP), our analysis shows that TAL models are able to produce more coherent segments along with an overall higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets."
  - [section] "Since TAL models are designed to predict both a regression (boundary prediction) and classification target (segment label), loss calculation of the ActionFormer, TemporalMaxer and TriDet models are performed as a weighted combination of a regression loss (IoU loss [40]) and classification loss (focal loss [23])."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence linking regression optimization to improved mAP in inertial HAR.
- Break condition: If ground truth annotations are imprecise or noisy, regression-based boundary optimization may lead to overfitting or degraded performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequence labeling vs. per-window classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental difference between TAL and traditional HAR approaches is critical to grasp why TAL models perform differently.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between predicting activity labels for each window versus predicting activity segments with start/end boundaries?
- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) and mAP metrics
  - Why needed here: TAL models are evaluated using mAP based on IoU thresholds, which is different from traditional classification metrics like accuracy or F1-score.
  - Quick check question: How does mAP at different tIoU thresholds provide a more nuanced evaluation of activity localization compared to per-window accuracy?
- Concept: Vectorization of multi-dimensional time series data
  - Why needed here: TAL models require 1D feature vectors as input, necessitating conversion of 2D inertial windows into a compatible format.
  - Quick check question: Why is it necessary to vectorize 2D sliding windows of inertial data before feeding them into TAL models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vectorized inertial data -> Multi-layer feature pyramid -> Classification head + Regression head -> Activity segments (class, start, end)
- Critical path: Vectorization → Encoder feature extraction → Decoder prediction → Post-processing (NMS/thresholding)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pros: Better segment coherence, higher NULL-class accuracy, arbitrary-length activity recognition
  - Cons: Not suitable for online/real-time classification, larger model size, requires longer sequences for context
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor NULL-class accuracy → Confidence threshold too low
  - Fragmented segments → Majority filter size incorrect or insufficient training data
  - Low mAP → Boundary regression loss not well-optimized or ground truth annotations noisy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate vectorization preserves discriminative information by comparing feature similarity before/after vectorization.
  2. Test different sliding window sizes and overlaps to find optimal temporal resolution for boundary prediction.
  3. Experiment with confidence thresholds and post-processing parameters to maximize NULL-class accuracy without sacrificing overall mAP.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well would Temporal Action Localization (TAL) models perform on HAR datasets that consist solely of periodic activities, such as the RWHAR dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that TAL models performed poorly on the RWHAR dataset, which consists only of periodic activities and lacks a NULL-class, and raises the question of whether TAL models are primarily suited for untrimmed sequences with breaks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive answer, only suggesting that the lack of a NULL-class and the small number of segments may have contributed to the poor performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with TAL models on other HAR datasets that consist solely of periodic activities and include a NULL-class would provide evidence for or against the hypothesis that TAL models are less suited for periodic activities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific architectural modifications could improve the performance of TAL models on HAR datasets with limited segment diversity, such as the RWHAR dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the RWHAR dataset yielded the least performant results for TAL architectures, and suggests that the absence of a NULL-class and the small number of segments may be contributing factors.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore specific architectural modifications that could address these issues, leaving the question of how to improve TAL model performance on such datasets unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different architectural modifications, such as incorporating a NULL-class prediction mechanism or increasing the model's capacity to handle limited segment diversity, and evaluating their impact on performance would provide evidence for effective solutions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the computational complexity of TAL models be reduced to enable their deployment on edge devices for real-time HAR applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that TAL models are substantially larger than inertial models and are not suited for deployment on edge devices, but does not explore potential solutions for reducing their computational complexity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any insights into how the computational complexity of TAL models could be reduced, leaving the question of how to enable their deployment on edge devices unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating techniques such as model compression, quantization, or pruning, and evaluating their impact on the computational complexity and performance of TAL models would provide evidence for effective solutions.

## Limitations

- The vectorization process and its impact on model performance lack empirical validation through ablation studies
- TAL models require longer sequences for context and are not suitable for online/real-time classification
- Performance on datasets with highly variable activity durations or irregular sampling rates is not well-established

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: TAL models produce more coherent segments and achieve higher NULL-class accuracy compared to traditional inertial models
- **Medium Confidence**: TAL models outperform inertial models on mAP metrics
- **Low Confidence**: The vectorization process preserves sufficient discriminative information for TAL models to learn activity boundaries effectively

## Next Checks

1. **Vectorization Validation**: Conduct ablation studies comparing TAL model performance using vectorized inputs versus alternative representations (e.g., flattened 2D tensors, sequence-based inputs) to quantify the impact of the vectorization approach.

2. **Temporal Context Sensitivity**: Test TAL models on datasets with varying activity durations and sampling rates to determine the minimum sequence length required for effective boundary prediction and identify scenarios where temporal context assumptions break down.

3. **Real-world Robustness**: Evaluate TAL models on noisy, real-world sensor data with missing values and irregular sampling to assess performance degradation and identify preprocessing requirements for deployment scenarios.
