# Sample-Efficient and Surrogate-Based Design Optimization of Underwater Vehicle Hulls

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.12420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12420
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Bayesian Optimization-Lower Confidence Bound (BO-LCB) is the most sample-efficient optimization framework for UUV hull design, and a deep neural network surrogate achieves 1.85% MAPE on drag predictions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational challenge of optimizing unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hull designs by combining sample-efficient optimization methods with fast surrogate models. The authors compare several optimization frameworks and find that Bayesian Optimization-Lower Confidence Bound (BO-LCB) significantly outperforms alternatives in terms of sample efficiency and convergence behavior. They develop a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate that predicts drag forces with 1.85% mean absolute percentage error, enabling a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to traditional CFD-in-the-loop optimization. The work represents the first application of Bayesian optimization and DNN-based surrogate modeling to UUV design optimization.

## Method Summary
The authors generate a dataset of 3,021 Myring hull designs parameterized by six geometric parameters, evaluating each using RANS CFD with k-ω SST turbulence model. They train a custom 9-layer DNN with dropout and skip connections to approximate drag forces, using L1 loss and Adam optimizer. The optimization methods compared include Monte Carlo, maximin Latin Hypercube, Genetic Algorithm, Nelder-Mead, and two Bayesian Optimization variants (LCB and EI). The DNN surrogate replaces expensive CFD evaluations in the optimization loop, with final designs validated using CFD simulations.

## Key Results
- BO-LCB consistently finds optimal designs after ~30 iterations, outperforming all other optimization methods tested
- DNN surrogate achieves 1.85% MAPE on test data with only 14 outliers among 621 test samples
- Surrogate-based optimization achieves two-orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to CFD-in-the-loop methods
- The combined approach demonstrates comparable accuracy to traditional CFD-based optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: BO-LCB finds lower drag designs with fewer CFD evaluations than alternatives.
- **Mechanism**: BO-LCB balances exploitation and exploration by optimizing a utility function that trades off the predicted mean and variance. The hyperparameter β controls this balance, encouraging sampling in regions with both low predicted drag and high uncertainty.
- **Core assumption**: The drag function is smooth and well-behaved in the design space so that Gaussian process modeling is effective.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "BO-LCB is the most sample-efficient optimization framework and has the best convergence behavior of those considered."
  - [section]: "BO-LCB always finds the same optimal design after about 30 iterations" and achieves lowest drag in fewest samples.
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in neighbor papers; the claim is based on internal empirical comparison.
- **Break condition**: If the drag function is noisy or discontinuous, the Gaussian process surrogate may be inaccurate, breaking the utility function's reliability.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The DNN surrogate accurately approximates CFD-computed drag forces.
- **Mechanism**: The DNN learns a mapping from hull design parameters to drag force by minimizing a loss function (L1 loss) on a dataset of 3,021 CFD-computed samples. Its architecture uses multiple fully connected layers with dropout for regularization and skip connections to prevent vanishing gradients.
- **Core assumption**: The training dataset sufficiently covers the design space and the relationship between parameters and drag is learnable by a DNN.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Our DNN-based surrogate model predicts drag force on test data in tight agreement with CFD simulations, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85%."
  - [section]: "Our surrogate model makes accurate predictions in the vast majority of test cases, and among the inaccurate predictions, only 14 of the 621 test data points are reported as outliers."
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers do not provide evidence for this specific DNN architecture or accuracy level.
- **Break condition**: If the design space is extended beyond the training data range or if drag depends on unmodeled physics, the surrogate's accuracy will degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using the DNN surrogate in the optimization loop achieves near-optimal designs orders of magnitude faster than CFD-in-the-loop.
- **Mechanism**: The surrogate enables rapid evaluation of many candidate designs during optimization (e.g., via GA), drastically reducing computation time. The final design's drag can be verified with a single CFD simulation.
- **Core assumption**: The surrogate's predictions are sufficiently accurate that the optimization algorithm converges to a near-optimal design.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Combining these results, we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup (with comparable accuracy) for the design optimization process when the surrogate model is used."
  - [section]: "In other cases, even though there is an error in the predicted drag between the surrogate and OpenFOAM, the trends in the functions over the course of the optimization loop are almost identical."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in neighbor papers for this specific speedup claim.
- **Break condition**: If the surrogate's errors are systematic or large in the critical regions of the design space, the optimization may converge to a suboptimal design.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Bayesian Optimization (BO) and acquisition functions.
  - **Why needed here**: BO is used to efficiently explore the design space and find low-drag hull shapes with minimal CFD evaluations.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the role of the acquisition function in BO, and how does it balance exploration and exploitation?

- **Concept**: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and turbulence modeling (RANS + k-ω SST).
  - **Why needed here**: CFD simulations with the k-ω SST turbulence model are used to compute the ground-truth drag forces for training the surrogate and for validation.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is the k-ω SST turbulence model chosen over simpler models like k-ε or laminar flow assumptions?

- **Concept**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for regression and surrogate modeling.
  - **Why needed here**: A DNN is trained to approximate the computationally expensive CFD simulations, enabling fast drag predictions during optimization.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the choice of loss function (L1 vs. L2) affect the DNN's performance in this regression task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: FreeCAD -> OpenFOAM -> Python scripts -> DNN surrogate
- **Critical path**:
  1. Generate design parameters.
  2. Create CAD model in FreeCAD.
  3. Run CFD simulation in OpenFOAM (for training data or final validation).
  4. Train DNN surrogate on CFD data.
  5. Use DNN surrogate in optimization loop (e.g., with GA or BO).
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: CFD is accurate but slow; the DNN surrogate is fast but less accurate.
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: BO's acquisition function balances these to efficiently find the optimum.
  - Model complexity: A more complex DNN may be more accurate but harder to train and slower to evaluate.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor surrogate accuracy: Large MAPE or many outliers in test predictions.
  - Optimization failure: Convergence to a suboptimal design or high variance in results across runs.
  - CFD simulation issues: Mesh generation failures, non-convergence, or unrealistic drag values.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run a single CFD simulation with a simple hull design to verify the simulation setup and obtain a baseline drag value.
  2. Train the DNN surrogate on a small subset of CFD data and evaluate its accuracy on a held-out test set.
  3. Use the trained surrogate in a simple optimization loop (e.g., with a small GA population) to find a low-drag design, then validate the result with a CFD simulation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Bayesian Optimization-Lower Confidence Bound (BO-LCB) compare to other optimization methods when applied to different types of hull designs beyond the Myring hull class?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found BO-LCB to be the most sample-efficient method for Myring hull designs, but this was a specific case study.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested BO-LCB on Myring hulls, leaving open the question of its generalizability to other hull designs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing BO-LCB on a variety of hull designs (e.g., non-axisymmetric, different aspect ratios) and comparing its performance to other optimization methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model be further improved by incorporating additional design parameters or physical features beyond the current six parameters (a, b, c, d, n, θ)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85% with the current six parameters, but this leaves room for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper only considered six parameters, and the authors acknowledge that more complex features could be incorporated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the DNN surrogate model with additional design parameters (e.g., surface roughness, control surface angles) and comparing the accuracy to the current model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the DNN surrogate model change when applied to different flow conditions, such as higher turbulence intensities or different Reynolds numbers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors used a Reynolds number of 10^7 and a turbulence intensity of 4%, but real-world UUV applications may involve different flow conditions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested the DNN surrogate model under specific flow conditions, leaving open the question of its robustness to varying conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the DNN surrogate model under different flow conditions (e.g., varying Reynolds numbers, turbulence intensities) and comparing the accuracy to the current model.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on a single UUV hull family (Myring hulls) with six geometric parameters, limiting generalizability to more complex designs
- The DNN surrogate's accuracy depends heavily on the quality and coverage of the training dataset generated using specific CFD settings
- The two-orders-of-magnitude speedup claim assumes the DNN surrogate remains accurate throughout the optimization process

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The superiority of BO-LCB over other optimization methods is well-supported by empirical results showing consistent convergence to the same optimal design with fewer evaluations
- **Medium Confidence**: The DNN surrogate's accuracy (1.85% MAPE) is supported by test results, but the robustness of this accuracy across different design spaces is not fully explored
- **Medium Confidence**: The claimed two-orders-of-magnitude speedup is plausible given the computational cost difference between CFD and DNN evaluations

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Validate the DNN surrogate's accuracy on a separate dataset of Myring hulls with parameters outside the original training range to assess its extrapolation capabilities
2. **Robustness Test**: Run the optimization process multiple times with different random seeds to quantify the variance in the optimal design found and assess the stability of the surrogate-based approach
3. **Alternative Hull Families**: Apply the same optimization framework to a different UUV hull family (e.g., Delft catamaran or X-series hull) to evaluate the generalizability of the approach to different geometries
