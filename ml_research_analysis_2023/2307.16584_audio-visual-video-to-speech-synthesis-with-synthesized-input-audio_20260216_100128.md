# Audio-visual video-to-speech synthesis with synthesized input audio

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16584
- Reference count: 40
- This work introduces audio-visual-to-speech synthesis models that use both video and synthesized audio inputs during training and inference, showing improved performance over video-only approaches across multiple datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the video-to-speech synthesis (V2A) task, where the goal is to reconstruct speech from silent videos of speakers. Unlike previous approaches that use only video inputs or discard audio pathways during inference, this work proposes audio-visual-to-speech (A V2A) models that leverage both modalities throughout training and inference. The approach involves appending an audio encoder to pre-trained V2A models and training on synthesized audio from the base V2A model. Three training procedures are introduced: baseline, modality dropout, and modality dropout with ground truth audio. Experiments on GRID, TCD-TIMIT, and LRW datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with A V2A models outperforming their V2A counterparts in terms of objective metrics including PESQ, STOI, ESTOI, and WER.

## Method Summary
The method involves transforming a pre-trained V2A model into an A V2A model by appending an audio encoder, then training on synthesized audio from the base V2A model. The process begins by training a V2A model (either V2A-WaveGAN for raw waveforms or V2A-MelSpec for mel spectrograms) on the target dataset. The V2A model is then used to synthesize audio for the entire dataset, including training, validation, and test subsets. An A V2A model is constructed by appending an audio encoder to the V2A model. Three training procedures are introduced: baseline (using both modalities), modality dropout (alternating between modalities), and modality dropout with ground truth audio (using ground truth audio during audio-only training). The modality dropout procedure forces the model to learn robust representations from each modality independently, while separate batch normalization statistics are maintained for each modality combination to prevent mixing incompatible statistics.

## Key Results
- A V2A models consistently outperform their base V2A counterparts across GRID, TCD-TIMIT, and LRW datasets in terms of PESQ, STOI, ESTOI, and WER metrics
- Modality dropout training procedure generally improves performance, particularly when combined with ground truth audio during audio-only training phases
- The proposed approach shows better generalization to unseen speakers compared to video-only V2A models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Synthesizing missing audio with a pre-trained V2A model provides realistic input audio that improves downstream A V2A reconstruction quality. The pre-trained V2A model learns visual-to-audio correlations, generating synthetic audio that serves as a strong conditioning signal during training and inference, bridging the modality gap.

### Mechanism 2
Modality dropout during training forces the model to learn robust representations from each modality independently, preventing trivial solutions. By randomly dropping audio or visual modalities, the model cannot rely on one modality alone and must learn complementary features from both inputs.

### Mechanism 3
Separate batch normalization statistics for each modality prevent batch norm from mixing incompatible statistics across different input types. When modality dropout is used, maintaining distinct statistics for audio-only, video-only, and audio-visual inputs ensures proper normalization regardless of the input type.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and latent space modeling
  - Why needed here: Understanding VAEs helps in grasping how models like Lip2Wav and SVTS use latent representations to model uncertainty in speech synthesis
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the latent variable in a VAE, and how does it differ from a deterministic encoder?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adversarial training
  - Why needed here: GANs are used in models like V2A-WaveGAN to improve the realism of synthesized waveforms. Understanding the generator-discriminator interaction is crucial
  - Quick check question: What is the objective of the discriminator in a GAN, and how does it influence the generator's training?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and cross-modal alignment
  - Why needed here: The core task involves aligning and fusing audio and visual modalities. Understanding techniques like cross-modal attention and modality dropout is essential
  - Quick check question: How does modality dropout encourage the model to learn robust cross-modal representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video frames → Video frames encoder → Temporal module → Decoder → Output; Audio frames → Audio encoder → Temporal module → Decoder → Output; Combined: Video frames + Audio → [Video encoder + Audio encoder] → Temporal module → Decoder → Output

- Critical path: Video frames → Video frames encoder → Temporal module → Decoder → Output; Audio frames → Audio encoder → Temporal module → Decoder → Output; Combined: Video frames + Audio → [Video encoder + Audio encoder] → Temporal module → Decoder → Output

- Design tradeoffs: Using a pre-trained V2A model as the base provides strong initialization but may limit flexibility; Modality dropout improves robustness but increases training complexity; Separate batch normalization statistics prevent mixing but require more memory

- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction quality (check if synthesized audio is realistic); Mode collapse in GAN training (monitor discriminator and generator losses); Overfitting to one modality (verify modality dropout is applied correctly)

- First 3 experiments: 1) Train A V2A model with baseline approach and compare to pre-trained V2A model; 2) Train with modality dropout and compare to baseline; 3) Train with modality dropout and ground truth audio, compare to previous approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does audio pre-training of V2A models consistently improve the corresponding A V2A models across all datasets and training procedures? The paper notes that A V2A models show better results when the base V2A model is trained with audio pre-training in most cases, but there are exceptions where validation and test set losses are higher despite the base V2A model having lower loss. This might be an optimization difficulty due to the decoder being fine-tuned twice.

### Open Question 2
Which training procedure (baseline, modality dropout, or modality dropout with ground truth audio) is most effective for A V2A models across different datasets and audio domains? The paper introduces three training procedures and evaluates their performance on different datasets, but notes that there is no clear winner among them, especially for mel spectrogram models. The effectiveness varies depending on the dataset and audio domain.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed A V2A approach compare to other methods for audio-visual speech enhancement, separation, and inpainting? The paper mentions the potential for extending the framework to other speech synthesis tasks but does not provide experimental results or comparisons, focusing instead on video-to-speech synthesis.

## Limitations

- Experiments are limited to GRID, TCD-TIMIT, and LRW datasets with controlled conditions, raising questions about generalization to more diverse and unconstrained speech datasets
- Limited analysis of how synthesized audio quality affects downstream A V2A performance across different quality thresholds
- Optimal implementation details for modality dropout (alternation schedule and probability distributions) are not fully specified, impacting reproducibility

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core claim that audio-visual inputs improve video-to-speech synthesis compared to video-only approaches is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets and metrics
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of modality dropout in improving robustness is demonstrated, but optimal implementation details remain unclear
- Medium confidence: The benefit of using separate batch normalization statistics for different modalities is supported by results, but the underlying mechanism could be more thoroughly explained

## Next Checks

1. Test the approach on a more diverse, unconstrained speech dataset (e.g., VoxCeleb) to evaluate generalization beyond controlled conditions
2. Systematically vary the quality of synthesized audio input (using different V2A model qualities) to quantify the relationship between input audio quality and A V2A performance
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal modality dropout schedule and probability distributions for training
