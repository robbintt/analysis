# Epistemic Modeling Uncertainty of Rapid Neural Network Ensembles for Adaptive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.06628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06628
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive machine learning using ensembles of emulator-embedded neural networks (E2NN) trained as rapid neural networks (RaNN).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for adaptive machine learning that combines physics-based models with neural networks to estimate epistemic uncertainty in aerospace design exploration. The approach uses emulator-embedded neural networks (E2NN) trained as rapid neural networks (RaNN) through a novel training method that achieves near-instantaneous training while maintaining prediction accuracy. The ensemble of E2NN models provides uncertainty estimates through Bayesian statistics, enabling goal-oriented adaptive learning. The framework is demonstrated on analytical examples and a hypersonic vehicle wing design problem, showing superior robustness and reduced computational costs compared to traditional kriging methods.

## Method Summary
The method combines physics-based models with neural networks by embedding low-fidelity (LF) models into neural network neurons (E2NN). Training uses a rapid neural network paradigm where weights in early layers are randomly initialized and the final layer weights are determined through linear regression, achieving near-instantaneous training. An ensemble of E2NN models with different architectures and activation functions is created, and epistemic uncertainty is estimated through Bayesian treatment of ensemble predictions using t-distributions. Adaptive learning is performed using an Expected Improvement acquisition function to guide where to sample new data points.

## Key Results
- E2NN ensembles achieve near-instantaneous training while maintaining prediction accuracy
- Physics-based model embedding reduces overfitting and enables accurate extrapolation
- Bayesian ensemble methods provide reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates
- Adaptive learning with Expected Improvement effectively guides sampling to reduce uncertainty
- Superior performance compared to kriging methods in terms of robustness and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Using ensemble of Rapid Neural Networks (RaNN) models enables near-instantaneous training while maintaining prediction accuracy. RaNN training replaces backpropagation with random weight initialization and linear regression for the final layer, reducing training time from minutes/hours to near-instantaneous. The core assumption is that random initialization of weights in early layers combined with linear regression for the final layer is sufficient to approximate the function without iterative optimization.

### Mechanism 2
Embedding physics-based models as emulators in neural network neurons reduces overfitting and enables accurate extrapolation. LF models provide regularization by constraining the neural network's behavior, while the neural network learns optimal transformations and combinations of these models. The core assumption is that the embedded LF models capture relevant physics that constrains the solution space appropriately.

### Mechanism 3
Combining multiple E2NN model predictions using Bayesian statistics estimates epistemic uncertainty. The ensemble of E2NN models trained with different random initializations provides samples from a stochastic prediction function, which is treated as aleatoric uncertainty to estimate epistemic uncertainty. The core assumption is that the disagreement between E2NN models trained with different random initializations is primarily due to epistemic uncertainty from lack of training samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-fidelity modeling (MFM)**: Why needed here - The method combines high-fidelity and low-fidelity data sources to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy. Quick check question: What are the key differences between high-fidelity and low-fidelity models in terms of accuracy and computational cost?

- **Bayesian statistics and posterior predictive distributions**: Why needed here - Used to estimate epistemic uncertainty from ensemble predictions by treating model disagreement as aleatoric uncertainty. Quick check question: How does a t-distribution differ from a normal distribution when estimating uncertainty from limited samples?

- **Active learning and acquisition functions**: Why needed here - Guides where to sample new data points to maximize information gain and reduce uncertainty. Quick check question: What is the difference between Expected Improvement and other acquisition functions like Probability of Improvement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Scaled design variables (Input layer) -> Embedded emulator neurons (Hidden layers) -> Target function prediction (Output layer) -> Ensemble predictions -> Bayesian uncertainty estimation -> Expected Improvement acquisition function

- **Critical path**: Generate initial samples → Train E2NN ensemble → Estimate uncertainty → Use acquisition function → Add sample → Repeat

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Number of ensemble members vs. computational cost
  - Complexity of embedded emulators vs. training data requirements
  - Activation function choice (Swish vs. Fourier) vs. numerical stability
  - Ensemble diversity vs. prediction consistency

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Large prediction errors on training data (model underfitting)
  - Unstable predictions with extremely large weights (numerical issues)
  - Ensemble predictions too similar (insufficient diversity)
  - Uncertainty estimates too low (overconfidence in predictions)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement basic E2NN with single emulator on simple 1D function (e.g., y = sin(x))
  2. Create ensemble of 4 E2NN models and verify uncertainty increases between training points
  3. Implement adaptive sampling with Expected Improvement on a 2D test function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of E2NN ensembles compare to other ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, boosting) for uncertainty quantification in adaptive learning scenarios? The paper compares E2NN ensembles to kriging methods but does not explore other ensemble techniques.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of the choice of emulator fidelity on the overall performance of E2NN ensembles? The paper demonstrates the use of emulators with different fidelities but does not systematically investigate the impact of emulator fidelity on ensemble performance.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed E2NN ensemble approach scale to high-dimensional problems? The paper demonstrates the methodology on a three-dimensional CFD example but does not explore its performance on higher-dimensional problems.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across diverse problem domains for the near-instantaneous training approach
- Only demonstrated on a limited set of problems for the effectiveness of physics-based model embedding
- No comprehensive comparison with other ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification

## Confidence

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The assertion that near-instantaneous training maintains prediction accuracy is supported by theoretical reasoning but lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse problem domains.

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The effectiveness of embedding physics-based models as emulators for reducing overfitting and enabling extrapolation is supported by the theoretical framework but only demonstrated on a limited set of problems.

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The ensemble-based approach for estimating epistemic uncertainty through Bayesian statistics is well-established in the literature. The specific implementation using t-distribution for limited samples is novel but follows standard statistical principles.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the RaNN approach on a diverse set of benchmark problems including highly nonlinear functions to assess the limits of random initialization + linear regression for training.

2. Test the E2NN framework with intentionally flawed or partially incorrect emulator models to determine how sensitive the approach is to emulator accuracy and relevance.

3. Conduct systematic experiments varying the number of ensemble members, architecture diversity, and activation functions to establish guidelines for optimal ensemble configuration and quantify the relationship between ensemble diversity and uncertainty estimation quality.
