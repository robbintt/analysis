# An Autoethnographic Exploration of XAI in Algorithmic Composition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.06089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06089
- Reference count: 15
- One-line primary result: Autoethnographic study demonstrates XAI model integration reveals dataset features and latent space topology in music composition

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an autoethnographic study exploring the use of MeasureVAE, an explainable AI generative music model, within compositional practice. The author integrated MeasureVAE with Euclidean rhythm generation to explore Irish folk music datasets, discovering that the workflow revealed dataset characteristics rather than model-specific features. The study demonstrates how XAI models can be appropriated within iterative workflows to provide feedback about dataset appropriateness and latent space structure, suggesting these models can form part of richer, more complex workflows than initially intended.

## Method Summary
The study used MeasureVAE, an explainable AI generative music model, trained on Irish folk music datasets and implemented as a Max4Live plugin. The author integrated Euclidean rhythm generators (E(3,7,2), E(4,16,0), E(2,5,2)) to create structured input sequences, which were then processed through MeasureVAE. The workflow involved generating monophonic melodies via lowest note policy, encoding them through MeasureVAE, and observing heatmap visualizations of latent space density and encoding feedback. This iterative process allowed the composer to adjust Euclidean parameters based on model responses, revealing how the training data aligned with the desired musical style.

## Key Results
- XAI model integration with Euclidean rhythms exposes dataset biases and latent space structure through controlled perturbations
- The workflow transforms XAI models from generative tools into dataset evaluation instruments, revealing training data appropriateness
- XAI-generated explanations can be appropriated by other algorithmic systems to improve navigation and parameter tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating Euclidean rhythm generators with an XAI music model creates a feedback loop that exposes dataset biases and latent space structure
- Mechanism: Euclidean rhythm sequences act as controlled perturbations that reveal under-represented or dense regions in the latent space when fed through the model, with heatmap and contrastive explanations highlighting these areas for iterative refinement
- Core assumption: The model's latent space and training dataset characteristics are meaningfully interpretable when probed with structured rhythmic inputs
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The model was integrated with Euclidean rhythm generation to explore Irish folk music datasets, revealing that the workflow foregrounded musical features of the training data rather than model features" [section] "By feeding a series of permuting Euclidean sequences into MeasureVAE, I was able to explore the under-defined contours of the latent space through example"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The autoethnographic workflow transforms the XAI model from a generative tool into a dataset evaluation instrument
- Mechanism: Iterative modification of Euclidean rhythm parameters produces XAI responses (heatmap density, encoding variation) that indicate training data alignment with desired musical style, enabling dual-purpose use for dataset fitness evaluation
- Core assumption: The model's explainability features are robust enough to reflect dataset appropriateness rather than only internal mechanics
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This suggests XAI models can form part of richer and more complex workflows than initially intended" [section] "My parametrically-defined melodies would be approximated within the distribution of the original dataset, and the artifacts which arose during this process gave some idea of the extent to which my melody was congruent with the distribution of the training set"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: XAI-generated explanations can be appropriated by other algorithmic systems to improve their own navigation and parameter tuning
- Mechanism: Composer uses XAI feedback (heatmap density, activation levels) to guide adjustments in Euclidean rhythm parameters, making the XAI's interpretability actionable for non-XAI processes
- Core assumption: Feedback from the XAI model is sufficiently actionable and comprehensible to inform tuning of unrelated algorithmic systems
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The appropriation of an XAI model within an iterative workflow highlights the potential of XAI models to form part of a richer and more complex workflow than they were initially designed for" [section] "Specifically, the MeasureVAE encoder gave me feedback about the extent to which my melody caused activation in its regularised dimensions. With this, I was able to more fluidly modify my Euclidean parameters so as to create melodies which were encoded as being less dense or complex"

## Foundational Learning

Concept: Autoethnography in human-computer interaction
- Why needed here: The study uses first-person reflexive practice to understand XAI model integration in creative workflows
- Quick check question: How does autoethnography differ from traditional usability testing in evaluating creative AI tools?

Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and latent space regularization
- Why needed here: MeasureVAE is a VAE variant; understanding its latent structure is key to interpreting the heatmap and encoding feedback
- Quick check question: What is the purpose of latent space regularization in a VAE used for music generation?

Concept: Euclidean rhythms and their parametric space
- Why needed here: Euclidean rhythms provide the structured input used to probe the XAI model's behavior
- Quick check question: How do the parameters (pulses, total beats, displacement) of a Euclidean rhythm affect its complexity and predictability?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Euclidean rhythm generator (Max/MSP) -> MeasureVAE XAI model -> Heatmap visualization -> MIDI extraction -> Feedback loop

Critical path:
1. Generate Euclidean rhythm sequence
2. Extract monophonic melody via lowest note policy
3. Encode through MeasureVAE
4. Observe heatmap and encoding feedback
5. Adjust rhythm parameters and repeat

Design tradeoffs:
- Precision vs. interpretability: High-dimensional latent spaces are hard to visualize but offer richer feedback
- Dataset bias vs. creative freedom: The model's feedback is constrained by the original training data's scope
- Complexity of workflow vs. clarity of feedback: More steps can obscure the source of a given insight

Failure signatures:
- Flat or uniform heatmap: Suggests either very homogeneous training data or insufficient latent space resolution
- No meaningful change in feedback after parameter adjustments: Indicates the XAI model's explanations may not be sensitive to input variations
- Feedback that contradicts musical intuition: Suggests misalignment between model explainability and human interpretability

First 3 experiments:
1. Run a single Euclidean rhythm through MeasureVAE and record the heatmap and encoding output
2. Systematically permute one Euclidean parameter (e.g., pulse count) and observe changes in the model's feedback
3. Compare heatmap responses for rhythms that are known to be present vs. absent in the training data (e.g., Western vs. non-Western rhythmic patterns)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1
- Question: How does the use of XAI models like MeasureVAE in iterative music-making workflows affect the composer's understanding and control over the generated music compared to traditional deep learning models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how the MeasureVAE model, when used in conjunction with Euclidean rhythms, provides feedback about dataset appropriateness and latent space topology, suggesting a richer and more complex workflow than initially intended
- Why unresolved: The study provides a case example but does not compare the effectiveness of XAI models to traditional models in terms of composer understanding and control
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies between XAI and traditional models in music-making workflows, focusing on composer feedback and control

Open Question 2
- Question: Can the appropriation of XAI models in music-making workflows lead to new forms of musical creativity or unexpected outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper hints at the potential for XAI models to form part of richer workflows and mentions "algorithmic surprise" as a future work area
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on the exploratory nature of the workflow but does not delve into the creative outcomes or surprises that might arise from using XAI models
- What evidence would resolve it: Examples of unique musical pieces or outcomes directly attributed to the use of XAI models in iterative workflows, showcasing new forms of creativity

Open Question 3
- Question: How does the feedback from XAI models like MeasureVAE influence the modification and evolution of algorithmic composition systems like Euclidean rhythms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes how feedback from MeasureVAE helped the composer modify Euclidean parameters to create melodies with desired density or complexity
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides an example of feedback influencing system modification, it does not explore the broader implications or long-term effects on composition practices
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies or case studies showing how XAI feedback consistently influences the development and refinement of algorithmic composition systems over time

Open Question 4
- Question: What are the implications of using XAI models for cross-genre adaptation of pre-trained models in music composition?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "cross-genre adaptation of pre-trained models" as a future work area, implying potential applications of XAI models in this context
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the practical applications or challenges of using XAI models for cross-genre adaptation
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating the successful adaptation of pre-trained XAI models across different musical genres, highlighting challenges and solutions

## Limitations
- The autoethnographic methodology relies on subjective interpretation of model feedback, making results difficult to reproduce
- The MeasureVAE implementation details (latent dimension interpretation, regularization strength) are not fully specified
- The study focuses on a single XAI model and dataset (Irish folk music), limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence

High: XAI models can provide interpretable feedback about dataset characteristics when integrated into creative workflows
Medium: The specific Euclidean rhythm integration method is effective for exploring latent space topology
Low: Claims about XAI models being "appropriated" by other algorithmic systems require more empirical demonstration

## Next Checks

1. Recreate the MeasureVAE model architecture and train on multiple diverse music datasets to test whether latent space feedback generalizes across domains
2. Implement a blinded validation where composers unfamiliar with the original study attempt to use the Euclidean-XAI workflow and document their interpretation of the feedback
3. Systematically vary the Euclidean rhythm parameters beyond those tested in the original study to map the boundaries of useful feedback from the XAI model
