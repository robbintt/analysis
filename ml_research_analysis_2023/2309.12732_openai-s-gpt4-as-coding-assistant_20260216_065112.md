# OpenAi's GPT4 as coding assistant

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.12732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12732
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 in code development tasks and shows improved accuracy in mathematical computations, while both models successfully handle debugging tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as coding assistants across three tasks: answering code-related questions, code development, and code debugging. GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance in code development tasks, particularly in implementing high-precision functions and complex applications like tic-tac-toe with minimax players. Both models successfully handled debugging tasks, with GPT-4 offering multiple solutions. The findings indicate GPT-4 can significantly enhance programmer productivity and reliability as a coding assistant.

## Method Summary
The study used custom test suites constructed by authors to evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across three categories: code-related questions, code development tasks, and debugging scenarios. Manual testing was conducted through the web interface with expert human reviewer evaluation. Performance was assessed based on correctness of responses, accuracy of code generation, and effectiveness in debugging. Results were compared against established standards like Java Math.pow for accuracy measurements.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved mean deviation of 2.3037066373333335E9 for positive exponents and 2.1726446876877912E-2 for negative exponents in high-precision function implementation
- GPT-4 successfully implemented a complete tic-tac-toe application with minimax-based AI players that never lose
- GPT-4 provided multiple solution approaches for debugging tasks, including iterator-based and reverse traversal methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 demonstrates superior code development capabilities through high-precision function implementation
- Mechanism: GPT-4 uses advanced mathematical algorithms and precision handling (BigDecimal) to achieve significantly lower deviation from standard Java Math.pow results compared to GPT-3.5
- Core assumption: Mathematical precision in code generation correlates with overall coding assistant reliability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance in code development tasks, particularly in implementing high-precision functions"
  - [section] "The mean deviation of GPT4 improved to 2.3037066373333335E9 for positive exponents and 2.1726446876877912E-2 for negative ones"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on general coding assistant evaluation rather than precision metrics
- Break condition: If required precision tolerance exceeds capabilities of underlying numerical representations or algorithms

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4 can implement complex algorithms like minimax for perfect game play
- Mechanism: GPT-4 successfully generates complete, functional tic-tac-toe applications with minimax-based AI players that never lose
- Core assumption: Complex algorithm implementation capability indicates advanced reasoning and problem-solving abilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4... added a player based on the Minimax algorithm with ease"
  - [section] "GPT4 responded with a fully functional minimax player"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus contains general coding assistant studies but not specific minimax implementation analysis
- Break condition: When algorithm complexity exceeds model's training data coverage or reasoning capabilities

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4 provides multiple solution approaches for debugging tasks
- Mechanism: GPT-4 offers alternative debugging strategies (e.g., iterator-based vs. reverse traversal for IndexOutOfBoundsException)
- Core assumption: Multiple solution generation indicates deeper understanding of problem space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4... offering multiple solutions"
  - [section] "While GPT3.5 proposed a solution based on an Iterator, GPT4 proposed two alternatives"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus mentions debugging but not multiple solution generation
- Break condition: When debugging problem complexity exceeds model's ability to generate valid alternatives

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Exponentiation by squaring algorithm
  - Why needed here: Understanding the algorithm GPT-4 uses for efficient power function implementation
  - Quick check question: What is the time complexity of exponentiation by squaring for computing b^e?

- Concept: Minimax algorithm for game theory
  - Why needed here: GPT-4 successfully implements this for perfect tic-tac-toe play
  - Quick check question: In a two-player zero-sum game, what does the minimax algorithm guarantee for the maximizing player?

- Concept: Iterator pattern for safe collection modification
  - Why needed here: GPT-3.5 uses this pattern to avoid IndexOutOfBoundsException during list modification
  - Quick check question: Why does modifying a collection while iterating over it with a traditional for loop cause IndexOutOfBoundsException?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt Processing -> Code Generation -> Compilation/Execution -> Result Evaluation
- Critical path: Prompt → Code Generation → Compilation/Execution → Result Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs. response time, precision vs. computational complexity, single vs. multiple solution generation
- Failure signatures: Compile-time errors, logical errors, precision deviations, infinite loops
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic code generation: "Generate a Java function to reverse a string"
  2. Test debugging: "Find and fix the error in this Java code that causes NullPointerException"
  3. Test precision: "Implement a high-precision square root function without using Math.sqrt"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does GPT-4's performance on code generation tasks compare to specialized code generation models like CodeBERT or AlphaCode?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions these models but does not directly compare GPT-4's performance against them.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 without benchmarking against other specialized models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison of GPT-4's performance on the same benchmarks used for CodeBERT and AlphaCode would provide clear evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can GPT-4's coding capabilities be further improved through fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates GPT-4's strong coding abilities but does not explore the potential for further improvement through fine-tuning.
- Why unresolved: The study did not investigate the effects of fine-tuning GPT-4 on specific coding domains or tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing GPT-4's performance before and after fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets would provide evidence of potential improvements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the use of GPT-4 as a coding assistant impact the long-term productivity and learning of human programmers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests GPT-4 can enhance programmer productivity but does not explore long-term effects.
- Why unresolved: The study did not investigate the potential for GPT-4 to either improve or hinder the development of programming skills over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking programmer productivity and skill development with and without GPT-4 assistance would provide insights into its long-term impact.

## Limitations
- The study relies on custom test suites with undisclosed specific test cases and evaluation criteria, limiting reproducibility
- The human expert reviewer's evaluation methodology lacks transparency and the sample size for testing is unclear
- The comparison between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is constrained by model availability at testing time, and results may vary with different versions or configurations

## Confidence

- High Confidence: GPT-4 demonstrates superior code development capabilities, particularly in implementing high-precision functions and complex applications like tic-tac-toe with minimax players.
- Medium Confidence: GPT-4 provides multiple solution approaches for debugging tasks, indicating deeper understanding of problem space.
- Low Confidence: GPT-4's overall impact on programmer productivity and software development processes requires further validation with larger-scale, real-world studies.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a blind, cross-validation study with independent human experts to verify GPT-4's performance advantages in code development and debugging tasks.
2. Implement the same test suites across multiple GPT-4 versions and configurations to assess consistency and identify potential model-dependent variations.
3. Design a longitudinal study tracking developer productivity metrics when using GPT-4 as a coding assistant over extended development cycles.
