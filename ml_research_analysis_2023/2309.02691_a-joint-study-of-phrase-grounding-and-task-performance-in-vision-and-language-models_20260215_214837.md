# A Joint Study of Phrase Grounding and Task Performance in Vision and Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.02691
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02691
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Key outcome**: This paper introduces a novel framework for jointly studying task performance and phrase grounding in vision and language models. The authors propose three benchmarks by extending existing datasets, including Touchdown SDR, KiloGram, and Flickr30k Entities, to study the relation between task performance and phrase grounding ability. They evaluate two contemporary models, ViLT-Aligner and MDETR, on these benchmarks and demonstrate that despite relatively strong task performance, the models exhibit inconsistencies between their ability to ground phrases and solve tasks. The authors show that this issue can be addressed through brute-force training on ground phrase annotations and analyze the dynamics it creates. The study provides valuable insights into the reasoning processes of vision and language models and offers a new perspective on evaluating their performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for jointly studying task performance and phrase grounding in vision and language models. The authors introduce three benchmarks by extending existing datasets with phrase grounding annotations to quantify the alignment between a model's ability to ground phrases and its success on vision-language tasks. They evaluate two contemporary models, ViLT-Aligner and MDETR, and demonstrate that despite strong task performance, these models often fail to ground phrases in a way that corresponds to their task success. The paper shows that this issue can be addressed through brute-force training on ground phrase annotations and analyzes the dynamics it creates. The study provides valuable insights into the reasoning processes of vision and language models and offers a new perspective on evaluating their performance.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a framework for jointly studying task performance and phrase grounding in vision and language models. The authors propose three benchmarks by extending existing datasets, including Touchdown SDR, KiloGram, and Flickr30k Entities, with phrase grounding annotations. They evaluate two contemporary models, ViLT-Aligner and MDETR, on these benchmarks. The models are fine-tuned on task data and optionally on dataset-specific phrase grounding annotations. The paper also conducts probing experiments to study internal activations of the models. The training involves minimizing task-specific losses and phrase grounding losses, with variations in the amount of phrase grounding annotations used. The models are evaluated on task performance, phrase grounding, and the correlation between the two.

## Key Results
- Despite strong task performance, ViLT-Aligner and MDETR exhibit inconsistencies between their ability to ground phrases and solve tasks.
- Fine-tuning on dataset-specific phrase grounding annotations improves both phrase grounding performance and task-grounding correlation.
- The amount of phrase grounding data needed for high task-grounding correlation varies across datasets, with Flickr30k Entities requiring the least amount of additional data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Phrase grounding pre-training provides knowledge that can be leveraged for downstream task performance.
- Mechanism: Pre-training on large-scale phrase grounding annotations allows the model to learn associations between text phrases and visual regions, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
- Core assumption: The knowledge acquired during pre-training is transferable to new tasks and can improve performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show how this can be addressed through brute-force training on ground phrasing annotations"
  - [section] "Fine-tuned MDETR without phrase grounding pre-training performs similarly to random guessing. Accuracy climbs to 46.50% when initialized with phrase grounding pre-training"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on enhancing VLM training with syntactic losses or medical phrase grounding, but not directly on transfer from pre-training to downstream tasks.
- Break condition: If the pre-training data is too dissimilar from the target task data, the transferred knowledge may not be useful.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning on dataset-specific phrase grounding annotations improves both phrase grounding performance and task-grounding correlation.
- Mechanism: Adding explicit phrase grounding supervision during fine-tuning encourages the model to learn the expected reasoning process of associating phrases with visual regions, leading to better alignment between task success and phrase grounding ability.
- Core assumption: The model has the capacity to learn phrase grounding, but needs explicit supervision to do so effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show how this can be addressed through brute-force training on ground phrasing annotations"
  - [section] "Fine-tuning on phrase grounding annotations helps significantly. Phrase grounding ability improves 14.48→42.97 mean-IoU in MDETR and 4.70→40.98 mean-IoU in ViLT-Aligner, while task-grounding correlation improves 0.39→0.67 in MDETR and 0.02→0.85 in ViLT-Aligner."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on quantifying grounding in VLMs or phrase dictionary biasing for speech translation, but not on the impact of explicit phrase grounding supervision during fine-tuning.
- Break condition: If the phrase grounding annotations are of poor quality or do not align well with the task requirements, the fine-tuning may not improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The amount of phrase grounding data needed for high task-grounding correlation varies across datasets.
- Mechanism: Datasets with more direct connections to the pre-training data (e.g., Flickr30k Entities) require less additional phrase grounding data to achieve high task-grounding correlation, while more dissimilar datasets (e.g., KiloGram) need more.
- Core assumption: The similarity between the pre-training data and the target dataset influences the amount of additional phrase grounding data needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In most cases, we observe that relatively small amount of phrase grounding annotations closes much of the gap and dramatically improves the correlation of task reasoning and phrase grounding."
  - [section] "Varying the amount of phrase grounding data shows different trends across the datasets (Figure 3). Flickr30k Entities needs the least amount of phrase grounding annotation to reach high correlation between task performance and phrase grounding."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers do not directly address the relationship between pre-training data, target dataset similarity, and the amount of additional phrase grounding data needed.
- Break condition: If the target dataset is highly dissimilar from the pre-training data, even large amounts of additional phrase grounding data may not significantly improve task-grounding correlation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Phrase grounding - the process of associating text phrases with corresponding image regions.
  - Why needed here: Phrase grounding is the core ability being studied in this paper, and understanding its role is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between phrase grounding and object detection?

- Concept: Task-grounding correlation - a measure of how well a model's ability to ground phrases corresponds to its success on the overall task.
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces this metric to quantify the alignment between task performance and phrase grounding ability, which is the main focus of the study.
  - Quick check question: How is task-grounding correlation calculated for tasks with continuous vs. discrete outputs?

- Concept: Vision and language pre-training - training models on large-scale image-caption datasets to learn cross-modal representations.
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates two contemporary vision and language models (ViLT-Aligner and MDETR) that are pre-trained on such datasets, and the impact of pre-training on downstream task performance is a key aspect of the study.
  - Quick check question: What are some common objectives used in vision and language pre-training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ViLT-Aligner (vision-language transformer + Aligner module) -> MDETR (modulated detector extended from DETR) -> Touchdown SDR / KiloGram / Flickr30k Entities (benchmarks)

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train ViLT-Aligner or MDETR on large-scale phrase grounding annotations.
  2. Fine-tune the pre-trained models on the target task (Touchdown SDR, KiloGram, or Flickr30k Entities) with or without additional phrase grounding annotations.
  3. Evaluate the models on task performance, phrase grounding, and task-grounding correlation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained models vs. training from scratch: Pre-trained models can leverage knowledge from large-scale data but may require careful fine-tuning to adapt to specific tasks.
  - Explicit phrase grounding supervision vs. implicit learning: Adding explicit phrase grounding annotations during fine-tuning can improve performance but requires additional data annotation effort.

- Failure signatures:
  - High task performance but low phrase grounding ability: Indicates that the model may be relying on shortcuts or biases rather than the expected reasoning process.
  - Low task-grounding correlation: Suggests that the model's success on the task is not well-aligned with its ability to ground phrases, which may limit its generalization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune ViLT-Aligner or MDETR on the target task without additional phrase grounding annotations to establish a baseline.
  2. Fine-tune the models on the target task with additional phrase grounding annotations to assess the impact on performance and task-grounding correlation.
  3. Vary the amount of phrase grounding data used during fine-tuning to study the relationship between data size and performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, based on the content and discussion, some potential open questions are:

1. What is the minimum amount of phrase grounding annotations needed to achieve high correlation between task performance and phrase grounding in models without phrase grounding pre-training?
2. How do the results generalize to other vision and language tasks beyond spatial description resolution and reference games?
3. What are the limitations of using correlation as a measure of the relation between task performance and phrase grounding?

## Limitations

- The evaluation focuses on only two contemporary models (ViLT-Aligner and MDETR), which may not represent the full spectrum of vision-language architectures.
- The phrase grounding annotations, while carefully constructed, are limited in scale - the Touchdown SDR dataset contains only 1,672 examples with phrase annotations.
- The study assumes that phrase grounding is a necessary component of task reasoning, which may not hold for all vision-language tasks.
- The correlation metrics used (Pearson and point biserial) may be sensitive to the specific evaluation protocols and thresholds chosen.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The finding that fine-tuning with phrase grounding annotations improves both grounding performance and task-grounding correlation is well-supported by the experimental results across all three datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that pre-training on phrase grounding annotations improves downstream task performance has strong support for MDETR but mixed results for ViLT-Aligner, suggesting model-specific effects.
- **Medium Confidence**: The observation that different datasets require different amounts of phrase grounding data to achieve high correlation is supported by the results, but the underlying reasons for these differences warrant further investigation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Evaluate additional vision-language models (e.g., BLIP, Flamingo) on the proposed benchmarks to assess whether the observed patterns hold across different architectural approaches.

2. **Annotation quality analysis**: Conduct an ablation study where different subsets of phrase grounding annotations (varying quality thresholds) are used during fine-tuning to quantify the impact of annotation quality on task-grounding correlation.

3. **Generalization testing**: Test whether models with high task-grounding correlation on these benchmarks maintain this correlation when evaluated on held-out data or on related but distinct tasks (e.g., referring expression comprehension).
