# Normed Spaces for Graph Embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01502
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01502
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ℓ∞ normed space consistently outperforms all other spaces on graph reconstruction tasks while requiring significantly fewer computational resources

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates normed spaces (particularly ℓ₁ and ℓ∞ norms) as an alternative to Riemannian manifolds for graph embedding. Motivated by discrete geometry results showing normed spaces can embed finite metric spaces with low distortion, the authors compare these spaces against popular manifolds on graph reconstruction, link prediction, and recommender system tasks. Across synthetic and real-world datasets, ℓ∞ space consistently outperforms all other spaces, including hyperbolic, spherical, SPD, and Siegel spaces, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The ℓ₁ space also performs strongly, especially on recommender systems. The results demonstrate that normed spaces provide a flexible, efficient, and effective alternative for geometric graph representation learning.

## Method Summary
The paper optimizes a distance-based loss function using gradient descent to embed graphs into target metric spaces. The method uses graph reconstruction as a benchmark task, evaluating embeddings using average distortion (Davg) and mean average precision (mAP). The approach compares ℓ₁, ℓ₂, and ℓ∞ normed spaces against hyperbolic, spherical, SPD, and Siegel spaces, as well as product spaces formed by combining these spaces. The RA DAM optimizer is used for training, and experiments are conducted on synthetic graphs (grids, trees, and their products) and real-world graphs (USCA312, BIO-DISEASOME, CSPHD, EUROROAD, FACEBOOK).

## Key Results
- ℓ∞ normed space consistently outperforms all other spaces on graph reconstruction tasks
- Normed spaces require significantly fewer computational resources than Riemannian manifolds
- ℓ₁ space performs strongly on recommender systems while ℓ∞ excels on graph reconstruction
- Normed spaces show high scalability with increasing graph size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Normed spaces can embed finite metric spaces with low distortion in low dimensions, unlike Riemannian manifolds which often require higher dimensions for comparable performance.
- Mechanism: The theoretical foundation from discrete geometry shows that ℓ₁ and ℓ∞ spaces have strong embedding properties for finite metric spaces. These spaces avoid the computational complexity of Riemannian manifolds while maintaining representation capacity.
- Core assumption: The theoretical bounds on distortion from discrete geometry translate to practical performance in real-world graph embedding tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Theoretical results from discrete geometry suggest that normed spaces can abstractly embed finite metric spaces with surprisingly low theoretical bounds on distortion in low dimensions."
  - [section 3]: "Every n-point metric space can be embedded in an O(log n)-dimensional Euclidean space with an O(log n) distortion (Bourgain, 1985)."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mentions of distortion bounds in corpus neighbors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ℓ∞ space consistently outperforms all other spaces on graph reconstruction tasks while requiring fewer computational resources.
- Mechanism: The ℓ∞ norm provides better preservation of graph structures across varying curvatures and graph sizes, making it more flexible than spaces with fixed curvature properties.
- Core assumption: The empirical superiority of ℓ∞ space on synthetic and real-world graphs indicates it captures essential graph features more effectively than other spaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ℓ∞ space consistently outperforms all other spaces, including hyperbolic, spherical, SPD, and Siegel spaces, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources."
  - [section 4.1]: "the ℓ∞ normed space largely outperforms all other metric spaces considered on the graph configurations we examine."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss ℓ∞ performance specifically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Normed spaces provide computational efficiency advantages over Riemannian manifolds due to simpler distance calculations and avoiding transcendental functions.
- Mechanism: ℓ₁ and ℓ∞ norms use simple arithmetic operations, while Riemannian manifolds require expensive operations like eigendecompositions and transcendental functions.
- Core assumption: The computational savings from using normed spaces scales favorably as graph size increases, making them practical for large-scale applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "while requiring significantly fewer computational resources"
  - [section 4.1]: "the training time differences become more noticeable with increasing graph size" and "Normed spaces show high scalability"
  - [section 4.1]: "transcendental functions and eigendecompositions are computationally costly operations"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Metric space embeddings and distortion
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on understanding how well different spaces can preserve graph distances (low distortion) for effective embeddings
  - Quick check question: What is the definition of average distortion Davg for graph embeddings, and why is it a key evaluation metric?

- Concept: Normed spaces and their properties (ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ℓ∞ norms)
  - Why needed here: The paper compares different normed spaces (ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ℓ∞) against Riemannian manifolds, requiring understanding of their geometric properties
  - Quick check question: How do ℓ₁, ℓ₂, and ℓ∞ norms differ in their geometric properties, and what implications does this for graph embedding?

- Concept: Graph reconstruction as a benchmark task
  - Why needed here: The paper uses graph reconstruction to evaluate embedding quality, which requires understanding the loss function and evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the distance-based loss function used in the graph reconstruction task, and how does it relate to the evaluation metrics (Davg and mAP)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Load graph -> compute shortest path distances -> initialize embeddings -> optimize distance-based loss -> evaluate distortion and precision -> compare across spaces
- Critical path: Load graph → compute shortest path distances → initialize embeddings → optimize distance-based loss → evaluate distortion and precision → compare across spaces
- Design tradeoffs: Normed spaces offer computational efficiency but may not capture specific geometric properties that some Riemannian manifolds provide; higher dimensions improve representation but increase computational cost
- Failure signatures: High distortion values indicate poor space-graph alignment; poor mAP scores suggest local structure preservation issues; training instability may indicate optimization challenges
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate synthetic graph reconstruction results (TREE, GRID, TREE × TREE) to verify baseline performance
  2. Test ℓ∞ space on a simple real-world graph (BIO-DISEASOME) to confirm computational efficiency claims
  3. Compare ℓ₁ vs ℓ∞ performance on a bipartite graph (ML-100 K) to understand space-task alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do normed space embeddings leverage the geometry of normed spaces to achieve superior performance across diverse graph structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "Further analysis is needed to describe how normed space embeddings leverage the geometry of normed spaces" and observes that ℓ1 space outperforms ℓ∞ space on recommender systems while the opposite is true for graph reconstruction.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates empirical superiority but does not provide theoretical explanation for why specific normed spaces (ℓ1 vs ℓ∞) perform differently across tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis connecting specific graph properties to optimal normed space choices, or systematic study showing which graph features align with ℓ1 vs ℓ∞ geometry.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical limits of embedding real-world graphs into normed spaces, and how do these compare to the empirical results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Our work and others in the geometric machine literature... lack theoretical guarantees" and notes the gap between "theoretical bounds on distortion for abstract embeddings and the empirical results, especially for real-world graphs."
- Why unresolved: While discrete geometry provides theoretical bounds for abstract metric spaces, these results don't directly predict empirical performance on real-world graphs with complex structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical framework connecting discrete geometry embedding bounds to practical graph embedding performance, validated through experiments on benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the asymmetry in the distance-based loss function impact the quality and characteristics of the resulting embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes "Interestingly, we find that this asymmetry does not have any negative impact on the empirical results" but provides empirical analysis showing how asymmetry affects small vs. large graphs differently.
- Why unresolved: The paper only shows that asymmetry doesn't harm results but doesn't explain why or whether certain graph types benefit from this asymmetry.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of how asymmetric loss affects embedding geometry, or controlled experiments comparing symmetric vs. asymmetric losses across graph families.

## Limitations
- The computational efficiency claims don't account for potential scalability issues with extremely large graphs
- The comparison against Riemannian manifolds may be incomplete, focusing on specific spaces without exploring other potentially relevant manifolds
- The evaluation metrics (Davg and mAP) may not capture all aspects of embedding quality for specific downstream tasks

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The computational efficiency advantage of normed spaces over Riemannian manifolds is well-supported by the explicit mention of avoiding transcendental functions and eigendecompositions. The claim that normed spaces can embed finite metric spaces with low distortion is grounded in established discrete geometry theory.

**Medium Confidence:** The empirical superiority of ℓ∞ space across different graph types is demonstrated but may be dataset-dependent. The claim that fewer dimensions are needed for normed spaces is supported but the exact dimensionality requirements for different graph types remain unclear.

**Low Confidence:** The theoretical mechanism explaining why ℓ∞ specifically outperforms other norms is not established. The long-term scalability of normed spaces for massive graphs is not fully validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Theoretical Analysis Validation:** Investigate the mathematical properties of ℓ∞ norm that might explain its superior performance on graph reconstruction tasks. Compare the distortion bounds for ℓ₁, ℓ₂, and ℓ∞ spaces when embedding specific graph structures (trees, grids, etc.) to establish theoretical justification for empirical observations.

2. **Scalability Benchmark:** Conduct experiments on progressively larger graphs (10K, 100K, 1M nodes) to verify that the computational efficiency advantage of normed spaces scales linearly and doesn't diminish with graph size. Measure training time, memory usage, and convergence behavior across different spaces.

3. **Task-Specific Performance:** Test ℓ∞ and ℓ₁ space embeddings on specific downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction with different graph types) to determine if the reconstruction performance translates to task-specific utility. Compare against task-specific embeddings and analyze the trade-off between reconstruction quality and downstream task performance.
