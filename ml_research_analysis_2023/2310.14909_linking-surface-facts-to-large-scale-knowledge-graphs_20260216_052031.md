# Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OIE-to-KG linking achieves 97.7% transductive accuracy but struggles with inductive and polysemous cases; out-of-KG entity detection is feasible but predicate detection remains an open problem.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of linking surface-form Open Information Extraction (OIE) triples to canonical Knowledge Graph (KG) facts. The authors introduce the FaLB benchmark for multi-faceted evaluation, including transductive, inductive, polysemous, and out-of-KG detection scenarios. Their approach uses pre-trained language models to encode OIE slots and KG entries, followed by pre-ranking and re-ranking steps to link them. Experiments show strong transductive performance but highlight difficulties with inductive generalization and polysemy, while out-of-KG entity detection is feasible but predicate detection is not.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a two-stage approach: pre-ranking and re-ranking. The OIEpreranker independently embeds OIE slots and KG entries using RoBERTa-based encoders with contrastive loss training. This is followed by the Factreranker, which uses cross-attention over the top-k candidates from pre-ranking to resolve ambiguity and improve accuracy. Models are trained on synthetic data (SynthIE) generated from KG facts, demonstrating that OIE-to-KG linking can be learned without manual annotation beyond the KG. Entity alias augmentation is used to increase data diversity.

## Key Results
- Transductive linking achieves 97.7% accuracy, outperforming baselines.
- Pre-ranking + re-ranking improves performance on polysemous and inductive cases.
- Training on synthetic data (SynthIE) yields models competitive with those trained on human-annotated data (REBEL).
- Out-of-KG entity detection is feasible, but predicate detection remains an open problem.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-ranking followed by re-ranking improves accuracy on polysemous and inductive fact linking.
- Mechanism: Pre-ranking independently embeds OIE slots and KG entries, enabling efficient initial retrieval. Re-ranking then uses cross-attention over the top-k candidates to resolve ambiguity using the full context of the OIE triple and KG fact.
- Core assumption: Top-k candidates from pre-ranking contain the correct match, and contextual information in re-ranking resolves polysemy and inductive generalization gaps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we obtain high performance by training models solely on a synthetic variant... and that (iii) a dedicated OIE-to-KG fact re-ranking model improves the linking performance of both inductive and polysemous OIEs"
  - [section]: "For each OIE slot, we re-rank the OIEpreranker top-k most probable KG links... the Fact reranker brings a significant performance gain especially prominent for linking complete facts"
- Break condition: If the correct KG entry is not in the top-k of pre-ranking, or if the full context does not disambiguate the polysemous mentions, re-ranking fails to recover accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training on synthetic data (SynthIE) yields models competitive with those trained on human-annotated data (REBEL).
- Mechanism: The LLM-generated sentences from SynthIE are paired with canonical KG facts, providing supervised signal for OIE-to-KG linking without manual annotation beyond the KG. Synthetic diversity (via alias augmentation) compensates for lack of human curation.
- Core assumption: LLM-generated sentences reliably entail the KG facts and maintain sufficient lexical diversity for generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we obtain high performance by training models solely on a synthetic variant of our dataset (i.e., with the KG as the only human-annotated data)"
  - [section]: "We observe that models trained on SynthIE are overall better OIE-to-KG fact linkers than models trained on REBEL... indicating that learning to link OIEs to KGs is possible using only synthetic data"
- Break condition: If synthetic sentences poorly reflect real-world surface forms, or if the entailment between sentence and KG fact is weak, model generalization will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Detecting out-of-KG entities is feasible, but detecting out-of-KG predicates is not.
- Mechanism: Entity detection leverages the large entity vocabulary to learn distinguishing features; predicate detection fails because the predicate set is small and models overfit to the limited training predicates.
- Core assumption: Entity sets are large and diverse, enabling zero-shot detection, while predicate sets are small and thus prone to overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we show that (v) it is possible to detect Out-of-KG entities to an extent, however, the same does not hold for predicates: a task that our experiments identify as a difficult open problem"
  - [section]: "None of the models we evaluate are able to recognize whether an OIE relation has a corresponding KG predicate... the number of relations is limited (~600 during training) and therefore, the models overfit on this limited set"
- Break condition: If predicate vocabulary grows large or is sampled more evenly, or if zero-shot relation detection methods are used, predicate detection might become feasible.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with in-batch and global negatives
  - Why needed here: Enables efficient training on large KGs without computing full softmax; ensures embeddings for matching pairs are close in latent space.
  - Quick check question: Why sample negatives from the whole KG during training rather than just in-batch negatives?
- Concept: Polysemy and contextual disambiguation
  - Why needed here: OIE mentions like "Michael Jordan" refer to multiple KG entities; disambiguation requires leveraging the relation and object in context.
  - Quick check question: How does the fact re-ranker use the full triple context to disambiguate polysemous mentions?
- Concept: Alias augmentation for data diversity
  - Why needed here: Surface forms in real text often use abbreviations, synonyms, or nicknames; augmentation exposes models to these variations.
  - Quick check question: Why is entity alias augmentation especially important for training but less critical for inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  OIEpreranker (RoBERTa encoder + linear projection) -> Factreranker (RoBERTa cross-attention) -> Out-of-KG detection (confidence/entropy heuristics or query-key-value attention)
- Critical path: Extract OIE triple -> encode via OIEpreranker -> retrieve top-k KG facts -> re-rank with Factreranker -> output final KG fact
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-ranking alone is fast but struggles with polysemy and inductive cases; re-ranking adds accuracy but increases latency.
  - Training on synthetic data saves annotation cost but may introduce domain shift; alias augmentation mitigates this.
  - Entity detection is feasible; predicate detection is not—affects choice of out-of-KG detection strategy.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low re-ranking gain: top-k candidates from pre-ranking miss the correct KG fact.
  - Poor inductive performance: model overfits to training KG entities; requires stronger generalization or context use.
  - Out-of-KG predicate false positives: model cannot distinguish unseen predicates due to small predicate set and overfitting.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Run OIEpreranker with and without Factreranker on REBEL transductive split; measure gain.
  2. Synthetic data: Train OIEpreranker on REBEL vs. SynthIE; evaluate on inductive REBEL split; compare macro accuracy.
  3. Out-of-KG detection: Apply confidence@1 and entropy heuristics on OIEpreranker scores; measure entity vs. predicate detection accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does incorporating knowledge graph structure improve out-of-KG detection performance compared to using only language model embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that leveraging KG structure could yield better representations for zero-shot samples and improve out-of-KG detection, but their current models ignore KG structure.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with incorporating KG structure into the model architecture or training process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing OIE-to-KG linking and out-of-KG detection performance between models using only language model embeddings versus models incorporating KG structure (e.g., through graph neural networks or knowledge graph embeddings).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of OIE-to-KG linking models generalize across different languages and knowledge graphs beyond English and Wikidata?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their approach can be readily extended to other languages and knowledge graphs, but all their experiments are conducted on English data with Wikidata.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any cross-lingual or cross-knowledge-graph experiments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the same OIE-to-KG linking models on datasets from different languages and knowledge graphs, comparing performance across languages and knowledge graphs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using more diverse and realistic OIE triples on the performance of OIE-to-KG linking models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that current datasets lack diversity in entity mentions and perform entity alias augmentation to increase diversity, but note that this augmentation only moderately impacts specific entity mentions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore using OIE triples from more diverse sources or with more realistic surface forms beyond the entity alias augmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing OIE-to-KG linking performance using OIE triples from diverse sources (e.g., social media, news articles) with more varied surface forms against performance on current benchmark datasets.

## Limitations
- Out-of-KG predicate detection remains an open problem due to small predicate set and overfitting.
- Synthetic data may not fully capture the diversity of real-world surface forms, potentially limiting generalization.
- Experiments are limited to English Wikipedia and Wikidata, restricting external validity to other domains and languages.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Transductive performance (97.7% accuracy) and general effectiveness of pre-ranking + re-ranking pipeline.
- Medium Confidence: Synthetic data sufficiency and alias augmentation benefits, though synthetic data alignment with real OIE distributions warrants further scrutiny.
- Low Confidence: Absolute statements about predicate detection impossibility and entity detection feasibility as the analysis provides plausible explanations but does not rule out alternative approaches.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transfer Test**: Apply the best-performing model (trained on SynthIE + alias augmentation) to OIE triples from a different domain (e.g., scientific literature or social media) and measure performance degradation compared to the Wikipedia-trained model.

2. **Predicate Detection Architecture Probe**: Implement a few-shot relation detection module using textual descriptions of KG predicates as conditioning context, and evaluate whether this enables out-of-KG predicate detection beyond the baseline's failure.

3. **Synthetic Data Quality Audit**: Conduct a manual annotation study comparing a sample of synthetic sentences from SynthIE against real OIE triples from REBEL, measuring lexical overlap, syntactic complexity, and entailment strength to quantify the domain shift.
