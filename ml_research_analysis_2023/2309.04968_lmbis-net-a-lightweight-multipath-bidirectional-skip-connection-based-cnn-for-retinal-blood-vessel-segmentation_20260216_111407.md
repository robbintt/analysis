# LMBiS-Net: A Lightweight Multipath Bidirectional Skip Connection based CNN for Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.04968
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04968
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: LMBiS-Net achieves superior retinal vessel segmentation performance with only 0.172M parameters across DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets

## Executive Summary
LMBiS-Net introduces a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for retinal blood vessel segmentation in fundus images. The model employs multipath feature extraction blocks and bidirectional skip connections to enhance feature representation while maintaining computational efficiency. With only 0.172 million parameters, the network achieves state-of-the-art performance across three major retinal image datasets, demonstrating that architectural innovations can compensate for reduced parameter counts. The bidirectional skip connections enable effective fusion of low-level spatial details and high-level semantic information, while multipath blocks capture vessel features at multiple scales and orientations.

## Method Summary
LMBiS-Net is a lightweight CNN architecture for retinal vessel segmentation that combines multipath feature extraction with bidirectional skip connections. The encoder processes 512×512 RGB images through three multipath blocks, each containing parallel convolutional pathways with 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5 kernels to capture multi-scale features. The network uses only two max-pooling layers to preserve spatial information, followed by a bottleneck layer for feature compression. The decoder employs three blocks with transpose convolutions for upsampling, with bidirectional skip connections concatenating encoder features at each resolution level. The model is trained using dice loss with Adam optimizer, incorporating data augmentation including contrast adjustments and rotation. The entire architecture contains only 0.172 million parameters, significantly fewer than traditional segmentation networks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 83.60% sensitivity, 98.83% specificity, and 97.08% accuracy on DRIVE dataset
- Demonstrates superior performance with only 0.172M parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Shows consistent improvement across all three datasets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1) with AUC scores above 98%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Bidirectional skip connections improve feature fusion between encoder and decoder by allowing high-level semantic information to flow downward and low-level spatial details to flow upward. Skip connections concatenate encoder features with corresponding decoder features at each resolution level, enabling the decoder to access both coarse semantic information and fine spatial details for precise vessel boundary delineation. Core assumption: Retinal vessel segmentation benefits from combining both high-level contextual understanding and low-level edge information. Evidence anchors: "incorporates bidirectional skip connections for the information flow between the encoder and decoder" and "bidirectional skip connections connecting its encoding and decoding layers, facilitating the fusion of low-level and high-level feature data". Break condition: If vessel boundaries are already well-defined in encoder features, additional skip connections may introduce noise or unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 2
Multipath feature extraction blocks capture vessel features at different scales and orientations, improving the model's ability to detect vessels of varying thickness. Parallel convolutional pathways with kernel sizes 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5 process the same input, allowing the network to learn both fine details and broader vessel patterns simultaneously. Core assumption: Retinal vessels exhibit significant variation in thickness and structure, requiring multi-scale feature extraction. Evidence anchors: "The network used multipath feature extraction blocks" and "A multipath feature extraction block is introduced in the proposed LMBiS-Net to process information through multiple parallel pathways". Break condition: If dataset contains predominantly uniform vessel thickness, additional computational cost of multipath processing may not be justified.

### Mechanism 3
Limited pooling operations preserve spatial information critical for accurate vessel boundary detection. Using only two max-pooling layers instead of typical four reduces spatial resolution loss, maintaining detailed vessel structure information throughout the network. Core assumption: Precise vessel boundary delineation requires high spatial resolution in feature maps. Evidence anchors: "the encoder utilizes only two max-pooling layers to minimize spatial information loss" and "its reliance on repeated convolution and pooling operations can hinder the representation of edge information". Break condition: If input image resolution is already low, further reduction in pooling may not provide additional benefits.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer → Encoder (3 multipath blocks + 2 max-pooling) → Bottleneck → Decoder (3 blocks with transpose convolutions) → Output layer with softmax
- **Critical path**: Input → Encoder (3 blocks) → Bottleneck → Decoder (3 blocks) → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fewer parameters (0.172M) vs. potentially reduced representational capacity
  - Limited pooling vs. reduced receptive field
  - Multipath blocks vs. increased computational complexity
  - Bidirectional skip connections vs. potential gradient issues
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Loss of thin vessel details: Check multipath block effectiveness and skip connection integration
  - Excessive false positives: Verify skip connection balancing and loss function parameters
  - Vanishing gradients: Examine bidirectional skip connection implementation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Remove bidirectional skip connections and compare performance on thin vessels
  2. Increase number of max-pooling layers and observe impact on spatial detail preservation
  3. Test with single-path vs. multipath feature extraction on datasets with varying vessel thickness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several limitations emerge from the methodology and results. The authors do not explore systematic evaluation of the model's robustness to varying noise levels and image quality degradation. Additionally, the specific multipath block configuration is presented without sensitivity analysis on alternative designs. The evaluation is limited to retinal fundus images without testing generalization to other vascular segmentation tasks beyond retinal vessels.

## Limitations
- Limited comparison against more recent state-of-the-art methods beyond those listed in the paper
- 0.172M parameter count raises questions about potential architectural simplifications that may compromise representational capacity
- Performance claims need further validation on datasets with varying noise levels and image quality degradation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Model architecture description and implementation details
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance superiority claims compared to listed baseline methods
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims to other segmentation tasks or imaging modalities

## Next Checks
1. Test LMBiS-Net on additional medical imaging datasets (e.g., polyp segmentation or lung nodule detection) to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Perform ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of bidirectional skip connections versus unidirectional alternatives
3. Compare computational efficiency against recent transformer-based segmentation models to validate lightweight design claims
