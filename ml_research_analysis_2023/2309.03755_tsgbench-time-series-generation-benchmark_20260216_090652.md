# TSGBench: Time Series Generation Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.03755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03755
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TSGBench provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating synthetic time series generation methods, addressing limitations of inconsistent datasets and ambiguous evaluation metrics in prior research.

## Executive Summary
TSGBench addresses the critical need for a standardized benchmark in synthetic time series generation (TSG), a field lacking comprehensive evaluation frameworks. The benchmark introduces three core modules: a curated collection of real-world datasets with standardized preprocessing, a comprehensive suite of twelve evaluation measures, and a novel generalization test based on Domain Adaptation. Through extensive experiments across ten datasets and ten advanced TSG methods, TSGBench demonstrates its efficacy in providing fair comparisons and meaningful insights into method performance and generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
TSGBench is a comprehensive benchmark for synthetic time series generation that standardizes dataset selection, preprocessing, and evaluation. The benchmark provides ten real-world time series datasets (DLG, Stock, Stock Long, Exchange, Energy, Energy Long, EEG, HAPT, Air, Boiler) with standardized preprocessing pipelines. It includes twelve evaluation measures covering model-based, feature-based, distance-based metrics, training efficiency, and visualization. The benchmark also introduces a novel generalization test using Domain Adaptation scenarios to evaluate methods' performance on small data. Ten TSG methods (RGAN, TimeGAN, RTSGAN, COSCI-GAN, AEC-GAN, TimeVAE, TimeVQVAE, GT-GAN, LS4, Fourier Flow) are evaluated using standardized hyperparameters across all datasets.

## Key Results
- TSGBench enables fair comparison across diverse TSG methods by standardizing datasets, preprocessing, and evaluation measures
- Statistical analysis reveals method rankings, with TimeVAE, COSCI-GAN, RTSGAN, and LS4 often outperforming others
- Generalization test using Domain Adaptation highlights the importance of evaluating methods' capabilities on small data and domain shift scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Module -> TSG Method Application -> Evaluation Module -> Generalization Test Module
- Critical path: Dataset selection and preprocessing → TSG method application → Evaluation measure application → Analysis of results
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing comprehensiveness of evaluation measures with computational efficiency; ensuring standardized preprocessing does not introduce new biases
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent or biased results across different TSG methods; poor generalization performance in DA scenarios
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply TSGBench to a small subset of TSG methods and datasets to validate the standardized preprocessing pipeline
  2. Compare results from model-based, feature-based, and distance-based measures to assess their consistency and complementarity
  3. Conduct a preliminary generalization test using a simple DA scenario to validate the methodology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can TSGBench be extended to evaluate the effectiveness of TSG methods in specific downstream tasks like anomaly detection, given the challenges of incorporating supplementary data and ground truth?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that TSGBench avoids using specific downstream tasks as isolated evaluation metrics due to the challenges of incorporating supplementary data and ground truth
- Why unresolved: Incorporating specific downstream tasks like anomaly detection into TSGBench would require additional data and ground truth, which may not be readily available or consistent across different TSG methods
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that demonstrates a robust and standardized way to incorporate specific downstream tasks like anomaly detection into TSGBench, using supplementary data and ground truth

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the performance of TSG methods be further improved by incorporating more diverse and complex datasets, and how would this impact the generalizability of TSGBench?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that TSGBench aims to provide a unified and equitable platform for assessing the efficacy and robustness of various TSG methods
- Why unresolved: The performance of TSG methods may vary significantly across different datasets, and incorporating more diverse and complex datasets could potentially lead to better insights into their generalizability
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that evaluates the performance of TSG methods on a larger and more diverse set of datasets, and analyzes the impact on the generalizability of TSGBench

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can TSGBench be adapted to handle time series with varying lengths and irregular sampling, which are common in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that some TSG methods are specifically designed for handling time series with varying lengths and irregular sampling, but they are not included in the initial experiments
- Why unresolved: The initial experiments of TSGBench focus on time series with fixed lengths and regular sampling, which may not fully capture the challenges of real-world applications
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that adapts TSGBench to handle time series with varying lengths and irregular sampling, and evaluates the performance of TSG methods on such data

## Limitations

- Some evaluation measures (C-FID, t-SNE visualization) have implementation details that are not fully specified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- DS and PS measures show high variance across runs due to randomness in post-hoc model training, which may impact result reliability
- The domain adaptation scenarios, while novel, may not fully capture all real-world domain shift challenges in time series generation

## Confidence

- High confidence: The benchmark's modular design with standardized datasets, preprocessing, and evaluation measures is well-documented and implementable
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the twelve evaluation measures in capturing diverse aspects of TSG performance, given some measures' implementation ambiguity
- Medium confidence: The domain adaptation generalization test's ability to evaluate real-world generalization, as the scenarios may not encompass all domain shift types

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce evaluation consistency: Run multiple experiments using the same TSG methods and datasets to quantify variance in DS and PS measures, establishing confidence intervals for these metrics
2. Cross-benchmark validation: Apply TSGBench's evaluation suite to methods from recent TSG papers not included in the original study to verify consistent method rankings across different contexts
3. Domain shift robustness: Design and implement additional domain adaptation scenarios beyond those proposed in TSGBench to test whether the benchmark's conclusions about generalization hold under different domain shift conditions
