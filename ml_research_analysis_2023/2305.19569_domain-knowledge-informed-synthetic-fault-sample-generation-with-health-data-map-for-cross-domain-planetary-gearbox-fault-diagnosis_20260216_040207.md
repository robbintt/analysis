# Domain knowledge-informed Synthetic fault sample generation with Health Data Map for cross-domain Planetary Gearbox Fault Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.19569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19569
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste achieve 98.4% and 97.8% fault diagnosis accuracy respectively in cross-domain planetary gearbox fault diagnosis

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis, where deep learning models struggle to generalize across different operating conditions. The authors propose two innovative methods—Scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste—that leverage Health Data Map (HDMap) representation to synthesize faulty data in target domains using only healthy data. These methods enable cross-domain fault diagnosis without requiring labeled faulty samples in the target domain, making them particularly valuable for real-world applications where collecting fault data is difficult or dangerous.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach uses HDMap representation of vibration signals to disentangle fault-related signatures from operating condition effects. Scaled CutPaste generates faulty samples by randomly pasting scaled fault patches onto healthy HDMap data, while FaultPaste extracts fault signatures from the source domain using an autoencoder trained on healthy data, then combines them with target domain healthy data. Both methods introduce scaling factors to simulate various fault severities, enabling the trained model to estimate unseen fault levels. A CNN-based classifier and regression model are trained on synthetic and real healthy data, then evaluated on target domain test sets.

## Key Results
- Scaled CutPaste achieves 98.4% fault diagnosis accuracy on target domain test sets
- FaultPaste achieves 97.8% fault diagnosis accuracy with similar performance
- Both methods demonstrate excellent severity estimation with ROC-AUC of 0.999 for predicting unseen fault severities
- Methods outperform conventional approaches in cross-domain fault diagnosis scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FaultPaste improves diagnosis by extracting fault signatures from the source domain using an autoencoder trained only on healthy data, then combining them with target domain healthy data.
- Mechanism: The autoencoder learns normal HDMap patterns in the source domain. When applied to faulty source data, it reconstructs only the healthy component, leaving a residual that represents the fault signature. This signature is normalized and pasted onto target domain healthy HDMap with a scaling factor to simulate various fault severities.
- Core assumption: Vibration characteristics representing operating conditions and fault-related signatures can be disentangled in the HDMap representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FaultPaste extracts fault signatures from the source domain using an autoencoder and combines them with target domain data."
  - [section 4.2] "an autoencoder is trained with pure normal data from the source domain to predict the normal patterns of the HDMap, which can then be subtracted from the faulty data."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers focus on domain adaptation but don't specifically discuss autoencoder-based fault signature extraction for planetary gearboxes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scaled CutPaste generates realistic faulty samples by introducing spatially irregular fault patterns with variable scaling factors on target domain healthy HDMap.
- Mechanism: Randomly selected long-thin patches are cut from normal HDMap and pasted at random locations with scaling factors. This creates spatial irregularities that mimic fault signatures while the scaling factor controls severity simulation.
- Core assumption: Faulty tooth of planet gear produces horizontally long-thin fault-related signature in HDMap that can be simulated by pasting patches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Scaled CutPaste generates faulty samples by pasting scaled fault signatures onto healthy HDMap data"
  - [section 4.1] "To simulate a faulty HDMap solely based on a normal HDMap in the target domain, we propose to apply CutPaste for HDMaps"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers discuss domain adaptation but don't specifically address CutPaste-style patch-based synthesis for gear faults.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of both methods with scaling factors enables the model to learn robust fault diagnosis that generalizes across domains and can estimate unseen fault severities.
- Mechanism: Both methods generate synthetic faulty data with varying scaling factors (0 to maximum value), creating a continuum of fault severities. This allows training regression models that can predict fault severity for real samples, not just classify health states.
- Core assumption: Training with synthesized samples across a range of scaling factors enables the model to learn fault severity estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Both methods introduce scaling of fault signatures for controlled synthesis of faults with various severity levels"
  - [section 4.3] "By training the regression model with randomly distributed scaling factors, the trained model can be employed to estimate the uncertain fault severity for real samples"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers focus on fault diagnosis but don't discuss severity estimation through scaling factor regression.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: HDMap representation of vibration signals
  - Why needed here: HDMap aligns vibration signals with gear meshing domains, allowing visualization of fault-related features while disentangling them from operating conditions.
  - Quick check question: How does HDMap transform raw vibration signals into a matrix representation that reveals fault characteristics?

- Concept: Domain shift and partial domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses scenarios where only healthy data is available in the target domain, requiring methods to synthesize faulty data without labeled examples.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes extreme partial domain adaptation from standard domain adaptation scenarios?

- Concept: Autoencoder-based residual analysis
  - Why needed here: FaultPaste uses autoencoders trained on healthy data to extract fault signatures by computing residuals between actual and reconstructed signals.
  - Quick check question: How does training an autoencoder only on healthy data enable it to isolate fault signatures from faulty samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> HDMap generation -> Synthesis module -> CNN model -> Training pipeline -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Generate HDMap from vibration signals → Apply synthesis method → Train CNN model → Evaluate on test set
- Design tradeoffs:
  - CutPaste vs FaultPaste: CutPaste is self-supervised but less realistic; FaultPaste requires source domain data but produces more realistic faults
  - Scaling factor range: Larger ranges improve generalization but may introduce unrealistic samples
  - Autoencoder complexity: More complex autoencoders may better capture normal patterns but require more data and computation
- Failure signatures: Poor classification accuracy indicates synthetic data doesn't match real fault characteristics; low ROC-AUC suggests scaling factors don't correlate with actual severity
- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement HDMap generation from raw vibration signals and verify fault signatures are visible in visualization 2) Test Scaled CutPaste with various scaling factors on target domain healthy data and evaluate synthetic sample realism 3) Train baseline CNN classifier on synthetic data and evaluate classification performance on target domain test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to multi-fault scenarios where multiple gears have different fault severities simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current evaluation focuses on single-fault scenarios with two discrete fault levels.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore scenarios with multiple concurrent faults or continuous fault severity variations across different gear components.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating fault diagnosis performance on datasets containing multiple simultaneous faults with varying severities across different gears.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the proposed method's performance when applied to gearboxes with different configurations (e.g., different number of planets, gear ratios)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation is limited to a specific planetary gearbox configuration with fixed parameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how changes in gearbox geometry or configuration affect the effectiveness of the HDMap-based synthesis methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing fault diagnosis accuracy across multiple gearbox configurations using the same methodology.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of autoencoder architecture affect the quality of fault signature extraction in the FaultPaste method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a "shallow version" of a specific autoencoder architecture without exploring alternatives.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not systematically investigate the sensitivity of FaultPaste performance to different autoencoder architectures or hyperparameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of FaultPaste performance using different autoencoder architectures, depths, and latent space dimensions.

## Limitations

- Evaluation based on single testbed with controlled fault introduction limits generalizability to real-world industrial settings
- Weak evidence for specific mechanisms proposed, particularly autoencoder-based fault signature extraction and CutPaste-style synthesis for gear faults
- Scaling factor approach assumes linear correlation between synthetic and real fault severity, which may not hold across different fault types

## Confidence

- Scaled CutPaste mechanism: Medium
- FaultPaste autoencoder approach: Medium  
- Cross-domain generalization claims: Low
- Severity estimation via scaling factors: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test the methods on real industrial planetary gearbox data with naturally occurring faults across varying operating conditions
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of HDMap representation versus the synthesis methods
3. Validate severity estimation by comparing predicted scaling factors against ground truth measurements from controlled fault injection experiments
