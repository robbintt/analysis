# Beyond still images: Temporal features and input variance resilience

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.00800
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00800
- Reference count: 10
- Models trained on videos show better resilience to input variations than those trained on still images

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates improving vision model resilience to input variations by training on videos instead of still images. The authors propose a multi-stream neural network that combines spatial, temporal, and audio channels, drawing inspiration from the brain's robustness to environmental changes. By training on YouTube-8M and testing on modified ImageNet and HVU datasets, they demonstrate that video-trained models exhibit significantly greater robustness to various input alterations, with accuracy and mAP dropping by only 1.36% and 3.14% respectively compared to 4.77% and 7.05% for image-trained models.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a two-stream architecture on YouTube-8M, combining a ResNet-based spatial stream with a temporal stream that performs slow fusion of 30 sampled frames using NetVLAD pooling. An optional audio stream processes audio features through fully connected layers and NetVLAD. The streams are combined using a Mixture of Experts classifier with context gating. The model is trained with adaptive learning rate optimization and evaluated on modified versions of ImageNet and HVU datasets to assess resilience to input variations including brightness changes, rotations, and color filters.

## Key Results
- Video-trained models show 1.36% accuracy drop vs 4.77% for image-trained models under input variations
- Video-trained models show 3.14% mAP drop vs 7.05% for image-trained models under input variations
- Incorporating temporal features improves robustness for both image and video understanding tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training on videos instead of still images improves model robustness to input variations by incorporating temporal features.
- Mechanism: The temporal stream captures long-term dependencies and dynamic changes across frames, allowing the model to learn invariant representations that generalize better to altered inputs.
- Core assumption: Temporal features contain information that complements spatial features and helps the model distinguish between essential and non-essential variations in input.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that the video-trained model exhibits greater robustness, with accuracy and mean average precision dropping by only 1.36% and 3.14% respectively compared to 4.77% and 7.05% for image-trained models."
  - [section] "By including a temporal stream, we enhance the model's robustness against input changes. Much like the dorsal pathway in natural vision, which facilitates understanding of how objects relate to each other and the observer's body in space, the temporal stream within a two-stream model can represent the overarching context of spatial features and their temporal interrelationships."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus neighbors. The related papers focus on spatiotemporal modeling but do not directly test input variance resilience.
- Break condition: If temporal features are corrupted or irrelevant (e.g., static scenes with no motion), the temporal stream may not provide meaningful information, potentially harming performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-stream architectures that combine spatial, temporal, and audio channels create more invariant representations by leveraging multiple sensory modalities.
- Mechanism: Each stream processes a different aspect of the input (visual appearance, motion dynamics, and audio cues), and their combination through mixture-of-experts and context gating allows the model to focus on the most relevant information for classification.
- Core assumption: Different input modalities provide complementary information that helps the model filter out irrelevant variations and focus on invariant features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We include a third-stream channel to train the network using audio data. The audio stream incorporates fully connected, and NetVLAD layers... Employing a Mixture of Expert Classifier in conjunction with context gating, we combine these three vectors using weights..."
  - [abstract] "Our findings demonstrate that models that train on videos instead of still images and include temporal features become more resilient to various alternations on input media."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. Corpus neighbors discuss multimodal approaches but do not specifically address invariant representation creation.
- Break condition: If one modality is missing or unreliable (e.g., silent video), the model may over-rely on the remaining streams, potentially reducing robustness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SlowFast architecture with different temporal sampling rates captures both fine-grained temporal details and broad contextual information.
- Mechanism: Fast stream with high frame rate captures rapid motion changes, while slow stream with low frame rate provides stable spatial features. This dual temporal resolution allows the model to build invariant representations across different timescales.
- Core assumption: Objects and actions can be recognized at multiple temporal scales, and combining these scales provides a more complete understanding that's less sensitive to input variations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Drawing inspiration from the principles of natural vision, the Slowfast network employs two pathways... One pathway, known as the Fast stream, provides higher temporal coverage with a high frame rate input... The other pathway, referred to as the Slow stream, offers lower temporal coverage with a lower frame rate input..."
  - [abstract] "Incorporating temporal features and video training enhances the model's ability to create invariant representations, improving generalization for both image and video understanding tasks."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors. The related papers do not discuss SlowFast architecture specifically.
- Break condition: If temporal sampling rates are not well-tuned, the model may either miss important motion details (too slow) or become overly sensitive to noise (too fast).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatiotemporal feature extraction
  - Why needed here: The paper transitions from spatial-only to spatiotemporal feature extraction, which is fundamental to understanding why temporal information improves robustness.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between extracting features from individual frames versus extracting features from sequences of frames?

- Concept: Invariant representation learning
  - Why needed here: The core contribution is about creating representations that remain stable under input variations, which requires understanding the concept of invariance in machine learning.
  - Quick check question: How does training on varied inputs help a model learn representations that are invariant to those variations?

- Concept: Multi-modal fusion
  - Why needed here: The three-stream architecture combines spatial, temporal, and audio information, requiring understanding of how different modalities can be effectively fused.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of early fusion versus late fusion in multimodal learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Spatial stream + Temporal stream + Audio stream → Mixture of Experts → Context gating → Classification
- Critical path: Input → Spatial stream + Temporal stream + Audio stream → Mixture of Experts → Context gating → Classification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Temporal sampling rate: Higher rates capture more motion but increase computational cost and may introduce noise
  - Stream weighting: The mixture of experts dynamically weights streams, but poor training can lead to over-reliance on one modality
  - Fusion strategy: Late fusion preserves stream-specific features but may miss cross-modal interactions that early fusion could capture
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to temporal patterns: Model performs well on training videos but poorly on static images
  - Modality imbalance: Model relies too heavily on one stream (e.g., audio) when other streams should be more important
  - Temporal aliasing: Incorrect temporal sampling causes motion blur or missed important events
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Train models with only spatial stream, only temporal stream, and only audio stream to quantify each modality's contribution to robustness
  2. Input variation sensitivity: Systematically apply different types of input variations (brightness, rotation, noise) and measure accuracy drop across different models
  3. Temporal sampling analysis: Vary the number of frames in the temporal stream (e.g., 10, 30, 60 frames) and measure the impact on both performance and robustness to input variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does incorporating temporal features impact the model's resilience to input variance compared to spatial-only models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares a two-stream model (spatial + temporal) with a single-stream spatial model, showing the two-stream model has better resilience to input variations in both image and video understanding tasks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the benefit of temporal features, it does not explore the specific mechanisms or optimal ways to incorporate temporal information for maximum resilience.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different temporal feature incorporation methods (e.g., varying temporal sampling rates, fusion techniques) and their impact on input variance resilience.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of an audio stream affect the creation of invariant representations in video understanding models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential benefits of including an audio stream, drawing inspiration from natural vision where auditory and visual information work together to enhance perception.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the potential of an audio stream and does not conduct experiments to validate its impact on invariant representation creation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing models with and without an audio stream, demonstrating the impact of audio information on input variance resilience and overall model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do transformer models compare to multi-stream networks in terms of resilience to input variance in video understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential of transformer models but does not conduct comparative studies with multi-stream networks like the one proposed in the research.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential of transformer models but does not explore their resilience to input variance or compare their performance with multi-stream networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the input variance resilience of transformer models and multi-stream networks, using similar datasets and metrics to assess their performance.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed architectural specifications for temporal stream components (slow fusion layer implementation and NetVLAD parameters)
- Unspecified training hyperparameters and mixture-of-experts weighting formula making faithful reproduction challenging
- Limited systematic analysis of evaluation methodology across wider range of perturbation types and magnitudes

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core finding that video-trained models show better resilience to input variations than image-trained models is well-supported by the presented results (accuracy drop of 1.36% vs 4.77%, mAP drop of 3.14% vs 7.05%)
- Medium confidence: The mechanism by which temporal features improve robustness is plausible but not definitively proven; the paper provides evidence of correlation but limited ablation studies to establish causation
- Medium confidence: The architectural design choices (30-frame sampling, mixture-of-experts fusion) appear effective but their optimality relative to alternatives is not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying temporal sampling rates (10, 30, 60 frames) and stream combinations to isolate each component's contribution to robustness
2. Test the trained models on additional input variation types including adversarial examples, compression artifacts, and temporal perturbations to evaluate robustness generalization
3. Implement and evaluate alternative fusion strategies (early fusion, attention-based fusion) to determine if the observed robustness improvements depend on the specific mixture-of-experts approach used
