# Interpretable Neural PDE Solvers using Symbolic Frameworks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20463
- Reference count: 36
- This paper reviews neural operators for PDEs and proposes integrating symbolic frameworks to improve interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of interpretability in neural PDE solvers, which limits their adoption in high-stakes scientific and engineering applications despite their state-of-the-art performance. The authors review recent advances in neural operators (PINNs, DeepONets, FNOs) and propose using symbolic frameworks, particularly symbolic regression, to distill learned models into human-readable mathematical expressions. The paper explores both post-hoc and embedded approaches for integration, emphasizing the need for models to balance accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability while ensuring physical coherence.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes integrating symbolic regression frameworks with neural PDE solvers to create interpretable models. Symbolic regression, which fits equations over model outputs rather than data points using genetic programming, can be applied either as a post-hoc interpretation method or embedded within the solver architecture. The approach aims to convert complex neural operations into human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining the solver's accuracy and efficiency. The paper discusses various integration strategies including interpreting neural ODEs through SINDy, symbolic metamodels, and Deep Polynomial Neural Networks, though empirical validation remains limited.

## Key Results
- Neural PDE solvers achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack interpretability, preventing adoption in high-stakes applications
- Symbolic regression can potentially distill complex neural solver outputs into human-readable mathematical expressions
- Integration of symbolic frameworks with neural operators shows promise but requires further empirical validation
- Interpretability is crucial for trustworthiness and broader applicability in scientific and engineering domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symbolic regression can distill complex neural PDE solver outputs into human-readable mathematical expressions
- Mechanism: Symbolic regression fits equations over model outputs rather than data points, using genetic programming to explore the space of possible mathematical structures and converge toward the best symbolic representation
- Core assumption: The neural PDE solver's predictions contain sufficient information to recover underlying mathematical relationships via symbolic regression
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Symbolic frameworks have the potential to distill complex neural operations into human-readable mathematical expressions"; [section] "Symbolic regression was first proposed by Koz [1] and is synonymous to regular linear or nonlinear regression except it fits over the parameters and structure of an equation rather than numerical data points"
- Break Condition: If the neural solver's representations are too entangled or the symbolic search space becomes intractable for the complexity of the PDE solution

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Embedding symbolic frameworks within neural PDE solvers improves interpretability while maintaining accuracy
- Mechanism: By integrating symbolic regression as either a post-hoc interpretation method or an embedded component of the solver architecture, the model can produce both accurate predictions and interpretable mathematical expressions
- Core assumption: Symbolic expressions can be generated without significantly degrading the solver's performance on the primary task of solving PDEs
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Some work in this direction has begun to emerge. Lee et al. [17] interprets the neural ODE by using its resulting time derivative predictions as inputs to SINDy"; [section] "Fronk and Petzold [12] adapts the Deep Polynomial Neural Networks... directly for symbolic regression"
- Break Condition: If the symbolic component adds computational overhead that negates the efficiency gains of neural solvers, or if accuracy degrades below acceptable thresholds

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interpretable neural PDE solvers will increase adoption in high-stakes scientific and engineering applications
- Mechanism: By providing transparency into the underlying mechanisms and ensuring physical coherence, interpretable solvers address the key barrier preventing neural methods from being used in critical applications
- Core assumption: Interpretability is a primary requirement for adoption in scientific domains, outweighing pure performance considerations
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Interpretability is crucial for trustworthiness and broader applicability, especially in scientific and engineering domains"; [section] "Neural PDE solvers lack the guarantees and transparency that numerical solvers have. This prevents them to be used in what are often high-stakes applications"
- Break Condition: If domain experts prioritize other factors (computational efficiency, accuracy guarantees) over interpretability, or if interpretability requirements vary significantly across applications

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partial Differential Equations and their numerical solution methods
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with PDEs as the target problem domain and various numerical methods (finite differences, finite elements) as the baseline comparison
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between forward and inverse PDE problems, and why neural solvers are particularly useful for inverse problems?

- Concept: Neural Operators and their variants (PINNs, DeepONets, FNOs)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on these as the foundation for neural PDE solvers and discusses their limitations regarding interpretability
  - Quick check question: What is the key architectural difference between finite-dimensional operators like PINNs and infinite-dimensional operators like DeepONets?

- Concept: Symbolic Regression and Genetic Programming
  - Why needed here: This is the proposed method for creating interpretable models from neural PDE solvers
  - Quick check question: How does symbolic regression differ from traditional regression, and what role does the fitness function play in the evolutionary process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Neural PDE Solver Core -> Symbolic Regression Module -> Human-Readable Mathematical Expression
  Training Pipeline (Joint/Sequential) -> Evaluation Framework (Accuracy + Interpretability)

- Critical path:
  1. Train neural PDE solver to convergence on target PDE problems
  2. Generate sufficient solver output data across diverse inputs
  3. Apply symbolic regression to extract mathematical expressions
  4. Validate symbolic expressions against known physics and numerical solutions
  5. Iterate on architecture if interpretability or accuracy falls below thresholds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedded vs. Post-hoc: Embedded approaches may provide better integration but increase model complexity; post-hoc approaches are simpler but may miss subtle relationships
  - Search Space Complexity: Balancing expressive power of symbolic expressions against computational tractability
  - Accuracy vs. Interpretability: More interpretable forms may sacrifice some predictive performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Symbolic regression fails to converge to meaningful expressions (overly complex or trivial results)
  - Physical inconsistencies between neural predictions and derived symbolic expressions
  - Significant accuracy degradation when interpretability constraints are added
  - Computational overhead making the approach impractical for real-time applications

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply symbolic regression to a trained PINN on a simple PDE (e.g., heat equation) to verify basic feasibility
  2. Compare embedded vs. post-hoc symbolic regression approaches on a moderately complex PDE
  3. Evaluate physical coherence of derived expressions by testing them on boundary conditions not seen during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific integration strategies between neural PDE solvers and symbolic frameworks (like symbolic regression) show the most promise for maintaining both interpretability and predictive accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various approaches like interpreting neural ODEs using SINDy, symbolic metamodels, and Deep Polynomial Neural Networks, but notes that further integrations would benefit popular models like neural operators.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides examples of initial attempts but doesn't compare or evaluate different integration strategies, nor does it establish which approaches best balance interpretability with performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing multiple integration strategies across different neural PDE solvers (PINNs, DeepONets, FNOs) with metrics for both interpretability quality and predictive accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we quantify and measure interpretability in neural PDE solvers to establish benchmarks for comparing different symbolic integration approaches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes interpretability as crucial for trustworthiness and broader applicability, but doesn't provide concrete metrics for measuring interpretability in this context.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the importance of interpretability, it doesn't establish objective criteria for evaluating how interpretable a neural PDE solver is after symbolic integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of interpretability metrics specific to PDE solvers, such as equation simplicity measures, human evaluation studies, or formal verification of physical consistency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs when integrating symbolic frameworks with neural PDE solvers, and how do these affect real-world applicability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that key performance indicators like computational efficiency need to be assessed, but doesn't explore the specific trade-offs between interpretability and efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges computational efficiency as important but doesn't quantify how symbolic integration affects training/inference time or scalability across different problem sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking studies showing runtime performance, memory usage, and scaling behavior of various neural PDE solvers with and without symbolic integration across different PDE types and problem scales.

## Limitations
- The paper primarily provides a conceptual framework rather than empirical validation, with most claims supported by theoretical reasoning rather than demonstrated results
- The effectiveness of symbolic regression on complex PDE solutions remains unproven, and computational overhead could negate efficiency advantages
- The paper doesn't address how to handle cases where the underlying PDE solution cannot be expressed in a reasonably interpretable symbolic form

## Confidence
- High confidence: The interpretability challenge in neural PDE solvers is real and well-documented
- Medium confidence: Symbolic regression is a viable approach for creating interpretable models, based on successful applications in other domains
- Medium confidence: The proposed integration methods (embedded vs. post-hoc) are technically feasible, though their relative merits need empirical comparison
- Low confidence: The claim that interpretability will drive adoption in high-stakes applications, as this depends heavily on domain-specific requirements

## Next Checks
1. Implement symbolic regression on a trained PINN for the 1D heat equation and compare the derived symbolic expression against the analytical solution to establish baseline feasibility
2. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing embedded vs. post-hoc symbolic regression approaches on a nonlinear PDE, measuring both accuracy retention and interpretability quality
3. Test the physical coherence of derived expressions by evaluating them on boundary conditions not seen during training, and quantify any violations of conservation laws or symmetry principles
