# Network Wide Evacuation Traffic Prediction in a Rapidly Intensifying Hurricane from Traffic Detectors and Facebook Movement Data: A Deep Learning Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09498
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09498
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: DGCN-LSTM model achieves 93% accuracy for hurricane evacuation traffic prediction using transfer learning from regular traffic data

## Executive Summary
This study develops a deep learning model to predict network-wide traffic flow during hurricane evacuations by integrating traffic detector data and Facebook movement data. The Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (DGCN-LSTM) model captures both spatial and temporal patterns in traffic data. The approach uses transfer learning, first training on regular traffic patterns and then adapting to evacuation scenarios. For regular traffic conditions, the model achieves 95% accuracy (RMSE = 356) without Facebook data and 96% accuracy (RMSE = 320) with it. For hurricane evacuation periods, the model achieves 93% accuracy (RMSE = 393) when Facebook movement data is included.

## Method Summary
The study uses 766 traffic detectors from Florida interstates and Facebook movement data between county subdivisions during Hurricane Ian evacuation. A Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (DGCN-LSTM) model is trained on regular traffic data (May-August 2022) and then adapted to evacuation periods (September 26-27, 2022) using transfer learning. The model predicts traffic flow up to 6 hours in advance using 6-hour input sequences. Key features include time periods, weekday/weekend indicators, previous day statistics, distance to evacuation zones, and population under evacuation orders. The model is compared against LSTM, GCN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM baselines.

## Key Results
- DGCN-LSTM achieves 95% accuracy (RMSE = 356) for regular traffic without Facebook data
- Facebook movement data integration improves regular traffic accuracy to 96% (RMSE = 320)
- Transfer learning approach achieves 93% accuracy (RMSE = 393) for hurricane evacuation periods with Facebook data
- Model forecasts traffic up to 6 hours in advance, providing valuable insights for evacuation traffic management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning improves hurricane evacuation traffic prediction by adapting a model pre-trained on regular traffic patterns to capture evacuation-specific dynamics.
- Mechanism: The DGCN-LSTM model is first trained on regular traffic data to learn the network's spatial and temporal patterns. Then, the model's knowledge is transferred to evacuation periods by fine-tuning with evacuation-specific features like time to landfall and population under evacuation orders.
- Core assumption: Regular traffic and evacuation traffic share underlying network connectivity patterns, but differ in demand and temporal behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a transfer learning approach is adopted to adapt the model trained on regular traffic"
  - [section] "We first trained the DGCN-LSTM model with regular period data. Then we applied transfer learning approach to predict for evacuation period."
- Break condition: If the network structure or traffic flow patterns during evacuation are fundamentally different from regular periods, transfer learning may fail to capture critical evacuation-specific dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating Facebook movement data enhances prediction accuracy by providing real-time demand signals that correlate with highway traffic flow during evacuations.
- Mechanism: Facebook movement data is processed to generate hourly inflow and outflow counts at detector locations. These counts act as proxy evacuation demand indicators that complement detector-based flow measurements.
- Core assumption: Social media movement data is representative of actual highway usage patterns during evacuations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Adding Facebook movement data further reduces model's RMSE value to 393 and increases accuracy to 93%"
  - [section] "The movement data contains information regarding increased human movement through the transportation network, and it is representative of actual traffic flow dynamics in the network."
- Break condition: If Facebook user demographics or movement patterns are not representative of the general evacuating population, the model's accuracy could degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic graph convolution captures evolving congestion propagation patterns better than static graph representations.
- Mechanism: Edge weights in the adjacency matrix are updated at each timestep based on changes in travel time between detector pairs, allowing the model to learn how congestion spreads through the network.
- Core assumption: Travel time between detectors is a reliable indicator of network congestion state.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the dynamic graph convolution approach, weights of the graph were assigned based on changes in travel time between two detectors at each timestep."
  - [section] "The weighted adjacency matrix contains information of change in travel time between detector pairs for each time step."
- Break condition: If detector speed measurements are unreliable or missing during peak evacuation congestion, the dynamic graph representation may fail to accurately model congestion propagation.

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs where intersections are nodes and roads are edges, allowing spatial relationships to be modeled.
  - Quick check question: What does a node and edge represent in the traffic network graph used in this study?

- Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: Evacuation data is scarce, so pre-training on abundant regular traffic data and adapting to evacuation scenarios addresses the data limitation.
  - Quick check question: Why is transfer learning particularly useful for hurricane evacuation traffic prediction?

- Time Series Forecasting with Spatiotemporal Dependencies
  - Why needed here: Traffic patterns depend on both spatial relationships between detectors and temporal evolution of flow, requiring models that can capture both.
  - Quick check question: What are the two types of dependencies that need to be captured in traffic prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing → Dynamic Graph Convolution → LSTM → Transfer Learning Adaptation → Output

- Critical path:
  Input → Dynamic Graph Convolution → LSTM → Transfer Learning Adaptation → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using Facebook data improves accuracy but introduces dependency on third-party data availability
  - Transfer learning reduces data requirements but may limit model flexibility for unique evacuation scenarios
  - Dynamic graphs capture congestion propagation but require reliable speed measurements

- Failure signatures:
  - High RMSE values during evacuation periods despite good regular period performance
  - Degradation in model accuracy when Facebook data is unavailable
  - Overfitting to regular traffic patterns during transfer learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline DGCN-LSTM on regular traffic data only and evaluate on evacuation period without transfer learning
  2. Add Facebook movement data to the regular period training and compare performance
  3. Apply transfer learning with evacuation features and evaluate improvement in prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DGCN-LSTM model performance vary when trained and tested on data from multiple hurricanes instead of just Hurricane Ian?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that due to data scarcity, they only used 16 hours of daily movement data from Hurricane Ian and note that "the approach needs more testing with additional data from multiple hurricanes."
- Why unresolved: The study's findings are based on a single hurricane event, limiting the generalizability of the model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on data from multiple hurricanes with varying intensities, evacuation patterns, and geographic regions would provide a more robust evaluation of its performance and generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using actual population under mandatory evacuation orders instead of estimated data from social media on the model's accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention using "cumulative population under mandatory evacuation orders as input features from emergency management officials' Twitter accounts" and suggest that "The model performance should be evaluated if actual population under mandatory evacuation orders can be obtained to obtain more realistic scenario."
- Why unresolved: The study relies on social media data to estimate the population under mandatory evacuation orders, which may introduce inaccuracies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the model's performance using actual evacuation order data versus the estimated data from social media would determine the impact of data source accuracy on the model's predictions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model perform in predicting traffic during different phases of a hurricane (e.g., before landfall, during landfall, after landfall)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on predicting traffic during the evacuation period, but it does not explicitly analyze the model's performance across different phases of a hurricane.
- Why unresolved: The model's effectiveness in predicting traffic during various hurricane phases is not evaluated, which is crucial for comprehensive evacuation traffic management.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the model's predictions and accuracy during pre-landfall, landfall, and post-landfall periods would provide insights into its performance across different hurricane phases.

## Limitations
- Model performance depends heavily on the quality and availability of Facebook movement data
- Transfer learning assumes regular traffic patterns provide sufficient foundation for evacuation predictions
- Single hurricane evaluation limits generalizability across different storm intensities and evacuation scenarios

## Confidence

- Transfer learning mechanism: Medium-High (supported by clear methodology and performance gains)
- Facebook data integration: Medium (performance improvement is demonstrated but representativeness concerns remain)
- Dynamic graph convolution: Medium (complexity of congestion propagation modeling)

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on multiple hurricane events with varying intensities and evacuation patterns to assess robustness
2. Compare Facebook movement data representativeness against ground truth traffic counts across different demographic segments
3. Evaluate model performance when Facebook data is unavailable to quantify dependency on third-party data sources
