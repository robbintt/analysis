# On the Trustworthiness Landscape of State-of-the-art Generative Models: A Survey and Outlook

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16680
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16680
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Comprehensive investigation of trustworthiness issues in diffusion models and large language models across privacy, security, fairness, and responsibility dimensions.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines trustworthiness challenges in state-of-the-art generative models, focusing on diffusion models and large language models. The analysis spans four critical dimensions: privacy (data leakage and membership inference), security (adversarial and backdoor attacks), fairness (bias propagation), and responsibility (watermarking and authenticity verification). The paper identifies that larger models pose greater privacy risks, highlights vulnerabilities to various attack vectors, and provides practical mitigation strategies while pointing to promising research directions for enhancing model trustworthiness.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach to investigate trustworthiness issues in generative models. The methodology involves collecting and organizing existing research across four key dimensions: privacy, security, fairness, and responsibility. The analysis synthesizes findings from multiple studies to identify key threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. The survey then provides a comprehensive mapping of the trustworthiness landscape and offers practical recommendations for future research and secure deployment of generative models.

## Key Results
- Larger models exhibit stronger privacy leakage risks during both training and inference stages
- Diffusion models are susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks through multiple noisy input sampling
- Backdoor attacks on LLMs can be executed through multi-level data poisoning with varying stealthiness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Larger models exhibit stronger privacy leakage risks during both training and inference stages
- Mechanism: Larger models have greater capacity to memorize and reconstruct training data patterns, leading to higher susceptibility to data leakage attacks like gradient leakage, membership inference, and direct data reconstruction
- Core assumption: Model capacity directly correlates with memorization ability and vulnerability to attacks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "larger models pose greater risks" (privacy section)
  - [section] "These studies consistently revealed that larger models pose a higher risk of data leakage" (Section 3.2 Federated learning)
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss model size directly
- Break condition: If model size increase does not proportionally increase memorization capacity or if architectural changes mitigate this relationship

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gradient-based optimization can effectively generate adversarial examples for diffusion models by sampling multiple noisy versions
- Mechanism: By maximizing the collective loss across multiple noisy versions of an input, attackers can find perturbations that cause significant shifts in model output while maintaining imperceptibility
- Core assumption: Diffusion models' iterative denoising process can be exploited through gradient optimization across multiple noise samples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The visual input is typically continuous, enabling us to directly leverage gradient-based optimization algorithms" (Section 4.2 Adversarial Attack and Defense)
  - [section] "Liang et al. sampled multiple noisy versions of adversarial examples and simultaneously input these noise versions into the model, maximizing their collective loss" (Section 4.2)
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss adversarial attacks on diffusion models specifically
- Break condition: If diffusion models develop robust defenses against gradient-based optimization or if the iterative nature inherently limits attack effectiveness

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Backdoor attacks on LLMs can be effectively executed through data poisoning at multiple levels (character, word, sentence) with varying stealthiness
- Mechanism: By inserting triggers at different granularities and using sophisticated poisoning techniques, attackers can create persistent backdoors that survive fine-tuning and are difficult to detect
- Core assumption: Language models have sufficient capacity to learn associations between triggers and target behaviors even with limited poisoned data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat, which becomes even more severe as the models continue to scale in capability" (Section 4.4 Discussion)
  - [section] "Models trained on internet-scraped data are inherently more susceptible, as malicious data can stealthily permeate aggregated repositories" (Section 4.4)
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss backdoor attacks specifically
- Break condition: If fine-tuning becomes more effective at removing backdoors or if detection mechanisms improve significantly

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gradient leakage attacks in federated learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how attackers can reconstruct training data from gradients is fundamental to addressing privacy concerns in collaborative learning scenarios
  - Quick check question: How does the cosine similarity loss function improve the effectiveness of gradient leakage attacks?

- Concept: Membership inference attack methodologies
  - Why needed here: These attacks form the basis for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in generative models and can be repurposed for auditing model behavior
  - Quick check question: What metrics do membership inference attacks use to distinguish between training and non-training samples?

- Concept: Adversarial example generation techniques
  - Why needed here: Adversarial attacks represent a critical security threat that must be understood to develop robust defenses for generative models
  - Quick check question: How do targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks differ in their objectives and methodologies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Privacy analysis pipeline: Data leakage detection → Membership inference → Privacy-preserving training
  - Security assessment framework: Adversarial attack testing → Backdoor vulnerability scanning → Defense implementation
  - Fairness evaluation system: Bias detection → Mitigation strategies → Continuous monitoring
  - Responsibility verification: Watermarking implementation → Content authenticity checks → User awareness mechanisms

- Critical path: Model deployment → Threat assessment → Defense implementation → Continuous monitoring → User feedback integration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs utility: Stricter privacy measures may reduce model performance
  - Security vs efficiency: Stronger defenses may increase computational overhead
  - Fairness vs creativity: Bias mitigation may limit model's creative capabilities
  - Responsibility vs flexibility: Watermarking may constrain content generation

- Failure signatures:
  - Privacy: Data reconstruction from gradients, membership inference success
  - Security: Successful adversarial attacks, backdoor activation
  - Fairness: Persistent bias in generated content, failure in bias detection
  - Responsibility: Watermark evasion, content authenticity failures

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test gradient leakage vulnerability by implementing a simple reconstruction attack on a federated learning setup
  2. Evaluate membership inference attack effectiveness on a pre-trained diffusion model
  3. Assess backdoor insertion success rate using character-level poisoning in an LLM

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How much computational resources are required for data reconstruction attacks on diffusion models and large language models in realistic settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that current data reconstruction attacks rely on computationally burdensome brute-force generation of numerous candidates, making the severity of the threat uncertain under realistic settings
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that the computational expense associated with brute-force enumeration poses a significant obstacle, and it is unclear how much modification is needed to cause content to no longer be considered AI-generated
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies quantifying the computational resources and time required for successful data reconstruction attacks on state-of-the-art models under different realistic scenarios

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between utility and privacy in federated learning and split learning for generative models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that encryption methods require significant computational resources and that the aggregated results are still vulnerable to attacks, indicating a need to establish theoretical boundaries for privacy leakage
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights that the defenses are noticeably lagging behind the attacks and also produce a significant privacy-utility trade-off, and it is unclear whether adding more sophisticated interactive rules in the schemas can help circumvent the attacks
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis and empirical studies comparing the privacy-utility trade-offs of different defense mechanisms and interactive rules in federated learning and split learning for generative models

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we define fairness in AI models with detailed specifications that account for cultural and regional differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that ensuring lightweight data cleansing is crucial and that fairness may vary across different countries, regions, and cultures, indicating the need for consensus among multiple stakeholders
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that there is currently a scarcity of benchmark evaluation datasets and that defining fairness with detailed specifications is crucial, but it remains unclear how to achieve consensus among diverse stakeholders
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies and surveys involving diverse stakeholders from different cultural and regional backgrounds to develop comprehensive fairness guidelines and evaluation metrics for AI models

## Limitations
- Analysis based primarily on existing literature rather than empirical validation
- Rapidly evolving nature of generative models means some identified risks may become obsolete
- Interconnections between trustworthiness dimensions remain largely qualitative

## Confidence
- **High**: Well-established risks like membership inference attacks and adversarial examples have extensive empirical support across multiple studies
- **Medium**: Claims about backdoor attacks and bias propagation are supported by growing evidence but lack standardized evaluation metrics
- **Low**: Future research directions and mitigation strategy effectiveness remain largely speculative due to limited real-world deployment data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing privacy leakage across models of varying sizes to quantify the relationship between model capacity and vulnerability to data reconstruction attacks
2. Design a framework to evaluate how privacy vulnerabilities interact with security weaknesses, measuring whether compromising one dimension increases risks in others
3. Implement a longitudinal study tracking actual incidents of trustworthiness violations in deployed generative models to validate survey predictions against observed failure modes
