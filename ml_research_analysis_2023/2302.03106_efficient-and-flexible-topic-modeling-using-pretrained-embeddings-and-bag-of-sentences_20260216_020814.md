# Efficient and Flexible Topic Modeling using Pretrained Embeddings and Bag of Sentences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.03106
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03106
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Novel topic modeling approach using pretrained sentence embeddings outperforms state-of-the-art models on coherence, diversity, and clustering tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel topic modeling approach that leverages pretrained sentence embeddings and performs hard assignments of entire sentences to topics. The model uses a bag-of-sentences framework with expectation-maximization inference and annealing to achieve better topic coherence and diversity than traditional methods like LDA. By treating sentences as semantic units rather than individual words, the approach reduces noise and fragmentation while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method uses pretrained sentence embeddings to represent both sentences and topics as vectors in semantic space. An EM algorithm with hard sentence-to-topic assignments iteratively refines topic vectors and sentence assignments. The annealing process allows flexible assignments early on, gradually stabilizing as the model converges. Topic-word relevance is scored using a combination of raw frequency and relative relevance across topics, producing interpretable results while maintaining modest computational requirements.

## Key Results
- Outperforms LDA on topic coherence (PMI) and diversity metrics
- Shows improved performance on downstream clustering tasks (NMI)
- Requires significantly less computation time than traditional topic models
- Achieves better topic separation and interpretability through hard sentence assignments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hard sentence-to-topic assignments with annealing outperform soft word assignments in topic coherence and diversity. By assigning entire sentences to single topics rather than individual words to multiple topics, the model reduces semantic noise and topic fragmentation. The annealing process allows early flexibility while gradually stabilizing assignments to prevent premature topic locking.

### Mechanism 2
Pretrained sentence embeddings provide richer semantic representations than bag-of-words models. Sentence transformers capture contextual relationships between words, allowing the model to measure semantic similarity between sentences and topics using dot product similarity. This captures meaning beyond simple word frequency.

### Mechanism 3
EM-based inference with frequency-based word scoring produces interpretable topic-word rankings. The scoring function combines raw frequency (damped by square root) with relative relevance across topics. This balances common topical words against discriminative terms that are more specific to individual topics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Expectation-Maximization algorithm
  - Why needed here: The inference relies on alternating between estimating sentence-topic assignments (E-step) and updating topic vectors based on those assignments (M-step)
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between hard assignments used here versus soft assignments in standard LDA?

- **Concept**: Sentence embeddings and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: The model depends on measuring similarity between sentence vectors and topic vectors using dot product to determine topic assignments
  - Quick check question: Why might pretrained sentence embeddings be more effective than word embeddings for this application?

- **Concept**: Topic coherence metrics (PMI, diversity)
  - Why needed here: Evaluation requires understanding how to measure whether topics are semantically coherent and cover diverse content
  - Quick check question: How does topic diversity differ from topic coherence, and why are both important?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sentence tokenizer → Sentence transformer → EM inference loop → Topic vector computation → Word scoring → Output
- **Critical path**: Tokenization → Embedding computation → EM iterations → Topic vector updates → Word scoring
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hard vs soft assignments (simplicity vs flexibility), full corpus EM vs mini-batch (accuracy vs speed), frequency vs TF-IDF scoring (simplicity vs sophistication)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor topic coherence suggests embedding quality issues or inappropriate α values; slow convergence suggests need for more aggressive annealing; degenerate topics suggest sentence segmentation problems
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run with default parameters on a small corpus and visualize topic-word distributions to verify basic functionality
  2. Vary α to see how topic-document concentration affects topic quality and interpretability
  3. Compare PMI and diversity scores against LDA baseline on the same corpus to validate improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed Bag of Sentences model compare to other topic modeling approaches when applied to very short texts, such as tweets or single sentences? The authors mention that LDA and similar models struggle with short texts and propose their BoS model as an alternative, but they do not explicitly compare their model's performance on very short texts.

### Open Question 2
Can the proposed Bag of Sentences model be extended to handle multi-lingual corpora or incorporate domain-specific knowledge? The authors mention that their model leverages pre-trained sentence embeddings, which could potentially be adapted for multi-lingual corpora, but they do not discuss incorporating domain-specific knowledge.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the proposed Bag of Sentences model to the choice of pre-trained sentence embedding model and hyperparameters? The authors mention using sentenceBERT as their pre-trained sentence embedding model and provide details on their hyperparameter settings, but they do not explore the impact of using different embedding models or hyperparameter configurations.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks empirical validation of the core assumption that hard sentence assignments are superior to soft word assignments through direct ablation studies.
- Claims about sentence embeddings capturing "richer semantic representations" than bag-of-words are weakly supported with no direct comparative evidence.
- The annealing schedule's impact is not thoroughly explored - only a single fixed schedule is used without sensitivity analysis.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of EM inference with sentence embeddings is sound and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results showing improved coherence and diversity are promising but limited to two datasets
- **Low confidence**: Claims about specific advantages of hard sentence assignments over other approaches lack direct comparative evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study by running the model with word-level hard assignments instead of sentence-level to isolate the effect of the sentence-based approach versus the hard assignment mechanism itself.

2. Perform sensitivity analysis by systematically varying the annealing schedule parameters (initial value, decay rate) to determine their impact on topic quality and convergence speed.

3. Test the model on diverse corpora including scientific papers, social media posts, and conversational text to verify that the sentence embedding approach generalizes beyond news and forum datasets.
