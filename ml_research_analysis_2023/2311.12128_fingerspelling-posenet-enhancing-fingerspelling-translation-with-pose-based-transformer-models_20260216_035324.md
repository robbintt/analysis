# Fingerspelling PoseNet: Enhancing Fingerspelling Translation with Pose-Based Transformer Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12128
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12128
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 66.3% and 71.1% letter accuracy on ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets respectively, exceeding state-of-the-art by over 10% relative improvement

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for American Sign Language fingerspelling translation that leverages hand pose estimation as input. The method incorporates a novel length prediction token and a two-stage inference approach with re-ranking to achieve state-of-the-art performance on fingerspelling datasets. By predicting word length during training and using decoder-based re-ranking during inference, the approach addresses key challenges in translating unsegmented fingerspelling sequences in real-world conditions.

## Method Summary
The method extracts hand pose sequences (21 keypoints) from video using MediaPipe Holistic, normalizes them, and feeds them into a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder includes a learnable length prediction token that estimates word length using MSE loss. The model is trained with CTC loss, cross-entropy loss, and length prediction loss. During inference, CTC beam search generates hypotheses which are then re-ranked using the decoder's language model probabilities combined with length prediction.

## Key Results
- Achieves 66.3% letter accuracy on ChicagoFSWild dataset
- Achieves 71.1% letter accuracy on ChicagoFSWild+ dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models by over 10% relative improvement
- Demonstrates effectiveness of length prediction token in reducing deletion errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Transformer self-attention captures temporal dependencies
- Claim: The transformer encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range dependencies and contextual information in fingerspelling sequences.
- Mechanism: Self-attention allows each pose token to attend to all other poses, modeling temporal and spatial relationships between hand gestures.
- Core assumption: Hand pose sequences contain sufficient information to reconstruct letters and words without needing raw RGB frames.
- Evidence anchors: The encoder takes in pose sequences and uses self-attention to capture contextual information within the pose sequence.

### Mechanism 2: Length prediction token provides word boundary information
- Claim: The length prediction token improves translation accuracy by providing explicit word boundary information.
- Mechanism: A learnable token predicts word length during training, helping the model anticipate letter count and reduce errors.
- Core assumption: Word length information is learnable from pose sequences and provides useful inductive bias for translation.
- Evidence anchors: The length prediction token is mapped to a vector using a fully connected layer to predict the number of letters in the word.

### Mechanism 3: Two-stage re-ranking leverages language model
- Claim: The two-stage re-ranking inference leverages both CTC and language model probabilities to improve hypothesis selection.
- Mechanism: CTC beam search generates hypotheses, then decoder re-ranks them using language model probability and length prediction.
- Core assumption: The decoder's language model captures valid letter sequences and can distinguish correct from incorrect hypotheses.
- Evidence anchors: The re-ranking uses both language model capabilities and contextualized features from the encoder with specific weighting parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hand pose estimation and normalization
  - Why needed here: The model uses hand landmarks as input rather than raw video frames
  - Quick check question: How do you normalize hand landmarks when the signer uses their left hand instead of their right hand?

- Concept: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
  - Why needed here: CTC handles unsegmented sequences where alignment between poses and letters is unknown
  - Quick check question: What does the CTC loss function optimize when training the encoder?

- Concept: Transformer self-attention and positional encoding
  - Why needed here: The model needs to capture temporal dependencies while maintaining gesture order
  - Quick check question: How does the model ensure the transformer understands the temporal order of hand poses?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pose estimation → Normalization → Encoder (with length token) → CTC beam search → Decoder re-ranking → Output
- Critical path: Pose estimation → Normalization → Encoder (with length token) → CTC beam search → Decoder re-ranking → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pose-based vs. RGB-based: Pose is more robust to background variations but depends on pose estimation accuracy
  - Encoder-only vs. Encoder-decoder: Encoder-only with CTC is faster but encoder-decoder can better model language structure
  - Length prediction: Adds small computational overhead but significantly improves accuracy
- Failure signatures:
  - High deletion rate: May indicate issues with length prediction or pose estimation
  - High substitution rate: Could suggest the model is confusing similar letters
  - Missing hand poses: Will cause complete failure since model relies entirely on pose input
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train encoder-only with CTC loss only, measure letter accuracy without decoder
  2. Add length prediction token, measure impact on deletion rate
  3. Implement re-ranking inference, compare performance against CTC-only decoding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Fingerspelling PoseNet compare to other state-of-the-art models when evaluated on different datasets?
- Basis in paper: The paper states their method outperforms existing SOTA models on ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how performance would generalize to other datasets or real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on additional datasets or real-world data to evaluate generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of pose estimation method affect the performance of the Fingerspelling PoseNet?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions different pose estimation methods like OpenPose and MediaPipe can be employed.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights, it does not provide comprehensive analysis of how pose estimation choice affects overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different pose estimation methods and comparing their impact.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Fingerspelling PoseNet handle variations in signing speed and style among different signers?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions variations in speed, hand appearance, and motion variations in real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges these challenges, it does not provide detailed analysis of how the model specifically handles these variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with signers of different speeds and styles to evaluate performance.

## Limitations

- Lack of detailed architectural specifications including embedding dimensions, feed-forward network sizes, and positional encoding implementation details
- No ablation studies isolating the contribution of each proposed component (length prediction token, two-stage inference, transformer architecture)
- Experimental validation limited to two specific datasets without comprehensive generalization testing

## Confidence

- Medium confidence in core claims: Performance improvements are statistically significant and reproducible in principle
- Low confidence in exact mechanisms: Lack of architectural detail and comprehensive ablation studies introduces uncertainty
- Medium confidence in practical applicability: Pose-based approach shows promise but real-world robustness needs further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Implement and test versions of the model with (a) encoder-only with CTC loss only, (b) encoder-decoder without length prediction token, (c) encoder-decoder without re-ranking inference. Measure incremental improvement from each component.

2. **Pose estimation robustness**: Evaluate model performance across varying levels of pose estimation accuracy by adding synthetic noise to hand landmarks or using different pose estimators (MediaPipe vs. OpenPose). This validates pose-based methods are more robust than RGB-based approaches.

3. **Length prediction reliability**: Analyze correlation between predicted word lengths and actual word lengths across different word lengths and frequencies. Test whether length prediction token consistently reduces deletion errors, particularly for longer words where accuracy degradation is more pronounced.
