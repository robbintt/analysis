# Legal Syllogism Prompting: Teaching Large Language Models for Legal Judgment Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08321
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08321
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Legal Syllogism Prompting (LoT) outperforms baseline and chain-of-thought prompting for legal judgment prediction on CAIL2018 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Legal Syllogism Prompting (LoT), a zero-shot prompting method that teaches large language models to predict legal judgments by structuring reasoning according to the legal syllogism framework. LoT instructs models that the major premise is law, the minor premise is fact, and the conclusion is judgment. Experiments on the CAIL2018 dataset with GPT-3 models show LoT achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods while providing interpretable reasoning steps. The method demonstrates improved selectivity and sensitivity in identifying relevant facts and distinguishing charges compared to other approaches.

## Method Summary
Legal Syllogism Prompting reformulates legal judgment prediction as a text generation task using the legal syllogism framework. The method takes raw case facts as input and applies a structured prompt that instructs the model to generate reasoning in three parts: major premise (law article), minor premise (relevant facts), and conclusion (judgment). This zero-shot approach requires no fine-tuning or examples, relying instead on the LLM's emergent reasoning capabilities. The output provides both the judgment and interpretable justification through the generated reasoning steps.

## Key Results
- LoT achieves higher micro accuracy for charge prediction on CAIL2018 dataset compared to baseline and chain-of-thought prompting
- The method enables models to predict judgments along with applicable law articles and justifications
- LoT demonstrates better selectivity by focusing on facts relevant to the stated law, reducing irrelevant context
- Generated structured reasoning enhances model explainability compared to traditional classification approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Legal Syllogism Prompting activates deductive reasoning by explicitly structuring the input as law→fact→judgment.
- Mechanism: The prompt instructs the model to treat the major premise as law, minor premise as fact, and conclusion as judgment, mirroring the legal syllogism framework. This explicit structural guidance channels the model's reasoning toward a deductive chain rather than open-ended generation.
- Core assumption: The LLM's zero-shot reasoning capability can be directed by a simple declarative prompt that maps to a known logical form.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LoT teaches only that in the legal syllogism the major premise is law, the minor premise is the fact, and the conclusion is judgment."
  - [section 3.2] "We add prompts to modify the input X into X′ as the following template: In the legal syllogism, the major premise is the law article, the minor premise is the fact of the case, and the conclusion is the judgment of case."
- Break condition: If the model cannot reliably parse the legal text or distinguish law from fact, the syllogism structure collapses and reasoning fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LoT improves selectivity by forcing the model to focus only on facts relevant to the stated law.
- Mechanism: By fixing the major premise first, the minor premise generation is constrained to facts that directly support or relate to that law, filtering out irrelevant context that might mislead judgment.
- Core assumption: LLMs can use the major premise as a relevance filter when generating the minor premise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Selectivity is the ability to concentrate on relevant parts of making decisions... For a theft case example, Zero-shot CoT outputted as below: 1. A saw B put his phone... 2. A surrendered to the police... 3. B issued a letter... Conclusion: A constitutes the crimes of theft and surrender. It may lead to errors in judgment. For LoT, due to the existence of the major premise, the minor premise will only contain facts related to the law article in the major premise."
- Break condition: If the law premise is vague or ambiguous, the model may still include irrelevant facts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LoT enhances explainability by producing structured, interpretable reasoning steps that mirror legal argumentation.
- Mechanism: The output format (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) is inherently interpretable and aligns with how legal professionals document reasoning, making post-hoc verification possible.
- Core assumption: Human-readable structured outputs are more trustworthy and useful for legal validation than opaque classification scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method enables LLMs to predict judgment along with law articles and justification, which significantly enhances the explainability of models."
  - [section 3.2] "Our method can generate both the reasoning process and the conclusion. The reasoning process can be used as an explanation of the conclusion for post hoc verification."
- Break condition: If the model generates incorrect or nonsensical law articles, the explanation becomes misleading despite its structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Legal syllogism (major premise = law, minor premise = fact, conclusion = judgment)
  - Why needed here: The prompt is built entirely around this framework; without understanding it, the reasoning steps are meaningless.
  - Quick check question: In a theft case, what should the major premise contain? (Answer: The applicable law article defining theft.)

- Concept: Zero-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: LoT is a zero-shot method that relies on the LLM's emergent reasoning ability without examples.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes LoT from Zero-shot CoT? (Answer: LoT uses legal syllogism structure; Zero-shot CoT uses generic step-by-step reasoning.)

- Concept: Text classification vs. text generation in NLP
  - Why needed here: LoT reformulates LJP from a classification task to a generation task, enabling structured outputs.
  - Quick check question: Why is generating law and fact text better than outputting a label? (Answer: It provides interpretability and aligns with legal reasoning.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input case facts -> Legal syllogism prompt template -> GPT-3 LLM -> Structured reasoning output -> Extract judgment
- Critical path:
  1. Receive case facts
  2. Apply LoT prompt template
  3. Generate structured output
  4. Extract and validate judgment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. completeness: LoT is zero-shot but may miss nuanced legal interpretations that fine-tuning could capture.
  - Interpretability vs. accuracy: Structured outputs are interpretable but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to black-box classifiers.
  - Prompt length vs. cost: Longer prompts may improve reasoning but increase token usage and cost.
- Failure signatures:
  - Model outputs irrelevant tokens (e.g., evidence, trial staff) → likely due to prompt ambiguity or model confusion.
  - Generated law articles are incorrect or non-existent → indicates model lacks precise legal knowledge.
  - Conclusion mismatches the facts → suggests poor fact-to-law alignment in reasoning.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Input case facts directly, ask for judgment only → measure accuracy drop vs. LoT.
  2. Zero-shot CoT: Add "Let's think step by step" prompt → compare reasoning quality and accuracy to LoT.
  3. Multi-LLM test: Run LoT on text-davinci-001, -002, -003 → identify model capability thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions.

## Limitations
- Method effectiveness is demonstrated only on Chinese criminal cases from CAIL2018 dataset, limiting generalizability to other legal domains
- Generated law articles may be incorrect or non-existent, potentially misleading despite structured explanations
- Performance improvements are demonstrated through qualitative analysis rather than systematic quantitative error rate comparisons

## Confidence
- High confidence: LoT's basic operational mechanism and ability to generate structured outputs
- Medium confidence: Claim that LoT outperforms Zero-shot CoT on CAIL2018 dataset
- Low confidence: Generalizability of LoT's performance improvements to other legal domains or languages

## Next Checks
1. Test LoT on a different legal dataset (e.g., European civil law cases) to assess cross-jurisdiction transferability
2. Conduct a human evaluation study comparing the trustworthiness of LoT's structured explanations versus baseline model outputs
3. Measure token efficiency and cost per accurate prediction to evaluate practical deployment viability
