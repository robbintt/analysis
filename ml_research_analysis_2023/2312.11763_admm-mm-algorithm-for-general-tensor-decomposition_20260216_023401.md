# ADMM-MM Algorithm for General Tensor Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.11763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11763
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposes ADMM-MM algorithm for general tensor decomposition with 21.6 dB SNR improvement in image denoising

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified optimization algorithm for general tensor decomposition formulated as an inverse problem with linear observation models. The proposed ADMM-MM algorithm supports three loss functions (ℓ2, ℓ1, and KL divergence) and various low-rank tensor decomposition models (CP, Tucker, TT, and TR). By hierarchically combining alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) frameworks, the algorithm achieves efficient and stable minimization of objective functions compared to projected gradient and block coordinate descent methods.

## Method Summary
The algorithm solves tensor decomposition problems by first addressing the ℓ2-loss case using least-squares-based tensor decomposition (LS-based TD) with the MM framework. It then extends this solution to ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases using the ADMM framework by introducing auxiliary variables and applying proximal operators. The method is designed to be plug-and-play, allowing easy extension to any established tensor decomposition model as long as the least-squares solution can be derived.

## Key Results
- Achieves 21.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement for salt-and-pepper noise reduction in image reconstruction
- Successfully applies to noise reduction, robust tensor decomposition with missing entries, and computed tomography
- Demonstrates efficient and stable minimization compared to projected gradient and block coordinate descent methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ADMM-MM algorithm achieves efficient and stable minimization by hierarchically combining ADMM and MM frameworks.
- Mechanism: The algorithm first uses MM to solve the ℓ2-loss case, which can be efficiently handled by existing LS-based TD algorithms. Then, ADMM is used to extend this solution to ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases by introducing auxiliary variables and applying proximal operators.
- Core assumption: The ℓ2-loss case can be efficiently solved by existing LS-based TD algorithms, and the ADMM framework can effectively handle the ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases by introducing auxiliary variables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed algorithm supports three basic loss functions (ℓ2-loss, ℓ1-loss and KL divergence) and various low-rank tensor decomposition models (CP, Tucker, TT, and TR decompositions). We derive the optimization algorithm based on hierarchical combination of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM)."
  - [section] "In this study, we first solve the case of ℓ2-loss using LS-based TD with MM framework. Furthermore, we use it to solve the cases of ℓ1-loss and KL divergence with ADMM framework."
- Break condition: If the ℓ2-loss case cannot be efficiently solved by existing LS-based TD algorithms, or if the ADMM framework cannot effectively handle the ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The algorithm can be easily extended to any established tensor decomposition models in a plug-and-play manner.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses a general optimization framework that can be applied to any TD model as long as the least-squares solution can be derived. This allows for easy extension to new TD models by replacing the LS-based TD module.
- Core assumption: Any established tensor decomposition model has a well-defined least-squares solution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that wide-range applications can be solved by the proposed algorithm, and can be easily extended to any established tensor decomposition models in a plug-and-play manner."
  - [section] "By replacing the module of LS-based TD, various types of TD can be easily generalized and applied to various applications."
- Break condition: If a new TD model does not have a well-defined least-squares solution, the algorithm cannot be easily extended to it.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The algorithm achieves significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio for image reconstruction tasks.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses a unified optimization framework that can handle various loss functions and TD models, allowing it to effectively reduce noise and improve image quality in reconstruction tasks.
- Core assumption: The unified optimization framework can effectively reduce noise and improve image quality in reconstruction tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It demonstrates successful application to image reconstruction tasks including noise reduction, robust tensor decomposition with missing entries, and computed tomography, achieving significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., 21.6 dB for salt-and-pepper noise reduction)."
  - [section] "Fig. 5 shows the results of image processing tasks: noise reduction for various distributions, robust TD with missing entries, and computed tomography."
- Break condition: If the unified optimization framework cannot effectively reduce noise or improve image quality in reconstruction tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor decompositions (TDs)
  - Why needed here: The algorithm is designed for general tensor decomposition problems, so a solid understanding of TDs is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between CP, Tucker, TT, and TR decompositions?

- Concept: Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)
  - Why needed here: ADMM is a key component of the algorithm, used to handle ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases.
  - Quick check question: How does ADMM differ from standard gradient descent methods?

- Concept: Majorization-minimization (MM) framework
  - Why needed here: MM is used to solve the ℓ2-loss case efficiently using existing LS-based TD algorithms.
  - Quick check question: What is the main idea behind the MM framework, and how does it ensure convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Observed signal b, design matrix A, tensor decomposition model S, loss function type, trade-off parameter α, penalty parameter β
  - Core components:
    - MM module: Solves ℓ2-loss case using existing LS-based TD algorithms
    - ADMM module: Extends solution to ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases using auxiliary variables and proximal operators
    - LS-based TD module: Can be replaced by any established TD algorithm in a plug-and-play manner
  - Output: Optimized tensor decomposition

- Critical path: Input → MM module → ADMM module → LS-based TD module → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. efficiency: The algorithm is highly flexible and can handle various loss functions and TD models, but this comes at the cost of some computational overhead.
  - Plug-and-play vs. custom solutions: The algorithm can be easily extended to new TD models, but custom solutions may be more efficient for specific cases.

- Failure signatures:
  - Slow convergence: May indicate that the LS-based TD module is not well-suited for the specific problem or that the penalty parameters are not well-tuned.
  - Poor reconstruction quality: May indicate that the chosen loss function or TD model is not appropriate for the specific problem.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the algorithm to a simple image denoising task using CP decomposition and ℓ2-loss.
  2. Extend the algorithm to handle missing data in a tensor completion task using Tucker decomposition and ℓ1-loss.
  3. Apply the algorithm to a computed tomography reconstruction task using TR decomposition and KL divergence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the convergence properties of the proposed ADMM-MM algorithm be proven for ℓ1-loss and KL-divergence cases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "In cases of ℓ1-loss and KL-loss, we have no result of convergence. Usually the convergence of ADMM is based on the non-expansive property of projection onto convex set or proximal mapping of convex function. In the proposed algorithm, LS-based TD is a projection onto non-convex set and it does not match above condition."
- Why unresolved: The proposed algorithm uses ADMM combined with MM framework where the MM step involves projection onto a non-convex set (low-rank tensor space), which violates typical convergence conditions for ADMM.
- What evidence would resolve it: Rigorous mathematical proof showing either (1) convergence properties for ADMM when the proximal operator is non-convex, or (2) empirical convergence guarantees under specific conditions for the proposed algorithm.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed algorithm be extended to support other loss functions beyond ℓ2, ℓ1, and KL divergence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "wide-range applications can be solved by the proposed algorithm, and can be easily extended to any established tensor decomposition models in a plug-and-play manner" and discusses hierarchical combination of ADMM and MM frameworks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates three loss functions, the hierarchical structure suggests potential for other loss functions, but this is not explored or proven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal proof of conditions under which new loss functions can be incorporated, along with empirical validation showing successful application to at least one additional loss function.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of MM iterations to use within each ADMM iteration for different tensor decomposition models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "it is inefficient to perform a full TD in each iteration, and the projection onto S is usually replaced by one iteration of ALS" and discusses using one cycle of ALS/HALS updates.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a single MM iteration within each ADMM iteration as a heuristic, but doesn't investigate the trade-off between computational efficiency and convergence speed for different TD models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing convergence rates and final objective values for different numbers of MM iterations across various TD models (CP, Tucker, TT, TR) and problem settings.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed implementation specifications for the LS-based TD module across different decomposition models
- Limited experimental validation across diverse problem settings and statistical analysis
- No thorough computational complexity analysis compared to specialized algorithms

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The hierarchical combination of ADMM and MM frameworks is technically sound and the convergence analysis for the ℓ2-loss case is rigorous. The plug-and-play extensibility to different TD models is well-supported by the theoretical framework.
- Medium Confidence: The claimed improvements in image reconstruction tasks are based on empirical results but lack extensive statistical validation. The extension to ℓ1-loss and KL divergence cases through ADMM is conceptually valid but requires more detailed convergence analysis.
- Low Confidence: The paper claims "significant improvements" over existing methods without providing comprehensive benchmarks across diverse problem types and parameter settings. The computational efficiency claims need more rigorous analysis.

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence verification**: Implement the algorithm for CP and Tucker decompositions and systematically verify convergence rates across different noise levels and regularization parameters, comparing with theoretical convergence bounds.
2. **Computational complexity analysis**: Measure actual runtime and memory usage for the ADMM-MM algorithm versus specialized TD algorithms (PG, BCD) on large-scale problems, particularly focusing on how the hierarchical structure affects scalability.
3. **Robustness testing**: Evaluate the algorithm's performance on diverse tensor structures (varying ranks, dimensions, and sparsity patterns) to identify failure modes and determine the limits of the plug-and-play approach across different TD models.
