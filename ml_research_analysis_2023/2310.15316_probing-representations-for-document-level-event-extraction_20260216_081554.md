# Probing Representations for Document-level Event Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15316
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Probing classifiers reveal that document-level IE encoders modestly improve argument detection but struggle with document length and cross-sentence discourse.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how representations learned by document-level information extraction models encode different types of information through probing classifiers. The authors designed eight probing tasks to assess surface, semantic, and event-understanding capabilities of representations from three different LLM-based document-level IE approaches. Their analysis reveals that while trained encoders can improve argument detection and labeling, they struggle with document-level tasks requiring cross-sentence understanding and coherence.

## Method Summary
The authors train three document-level IE frameworks (DyGIE++, GTT, TANL) on MUC datasets and capture encoder outputs at different training epochs. They then train probing classifiers on these embeddings for eight tasks: word/sentence counts, argument detection, argument typing, coreference, event typing, co-event relations, and event counts. The study compares full-text versus sentence-level contextualization and analyzes performance across training epochs and encoder layers.

## Key Results
- Trained encoder embeddings modestly improve argument detection and labeling tasks compared to untrained baselines
- Encoder models struggle with document length constraints and cross-sentence discourse understanding
- Different IE frameworks encode varying types of information, with trade-offs between semantic understanding and event prediction capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Probing tasks reveal how encoder representations evolve during document-level IE training, showing trade-offs between different information types. By testing encoder outputs at different training epochs with simplified classifiers, we can measure how much semantic, event, and surface information is encoded. The core assumption is that probing classifier performance directly reflects information content in embeddings. Evidence shows embedded semantic and event information fluctuate during training but differ from untrained baselines. Break conditions include probing classifiers being too weak or training fundamentally altering representation spaces.

### Mechanism 2
Full-text contextualization may be less effective than sentence-level contextualization for document-level IE tasks. When BERT-based encoders process entire documents, they may struggle with long-range dependencies and cross-sentence discourse, while sentence-level processing preserves local coherence better. The assumption is that attention mechanisms and positional embeddings aren't optimized for very long sequences. Evidence shows encoder models struggle with document length and cross-sentence discourse, and sentence concatenation can be more effective for IE tasks. Break conditions include modified architectures better handling long sequences or document-level pretraining.

### Mechanism 3
Different IE frameworks encode different types of information in their representations, leading to varying performance across probing tasks. Architectural choices and training objectives result in representations emphasizing different aspects of document understanding. The assumption is that probing task performance differences reflect genuine differences in encoded information. Evidence highlights strengths and weaknesses of encoders trained using different frameworks. Break conditions include probing tasks not being sensitive enough to capture differences or differences stemming from factors beyond architectural choices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Probing classifiers and their use in NLP interpretability
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to design and interpret probing tasks is crucial for analyzing encoder representations
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between sentence-level and document-level probing tasks, and why does this matter for event extraction?

- **Concept**: Document-level information extraction challenges
  - Why needed here: Understanding specific challenges helps interpret probing results and design better models
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between sentence-level and document-level event extraction, and how do these differences manifest in probing results?

- **Concept**: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding how transformers process long sequences is crucial for interpreting why full-text contextualization may be less effective
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in transformers behave differently when processing long documents versus individual sentences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Document-level IE frameworks (DyGIE++, GTT, TANL) -> Probing task classifiers for different information types -> Analysis pipeline that trains models, captures encoder outputs, and runs probing tasks
- **Critical path**: Train IE framework → Capture encoder outputs → Run probing tasks → Analyze results across epochs and layers
- **Design tradeoffs**: Full-text vs. sentence-level contextualization trades cross-sentence coherence for better local processing; different frameworks trade architectural complexity for specific strengths in information encoding
- **Failure signatures**: Poor probing performance may indicate encoder struggles with document length, cross-sentence discourse, or specific information type; inconsistent results across epochs may indicate training instability
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare probing performance of untrained vs. trained BERT on simple surface information task to establish baseline improvements
  2. Test full-text vs. sentence-level contextualization on semantic understanding task to confirm trade-off
  3. Compare probing performance across different IE frameworks on event detection task to identify architectural strengths and weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the effectiveness of probing tasks vary across different document-level IE datasets? The paper focused on MUC dataset and briefly discussed WikiEvents, but notes WikiEvents is smaller with limitations. A comparative analysis across multiple document-level IE datasets would provide insights into generalizability.

### Open Question 2
What are the specific challenges of using probing tasks to assess document-level IE models compared to sentence-level IE models? While the paper identifies document-level IE as a new area for probing tasks and mentions some challenges, it doesn't provide a detailed comparison of challenges when applying probing tasks to document-level versus sentence-level models.

### Open Question 3
How do different pre-trained models (e.g., BERT vs. T5) affect the performance of document-level IE models in the context of probing tasks? The paper discusses use of BERT and T5 models in different IE frameworks and notes performance differences, but doesn't extensively explore how these differences manifest in probing tasks.

## Limitations

- Probing task design may not fully capture complex encoder representations, particularly for higher-level event understanding
- 512-token limit for BERT-based models creates significant constraint for document-level tasks, potentially truncating important context
- Probing tasks focus primarily on English datasets (MUC-3/4, WikiEvents), limiting generalizability to other languages and domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Encoder embeddings modestly improve argument detection and labeling compared to untrained baselines (well-supported by direct experimental evidence)
- **Medium Confidence**: Different IE frameworks encode different types of information (reasonable support from comparative analysis, though probing tasks may not be sufficiently sensitive)
- **Low Confidence**: Full-text contextualization is less effective than sentence-level processing for document-level IE tasks (requires additional validation, evidence is primarily indirect)

## Next Checks

1. **Probing Task Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies by removing individual probing tasks to determine if observed differences between frameworks are robust across all eight tasks or driven by a subset of tasks.

2. **Cross-Lingual Generalization**: Apply the same probing methodology to multilingual document-level IE datasets to verify whether observed limitations with document length and cross-sentence discourse generalize beyond English.

3. **Architectural Modifications**: Test modified transformer architectures with hierarchical attention or sliding window approaches to determine if document length limitations are fundamental or can be overcome with architectural changes.
