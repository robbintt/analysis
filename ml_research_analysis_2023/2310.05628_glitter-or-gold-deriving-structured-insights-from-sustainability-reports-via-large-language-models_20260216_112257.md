# Glitter or Gold? Deriving Structured Insights from Sustainability Reports via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05628
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-based triple extraction from sustainability reports generates structured ESG insights that correlate strongly with ESG ratings

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of extracting structured ESG insights from unstructured sustainability reports using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core method employs LLMs with in-context learning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract semantically structured triples (category-predicate-object) from reports. These triples are then used to generate knowledge graphs and perform bipartite graph analyses. The study extracted over 500 ESG categories, revealing a wide range of topics beyond existing taxonomies. Key findings include: companies address ESG issues through diverse approaches; regional and sectoral similarities in disclosure patterns exist; and ESG disclosure significantly impacts ESG ratings more than other financial or company attributes. The methodology demonstrates LLMs' effectiveness in extracting meaningful ESG insights from complex textual data.

## Method Summary
The study employs a four-stage pipeline to extract ESG insights from sustainability reports. First, PDF reports are parsed and preprocessed to extract ESG-relevant sentences using semantic search. Second, an instruction-tuned LLM with in-context learning and RAG generates semantically structured triples (category-predicate-object) from these sentences. Third, semantic clustering consolidates similar ESG categories and predicates to reduce redundancy. Fourth, three bipartite graphs (category-predicate, company-category, company-action) are constructed from the knowledge graph to enable statistical analyses including graph metrics, entropy-based diversity measures, and correlation with ESG scores. The approach leverages LLMs' semantic understanding to generate domain-specific triples rather than generic information extraction.

## Key Results
- Over 500 ESG categories extracted, significantly exceeding existing taxonomies
- ESG disclosure patterns show stronger regional than sectoral similarities
- ESG disclosure correlates more strongly with ESG ratings than financial or company attributes
- Companies employ diverse approaches to address similar ESG categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs with in-context learning and RAG can generate semantically-aware ESG-focused triples instead of traditional SPO triples.
- Mechanism: The instruction-tuned LLM receives a sentence and a semantic schema (cat-pred-obj) via in-context learning, enabling it to extract domain-specific entities and relations rather than generic ones.
- Core assumption: The LLM's semantic understanding is sufficient to infer ESG categories from context and nominalize predicates correctly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach relies on an instruction-finetuned generative LLM, alongside the technique of in-context learning and the paradigm of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)..."
  - [section] "Generating the latter requires defining a semantically-aware triple template. Firstly, the entity Waste, representing an ESG category, is not explicitly mentioned, although it could be inferred from the term recycling technologies."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: corpus neighbors do not directly mention this triple extraction mechanism.
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot reliably infer ESG categories from context or nominalize predicates, the generated triples will be incomplete or semantically incorrect.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic clustering of extracted triples reduces redundancy and improves KG quality.
- Mechanism: After generating triples, the ESG categories (cat) and predicates (pred) are embedded and clustered using cosine similarity. Cluster centroids replace original terms, consolidating semantically similar concepts.
- Core assumption: High-density regions in the embedded vector space correspond to semantically equivalent ESG categories or predicates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Starting from the generated knowledge graph, we created three distinct bipartite graphs [32, 33] to extrapolate meaningful insights."
  - [section] "To achieve this goal, we perform semantic clustering on all the ESG categories (cat) and predicates (pred) included in the generated triples."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: corpus neighbors do not directly mention semantic clustering for KG consolidation.
- Break condition: If the similarity threshold is too low, unrelated concepts may be clustered together; if too high, distinct but related concepts may remain separate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bipartite graph representations enable non-trivial statistical analyses of ESG disclosures.
- Mechanism: Three bipartite graphs (category-predicate, company-category, company-action) are constructed from the KG. Graph metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness) and similarity coefficients are computed to derive insights about ESG actions and company similarities.
- Core assumption: The bipartite graph structure accurately captures the relationships between companies, ESG categories, and actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then leverage graph-based representations to conduct statistical analyses concerning the extracted insights."
  - [section] "Specifically, we use three distinct bipartite graphs for our analyses which are obtained through node and edge filtering of the comprehensive KG."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: corpus neighbors do not directly mention bipartite graph analysis for ESG disclosures.
- Break condition: If the KG is incomplete or noisy, the derived bipartite graphs will not accurately represent ESG disclosure patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Extraction (IE) and Open Information Extraction (OIE)
  - Why needed here: The study aims to extract structured ESG insights from unstructured sustainability reports, which requires advanced IE techniques.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between traditional IE and OIE, and why is OIE more suitable for this task?

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Bipartite Graphs
  - Why needed here: The extracted triples are used to construct a KG, which is then analyzed using bipartite graph representations to derive insights.
  - Quick check question: How do bipartite graphs differ from traditional graphs, and what advantages do they offer for analyzing ESG disclosures?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and In-Context Learning
  - Why needed here: LLMs are used to generate semantically-aware ESG-focused triples, and in-context learning is employed to provide the LLM with examples and semantic schemas.
  - Quick check question: What is in-context learning, and how does it enhance the LLM's ability to generate domain-specific triples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preparation -> Triple Generation -> KG Construction -> Analysis
- Critical path: Data Preparation → Triple Generation → KG Construction → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LLMs vs. traditional IE methods: LLMs offer semantic understanding but are computationally expensive.
  - Semantic clustering threshold: Higher thresholds reduce redundancy but may lose granularity.
  - Bipartite graph density: Higher density enables more comprehensive analysis but increases computational complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low-quality triples: Indicates issues with LLM instructions or semantic schema.
  - Noisy KG: Suggests problems with semantic clustering or triple generation.
  - Weak correlations: May indicate insufficient data or inappropriate similarity measures.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test LLM triple generation with a small sample of sentences and evaluate semantic correctness.
  2. Experiment with different semantic clustering thresholds and assess the impact on KG quality.
  3. Analyze a subset of companies using bipartite graph metrics and compare with manual assessments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of our LLM-based triple extraction method compare to traditional Open Information Extraction (OIE) techniques when applied to ESG-related text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that traditional OIE techniques would not be suitable for generating ESG-focused triples and instead relies on LLMs with in-context learning and RAG for triple generation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the LLM-based method and traditional OIE techniques in terms of performance metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of the quality and quantity of triples generated by both methods on the same ESG-related text corpus, using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the geographical location of a company influence the ESG-related actions it discloses, and how does this compare to the influence of its sector?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that company similarities based on disclosed ESG-related actions are more strongly associated with geographical location than with sector.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this association, it does not quantify the relative influence of geographical location versus sector on the diversity and nature of disclosed ESG-related actions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A statistical analysis comparing the variance in ESG-related actions attributed to geographical location versus sector, potentially using techniques such as ANOVA or regression analysis.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the ESG disclosure behavior of companies established in different time periods (e.g., pre-2000 vs. post-2000) differ, and what factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper's interpretability analysis of ESG scores reveals that being established earlier (older Incorporation Year) positively impacts a company's score, and it also mentions that all considered Chinese companies were established between 1999 and 2006.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the ESG disclosure patterns of companies established in different time periods or investigate the factors contributing to potential differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study analyzing the ESG disclosure behavior of companies over time, considering factors such as regulatory changes, societal expectations, and industry trends.

## Limitations
- The semantic clustering process may merge distinct ESG concepts if similarity thresholds are not carefully calibrated
- The bipartite graph analysis assumes the generated knowledge graph accurately represents all relevant ESG disclosures, but recall is not quantified
- Generalizability across different ESG taxonomies and languages is unclear

## Confidence
- High Confidence: PDF preprocessing and sentence segmentation methodology; use of established graph metrics for analysis
- Medium Confidence: Core LLM triple generation mechanism with in-context learning and semantic schemas
- Low Confidence: Generalizability of findings across different ESG taxonomies and non-English reports

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the semantic clustering threshold (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) and measure the impact on triple quality metrics and downstream analysis results
2. Manually review a subset of ESG-related sentences from reports and compare them against the generated triples to estimate the recall rate
3. Apply the same methodology to a different ESG taxonomy (e.g., SASB standards) and assess whether the approach remains effective or requires modifications
