# A Survey on Interpretable Cross-modal Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.01955
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01955
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive overview of interpretable cross-modal reasoning methods using a three-level hierarchical taxonomy, categorizing approaches by explanation modality (visual, textual, graph, symbol, multimodal) with analysis of datasets and future directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines interpretable cross-modal reasoning (I-CMR), a field that combines high predictive performance with human-understandable explanations for reasoning across multiple modalities. The work presents a systematic three-level hierarchical taxonomy that organizes I-CMR methods based on the modality of explanations provided—visual, textual, graph, symbol, or multimodal. Through this framework, the survey reviews existing CMR datasets with explanation annotations and identifies key challenges and future research directions in advancing interpretable reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a three-level hierarchical taxonomy as its primary methodological framework, organizing interpretable cross-modal reasoning methods by the modality of their explanations. This structure begins with broad categories (visual, textual, graph, symbol, multimodal) and progressively subdivides into more specific characteristics and approaches. The methodology involves comprehensive literature review across these categories, analysis of existing datasets with explanation annotations, and identification of open challenges in the field. Rather than proposing new methods, the work synthesizes and categorizes existing approaches to provide researchers with a panoramic perspective on state-of-the-art I-CMR techniques.

## Key Results
- Presents a three-level hierarchical taxonomy categorizing I-CMR methods by explanation modality (visual, textual, graph, symbol, multimodal)
- Reviews existing CMR datasets with annotations for explanations and their characteristics
- Identifies key challenges including inaccurate grounding of visual objects, lack of evaluation metrics for graph/symbol explanations, and need for improved user interaction
- Highlights future directions such as leveraging large language models for explanations and exploring multimodal large language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The three-level hierarchical taxonomy effectively organizes interpretable cross-modal reasoning methods by modality and design details.
- Mechanism: The taxonomy creates a structured framework that categorizes methods into visual, textual, graph, symbol, and multimodal explanations based on the modality of explanations, then further subdivides each category by specific characteristics.
- Core assumption: A hierarchical classification system improves understanding and comparison of complex AI methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the typical methods with a three-level taxonomy for I-CMR."
  - [section] "Fig. 2 summarizes the general taxonomy of interpretable cross-modal reasoning (I-CMR) and the related methods reviewed in this paper."
- Break condition: If the taxonomy fails to capture emerging explanation modalities or becomes too rigid to accommodate new approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Visual explanation methods provide intuitive understanding of CMR processes through visualization techniques.
- Mechanism: These methods quantify contributions and relevance across modalities and visualize them using heatmaps, attention maps, and other techniques to reveal how models process multimodal inputs.
- Core assumption: Visual representations are more intuitive and accessible for understanding complex reasoning processes than textual or numerical representations alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey delves into the realm of interpretable cross-modal reasoning (I-CMR), where the objective is not only to achieve high predictive performance but also to provide human-understandable explanations for the results."
  - [section] "Visual explanation methods adopt various visualization techniques to provide visual explanations for CMR processes."
- Break condition: If visualization techniques fail to accurately represent the underlying model processes or become misleading due to oversimplification.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal explanation methods enhance interpretability by combining multiple explanation modalities into unified or independent explanations.
- Mechanism: These methods leverage the strengths of different modalities (visual, textual, graph, symbol) to provide more comprehensive and user-friendly explanations that capture different aspects of the reasoning process.
- Core assumption: No single modality can fully explain complex cross-modal reasoning, and combining modalities provides complementary perspectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multimodal explanation [15, 104] aims to provide more comprehensive or user-friendly explanations by combining independent explanations of different modalities or generating a joint multimodal explanation."
  - [section] "Multimodal explanation methods incorporate multiple modalities simultaneously to facilitate a more comprehensive and holistic interpretation of the CMR process."
- Break condition: If combining modalities introduces inconsistency or complexity that outweighs the interpretability benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal reasoning (CMR)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental process of reasoning across different modalities is essential for grasping I-CMR methods and their applications.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes cross-modal reasoning from single-modal reasoning in AI systems?

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI) and interpretability
  - Why needed here: The survey's focus on interpretable CMR requires understanding the broader context of XAI methods and evaluation metrics for explanations.
  - Quick check question: How do interpretability requirements differ between visual, textual, and multimodal explanation methods?

- Concept: Hierarchical taxonomy design
  - Why needed here: The three-level taxonomy is a core contribution, so understanding how to design and apply hierarchical classification systems is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing a hierarchical taxonomy for complex AI methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Survey methodology and taxonomy design
  2. Visual explanation methods and techniques
  3. Textual explanation methods and techniques
  4. Graph explanation methods and techniques
  5. Symbol explanation methods and techniques
  6. Multimodal explanation methods and techniques
  7. Dataset curation and annotation analysis
  8. Challenge identification and future directions

- Critical path: Taxonomy design → Method categorization → Dataset analysis → Challenge identification
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage vs. focused depth, visual vs. textual vs. multimodal explanations, established vs. emerging methods
- Failure signatures: Incomplete coverage of key methods, unclear categorization, insufficient dataset analysis, overlooking critical challenges
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the taxonomy to a small set of recent I-CMR papers to test classification accuracy and completeness
  2. Compare visual explanation methods using a common dataset to identify strengths and limitations
  3. Evaluate multimodal explanation methods on a benchmark task to assess interpretability improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we accurately ground key visual objects for reasoning in cross-modal reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of inaccurate grounding of visual objects, noting that current methods often focus on limited regions and may miss global characteristics of objects.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods like pre-trained detection models may fail to extract key objects relevant to specific reasoning problems, and object boxes may not precisely conform to the shape of target objects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different object grounding methods, particularly those incorporating problem semantics, on cross-modal reasoning tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop evaluation metrics for graph and symbol explanations in interpretable cross-modal reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of universally accepted evaluation criteria for graph alignment and symbol inference processes.
- Why unresolved: Existing metrics for visual and textual explanations are not directly applicable to graph and symbol explanations, and the complexity of these modalities poses challenges for evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for graph and symbol explanations, with experiments demonstrating their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we improve the user-friendliness and user-interaction of interpretable cross-modal reasoning systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of making explanations understandable to general users and allowing for dynamic explanations through user interactions.
- Why unresolved: Current methods often provide explanations in a one-shot manner, which may not address users' specific confusion or require expert knowledge to comprehend.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies evaluating the effectiveness of different explanation presentation formats and interaction mechanisms, along with metrics measuring user understanding and satisfaction.

## Limitations
- As a survey paper, it does not provide empirical validation of the claims made about different interpretability approaches
- The three-level hierarchical taxonomy may not capture all emerging explanation modalities or novel approaches developed after the survey's completion
- The survey's focus on existing datasets with explanation annotations may not reflect the full landscape of available data resources

## Confidence

**Confidence Levels:**
- High confidence: The general categorization of I-CMR methods into visual, textual, graph, symbol, and multimodal explanations is well-supported by the survey's comprehensive literature review and the established taxonomy framework.
- Medium confidence: The mechanisms describing how visual and multimodal explanation methods work are plausible based on the survey's descriptions, but would benefit from empirical validation studies.
- Low confidence: The effectiveness of the three-level taxonomy in capturing all relevant I-CMR methods is uncertain without broader testing across diverse research papers.

## Next Checks

1. **Taxonomy Validation**: Apply the three-level hierarchical taxonomy to a sample of recent I-CMR papers (2023-2024) to test its completeness and flexibility in categorizing emerging methods.
2. **Method Comparison Study**: Select 2-3 visual explanation methods from the survey and conduct a controlled comparison on a standard CMR dataset (e.g., GQA or VQA) to empirically validate their relative strengths and limitations.
3. **User Study on Multimodal Explanations**: Design and execute a user study comparing the interpretability of single-modality explanations versus multimodal explanations for a CMR task, measuring both comprehension accuracy and user preference.
