# DeepOnto: A Python Package for Ontology Engineering with Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.03067
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03067
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DeepOnto bridges Python-based deep learning with Java-based ontology processing, achieving F-score of 0.868 in medical concept alignment and outperforming other systems in Bio-ML track.

## Executive Summary
DeepOnto is a Python package designed to integrate deep learning frameworks with ontology engineering by providing a Pythonic wrapper around the Java-based OWL API. The package addresses the challenge of combining the strengths of Python's deep learning ecosystem with the stability and reliability of Java's ontology processing capabilities. DeepOnto offers core ontology processing modules and specialized tools for tasks like ontology alignment and completion using pre-trained language models.

## Method Summary
DeepOnto leverages the OWL API through JPype to create a Python interface for ontology processing, then extends this with deep learning capabilities for ontology engineering tasks. The package provides components for reasoning, pruning, verbalization, normalization, and projection of ontologies, along with specialized tools like BERTMap for alignment and BERTSubs for completion. The approach involves transforming ontologies into formats suitable for deep learning applications while maintaining semantic integrity through the underlying OWL API foundation.

## Key Results
- BERTMap achieves F-score of 0.868 in aligning medical concepts from NHS conditions to DOID ontology
- DeepOnto outperforms other systems in the Bio-ML track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
- The package successfully demonstrates practical utility in both Digital Health Coaching and Bio-ML evaluation scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: DeepOnto provides a Pythonic wrapper around the Java-based OWL API, enabling seamless integration with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers.
- **Mechanism**: DeepOnto uses JPype to bridge the JVM with Python, encapsulating OWL API's ontology processing features in a more user-friendly manner while extending capabilities to include reasoning, verbalization, normalization, taxonomy, and projection.
- **Core assumption**: OWL API is stable, reliable, and widely adopted, making it a suitable backend dependency for ontology processing.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "DeepOnto provides a core ontology processing module founded on the widely-recognised and reliable OWL API"
- **Break condition**: If OWL API becomes deprecated or loses community support, or if JPype introduces breaking changes that are difficult to resolve.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: DeepOnto's ontology processing module enables various ontology engineering tasks by transforming ontologies into formats suitable for deep learning-based applications.
- **Mechanism**: DeepOnto implements components like reasoning, pruning, verbalization, normalization, and projection to convert ontologies into different data forms (e.g., natural language text, RDF graphs) that can be processed by deep learning models.
- **Core assumption**: Transforming ontologies into different data formats facilitates the application of deep learning techniques to ontology engineering tasks.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "DeepOnto offers a suite of tools, resources, and algorithms that support various ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology alignment and completion, by harnessing deep learning methods, primarily pre-trained LMs"
- **Break condition**: If the transformations do not preserve essential semantic information or if the resulting formats are not compatible with popular deep learning frameworks.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: DeepOnto's tools and resources, such as BERTMap, BERTSubs, Bio-ML, and OntoLAMA, provide effective solutions for specific ontology engineering tasks.
- **Mechanism**: BERTMap uses BERT to align ontology concepts based on their labels; BERTSubs predicts concept subsumptions within and between ontologies; Bio-ML provides datasets and evaluation protocols for ontology matching; OntoLAMA probes language models' understanding of ontology subsumption inferences.
- **Core assumption**: Pre-trained language models can effectively capture semantic relationships between ontology concepts when fine-tuned on relevant tasks.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "The results show promising performance, with BERTMap achieving an F-score of 0.868 in aligning medical concepts and outperforming other systems in the Bio-ML track"
- **Break condition**: If pre-trained language models fail to generalize well to new ontologies or if their performance degrades significantly with increased ontology size or complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Ontology engineering
  - **Why needed here**: DeepOnto is a package designed for ontology engineering tasks, so understanding the basics of ontology engineering is crucial for using the package effectively.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the main stages of ontology development, and how does DeepOnto support these stages?

- **Concept**: Description Logic and OWL
  - **Why needed here**: OWL (Web Ontology Language) is based on Description Logic, and DeepOnto's core ontology processing module is built upon the OWL API. Familiarity with these concepts is necessary to understand how DeepOnto handles ontologies.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the main components of an OWL ontology, and how does the OWL API represent and manipulate these components?

- **Concept**: Deep learning and language models
  - **Why needed here**: DeepOnto leverages deep learning techniques, particularly pre-trained language models, to support various ontology engineering tasks. Understanding these techniques is essential for using and extending DeepOnto's capabilities.
  - **Quick check question**: How do pre-trained language models like BERT capture semantic relationships between words, and how can they be fine-tuned for specific tasks like ontology alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Core ontology processing module (based on OWL API) → Ontology class, OntologyReasoning, OntologyPruning, OntologyVerbalisation, OntologyNormalisation, OntologyProjection → Tools and resources (BERTMap, BERTSubs, Bio-ML, OntoLAMA)

- **Critical path**: Loading an ontology → Performing basic operations (e.g., accessing entities, querying hierarchy) → Applying advanced features (e.g., reasoning, verbalization) → Using tools and resources for specific tasks (e.g., alignment, completion)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using OWL API as the backend dependency provides stability and reliability but may limit flexibility in terms of extending or customizing the ontology processing capabilities. Leveraging pre-trained language models for ontology engineering tasks offers promising results but may require significant computational resources and careful fine-tuning.

- **Failure signatures**: Errors or unexpected behavior when loading ontologies with complex structures or large sizes. Incorrect or incomplete results when applying advanced features like reasoning or verbalization to ontologies with missing or inconsistent information. Poor performance or generalization when using tools and resources on ontologies from domains different from the pre-trained language models' training data.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Load a simple ontology file and perform basic operations like accessing entities and querying the concept hierarchy.
  2. Apply the OntologyVerbalisation component to a complex concept expression and verify the correctness of the generated natural language text.
  3. Use BERTMap to align two small ontologies and evaluate the quality of the resulting mappings using a ground truth or manual inspection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

  - **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a clear solution for handling out-of-scope concepts, and the impact of these concepts on the performance of ontology matching systems is not fully explored.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental studies comparing different strategies for handling out-of-scope concepts in ontology matching tasks, along with a detailed analysis of the impact of these strategies on the performance of the systems.

## Limitations

- The evaluation is limited to specific use cases (Digital Health Coaching and Bio-ML track) and may not generalize to all ontology engineering scenarios.
- The performance heavily depends on the quality and relevance of pre-trained language models, which may not be optimal for all domains or ontology types.
- The integration with OWL API via JPype may introduce compatibility issues or limitations in extending the ontology processing capabilities beyond what OWL API offers.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of providing a Pythonic wrapper around OWL API for seamless integration with deep learning frameworks is well-established and demonstrated in the paper.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of transforming ontologies into different data formats for deep learning-based applications shows promising results but lacks extensive validation across diverse ontology engineering tasks.
- **Medium confidence**: The performance of DeepOnto's tools and resources (BERTMap, BERTSubs, Bio-ML, OntoLAMA) on the specific use cases presented is demonstrated, but further evaluation on a wider range of ontologies and tasks is needed to establish their generalizability.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate DeepOnto's core ontology processing module on a diverse set of ontologies with varying sizes, structures, and domains to assess its robustness and scalability.
2. Conduct a comprehensive comparison of DeepOnto's tools and resources with other state-of-the-art ontology engineering approaches on a range of benchmark datasets and tasks.
3. Investigate the impact of different pre-trained language models and fine-tuning strategies on the performance of DeepOnto's tools and resources, particularly for ontologies from domains not well-represented in the pre-training data.
