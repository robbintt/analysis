# Automatic News Summerization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11520
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11520
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Graph-based extractive model achieved highest ROUGE-1 score (0.332), Pegasus abstractive model achieved ROUGE-1 score of 0.3186

## Executive Summary
This study compared extractive and abstractive methods for automatic news summarization using the CNN-Daily Mail dataset. The graph-based extractive model achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score (0.332), while the pre-trained Pegasus model, after fine-tuning, achieved a ROUGE-1 score of 0.3186. Extractive models were significantly faster than Pegasus in real-time summarization. The study found that while Pegasus showed the best overall summarization quality, extractive methods are more suitable for real-time applications due to lower computational requirements.

## Method Summary
The study implemented multiple extractive models (TF-IDF baseline, graph-based using cosine similarity and PageRank, hybrid with Random Forest regressor) and abstractive models (Seq2Seq with Bidirectional LSTM, Pegasus fine-tuned on dataset) to summarize news articles from the CNN-Daily Mail dataset. Models were evaluated using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores. The graph-based extractive model constructs a similarity graph where sentences are nodes weighted by cosine similarity, then applies PageRank to identify central sentences. The Pegasus model uses transformer architecture pre-trained on gap-sentences for abstractive summarization. Top models were integrated into a Flask web application for real-time testing with NewsAPI.

## Key Results
- Graph-based extractive model achieved highest ROUGE-1 score (0.332)
- Pegasus abstractive model achieved ROUGE-1 score of 0.3186 after fine-tuning
- Extractive models were significantly faster than Pegasus in real-time summarization
- Pegasus showed best overall summarization quality but required more computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph-based extractive model outperforms TF-IDF baseline by capturing inter-sentence relationships through cosine similarity and PageRank scoring
- Mechanism: Builds similarity graph where sentences are nodes weighted by cosine similarity, uses PageRank to rank sentences by contextual centrality
- Core assumption: Sentence importance correlates with centrality in similarity graph and PageRank can identify these central nodes
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states graph-based model achieved highest ROUGE-1 score (0.332); methodology describes graph construction with cosine similarity and PageRank
- Break condition: Fails with many short, repetitive sentences or when similarity metric cannot distinguish semantically distinct sentences

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pegasus achieves competitive ROUGE scores due to pre-training on gap-sentences that provides strong summarization inductive bias
- Mechanism: Pre-trained to generate missing sentences from documents where summary-like sentences are masked, learning abstractive summarization during pre-training
- Core assumption: Masked sentences in pre-training are representative of content needed in human-generated summaries
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms Pegasus achieved ROUGE-1 score of 0.3186 after fine-tuning; methodology describes pre-training on gap-sentences
- Break condition: Fails if masked spans in pre-training do not align with human-generated summary requirements

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Extractive models are significantly faster due to avoiding complex decoding steps required by abstractive models
- Mechanism: Extractive methods select and concatenate existing sentences based on scoring, while abstractive methods run encoder-decoder attention, beam search, and language modeling during generation
- Core assumption: Computational overhead of generation dominates inference time compared to sentence selection
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states extractive models were significantly faster than Pegasus; methodology describes real-time testing showing extractive methods take far less time
- Break condition: Speed advantage diminishes if extractive pipeline includes heavy preprocessing or similarity computation over long documents

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)
  - Why needed here: Study uses ROUGE scores to objectively compare summary quality across models
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L in terms of what they measure?

- Concept: TF-IDF vectorization
  - Why needed here: Both baseline and hybrid extractive models rely on TF-IDF to quantify word importance
  - Quick check question: How does TF-IDF help differentiate common words from informative ones in a document?

- Concept: Sentence similarity using cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: Graph-based model computes pairwise sentence similarity to build similarity graph for PageRank
  - Quick check question: Why is cosine similarity preferred over Euclidean distance for comparing TF-IDF vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset -> Preprocessing -> Tokenization -> Vectorization -> Model training -> ROUGE evaluation -> Flask web app serving
- Critical path: CNN/Daily Mail dataset → cleaning → tokenization → vectorization/embedding → model training → ROUGE evaluation → web app serving
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs speed: Abstractive models yield better coherence but are slower; extractive models are faster but may miss nuanced content
  - Complexity vs compute: Seq2Seq underperforms due to limited compute; Pegasus is pre-trained but resource-heavy
  - Simplicity vs performance: TF-IDF baseline is simple but less accurate than graph-based methods
- Failure signatures:
  - Low ROUGE scores across all models → preprocessing issues or mismatched evaluation references
  - Pegasus slower than extractive but with similar ROUGE → possible overfitting or inefficient fine-tuning
  - Web app crashes on live news → API throttling or memory limits during model inference
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TF-IDF baseline on small subset and verify ROUGE scores match expected baseline (~0.25 ROUGE-1)
  2. Build and evaluate graph-based model on same subset; confirm improvement in ROUGE-1 (~0.33)
  3. Deploy hybrid model in Flask app and measure execution time vs Pegasus on live news article

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would different abstractive summarization models perform compared to Pegasus in terms of ROUGE scores and real-time processing speed?
- Basis in paper: Study only evaluated Pegasus and compared it to extractive methods, not exploring other abstractive models like BART, GPT-3, or newer transformer architectures
- Why unresolved: Limited to single abstractive model comparison
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of multiple abstractive models (BART, GPT-3, T5) on same dataset with ROUGE scores and processing time measurements

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between ROUGE score performance and real-time processing speed for practical news summarization applications?
- Basis in paper: Paper identifies trade-off between performance and speed but did not determine optimal balance point for practical applications
- Why unresolved: Identified trade-off without systematic study of optimal balance
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic study varying model complexity with measurements of both ROUGE scores and processing times to identify optimal trade-off point

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would using more computational resources affect performance of Seq2Seq model and other abstractive models?
- Basis in paper: Seq2Seq "lacked performance due to inadequate computation power" and "full potential of abstractive models could not be used because they require a lot of computing power to train"
- Why unresolved: Study limited by computational resources unable to explore capabilities of resource-intensive models
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-training Seq2Seq and other abstractive models with significantly more computational resources and measuring their ROUGE scores and processing times

## Limitations

- Exclusive focus on CNN-Daily Mail dataset may not represent full diversity of news writing styles and domains
- Evaluation limited to ROUGE scores which primarily measure n-gram overlap and may not capture factual consistency, coherence, or informativeness
- Computational resource constraints prevented proper training of Seq2Seq model, weakening conclusions about abstractive method performance
- Real-time comparison based on relatively small sample of live news articles without statistical validation of timing differences

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Comparative ROUGE score results for graph-based extractive model versus TF-IDF baseline are well-supported by methodology and consistent with literature on graph-based centrality methods
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that Pegasus achieves competitive ROUGE scores after fine-tuning is supported by reported results but training procedure details are sparse
- **Low Confidence**: Real-time speed comparison conclusions based on limited testing without statistical validation and exact execution environment specifications not provided

## Next Checks

1. Implement graph-based extractive model using described methodology (cosine similarity + PageRank) on small subset of CNN-Daily Mail dataset and verify ROUGE-1 scores achieve approximately 0.332

2. Conduct controlled timing experiments comparing three fastest models (TF-IDF baseline, graph-based extractive, and Pegasus) on identical hardware with multiple runs to establish statistical significance of execution time differences

3. Recreate Seq2Seq model training pipeline with specified resources and document whether computational constraints were primary factor in underperformance or if architectural limitations also contributed
