# Beaching Large Language Models in Biomedical Triple Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18463
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: PETAILOR achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving F1 score by 32.20% over best baseline in triple extraction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PETAILOR, a retrieval-augmented language model specifically designed for biomedical triple extraction. Unlike traditional approaches that retrieve documents or sentences, PETAILOR segments input sentences into chunks and retrieves relevant relation chunks from a pre-computed relational key-value memory. The method is evaluated on a newly introduced expert-annotated dataset, GM-CIHT, covering 22 relation types in biomedical and complementary health domains, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing models.

## Method Summary
PETAILOR is a retrieval-augmented language model that addresses biomedical triple extraction by leveraging chunk-level retrieval from a pre-constructed relational key-value memory. The system segments input sentences into chunks, retrieves relevant (relation description chunk, relation type) pairs, and uses a tailored chunk scorer trained with the language model's output as supervision to select the most beneficial retrieved information. This approach provides targeted relational context during generation, improving the model's ability to identify complex biomedical relations compared to document or sentence-level retrieval methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GM-CIHT dataset for biomedical triple extraction
- Improves F1 score by 32.20% over best baseline model
- Demonstrates significant advantages in both triple extraction and relation extraction tasks
- Outperforms both fine-tuned small language models and non-fine-tuned large language models in biomedical domain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PETAILOR improves relation identification by retrieving relevant chunk-level knowledge from a pre-constructed relational key-value memory.
- Mechanism: The model segments input sentences into chunks and retrieves the most relevant chunks from a memory storing (relation description chunk, relation type) pairs. This provides the language model with targeted relational context rather than relying solely on sentence-level similarity.
- Core assumption: Chunk-level retrieval provides more relevant relational context than document or sentence-level retrieval for complex biomedical relations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unlike previous retrieval-augmented language models (LM) that retrieve relevant documents by calculating the similarity between the input sentence and the candidate document set, PETAILOR segments the sentence into chunks and retrieves the relevant chunk from our pre-computed chunk-based relational key-value memory."
  - [section 5.1]: "In contrast to previous retrieved language models that retrieve relevant information at the document or sentence level without labels, our approach focuses on retrieving information at the chunk level with labels."
- Break condition: If chunks are too short or too long relative to the relational context needed, retrieval effectiveness may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The tailored chunk scorer adapts the retrieval process to the specific needs of the language model.
- Mechanism: The scorer is trained using the language model's output as a signal, learning which retrieved chunks best improve the model's performance. This creates a personalized retrieval model aligned with the LM's processing patterns.
- Core assumption: The language model's output can serve as an effective training signal for optimizing chunk retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PETAILOR adapt the tailored chunk scorer to the LM. We also introduce GM-CIHT, an expert annotated biomedical triple extraction dataset with more relation types."
  - [section 5.3]: "We use the LM as a scoring function to help train the Tailored chunk Scorer and measure how much each memory could improve the LM perplexity, in the training process, the memory that makes the LM's output as close as possible to the ground truth is considered to be providing the memory that the LM needs."
- Break condition: If the LM output is not a reliable indicator of chunk relevance, the scorer may optimize for irrelevant features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation addresses the knowledge gap in LLMs for biomedical domains.
- Mechanism: By retrieving relevant relational knowledge during generation, the model supplements its internal knowledge with external, domain-specific information, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.
- Core assumption: Biomedical domain knowledge is not adequately captured in the pre-training of general LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.2.3]: "(2) The non-finetuned LLMs are incapable of extracting the precise triple from biomedical sentences, as exemplified by GPT-4 (P1);"
  - [section 6.2.3]: "(3) Using SLM models in the biomedical domain reveals their reduced effectiveness, even though they have demonstrated strong performance in the general domain."
- Break condition: If the retrieval mechanism fails to provide accurate or relevant knowledge, the benefits may not materialize.

  - Why needed here: To identify and retrieve the most relevant relational context within sentences
  - Quick check question: How does chunk size affect the granularity of retrieved information?

  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning versus using in-context learning for domain adaptation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Relational Key-Value Memory -> Chunk Retriever -> Tailored Chunk Scorer -> Language Model -> Instruction Generator

- Critical path:
  1. Construct Relational Key-Value Memory from training data
  2. For each input sentence, split into chunks
  3. Retrieve top-relevant key-value pairs for each chunk
  4. Score retrieved pairs using the Tailored Chunk Scorer
  5. Select the highest-scoring pair and combine with input and instruction
  6. Generate output using the Language Model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Chunk size: Affects retrieval granularity and computational efficiency
  - Memory size: Impacts retrieval accuracy and storage requirements
  - Scorer complexity: Balances adaptation accuracy with training overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Low retrieval relevance: Retrieved chunks do not align with input context
  - Scorer misalignment: Selected chunks do not improve LM performance
  - Instruction ambiguity: LM generates incorrect or irrelevant outputs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate retrieval accuracy with different chunk sizes (m=3,4,5)
  2. Compare tailored chunk scorer with cosine similarity baseline
  3. Assess impact of retrieved chunk diversity on LM performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Availability Verification**: Attempt to obtain or recreate the GM-CIHT dataset to independently verify the reported performance metrics. If the dataset is not accessible, identify comparable publicly available biomedical triple extraction datasets for validation.

2. **Chunk Size Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically evaluate the retrieval accuracy and overall performance across different chunk sizes (m=3,4,5) to determine the optimal parameter settings and assess the method's sensitivity to this hyperparameter.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply PETAILOR to at least two additional biomedical datasets from different subdomains (e.g., clinical notes, scientific literature) to assess whether the performance improvements generalize beyond the original GM-CIHT dataset.
