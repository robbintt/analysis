# Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07107
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of integrating large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval (IR) systems, covering query rewriting, retrieval, reranking, and reading modules.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines the integration of large language models into information retrieval systems, focusing on four key modules: query rewriting, retrieval, reranking, and reading. LLMs enhance IR by improving query understanding, generating synthetic training data, and directly generating answers. The paper highlights how these advancements lead to more personalized, precise, and user-centric search experiences. Future directions include efficient indexing, user modeling, and novel evaluation metrics to address current challenges.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes current research on applying LLMs to IR systems through a comprehensive literature review. It organizes findings around four main modules: query rewriting (improving query formulation), retrieval (finding relevant documents), reranking (scoring and ordering results), and reading (generating final answers). The paper examines various approaches including prompt engineering, fine-tuning strategies, and data augmentation techniques. The methodology involves analyzing existing studies to identify patterns, challenges, and future research directions in LLM-enhanced IR systems.

## Key Results
- LLMs significantly improve query understanding and reformulation, reducing vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents
- Synthetic data generation using LLMs addresses data scarcity in training retrieval models
- LLM-based generative retrieval eliminates the need for explicit indexing by directly mapping queries to document identifiers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs enhance IR systems by generating synthetic queries and relevance labels to augment training data, addressing the data scarcity problem.
- Mechanism: LLMs are prompted to generate pseudo queries from documents or soft relevance labels from retrieved passages, expanding the training set for retrievers without requiring manual annotation.
- Core assumption: The generated queries and labels are sufficiently accurate and representative of real user queries and relevance judgments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems."
  - [section] "How to apply LLMs for data augmentation? ... Two mainstream approaches ... pseudo query generation and relevance label generation."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus shows related papers but lacks direct evidence of LLM-generated data quality.
- Break condition: If generated queries/labels are noisy or unrepresentative, they could mislead the training process and degrade retrieval performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs improve query rewriting by better understanding user intent and generating more expressive queries, reducing vocabulary mismatch.
- Mechanism: LLMs are prompted to rewrite ambiguous or short queries into more specific and semantically rich forms, either by generating additional context or directly reformulating the query.
- Core assumption: LLMs can accurately infer user intent from limited input and generate queries that retrieve more relevant documents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs have exhibited unprecedented proficiency in language understanding and generation, resulting in responses that are more human-like and better align with human intentions."
  - [section] "Query2Doc [87] prompts the LLMs to generate a relevant passage according to the query. Subsequently, the original query is expanded by incorporating the generated passage."
  - [corpus] Weak. Related surveys exist but lack specific evidence on LLM query rewriting effectiveness.
- Break condition: If LLMs misinterpret user intent or generate overly specific queries, they may reduce recall or miss relevant documents.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs enable generative retrieval by directly generating document identifiers, eliminating the need for explicit indexing.
- Mechanism: LLMs are fine-tuned or prompted to map queries to document identifiers (e.g., URLs or semantic IDs), allowing retrieval without traditional indexing structures.
- Core assumption: The knowledge of the document corpus can be effectively encoded in LLM parameters and accurately decoded into relevant document identifiers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs can effectively apply their learned knowledge and reasoning abilities to tackle new tasks with just a few task-specific demonstrations or appropriate instructions."
  - [section] "In these model-based generative retrieval methods, the knowledge of document corpus is stored in the model parameters, eliminating the need for additional storage space for the index."
  - [corpus] Weak. Related papers discuss generative retrieval but lack evidence on scalability and index update challenges.
- Break condition: If the document corpus is too large or frequently updated, the static nature of LLM parameters may hinder retrieval accuracy and freshness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Query reformulation and expansion
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to improve short, ambiguous queries is crucial for leveraging LLMs in the query rewriting module.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between query reformulation and query expansion, and when would you use each?

- Concept: Dense retrieval and semantic matching
  - Why needed here: Grasping the shift from keyword-based to dense retrieval is essential for understanding how LLMs enhance the retrieval module.
  - Quick check question: How does dense retrieval differ from traditional sparse retrieval, and what role do embeddings play?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: Effectively leveraging LLMs requires designing prompts that elicit the desired behavior, especially for zero- or few-shot scenarios.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, and when would you use each?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Query rewriter: LLM-based query reformulation/expansion
  - Retriever: Dense retrieval models, optionally LLM-augmented
  - Reranker: LLM-based fine-tuning, prompting, or training data augmentation
  - Reader: LLM-based answer generation with retrieval augmentation

- Critical path:
  1. User query → Query rewriter → Enhanced query
  2. Enhanced query → Retriever → Candidate documents
  3. Candidate documents → Reranker → Reranked documents
  4. Reranked documents → Reader → Final answer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM parameter count vs. inference latency vs. retrieval accuracy
  - Synthetic data quality vs. manual annotation cost vs. retriever generalization
  - Generative retrieval vs. traditional retrieval vs. index storage cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval accuracy: LLM-generated queries/labels are noisy or unrepresentative
  - High latency: LLM inference time is too long for real-time search
  - Hallucinations: LLM generates irrelevant or fabricated content in answers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple LLM-based query rewriter (e.g., using GPT-3) and measure its impact on retrieval accuracy vs. a baseline BM25 system.
  2. Generate synthetic queries using an LLM and fine-tune a dense retriever on the augmented data, comparing performance to a model trained only on human-annotated data.
  3. Implement a basic generative retrieval model (e.g., using T5) and compare its accuracy and efficiency to a traditional retrieval + reranking pipeline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
