# Distinguishing Risk Preferences using Repeated Gambles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07054
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Decision convergence makes risk preference inference difficult as agent wealth increases

## Executive Summary
This study develops a methodology for inferring risk preferences of artificial decision-making agents through sequences of repeated gambles. The authors introduce a family of gambles using the Yeo-Johnson transformation that interpolates smoothly between additive and multiplicative cases while handling negative wealth. Through analytical and numerical analysis of optimal strategies, they demonstrate that distinguishing risk preferences becomes increasingly difficult as agent wealth grows due to decision convergence. Their experiments with 100,000 simulations across five different risk preferences reveal that growth-rate maximizing agents perform best, with their advantage becoming more pronounced over longer time horizons (t=300 vs t=30).

## Method Summary
The methodology employs Yeo-Johnson transformations with parameters η and γ to create a family of utility functions that smoothly interpolate between additive (identity) and multiplicative (log) cases. Agents choose between safe and risky gambles based on expected utility change, with wealth evolving according to the inverse Yeo-Johnson transform. The experimental design uses 100,000 simulations across five risk preferences (η ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}) and five gamble dynamics (γ ∈ {0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}), with safe options bounded by λt ~ Uniform(µ - cσ², µ + cσ²) and risky options following Π ~ Normal(µ, σ²). The study analyzes wealth distributions over 30 and 300 time steps to assess inference difficulty.

## Key Results
- Decision convergence causes risk preference inference difficulty to increase with agent wealth due to dominating linear terms in utility change expansions
- Growth-rate maximizing agents (η = γ) consistently outperform others, with advantage more pronounced at t=300 versus t=30
- Yeo-Johnson transforms enable smooth interpolation between additive and multiplicative dynamics while handling negative wealth values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decision convergence makes risk preference inference difficult as agent wealth increases.
- Mechanism: As wealth grows, expected utility differences between agents with different risk preferences shrink due to the dominating linear term in the Taylor expansion of utility change.
- Core assumption: The utility function is a Yeo-Johnson transform with parameters η, and the gamble dynamics use parameter γ.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We find that it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the risk preferences of agents as their wealth increases."
  - [section 4.2]: Explains that for Xt → ∞, the coefficient of E(Z) dominates higher moment terms, causing preferences to converge.
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on gambles but not on decision convergence per se.
- Break condition: Decision convergence fails when γ = 1 (multiplicative dynamics) because the linear term no longer dominates.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using Yeo-Johnson transforms allows smooth interpolation between additive and multiplicative gamble dynamics while handling negative wealth.
- Mechanism: The Yeo-Johnson transform family includes both identity (additive) and near-multiplicative cases, and is unbounded for γ ∈ [-1,1], enabling representation of all wealth values.
- Core assumption: The transform must be strictly increasing and invertible to maintain meaningful utility calculations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "The benefit of using the Yeo-Johnson transform is that it is unbounded for γ ∈ [-1, 1], a much wider range of parameter values than for the Isoelastic transform."
  - [section 2]: Explains ergodicity transforms for additive (identity) and multiplicative (log) cases.
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence of Yeo-Johnson use in related papers.
- Break condition: If the transform is not strictly increasing, the inverse function is not well-defined, breaking the experimental design.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Growth-rate maximizing agents perform best in finite repeated gambles, especially over longer horizons.
- Mechanism: Time-optimality ensures that the growth-rate maximizing agent will have the highest wealth asymptotically; in finite time, this advantage becomes more pronounced as the time horizon increases.
- Core assumption: The Strong Law of Large Numbers applies to the wealth process increments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2]: "The growth-rate maximizing agent is time-optimal, meaning that they are guaranteed at the infinite-time limit to have a larger wealth than any other agent."
  - [abstract]: "growth-rate maximizing agents perform best, their advantage becomes more pronounced over longer time horizons (t=300 vs t=30)."
  - [section 5]: CDF plots show growth-rate maximizing agents outperforming others more clearly at t=300 than at t=30.
- Break condition: If the wealth process does not satisfy the Kolmogorov criterion for the SLLN, the growth-rate maximizing agent's advantage may not materialize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Expected utility theory
  - Why needed here: Agents choose gambles by maximizing expected utility change, the core decision rule in the experiment.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between expected utility maximization and growth-rate maximization?
- Concept: Ergodic theory and time-optimal strategies
  - Why needed here: Explains why maximizing expected log wealth (multiplicative) vs. expected wealth (additive) leads to different optimal strategies.
  - Quick check question: How does the ergodicity transform differ between additive and multiplicative dynamics?
- Concept: Yeo-Johnson transformation
  - Why needed here: Provides a family of transforms that smoothly interpolate between additive and multiplicative dynamics and handle negative wealth.
  - Quick check question: What is the parameter range for the Yeo-Johnson transform that keeps it unbounded?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Generate gamble -> Calculate expected utilities -> Select option -> Update wealth -> Repeat
- Critical path: Generate gamble → Calculate expected utilities → Select option → Update wealth → Repeat
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simple vs. complex utility functions (affects computation)
  - Fixed vs. adaptive gamble parameters (affects inference difficulty)
  - Short vs. long time horizons (affects convergence to optimal strategy)
- Failure signatures:
  - Agents always choosing the same option regardless of risk preference
  - Wealth distribution collapsing to a single point
  - Numerical integration errors in expected utility calculation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify decision convergence by running a single agent with varying η over increasing wealth and observing preference changes.
  2. Test the algorithm for choosing μ and c by checking if λt splits opinions as intended.
  3. Compare CDFs of growth-rate maximizing vs. other agents at t=30 and t=300 to confirm advantage increases with time horizon.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Yeo-Johnson transformation parameter γ affect the rate of decision convergence in repeated gambles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors show that decision convergence occurs for γ ∈ [0, 1) but not for γ = 1, and provide mathematical conditions for this phenomenon.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes the existence of decision convergence for certain parameter ranges, it does not quantify how the rate of convergence varies with different γ values or other experimental parameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic numerical experiments varying γ, initial wealth, and time horizon to measure the wealth threshold at which decision convergence occurs for different utility functions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal experimental design for inferring risk preferences when agents exhibit decision convergence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the challenge of decision convergence making risk preference inference difficult and propose keeping wealth near zero, but don't provide a complete optimal design framework.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but doesn't solve it completely - there's no systematic method for choosing gamble parameters (λt bounds, time horizon, etc.) that maximizes information gain about risk preferences despite convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis comparing different experimental designs (varying gamble parameters, observation periods, wealth ranges) using information-theoretic measures of inference quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do finite-time limitations affect the practical applicability of growth-rate maximization theory?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "The concept of time-optimality does not extend neatly into finite-time" and acknowledge uncertainty about what characterizes the 'best' wealth distribution in practice.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that growth-rate maximizing agents perform well in simulations, it doesn't provide rigorous bounds on how much performance can degrade in finite time or under what conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analytical or numerical bounds on the performance gap between growth-rate maximizing agents and other agents as a function of time horizon, initial wealth, and gamble parameters.

## Limitations
- Findings depend on specific parametric assumptions about utility functions and gamble structures
- Simulation results are constrained to a specific parameter space and may not capture edge cases
- Decision convergence analysis relies heavily on Yeo-Johnson transformation properties that may not generalize

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical framework connecting utility maximization to wealth dynamics
- Medium confidence in the simulation results given the controlled experimental conditions
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of decision convergence findings across different utility specifications

## Next Checks
1. **Parametric Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the parameter range for η and γ beyond the discrete values tested to identify potential non-monotonic effects on inference difficulty.
2. **Alternative Utility Families**: Implement the experimental design using different utility function families (e.g., power utility, prospect theory) to test the robustness of decision convergence across specifications.
3. **Real-World Data Validation**: Apply the methodology to empirical datasets of human decision-making under risk to verify whether the theoretical predictions about inference difficulty hold in practice.
