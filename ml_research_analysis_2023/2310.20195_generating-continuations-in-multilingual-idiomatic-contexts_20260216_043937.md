# Generating Continuations in Multilingual Idiomatic Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20195
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Models perform slightly better on literal than idiomatic contexts, but difference is not statistically significant; GPT-3 davinci excels in zero-shot setting.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether generative language models handle idiomatic and literal multiword expressions differently when generating narrative continuations, across English and Portuguese. Using datasets with both idiomatic and literal forms of expressions, the authors evaluate GPT-2, OPT, and GPT-3 under zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised settings. Results show only minimal performance differences between idiomatic and literal contexts, with GPT-3 davinci consistently outperforming other models, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. Human evaluation confirms reasonable relevance of generated continuations, especially for idiomatic cases, though grammatical errors remain common.

## Method Summary
The study uses sentence sequences (S1, S2, S3) from a multilingual idiomaticity detection dataset, where S2 contains multiword expressions in either idiomatic or literal sense. Models tested include GPT-2, OPT, and GPT-3 (ada, davinci) under zero-shot, few-shot (using 87 idiomatic and 53 literal examples per language), and fully supervised settings. Continuations are generated with sampling and evaluated using ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, and human relevance/grammaticality ratings.

## Key Results
- Models perform slightly better on literal than idiomatic contexts, but differences are not statistically significant.
- GPT-3 davinci consistently outperforms other models, with zero-shot settings often yielding best results.
- Performance is comparable across English and Portuguese despite differing resource levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Language models process idiomatic and literal multiword expressions similarly, with only minimal performance differences.
- **Mechanism:** The contextual embedding and generation capabilities of large language models allow them to capture both compositional and non-compositional meanings without strong bias toward either.
- **Core assumption:** Idiomatic and literal contexts provide sufficient distributional cues for the model to infer correct continuations in both cases.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Results show models perform slightly better on literal contexts than idiomatic ones, but the difference is very small and not statistically significant."
  - [section 5.1] "Overall, in both the language datasets and all three metrics, the literal continuations obtain slightly higher scores than idiomatic continuations... the lexical continuations are better than idiomatic continuations in only about half the scenarios or less."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus shows related works but no direct quantitative comparison of idiomatic vs literal performance.
- **Break condition:** If the model lacks sufficient training data containing idiomatic usages or if idiomatic expressions are highly culture-specific and under-represented.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Zero-shot prompting outperforms few-shot and fully supervised fine-tuning for idiomatic continuation generation.
- **Mechanism:** Large pre-trained models already encode rich linguistic patterns; additional fine-tuning on limited idiom-specific data can cause overfitting or distort the model's natural generalization.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-training corpus sufficiently covers idiomatic usage, making further specialization unnecessary or even harmful.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "GPT-3 davinci consistently outperforms other models, with zero-shot settings often yielding the best results."
  - [section 5.1] "Interestingly, the best results are obtained under the zero-shot setting (rather than few-shot setting) using the GPT-3 davinci model for both English and Portuguese."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus includes related works but none specifically compare zero-shot vs fine-tuning performance for idioms.
- **Break condition:** If the target domain idioms are highly specialized or rare, lacking coverage in pre-training data.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multilingual models perform comparably across high-resource and mid-resource languages for idiomatic tasks.
- **Mechanism:** Shared architectural and tokenization strategies (e.g., subword tokenization, multilingual embeddings) allow models to transfer idiomatic understanding across languages with similar scripts and structures.
- **Core assumption:** English and Portuguese share enough linguistic features (Latin script, SVO structure) for effective cross-lingual transfer in idiomatic processing.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Performance is comparable across English and Portuguese, despite differing resource levels."
  - [section 5.1] "In terms of comparing the performance of all LMs between the two different languages, it appears that the results are comparable... performance on English dataset is superior to that of Portuguese dataset by a maximum of 0.05 metric points."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus references multilingual idiom studies but not direct performance comparison of generative tasks.
- **Break condition:** If languages differ significantly in script, syntax, or cultural idiom usage, reducing transfer effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Multiword expressions and compositionality
  - **Why needed here:** The study hinges on distinguishing idiomatic (non-compositional) from literal (compositional) usages; understanding this distinction is key to interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** What makes an idiomatic expression different from a literal one in terms of meaning composition?

- **Concept:** Zero-shot vs few-shot vs fine-tuning
  - **Why needed here:** The experiments explicitly compare these training settings; knowing their differences is essential for interpreting performance claims.
  - **Quick check question:** How does zero-shot prompting differ from few-shot in terms of model exposure to task examples?

- **Concept:** Evaluation metrics for text generation
  - **Why needed here:** Results rely on ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore; understanding what each measures is critical for evaluating model quality.
  - **Quick check question:** Which metric would best capture semantic similarity rather than exact lexical overlap?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Sentence pairs (S1, S2) with multiword expression
  - Models: GPT-2, OPT, GPT-3 (ada, davinci)
  - Settings: Zero-shot, few-shot, fully supervised
  - Tokenizer: GPT2Tokenizer (for GPT-2/OPT)
  - Output: Generated continuation (S3′)
  - Evaluators: Automatic metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore), Human annotators

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load dataset and split into train/test per language
  2. Tokenize inputs for GPT-2/OPT; format prompts for GPT-3
  3. Generate continuations under each setting
  4. Compute automatic metrics against reference S3
  5. Conduct human evaluation on subset
  6. Analyze results across languages and settings

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using only S2 vs S1+S2 as context trades input simplicity for potential performance loss
  - Sampling with temperature > 0 increases diversity but may reduce coherence
  - GPT-3 access cost vs open-source alternatives (GPT-2, OPT) impacts feasibility

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Outputs longer than reference or containing HTML/erroneous symbols suggest generation instability
  - Consistent preference for literal over idiomatic may indicate model bias or data imbalance
  - Poor multilingual parity may reveal tokenization or representation issues

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Generate continuations for a small balanced idiomatic/literal sample in English using GPT-3 davinci zero-shot; verify output format and coherence.
  2. Compare GPT-2 vs OPT performance on Portuguese literal contexts under few-shot; check if training improves over zero-shot.
  3. Run human evaluation on 10 randomly selected English outputs; compare relevance scores between idiomatic and literal contexts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the type of multiword expression (e.g., idiom vs. other figurative language) significantly impact the model's ability to generate relevant continuations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on idiomatic expressions but mentions "multiword expressions" more broadly, suggesting other types of figurative language could be explored.
- Why unresolved: The study primarily examines idioms, leaving open whether other figurative language forms present similar or different challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with diverse figurative language types (e.g., metaphors, similes) and comparing results to those for idioms would clarify the impact of expression type.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the size and domain of the training data influence the model's performance on idiomatic versus literal contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that English is a higher-resource language than Portuguese, yet performance is comparable, suggesting data characteristics may play a role.
- Why unresolved: While resource levels are considered, the specific influence of data size and domain on idiomatic comprehension remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Varying the size and domain of training datasets and analyzing performance differences would elucidate the impact of data characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating additional contextual information, beyond the immediate sentence, improve the model's ability to generate coherent continuations for idiomatic contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of using limited context (only S2) versus full context (S1 and S2), noting a larger performance gap in English than Portuguese.
- Why unresolved: While the study examines context use, the potential benefits of incorporating broader contextual information are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating extended contextual information and comparing results to those with limited context would reveal the impact of broader context on performance.

## Limitations
- Lack of statistical significance testing for performance differences between idiomatic and literal contexts.
- Limited fine-tuning data (87 idiomatic, 53 literal examples) may confound comparisons between zero-shot and supervised settings.
- Human evaluation covers only a subset of English outputs with binary grammaticality checks.

## Confidence
- High: Models perform comparably across idiomatic and literal contexts (multiple metrics show minimal differences).
- Medium: Multilingual parity holds (small performance gaps but no statistical validation).
- Low: Superiority of zero-shot prompting (potential confounding factors in experimental design).

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical significance testing**: Apply paired t-tests or non-parametric equivalents to compare automatic metric scores between idiomatic and literal contexts across all models and settings, with 95% confidence intervals reported for all performance differences.

2. **Cross-linguistic generalization**: Test model performance on additional languages with varying resource levels (e.g., Spanish, Chinese) and idiom types (culture-specific vs. universal) to assess whether observed multilingual parity holds beyond Portuguese.

3. **Fine-tuning resource sensitivity**: Conduct a systematic ablation study varying the number of fine-tuning examples (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 200) to determine the minimum data threshold at which supervised learning overtakes zero-shot performance, and whether this threshold differs for idiomatic versus literal expressions.
