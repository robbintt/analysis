# An Event based Prediction Suffix Tree

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14944
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14944
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Introduces EPST algorithm that outperforms traditional sequence-based algorithms on event-based prediction tasks with noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Event-based Prediction Suffix Tree (EPST), a novel prediction algorithm designed for event-based data that learns models online and makes predictions over multiple overlapping patterns. The EPST uses a representation specific to event-based data defined as a portion of the power set of event subsequences within a short context window. The algorithm was evaluated on synthetic data with additive noise, event jitter, and dropout, demonstrating superior performance to traditional sequence-based algorithms while maintaining robustness to structured and random noise.

## Method Summary
The EPST learns online from event-based inputs using a power set decomposition of event subsequences within a short context window. The algorithm stores multiple subsequences and their delays in a tree data structure, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. It uses a matching interval method that stores exact event timings and allows configurable sensitivity to timing variations. The branch extension threshold hyperparameter controls tree growth rate, enabling one-shot learning while balancing pattern reliability. Training is spike-triggered, updating on receipt of events in the preferred channel.

## Key Results
- EPST demonstrated robustness to structured additive noise, random additive noise, and dropout with negligible accuracy reduction
- Event time jitter was identified as a challenge for EPST performance
- EPST's superior performance attributed to ability to track multiple trajectories in parallel and resistance to noise
- High performance during interference exemplifies EPST's "Multiple trajectory tracking" property

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** EPST's superior performance over traditional sequence-based algorithms is attributed to its ability to track multiple trajectories in parallel and its resistance to noise
- **Mechanism:** Uses power set decomposition of event subsequences within a short context window, storing multiple subsequences and their delays for redundancy and fault tolerance
- **Core assumption:** Power set representation of event-based data is more robust to noise and can track multiple patterns simultaneously compared to traditional algorithms
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract shows negligible accuracy reduction under noise; section describes multiple trajectory tracking property
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades if event-based data becomes too complex or exceeds probabilistic capacity

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** EPST's resistance to noise is due to its ability to store and match subsequences with configurable sensitivity to timing variations
- **Mechanism:** Uses matching interval method that stores exact event timings and matches subsequent patterns with configurable sensitivity to timing variations
- **Core assumption:** Matching interval method is more robust to noise than time bin methods that lose original timing information
- **Evidence anchors:** Section describes configurable sensitivity to timing variations; corpus lacks direct evidence
- **Break condition:** Overly wide matching intervals may cause false positives and degraded performance

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** EPST's one-shot learning capability is due to branch extension threshold hyperparameter that allows rapid tree growth when new patterns are encountered
- **Mechanism:** Branch extension threshold determines how quickly tree grows - lower threshold enables faster growth and one-shot learning
- **Core assumption:** Branch extension threshold critically balances learning speed against pattern reliability
- **Evidence anchors:** Section describes threshold as learning rate parameter trading off speed against reliability
- **Break condition:** Overly low threshold may cause rapid growth leading to overfitting and poor generalization

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Event-based data representation
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how event-based data is represented and processed by EPST is crucial for designing and implementing the algorithm
  - **Quick check question:** What is the main difference between event-based data and sequential symbolic data, and how does EPST handle this difference?

- **Concept:** Suffix trees and prediction
  - **Why needed here:** EPST is based on prediction suffix tree algorithm, so understanding how suffix trees work for prediction is essential
  - **Quick check question:** How does EPST adapt PST algorithm to handle event-based data, and what are key differences?

- **Concept:** Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
  - **Why needed here:** EPST has several hyperparameters that control behavior, so understanding how to tune them is critical for good performance
  - **Quick check question:** What are main hyperparameters of EPST, and how do they affect algorithm's performance and behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Event-based data input -> Power set decomposition of subsequences -> Tree data structure for storing subsequences and counts -> Probability estimation and prediction -> Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- **Critical path:** 1. Receive event-based data input 2. Decompose input into subsequences using power set operation 3. Store subsequences and counts in tree data structure 4. Estimate probabilities for each subsequence 5. Select most reliable subsequence using entropy heuristic 6. Output prediction based on selected subsequence
- **Design tradeoffs:** Tree size vs. learning speed (larger trees store more patterns but grow slowly); Matching interval vs. sensitivity to noise (wider intervals more robust but may cause false positives); Hyperparameter values vs. performance (choosing right values is critical)
- **Failure signatures:** Rapid tree growth leading to overfitting; False positives due to overly wide matching intervals; Poor performance under event jitter or dropout; Failure to learn patterns quickly enough due to high branch extension threshold
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Implement EPST with synthetic event-based data and compare performance to traditional VMM algorithms under structured and random noise conditions 2. Tune EPST hyperparameters to optimize performance on different event noise scenarios 3. Extend EPST with inhibition mechanism to handle XOR problems and improve robustness to structured noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper acknowledges several open questions including the need for testing on more complex and realistic datasets beyond simple synthetic examples, the computational mechanism behind EPST's robustness to noise and ability to track multiple trajectories, optimization for efficiency in runtime and storage complexity, extending EPST to handle longer-term dependencies similar to LSTM networks, and comprehensive comparison with other event-based prediction algorithms.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical evidence for specific mechanisms of multiple trajectory tracking and noise resistance
- Experimental comparisons restricted to synthetic datasets without real-world validation
- Connection to biological neural computation remains speculative without concrete neurophysiological evidence
- Computational efficiency concerns due to high runtime complexity not fully addressed

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Basic EPST architecture and ability to handle event-based data through power set decomposition
- **Medium confidence:** Noise resistance claims supported by experimental results but lacking mechanistic detail
- **Low confidence:** Biological plausibility arguments and specific claims about multiple trajectory tracking

## Next Checks

1. Implement the matching interval method with configurable sensitivity and conduct ablation studies to quantify its impact on noise resistance compared to time bin approaches
2. Test EPST on real-world event-based datasets (such as neuromorphic sensor data) to validate synthetic experiment findings
3. Conduct runtime and memory complexity analysis comparing EPST with PST and PPM-C under varying data stream conditions and pattern densities
