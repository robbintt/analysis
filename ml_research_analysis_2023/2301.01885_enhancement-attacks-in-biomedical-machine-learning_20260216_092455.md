# Enhancement attacks in biomedical machine learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.01885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01885
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Shows how dataset manipulations can falsely improve classifier performance while maintaining high feature similarity

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates how biomedical machine learning performance can be falsely enhanced through subtle data manipulations. The authors developed three techniques to manipulate datasets: within-dataset enhancement (improving classifier accuracy from 50% to 99% while maintaining feature correlations above 0.99), method-specific enhancement (making neural networks outperform simpler models by up to 50% while preserving data similarity), and cross-dataset enhancement (improving generalization accuracy by 18-38% while altering only 50 training points). These enhancement attacks present an ethical challenge for biomedical research by showing that impressive results can be achieved without actual scientific discovery, highlighting the need for robust data provenance tracking to ensure research integrity.

## Method Summary
The authors developed three enhancement attack techniques using gradient-based perturbations on biomedical datasets. Within-dataset enhancement iteratively perturbs held-out data points in the direction of model gradients to push samples toward correct classification boundaries while maintaining high feature similarity. Method-specific enhancement uses orthogonal gradient decomposition to make one model type outperform another while preventing transferability. Cross-dataset enhancement employs bilevel optimization to perturb training data based on generalization loss to an external dataset. The framework was tested on functional neuroimaging data from three large-scale studies using SVM, logistic regression, and neural network classifiers.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy improved from 50% to nearly 100% while maintaining Pearson correlations above 0.99
- Neural networks outperformed logistic regression by 17% on enhanced datasets despite no differences in original data
- Generalization accuracy increased by 18-38% after altering only 50 training points
- Enhancement attacks transferred between models but were designed to prevent unwanted transferability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Data perturbations in the direction of model gradients can drastically improve classification accuracy while maintaining high feature similarity. The enhancement framework iteratively perturbs held-out data points in the direction of the model's decision function gradient. This pushes samples toward the correct side of the decision boundary, making classification easier. Since the perturbation direction is consistent across samples (due to similar model coefficients when holding out few points), all samples of a class move coherently.

### Mechanism 2
Enhancement attacks can be targeted to make one model type outperform another while maintaining data similarity. By computing the orthogonal component of one model's gradient relative to another's, perturbations can enhance one model's performance without transferring the same benefit to the other. An additional suppression term further reduces the second model's performance.

### Mechanism 3
Cross-dataset enhancement can improve generalization accuracy by perturbing training data based on generalization loss. Using bilevel optimization, the framework perturbs training points to minimize loss on an external generalization dataset. Back-gradient descent approximates the necessary gradients for this optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gradient-based optimization
  - Why needed here: The enhancement framework relies on computing and following gradients of model decision functions to perturb data.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between a model's decision function and its gradient with respect to input features?

- Concept: Orthogonal decomposition of vectors
  - Why needed here: Method-specific enhancement requires finding the component of one gradient orthogonal to another to prevent transferability.
  - Quick check question: How do you compute the orthogonal component of vector v relative to vector u?

- Concept: Bilevel optimization
  - Why needed here: Cross-dataset enhancement requires optimizing training data while considering the impact on generalization performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between single-level and bilevel optimization problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing -> Model training -> Enhancement algorithms -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess dataset
  2. Train initial model(s) with cross-validation
  3. Apply enhancement algorithm (choose appropriate type)
  4. Evaluate performance and feature similarity
  5. Transfer to other models if testing transferability

- Design tradeoffs:
  - K-fold partitioning vs. leave-one-out: K-fold provides better computational efficiency but may have slightly different model coefficients
  - Enhancement scale vs. data similarity: Larger enhancement scales improve accuracy but may reduce Pearson correlation
  - Number of enhancement points vs. computational cost: More points provide better enhancement but increase computation time quadratically

- Failure signatures:
  - Enhancement fails to improve accuracy: Check gradient computation and normalization
  - Pearson correlation drops significantly: Reduce enhancement scale or check for implementation errors
  - Enhancement transfers between models when it shouldn't: Verify orthogonal decomposition implementation
  - Cross-dataset enhancement fails: Check generalization dataset quality and feature alignment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test within-dataset enhancement on a simple binary classification problem (e.g., MNIST) to verify basic functionality
  2. Test method-specific enhancement by comparing two different model types on the same dataset
  3. Implement cross-dataset enhancement using two related but distinct datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective are enhancement attacks on different types of biomedical datasets beyond functional neuroimaging? The authors note "Although our analysis was restricted to functional neuroimaging, these problems extend to the greater biomedical machine learning communities" and recommend future work should expand to other disciplines. This remains unresolved as the paper only tested enhancement attacks on functional neuroimaging data from three specific datasets.

### Open Question 2
What is the minimum number of data points that need to be altered to achieve significant enhancement across different model architectures? The paper explored different numbers of enhanced points but didn't systematically determine the minimum threshold needed for successful enhancement across various architectures.

### Open Question 3
Can method-specific enhancement attacks be successfully implemented between more complex architectures beyond simple linear models versus neural networks? The authors state "whether one complex architecture can be enhanced over another with subtle differences (i.e., using method enhancement) remains to be seen."

## Limitations

- Enhancement attacks may overfit to specific model architectures and datasets used in the study
- Gradient-based approach assumes stable model coefficients across K-fold partitions, which may not hold for all biomedical datasets
- Cross-dataset enhancement depends heavily on the quality and relevance of the generalization dataset, which may vary across applications

## Confidence

- High confidence: Demonstration that data perturbations can improve classification accuracy while maintaining feature similarity
- Medium confidence: Transferability of enhancement attacks between different model types
- Medium confidence: Cross-dataset enhancement approach and its dependency on generalization dataset quality

## Next Checks

1. Verify that model coefficients remain stable across K-fold partitions for various biomedical datasets by computing coefficient variance and correlation matrices
2. Systematically test method-specific enhancement across a broader range of model architectures to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate how different choices of generalization datasets affect cross-dataset enhancement performance, including testing with datasets from different domains or with varying feature spaces
