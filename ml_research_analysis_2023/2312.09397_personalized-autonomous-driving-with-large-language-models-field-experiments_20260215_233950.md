# Personalized Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models: Field Experiments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09397
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09397
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: LLM-based Talk2Drive framework achieves 100% command execution success and up to 90.1% reduction in takeover rates through personalized driving

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Talk2Drive, an LLM-based framework for personalized autonomous driving that translates verbal commands into executable vehicle controls while learning individual preferences through a memory module. The system successfully interprets commands at different intuition levels, from direct requests like "can you drive faster" to indirect expressions like "I am really in a hurry now." Field experiments on a real autonomous vehicle demonstrated the framework's effectiveness in executing generated codes with a 100% success rate while significantly reducing takeover rates compared to baseline driving.

The memory module, which stores historical human-vehicle interactions, was shown to further enhance personalization by reducing the takeover rate by up to 65.2% compared to the system without it. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in enabling intuitive, personalized human-vehicle interaction in autonomous driving scenarios, though the study involved a limited sample size of 7 drivers and relatively short evaluation periods.

## Method Summary
The Talk2Drive framework uses Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion, LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, PaLM-2) for command interpretation and code generation, and a memory module for storing historical interactions. The system generates ROS-compatible control codes that are verified for safety before execution through a drive-by-wire interface. Field experiments were conducted on a designated test track with diverse drivers to evaluate the system's performance in interpreting verbal commands at different directness levels and its ability to personalize driving based on learned preferences.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% success rate in executing generated control codes from LLM interpretations
- Reduced takeover rate by up to 90.1% compared to baseline driving without personalization
- Memory module further reduced takeover rate by up to 65.2% compared to system without memory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The memory module reduces takeover rates by learning individual preferences over time.
- Mechanism: Historical interaction data (commands, generated codes, feedback) is stored per user and used as context in subsequent LLM prompts, allowing the system to adapt to personal driving styles.
- Core assumption: Users' preferences remain consistent enough across sessions that past interactions are predictive of future needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The memory module... further reduces the takeover rate by up to 65.2% compared with those without a memory module."
  - [section III-E]: "Each interaction... is recorded and saved... This historical data... is updated after every trip."
  - [corpus]: Missing - no similar mechanisms found in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If user preferences change significantly between trips, the memory module's stored patterns become irrelevant and may even reduce performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs can interpret both direct and indirect verbal commands by leveraging their language understanding capabilities.
- Mechanism: The speech recognition module converts spoken commands into text, which LLMs process using reasoning to understand intent at different directness levels (direct commands, strong hints, mild hints).
- Core assumption: The LLM's training data includes sufficient examples of varied linguistic expressions to handle the range of command styles tested.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experiments showcase that the proposed system can comprehend human intentions at different intuition levels, ranging from direct commands... to indirect commands..."
  - [section V-D]: "All LLMs tested in our framework are capable of understanding speed commands for different categories of speed intention and accurately converting received commands into the required codes, achieving a success rate of 100% in the execution of these codes."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct comparison to other LLM-based command interpretation systems in the corpus.
- Break condition: If commands use domain-specific jargon or novel phrasings not well-represented in the LLM's training data, interpretation accuracy may drop significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Talk2Drive framework maintains safety while personalizing by implementing parameter verification on generated codes.
- Mechanism: Before code execution, the system checks both format validity and parameter appropriateness (e.g., speed limits), preventing execution of potentially dangerous commands.
- Core assumption: The verification logic can catch all safety-critical parameter violations without introducing significant latency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-D]: "Another safety check for the executing codes is parameter verification. It evaluates whether the given parameters are appropriate and safe for the current situation, and prevents the execution of codes that could potentially be dangerous."
  - [section V-D]: "The table reveals that the speed difference and mean acceleration do not substantially exceed the baseline levels, while the mean acceleration falls do not exceed the suggested threshold for the best riding experience."
  - [corpus]: Missing - no safety verification mechanisms described in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If verification logic is incomplete or parameters fall into edge cases not covered by the checks, unsafe commands could still be executed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speech-to-text conversion using Whisper API
  - Why needed here: Converts human verbal commands into textual format that LLMs can process
  - Quick check question: What would happen if speech recognition accuracy drops below 90% for common driving commands?

- Concept: Context integration from external APIs (weather, traffic, traffic rules)
  - Why needed here: Provides environmental context that helps LLMs make more informed driving decisions
  - Quick check question: How does the system handle API failures or missing data for any of these contextual sources?

- Concept: Pure pursuit path tracking algorithm
  - Why needed here: Translates LLM-generated control codes into actual vehicle steering and speed commands
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between look-ahead distance and vehicle stability at different speeds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Speech input → Whisper API → Text conversion → LLM processing (with memory context) → Code generation → Parameter verification → ROS-compatible control codes → Vehicle actuation

- Critical path: Speech input → Text conversion → LLM processing (with memory context) → Code generation → Parameter verification → Vehicle actuation

- Design tradeoffs: Real-time responsiveness vs. comprehensive reasoning - LLMs provide better personalization but add latency; memory module improves personalization but requires storage and retrieval overhead

- Failure signatures: Increased takeover rates indicate personalization failure; high latency suggests LLM processing or network issues; inconsistent speed control points to problems in code generation or execution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test speech recognition accuracy with different accents and background noise levels
  2. Validate LLM command interpretation across all three directness levels with controlled inputs
  3. Verify safety parameter checking by attempting to generate codes with intentionally unsafe parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of LLM latency on the overall safety and user experience of the autonomous driving system, and how can this latency be further minimized without compromising the system's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the latency of LLMs, noting that the most responsive LLM has a latency between approximately 1.8 to 2 seconds, and acknowledges the need for continued optimization to reduce latency for safety-critical applications.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the latency as a factor, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how this latency affects safety and user experience, nor does it explore potential methods for further minimizing latency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed studies on the correlation between LLM response times and real-world driving scenarios, including safety incidents or user feedback, would provide insights. Additionally, exploring advanced model optimization techniques or hardware improvements could offer solutions for reducing latency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Talk2Drive framework adapt to varying environmental conditions, such as adverse weather or unexpected road obstacles, and what are the limitations of its current adaptation mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the framework integrates real-time environmental data (e.g., weather updates, traffic conditions) into its decision-making process, but it does not delve into the system's performance under diverse or challenging environmental conditions.
- Why unresolved: The framework's adaptability to dynamic and potentially hazardous conditions is crucial for its practical deployment, yet the paper does not provide empirical evidence or detailed analysis of its performance in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting field tests in various environmental conditions, including simulations of adverse weather and unexpected obstacles, would reveal the framework's robustness and adaptability. Comparing these results with baseline systems would highlight its strengths and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential privacy and data security concerns associated with the memory module that stores historical human-vehicle interactions, and how can these concerns be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a memory module that records historical interactions to enhance personalization, but it does not address privacy or data security implications.
- Why unresolved: As the memory module stores detailed interaction data, there are inherent risks related to data privacy and security, which are not discussed in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the data storage and processing protocols for compliance with privacy regulations, along with implementing and testing encryption and anonymization techniques, would provide insights into mitigating potential security risks. Additionally, user studies on data privacy concerns could inform the development of more secure and transparent systems.

## Limitations
- Small sample size for personalization validation (only 7 human drivers, each completing 3 trips)
- Missing safety incident data - no explicit reporting of safety incidents or near-misses during field experiments
- Limited evaluation duration - each driver completed only 3 trips in a single session

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism of using LLMs to interpret verbal commands and generate executable control codes is well-supported by the experimental results, particularly the 100% success rate in code execution.
- Medium confidence: The personalization benefits attributed to the memory module are plausible given the reported takeover rate reductions, but the limited sample size and experimental duration reduce confidence in the magnitude of these improvements across diverse users and longer timeframes.
- Low confidence: The system's ability to handle safety-critical edge cases and unexpected scenarios is not thoroughly validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Longitudinal personalization study**: Conduct a multi-week field trial with 20+ drivers, each completing 15+ trips, to validate whether the memory module's personalization benefits persist and evolve over extended periods with changing preferences.

2. **Safety incident simulation**: Create a comprehensive test suite of edge-case verbal commands that push the boundaries of safety constraints, then measure the system's response rates, parameter verification effectiveness, and fallback behaviors.

3. **Cross-population generalization test**: Evaluate the system with drivers from diverse demographic backgrounds, including different age groups, cultural contexts, and driving experience levels, to assess whether the personalization mechanisms work equally well across populations or show systematic biases.
