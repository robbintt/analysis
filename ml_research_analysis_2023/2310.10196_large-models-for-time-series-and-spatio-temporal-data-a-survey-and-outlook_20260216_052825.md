## Executive Summary
This survey presents the first comprehensive overview of large models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, covering both language models and pre-trained foundation models. The work introduces a novel taxonomy categorizing existing literature into two main clusters: large models for time series data (LM4TS) and large models for spatio-temporal data (LM4STD), further divided by model types (LLMs vs. PFMs) and scopes (general vs. domain-specific). The survey identifies key research directions including multimodal model development, continuous learning, interpretability, and privacy-preserving techniques, while compiling extensive resources across various applications.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a comprehensive literature review of large models applied to time series and spatio-temporal data analysis. It categorizes existing work into two major clusters (LM4TS and LM4STD) based on data types, model categories, scopes, and application domains. The methodology involves systematic analysis of 25+ related papers, identification of representative tasks and approaches, and compilation of resources including datasets, tools, and model checkpoints. The work synthesizes findings across different data types including time series, spatio-temporal graphs, temporal knowledge graphs, and videos.

## Key Results
- Introduced first unified taxonomy for large models in time series and spatio-temporal data analysis
- Identified four key research directions: multimodal models, continuous learning, interpretability, and privacy-preserving techniques
- Compiled extensive resources including datasets, tools, and model checkpoints across multiple application domains
- Highlighted opportunities for future research in adapting large models to complex temporal patterns and multiple data modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Large language models (LLMs) can be repurposed for time series forecasting by converting numerical data into natural language prompts, leveraging their sequence modeling strengths.
- **Mechanism:** The numerical time series is tokenized and encoded into natural language sentences, which are then fed into an LLM. The LLM's sequence modeling capabilities, originally developed for text, are applied to capture temporal patterns in the encoded time series.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying patterns in time series data are sufficiently similar to the sequential patterns found in natural language, allowing an LLM trained on text to generalize to temporal data.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We offer a comprehensive and up-to-date review of large models tailored (or adapted) for time series and spatio-temporal data, spanning four key facets: data types, model categories, model scopes, and application areas/tasks."
  - [section] "In this paper, we fulfill this need by providing a unified comprehensive and up-to-date survey of large models dedicated to time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, encompassing both LLMs and PFMs across different data types, scopes, application domains, and representative tasks."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.412, suggesting moderate relevance but some gaps in direct evidence.
- **Break condition:** The model fails when temporal patterns in time series are too dissimilar from linguistic sequences, or when the encoding process loses critical temporal information.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) can enhance spatio-temporal graph learning by transferring learned representations, improving the ability to capture intricate patterns.
- **Mechanism:** PFMs, trained on large-scale datasets, learn general representations that can be transferred to spatio-temporal graphs. This transfer allows the models to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies more effectively than models trained from scratch.
- **Core assumption:** The representations learned by PFMs on large datasets contain generalizable features that are applicable to spatio-temporal graphs across various domains.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Such methodologies not only enable enhanced pattern recognition and reasoning across diverse domains but also lay the groundwork for artificial general intelligence capable of comprehending and processing common temporal data."
  - [section] "We primarily categorize the existing literature into two major clusters: large models for time series analysis (LM4TS) and spatio-temporal data mining (LM4STD)."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; some papers like "Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Data Science: A Tutorial and Survey" support this mechanism, but others are less directly relevant.
- **Break condition:** The model fails when the domain-specific characteristics of spatio-temporal graphs are too unique, making the transferred representations less effective.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multimodal models can integrate supplementary information like text descriptions with time series data, enhancing forecasting accuracy in domains like finance and economics.
- **Mechanism:** Multimodal models process both the numerical time series data and associated textual information (e.g., news articles, tweets) simultaneously. The model learns joint representations that consider the sequential nature of temporal data and the unique characteristics of other modalities, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **Core assumption:** The textual information provides additional context that is relevant to the time series data, and the multimodal model can effectively learn the relationships between the modalities.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Combining the study of these two intrinsically linked broad data types is crucial, as they are both pervasive and can be sourced from a diverse range of platforms, such as sensors [25], [26], financial market transactions [27]."
  - [section] "Time series and spatio-temporal data often share similarities in terms of data structure and analytical methods."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; some papers like "How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook" support this mechanism, but others are less directly relevant.
- **Break condition:** The model fails when the textual information is not relevant to the time series data, or when the model cannot effectively learn the relationships between the modalities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Understanding the difference between large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained foundation models (PFMs).
  - **Why needed here:** The survey distinguishes between LLMs and PFMs, highlighting their different strengths and applications in time series and spatio-temporal data analysis.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary difference between an LLM and a PFM in the context of time series analysis?

- **Concept:** Familiarity with time series and spatio-temporal data definitions and tasks.
  - **Why needed here:** The survey defines time series and spatio-temporal data and outlines their representative tasks, providing a foundation for understanding the applications of large models.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the four principal analytical tasks in time series analysis?

- **Concept:** Knowledge of spatio-temporal graphs (STGs) and temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs).
  - **Why needed here:** The survey focuses on STGs and TKGs as key data types, requiring an understanding of their structure and tasks for effective analysis with large models.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the two main tasks in temporal knowledge graphs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Data Types: Time series, Spatio-temporal graphs, Temporal knowledge graphs, Videos
  - Model Categories: LLMs, PFMs
  - Model Scopes: General-purpose, Domain-specific
  - Application Domains/Tasks: Forecasting, Classification, Anomaly Detection, Imputation, etc.

- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify the data type and task
  2. Select the appropriate model category (LLM or PFM)
  3. Determine the model scope (general-purpose or domain-specific)
  4. Implement the model and evaluate its performance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLMs vs. PFMs: LLMs are better for tasks that benefit from natural language understanding, while PFMs are better for tasks that require domain-specific knowledge
  - General-purpose vs. Domain-specific: General-purpose models are more flexible but may not perform as well on specific tasks, while domain-specific models are more specialized but less adaptable

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance on specific tasks despite high general accuracy
  - Inability to handle domain-specific nuances or data characteristics
  - Overfitting to training data, leading to poor generalization

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test LLM-based time series forecasting on a simple dataset (e.g., METR-LA) to validate the mechanism of converting numerical data to natural language prompts
  2. Evaluate PFM-based spatio-temporal graph learning on a traffic forecasting dataset to assess the effectiveness of representation transfer
  3. Experiment with multimodal models on a finance dataset that includes both time series and textual data to measure the impact of integrating supplementary information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can large language models (LLMs) effectively capture long-term dependencies in time series data that differ significantly from natural language sequences?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses extending LLMs to handle time series tasks but notes this is a "very high-level understanding" and highlights the need for deeper theoretical analysis.
- **Why unresolved:** Current understanding of LLMs for time series is superficial, lacking rigorous theoretical frameworks explaining how language sequence patterns translate to temporal data patterns.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal mathematical proofs or extensive empirical studies demonstrating how LLM attention mechanisms map to temporal dependencies in diverse time series domains.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the optimal strategies for enabling continuous learning and adaptation of large models on non-stationary time series data without catastrophic forgetting?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies this as an under-explored problem, noting the need for research on online learning, concept drift adaptation, and evolving pattern accommodation.
- **Why unresolved:** While some research exists on continual learning for traditional ML models, specific methods for large models on streaming temporal data remain undeveloped.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Novel algorithms demonstrating successful lifelong learning on real-world time series streams with dynamic patterns and concept drift.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can privacy-preserving techniques be effectively integrated with large models for time series analysis while maintaining performance on sensitive applications like healthcare and finance?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper highlights privacy risks when LLMs are trained on sensitive temporal data and identifies this as a key research opportunity.
- **Why unresolved:** Balancing differential privacy or federated learning constraints with the computational demands and performance requirements of large models remains challenging.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies showing privacy-utility tradeoffs and practical implementations of large models on private temporal datasets achieving acceptable performance.

## Limitations
- Rapidly evolving research landscape may not capture all recent developments
- Some methods may span multiple taxonomy categories, creating classification ambiguity
- Performance comparisons across different approaches are challenging due to varying datasets and evaluation metrics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Comprehensive coverage of existing literature on large models for time series and spatio-temporal data
- **Medium Confidence:** Identified research directions are logical extensions of current trends but may not capture all emerging opportunities
- **Low Confidence:** Specific performance claims and benchmark results across different methods should be verified independently

## Next Checks
1. Replicate Key Mechanisms: Select 2-3 representative methods from each major category (LLMs for time series, PFMs for spatio-temporal graphs, multimodal approaches) and reproduce their core results on standardized benchmark datasets.
2. Taxonomy Validation: Apply the proposed taxonomy to a set of recent papers not included in the survey to test its coverage and identify any gaps or misclassifications.
3. Gap Analysis: Conduct a systematic search for papers published after the survey's completion to identify emerging trends that may warrant inclusion in future updates.
