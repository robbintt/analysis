# Unifying Structure and Language Semantic for Efficient Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Structured Entity Anchors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04250
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: SEA-KGC achieves competitive performance on KGC benchmarks using entity anchors and contrastive learning with uniform random negatives

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEA-KGC, a method that unifies textual and structural information for knowledge graph completion (KGC). The approach uses entity anchors to represent entities as linear combinations of a small set of fixed vectors, which are combined with textual descriptions in a PLM-based encoder to learn unified representations. SEA-KGC employs contrastive learning with both in-batch and uniform random negative samples to improve generalization. Experiments on FB15K-237, WN18RR, and Wikidata5M show SEA-KGC outperforms state-of-the-art text-based methods and is competitive with structure-based ones, especially on FB15K-237 (MRR 36.7) and Wikidata5M (MRR 73.0 inductive).

## Method Summary
SEA-KGC combines entity anchors with PLM-based text encoding for KGC. Entities are represented as linear combinations of fixed anchor vectors, initialized via clustering or randomly. The model uses a PLM (BERT) to encode text plus anchor sequences, learning unified representations. Training employs three losses: InfoNCE for semantic alignment, logistic loss for structure-based KGE, and MSE/margin losses to align unified and structure embeddings. The method uses both in-batch and uniform random negative sampling to improve contrastive learning generalization.

## Key Results
- Achieves MRR of 36.7 on FB15K-237, outperforming text-based SOTAs
- Achieves MRR of 73.0 on Wikidata5M inductive setting
- Ablation shows random negatives and anchor initialization are critical for performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using entity anchors allows the model to represent entities as linear combinations of a small set of fixed vectors, enabling both structure and text integration without losing inductive reasoning.
- Mechanism: Entity embeddings are decomposed into weighted sums of anchor vectors. The anchors are trained via structure-based KGE and reused in the PLM-based encoder, allowing unseen entities to be represented using the same anchors.
- Core assumption: A small number of representative anchors can approximate all entity embeddings effectively, and anchors remain fixed across seen and unseen entities.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We adopt entity anchors and these anchors and textual description of KG elements are fed together into the PLM-based encoder to learn unified representations." [section 3.1.1] "All entities are described into their name or description text. Each structure entity anchor is treated as special token which is part of word embeddings." [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct neighbor citations on anchor-based decomposition.
- Break condition: If anchors fail to span the embedding space, unseen entities cannot be accurately represented, breaking inductive capability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-batch negative sampling introduces bias because negatives follow training data distribution, limiting contrastive learning generalization.
- Mechanism: Additional uniform random negatives are sampled from the entire entity set and combined with in-batch negatives to provide more diverse contrastive examples.
- Core assumption: Random negatives from the full entity set provide more informative negative signals than in-batch negatives alone.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.3] "we argue that in-batch negative sampling may introduce a bias that the negative samples follow the training data distribution." [section 3.3] "We address this issue by adding uniform random negative sampling strategy and we can take remarkable performance gains." [corpus] No corpus evidence; stated as experimental finding in paper.
- Break condition: If uniform negatives are too easy (e.g., far from positive), they provide little learning signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fusing structure and text via shared anchors and alignment losses improves KGC performance over text-only models while preserving inductive reasoning.
- Mechanism: Anchors capture structure; PLM encodes text; alignment losses (MSE + margin) pull unified embeddings into the same space as structure embeddings.
- Core assumption: Joint optimization of structure and text embeddings yields representations that benefit from both modalities.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "the proposed method utilizes additional random negative samples which can be reused in the each mini-batch during contrastive learning to learn a generalized entity representations." [section 3.4] "We define a loss La that aligns the representations created by anchors with the representations created by text encoding in the structure embedding space." [corpus] Weak evidence; neighbor papers focus on different KGC variants without anchor alignment.
- Break condition: If alignment loss overwhelms either modality, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge graph completion (KGC)
  - Why needed here: Understanding KGC sets the task context and evaluation metrics (MRR, Hit@N).
  - Quick check question: What is the goal of KGC and how are predictions evaluated?

- Concept: Contrastive learning and InfoNCE loss
  - Why needed here: The model uses contrastive learning to align unified and structure embeddings; understanding the loss is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does InfoNCE loss encourage positive pairs and discourage negatives?

- Concept: Entity embeddings and decomposition
  - Why needed here: Anchors decompose entity embeddings; knowing how embeddings work is essential for understanding the anchor mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between entity embeddings, anchors, and transformation matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text+anchor sequence -> PLM encoder -> unified embedding -> InfoNCE loss + alignment losses -> structure KGE -> logistic loss -> total loss
- Critical path: Text+anchor sequence → PLM → unified embedding → InfoNCE loss + alignment losses → structure KGE → logistic loss → total loss
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Anchors reduce memory but may lose fine-grained entity distinctions
  - Uniform negatives increase diversity but add computational cost
  - Alignment loss helps fusion but risks over-regularization
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor MRR/Hit@N: likely anchor or alignment issues
  - High training loss but low validation: overfitting or negative sampling bias
  - Slow convergence: learning rate or temperature issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: train with in-batch negatives only, no anchors
  2. Add uniform random negatives to assess improvement
  3. Add anchors with random initialization to measure structural contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of entity anchors for SEA-KGC on large-scale knowledge graphs, and how does it affect the trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that performance saturates when the number of anchors exceeds 10, but this may change when training on much larger KGs.
- Why unresolved: The paper only experiments with a small number of anchors (3, 5, 10, 20, 50) and does not explore the optimal number for very large KGs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on larger KGs with varying numbers of anchors, measuring both performance and computational cost.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of KGE function (e.g., TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE) impact the overall performance of SEA-KGC, and are there specific KGs where one function outperforms others?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper experiments with different KGE functions but notes that TransE performs best, suggesting that hyperparameter optimization for each function might yield improved results.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly explores the impact of different KGE functions and does not conduct a thorough hyperparameter optimization for each.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments on various KGs with different KGE functions, including hyperparameter tuning for each function.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can SEA-KGC be further improved by incorporating larger language models, and what are the potential trade-offs in terms of computational cost and performance gains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the potential of using larger language models as future work, indicating that this could be a direction for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with larger language models and does not discuss the potential trade-offs of doing so.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing SEA-KGC with different sizes of language models, measuring both performance and computational cost.

## Limitations
- The entity anchor decomposition mechanism assumes a small set of fixed vectors can effectively span the embedding space for both seen and unseen entities, but this is untested beyond reported datasets.
- The claim about in-batch negative sampling bias is supported only by experimental results in this paper, without citation to prior work or theoretical justification.
- Computational cost increase from PLM usage is acknowledged but not quantified, making it difficult to assess practical deployment tradeoffs.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core architecture design (anchors + PLM + contrastive learning) is well-specified and the reported performance metrics are internally consistent.
- **Medium confidence**: The ablation studies showing the importance of random negatives and anchor initialization are convincing within the experimental scope but may not generalize to other datasets or domains.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim of inductive reasoning capability is supported by Wikidata5M results but lacks direct comparison to other inductive methods on the same benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Anchor robustness test**: Evaluate SEA-KGC performance when anchors are initialized randomly versus via clustering, and measure how performance degrades as the number of anchors decreases below the reported 300.

2. **Negative sampling analysis**: Systematically vary the ratio of in-batch to uniform random negatives and measure the tradeoff between performance gains and computational overhead to validate the claimed bias reduction.

3. **Inductive generalization stress test**: Create a new train/test split where test entities have zero structural overlap with training entities (no shared neighbors) to more rigorously test the claimed inductive reasoning capability.
