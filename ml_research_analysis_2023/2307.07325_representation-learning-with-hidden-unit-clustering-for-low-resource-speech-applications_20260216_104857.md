# Representation Learning With Hidden Unit Clustering For Low Resource Speech Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07325
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: HUC framework achieves state-of-the-art results on 7/8 ZeroSpeech 2021 subtasks and improves TIMIT PER by 9.2% relative to CPC-big baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a self-supervised representation learning framework using Hidden Unit Clustering (HUC) for low-resource speech applications. The approach processes raw audio through 1-D convolutional and LSTM layers to generate contextual representations, which are then clustered using k-means to generate pseudo-phoneme labels. A data sampling technique selects utterances from diverse pseudo-speaker clusters to improve speaker invariance. The model is trained using a combination of clustering and contrastive losses. Experiments on ZeroSpeech 2021 tasks show state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 subtasks, with significant improvements over baselines like Wav2vec, HuBERT, and Best-RQ.

## Method Summary
The method processes raw audio through 1-D convolutional layers followed by LSTM layers to generate context vectors. These vectors are mean-normalized and clustered using k-means to create pseudo-phoneme labels. A data sampling algorithm selects utterances from the most distant pseudo-speaker centroids to ensure diversity. The model is trained using a combination of HUC loss (cross-entropy for pseudo-phoneme prediction) and CPC loss (contrastive loss for future frame prediction), with a regularization parameter λ controlling their balance. Dimensionality reduction is applied to retain only the most predictive dimensions of the context vectors.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 out of 8 ZeroSpeech 2021 subtasks
- Improves TIMIT phoneme recognition PER by 9.2% relative to CPC-big baseline
- Improves GramVaani Hindi ASR WER by 9.9% relative to Wav2vec on test set
- Reduces training time by 1.5x compared to Best-RQ while maintaining superior performance
- Shows improved robustness to noise and transformations compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hidden Unit Clustering (HUC) forces speech representations to be more categorical and speaker-invariant. By clustering context vectors into pseudo-phoneme labels and using cross-entropy loss to predict these labels, the model learns representations that are discriminative and consistent across speakers. The mean normalization of context vectors removes speaker-level information, further enforcing speaker invariance. Core assumption: Clustering context vectors into discrete phoneme-like units captures the semantic structure of speech while ignoring speaker identity.

### Mechanism 2
Data sampling from diverse pseudo-speaker clusters improves the consistency and conciseness of pseudo-phoneme classes. By selecting utterances from the most distant pseudo-speaker centroids for clustering, the model ensures that the pseudo-phoneme classes are both broad enough to represent different speakers and concise enough to capture fine acoustic distinctions. Core assumption: Sampling from diverse pseudo-speakers ensures that the pseudo-phoneme clusters are not biased toward any particular speaker's characteristics.

### Mechanism 3
Combining HUC loss with CPC loss balances categorical learning and predictive power, improving semantic richness. The HUC loss encourages categorical clustering of representations, while the CPC loss maintains the ability to predict future frames, preventing over-fitting to the clustering labels. Core assumption: The combination of clustering and predictive losses leads to representations that are both semantically rich and useful for downstream tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-supervised learning from raw audio**: Enables the model to learn useful speech representations without requiring transcribed data, which is crucial for low-resource applications. Quick check: Can the model learn meaningful speech representations without any labeled data?

- **Clustering and quantization for discrete speech unit discovery**: Clustering context vectors into pseudo-phoneme units allows the model to learn categorical representations that capture the semantic structure of speech. Quick check: Does the clustering process capture meaningful phonetic units that are consistent across different speakers?

- **Speaker invariance in speech representations**: Speaker-invariant representations are essential for tasks like phoneme recognition and spoken language modeling, where the focus is on the content rather than the speaker's identity. Quick check: Do the learned representations capture semantic information while being invariant to speaker variations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw audio -> 1-D convolutional layers -> LSTM layers -> Context vectors -> Mean normalization -> Data sampling from pseudo-speaker clusters -> K-means clustering -> Pseudo-phoneme labels -> HUC + CPC loss training -> Dimensionality reduction

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Pre-train the CPC model on Librispeech to generate initial context vectors
  2. Compute utterance-level means of context vectors and cluster them into pseudo-speaker centroids
  3. Sample utterances from diverse pseudo-speaker clusters and cluster their mean-normalized context vectors into pseudo-phoneme labels
  4. Train the HUC model with the regularized loss function to predict pseudo-phoneme labels
  5. Apply dimensionality reduction to retain only the most predictive dimensions of the context vectors

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Number of clusters (k): Larger numbers capture finer distinctions but may lead to overfitting
  - Regularization factor (λ): Higher weight for HUC loss improves categorical learning but may reduce predictive power
  - Number of pseudo-speaker clusters (N): Larger numbers ensure more diversity but may lead to less focused pseudo-phoneme classes

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on downstream tasks indicates representations are not semantically rich or speaker-invariant
  - High speaker classification accuracy indicates the model has not successfully removed speaker information
  - Low cluster purity of pseudo-phoneme labels indicates the clustering process has not captured meaningful phonetic units

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the HUC model with different values of regularization factor (λ) and evaluate ABX metric on ZeroSpeech development set
  2. Experiment with different numbers of pseudo-speaker clusters (N) for data sampling and evaluate ABX metric
  3. Apply dimensionality reduction to context vectors and evaluate impact on ABX metric and downstream tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal number of pseudo-speaker clusters (N) for different languages and datasets beyond LibriSpeech? The paper mentions N is a hyperparameter set through validation experiments on ZeroSpeech development data, with N=30 found optimal for Librispeech. This remains unresolved because the paper only tests on English data; different languages with varying phonetic inventories and speaker diversity may require different optimal values. Systematic experiments varying N across multiple languages/datasets while measuring ABX scores and downstream task performance would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How does the proposed HUC framework perform on languages with non-phonemic orthographies or tonal languages? The paper focuses on English and Hindi ASR tasks, both using phonemic orthographies, and doesn't address tonal languages or languages without clear phoneme boundaries. This remains unresolved because tonal languages have additional acoustic dimensions beyond segmental phonemes, and languages with non-phonemic scripts may require different clustering approaches. Experiments on Mandarin, Thai, or languages with abjad scripts measuring both semantic and non-semantic task performance would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
What is the theoretical relationship between the number of HUC units (k) and the granularity of acoustic units that can be effectively discovered? The paper empirically finds k=200 optimal but doesn't provide theoretical justification for this relationship or explore the trade-offs systematically. This remains unresolved because the paper shows empirical results but doesn't explain why certain values of k work better or how this relates to the underlying acoustic structure of speech. Analysis connecting k to measures of acoustic variability, comparison with established phonetic inventories, and theoretical models explaining the optimal range would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Heavy dependence on hyperparameter tuning, particularly the regularization factor λ and number of pseudo-speaker clusters N, which are not thoroughly explored across different datasets
- Reduced performance on speaker and emotion recognition tasks, indicating a fundamental trade-off in the learned representations that is not fully addressed
- Limited analysis of why certain configurations work better than others, despite showing significant performance improvements

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that HUC improves semantic richness for low-resource speech applications is well-supported by quantitative results showing state-of-the-art performance on 7 out of 8 ZeroSpeech 2021 subtasks
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which speaker invariance is achieved through mean normalization and data sampling is supported by results but lacks detailed ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that combining HUC and CPC losses improves performance is supported by results but the optimal balance appears to be task-dependent and not fully characterized

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of mean normalization, data sampling, and CPC regularization to the overall performance improvements

2. Evaluate the learned representations on a wider range of downstream tasks including speaker and emotion recognition to better characterize the trade-offs in the representation space

3. Test the model's robustness to different languages and acoustic conditions beyond the datasets used in the paper to assess generalizability to truly low-resource scenarios
