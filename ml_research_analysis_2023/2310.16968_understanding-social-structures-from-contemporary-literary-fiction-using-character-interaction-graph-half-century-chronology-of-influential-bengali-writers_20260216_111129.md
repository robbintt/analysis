# Understanding Social Structures from Contemporary Literary Fiction using Character Interaction Graph -- Half Century Chronology of Influential Bengali Writers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16968
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16968
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Character interaction graphs reveal how historical events and social changes are reflected in Bengali literature over half a century, showing significant influence of major events on character demographics and relationships.

## Executive Summary
This study constructs character interaction graphs from 63 novels by five prominent Bengali writers to analyze how social structures and historical events are represented in literature from 1865-1935. By extracting graph features, sentiment scores, and character attributes, the authors demonstrate that major historical events like the widow remarriage law and nationalist movements significantly influenced character presence and interactions. The methodology successfully reveals how literary works mirror societal changes and authors' perspectives on contemporary social issues.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves constructing character interaction graphs using co-occurrence within narrative segments, extracting graph features including node weights, degrees, and density, performing sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and applying statistical significance tests. Characters are manually annotated with attributes including gender, age group, and role. The study analyzes how historical events influenced character development and prominence, examining the impact of age and gender groups on literature, and interpreting character presence and graph structure based on story context and genre.

## Key Results
- Historical events like the widow remarriage law (1872) and nationalist movements significantly influenced character presence and interactions in Bengali literature
- Female characters receive substantial narrative weight despite lower overall presence in the novels
- Graph structure varies by genre, with romantic novels showing dense or sparse networks and political novels maintaining high density
- Older age groups' influence declines post-1916, with age group A3 (55+) showing statistically significant decrease in aggregated weight

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Character interaction graphs capture social structure influence from real-world events.
- Mechanism: Historical events like the widow remarriage law (1872) and nationalist movements shift character demographics and relationships in the narrative graph, making these influences quantifiable through changes in node weight, degree, and edge structure.
- Core assumption: Authors embed their societal perspectives into character interactions in ways that are reflected in network topology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "major historical events like the widow remarriage law and nationalist movements significantly influenced character presence and interactions"
  - [section 5.1]: "The Brahma Marriage Act of 1872, which lifted the ban on widow remarriage, notably influenced Bankim's works"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, average neighbor FMR=0.421, indicating moderate relatedness in computational literary analysis literature.
- Break condition: If authors do not consciously or unconsciously encode social perspectives into character dynamics, or if the text preprocessing fails to capture relevant character mentions accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph features like node weight and degree reveal age and gender group influence in fiction.
- Mechanism: By segmenting characters into age groups (A1, A2, A3) and genders, and measuring their aggregated node weights and degrees, we can infer their narrative prominence and societal influence as depicted by the author.
- Core assumption: Narrative weight (importance) correlates with character influence and societal representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "For character nodes, we consider a range of manual attributes, including protagonist status (protagonist/antagonist/regular), gender (male/female), age group"
  - [section 4]: "Table 2 demonstrates the proportion of different age & gender groups and the mean (over stories) of aggregated weight ω across various groups"
  - [corpus]: Related papers on character networks and literary analysis show this is a recognized approach in computational narratology.
- Break condition: If the manual age/gender annotation is inconsistent or if the weighting formula does not accurately reflect narrative importance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph structure (density, node count) reflects genre context and social setting.
- Mechanism: Different genres (romantic, political, historical) produce distinct network topologies; for example, romantic novels show either small dense or large sparse networks, while political novels maintain high density regardless of node count.
- Core assumption: Genre conventions dictate typical character interaction patterns that manifest as graph structural properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4]: "Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between graph density and node count across different genres. Romantic novels exhibit either small, dense networks... Political novels exhibit higher graph density"
  - [section 5.3]: "Similarly, genre shapes the character presence and graph structure in fiction"
  - [corpus]: Presence of papers on genre classification using character networks (e.g., Ardanuy and Sporleder 2015) supports this mechanism.
- Break condition: If genre does not significantly constrain character interaction patterns, or if other factors (like author style) override genre effects.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for character identification
  - Why needed here: To accurately detect and list characters in Bengali literary text, which standard NER tools may not handle well due to domain specificity.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper handle NER limitations for Bengali fiction? (Answer: Manual annotation combined with BNLP toolkit, cross-verification, and adding suffixes/inflections)

- Concept: Graph theory basics (nodes, edges, weights, density)
  - Why needed here: To construct and analyze character interaction graphs where nodes represent characters and edges represent interactions.
  - Quick check question: What factors contribute to node weight in the character interaction graph? (Answer: Segment length, number of times character is addressed, scaling factor for segment count)

- Concept: Statistical significance testing (two-sample t-test)
  - Why needed here: To validate whether observed differences in graph features between age/gender groups are statistically significant.
  - Quick check question: Which test is used to assess significance of differences in character attributes? (Answer: Independent two-sample t-test)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Text preprocessing -> Character identification -> Interaction detection -> Graph construction -> Feature extraction -> Analysis/visualization
  External: Bengali NLP toolkit (BNLP), BERT model for sentiment, LDA for topic modeling, manual annotation interface

- Critical path:
  1. Character identification and segmentation of text into sentences/chapters
  2. Interaction detection via co-occurrence within segments
  3. Graph generation with weighted nodes/edges
  4. Feature extraction (sentiment, topic, structural metrics)
  5. Statistical analysis and visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual vs automated character annotation: Accuracy vs scalability
  - Sentence vs paragraph as interaction unit: Granularity vs noise
  - Static vs dynamic graphs: Snapshot analysis vs narrative evolution
  - Weighted vs unweighted edges: Nuance vs simplicity

- Failure signatures:
  - Missing characters → Incomplete graph representation
  - Incorrect sentiment scores → Mischaracterized character dynamics
  - Low graph density → Possible text preprocessing errors
  - Non-significant statistical tests → Weak effect of social factors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify character detection accuracy by comparing automated list vs manual annotation on a sample chapter
  2. Test different interaction thresholds (δA, δB) and observe impact on graph density and structure
  3. Run sentiment analysis on a known emotional passage to validate model output

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do character interaction graphs differ between children's literature and adult fiction in Bengali literature?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "Relation among children is very rare for all authors since none of these are children specific fiction" and that "male children have always received less attention in Bengali literary fiction."
- Why unresolved: The study did not include children's literature in its analysis, focusing instead on novels by prominent adult writers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing character interaction graphs from a dataset of Bengali children's literature to compare structural differences and character dynamics with adult fiction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do character interaction patterns change when analyzing individual chapters versus entire novels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The methodology states they "combine the chapter-level graphs to create the ultimate story graph" and create "static graphs (story-wise)" but acknowledge that "Future research avenues could explore the dynamics of character interaction, sentiment, and weight changes throughout the narrative."
- Why unresolved: The study focused on static, story-level graphs rather than dynamic, chapter-level analysis, leaving questions about narrative evolution unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a longitudinal analysis tracking character interactions, sentiments, and weights across chapters within individual novels to identify patterns of narrative development.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the inclusion of more contemporary writers and diverse chronological periods affect the observed trends in character interactions and social structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Our future plans also expand our dataset to encompass more writers and diverse chronological periods" and acknowledge their dataset is "limited to five writers."
- Why unresolved: The study's dataset is limited to five writers spanning 1865-1935, potentially missing important shifts in literary representation and social commentary in later periods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing character interaction graphs from Bengali novels published in the post-independence era (1947-present) to identify shifts in gender representation, age dynamics, and social commentary.

## Limitations
- Manual character annotation introduces potential subjectivity in age and gender classification, with no inter-annotator agreement metrics provided
- The study cannot definitively prove causation versus correlation between historical events and character representation changes
- The Bangla-BERT model's performance on literary Bengali text is not validated, raising concerns about sentiment analysis accuracy

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Genre-specific graph structures (dense vs. sparse networks) are well-supported by clear visualizations and consistent patterns across multiple authors.

**Medium confidence**: Claims connecting specific historical events to character representation changes are supported by temporal alignment and statistical significance testing.

**Low confidence**: Interpretation of sentiment score variations across character groups requires more validation, as the Bangla-BERT model's performance on literary Bengali text may differ from its training domain.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator reliability testing on a subset of novels to quantify the consistency of manual character attribute annotations, particularly age group classification which showed the most variation across time periods.

2. Perform ablation studies by systematically varying the interaction detection thresholds (δA, δB, δC) to assess the robustness of observed graph structural patterns and their relationship to genre and historical context.

3. Validate the Bangla-BERT sentiment analysis outputs against human-annotated sentiment labels on a stratified sample of passages representing different emotional contexts and character types to ensure the model captures nuanced literary expressions accurately.
