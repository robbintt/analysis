# CholecTrack20: A Multi-Perspective Tracking Dataset for Surgical Tools

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.07352
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07352
- Reference count: 40
- Current state-of-the-art tracking methods achieve less than 45% HOTA performance on this dataset, highlighting the need for advanced tracking algorithms.

## Executive Summary
CholecTrack20 addresses the lack of context-rich surgical tool tracking datasets by introducing three distinct tracking perspectives: intraoperative (lifelong), intracorporeal (in-body), and visibility (on-screen). The dataset includes 20 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos with over 35,000 annotated frames and 65,000 tool instances, capturing tool spatial location, category, identity, operator, surgical phase, and visual challenges. Current state-of-the-art tracking methods achieve less than 45% HOTA performance on this dataset, highlighting the need for advanced tracking algorithms.

## Method Summary
CholecTrack20 is a multi-class multi-object tracking dataset for surgical tools that introduces three tracking perspectives to address the limitations of existing datasets. The dataset includes 20 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos with bounding box annotations, tool class, identity, operator, phase, and visual challenge labels at 1 FPS. The identity reassignment mechanism uses tool class, operator, and port consistency to handle tool replacement scenarios. The dataset is evaluated using HOTA metrics and tested with state-of-the-art tracking methods to establish baseline performance.

## Key Results
- Three distinct tracking perspectives (intraoperative, intracorporeal, visibility) provide clinically meaningful tool trajectories
- Over 35,000 annotated frames and 65,000 tool instances across 20 laparoscopic videos
- Current state-of-the-art tracking methods achieve less than 45% HOTA performance
- Comprehensive visual challenge annotations including bleeding, smoke, occlusion, and reflection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Introducing three distinct tracking perspectives addresses temporal ambiguity when tools exit and re-enter the camera view.
- **Mechanism**: By separating tool trajectories into intraoperative, intracorporeal, and visibility views, algorithms can learn when to maintain identity across full procedure duration, when to focus only on in-body time, and when to track only on-screen.
- **Core assumption**: Surgical tools can be uniquely re-identified after occlusion or out-of-view based on tool class, operator identity, and trocar port usage.
- **Evidence anchors**: The identity reassignment is defined by: Ok,t+1 id← O j,t ⇐ ⇒c(O j) = c(Ok) and p(O j) = p(Ok), implying track id reassignment when tools share same class and are manipulated by same surgeon via same port.
- **Break condition**: Multiple tools of same class through same port in quick succession may cause identity ambiguity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Fine-grained visual challenge annotations enable robust tracking models that handle real-world surgical variability.
- **Mechanism**: Visual challenge attributes are explicitly labeled per frame and per tool, enabling algorithms to condition tracking decisions on adverse visual conditions.
- **Core assumption**: Presence of specific visual challenges is a strong signal for algorithmic adaptation during tracking.
- **Evidence anchors**: The dataset accounts for real-world attributes such as occlusions, appearance variations, tool-tissue interactions, surgical phases, and visual challenges like bleeding, smoke, fast motion blurring, and specular light reflection.
- **Break condition**: Noisy or inconsistently applied visual challenge labels may mislead models rather than improve robustness.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Multi-perspective trajectories reduce identity fragmentation by aligning tracking formalization with clinically relevant use cases.
- **Mechanism**: Three separate trajectory perspectives allow algorithms to select the most appropriate trajectory type for their task, preventing compromises that degrade performance across different clinical scenarios.
- **Core assumption**: Different clinical applications require different definitions of when a tool "starts" and "ends."
- **Evidence anchors**: The three perspectives offer diverse insights into surgical needs, with intraoperative and visibility trajectories independently explored in prior research while the intracorporeal perspective was completely lacking in literature.
- **Break condition**: Inconsistent annotation between perspectives may create ambiguous or contradictory trajectory definitions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Bounding box annotation and spatial overlap metrics (e.g., Jaccard Index)
  - Why needed here: Accurate spatial localization is essential for evaluating tracking performance and ensuring consistent tool identification across frames.
  - Quick check question: How would you compute the Jaccard Index between two bounding boxes given their coordinates?

- **Concept**: Cohen's Kappa for label agreement
  - Why needed here: It quantifies the reliability of categorical annotations (tool class, operator) beyond simple percentage agreement, accounting for chance agreement.
  - Quick check question: What does a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.95 indicate about annotator agreement?

- **Concept**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) evaluation metrics (HOTA, MOTA, IDF1)
  - Why needed here: These metrics assess the trade-off between detection and association quality, critical for measuring tracking performance on multi-class multi-tool datasets.
  - Quick check question: Which metric would you prioritize if your primary concern is minimizing identity switches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw video -> Sampled frames (1 FPS) -> Bounding box extraction -> Trajectory assignment -> Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path**: From raw video → sampled frames → bounding box extraction → trajectory assignment → evaluation metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sampling rate: 1 FPS balances annotation cost with temporal resolution
  - Operator labeling: based on trocar port triangulation rather than direct visual identification
  - Identity reassignment: relies on class/operator/port consistency, which may not always hold in complex procedures
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High identity switches when tools of same class are inserted through same port in quick succession
  - Poor performance in frames with multiple visual challenges (e.g., smoke + occlusion + bleeding)
  - Trajectory fragmentation in crowded scenes with more than two tools visible
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline MOT model (e.g., ByteTrack) trained on CholecTrack20 with HOTA evaluation across all three trajectory perspectives
  2. Visual challenge-conditioned tracking: train separate models or use multi-task learning to handle bleeding, smoke, and occlusion
  3. Cross-perspective evaluation: train on visibility tracks, test on intraoperative tracks to measure generalization across trajectory definitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the CholecTrack20 dataset handle tool replacement scenarios, where the same tool class is replaced by another instance during surgery?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses that existing datasets struggle with tool replacement, particularly for out-of-body tools of the same class, leading to rigid trajectories. CholecTrack20 aims to address this by considering three perspectives.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper mentions that CholecTrack20 considers tool replacement through the use of track identities and operator information, it does not provide specific details on how tool replacement scenarios are handled within the dataset annotations.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A detailed explanation of the annotation protocol for tool replacement scenarios, including examples of how tool identities are reassigned and how this is reflected in the dataset annotations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How do the three tracking perspectives (intraoperative, intracorporeal, and visibility) in CholecTrack20 compare in terms of their impact on tracking performance and clinical relevance?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper introduces three tracking perspectives and highlights their different clinical applications, but does not provide a comparative analysis of their performance or clinical relevance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not present a detailed comparison of the three tracking perspectives in terms of their impact on tracking performance or their clinical significance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comprehensive evaluation of tracking performance using each perspective individually and in combination, along with a discussion of their clinical implications and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the specific challenges and limitations of using CholecTrack20 for real-time surgical tool tracking in clinical settings?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that CholecTrack20 is designed to address the limitations of existing datasets and enable more accurate and clinically relevant tool tracking, but does not discuss the specific challenges and limitations of using the dataset in real-time clinical settings.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on the development and annotation of the dataset but does not provide insights into the practical challenges and limitations of using CholecTrack20 for real-time surgical tool tracking in clinical environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A discussion of the computational requirements, annotation challenges, and potential limitations of using CholecTrack20 for real-time surgical tool tracking, along with suggestions for addressing these challenges.

## Limitations
- The identity reassignment mechanism based on tool class, operator, and port may fail in scenarios with rapid tool exchanges or multiple tools of the same class through a single port.
- The paper does not provide a specific tracking algorithm or training procedure, leaving implementation details to the user.
- The dataset's scalability to other surgical procedures or scenarios with more complex tool interactions remains untested.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The dataset's multi-perspective framework is well-defined and addresses a clear gap in existing surgical tracking datasets. The annotation schema and evaluation metrics are explicitly specified.
- **Medium Confidence**: The dataset's effectiveness in improving tracking performance is demonstrated through benchmarking, but the lack of a standardized training pipeline introduces variability in results.
- **Low Confidence**: The dataset's scalability to other surgical procedures or scenarios with more complex tool interactions remains untested.

## Next Checks
1. **Annotation Consistency**: Verify the consistency of trajectory assignments across the three perspectives by cross-checking a subset of annotated frames for agreement between annotators.
2. **Visual Challenge Impact**: Analyze the dataset's performance breakdown by visual challenge (e.g., occlusion, smoke, bleeding) to identify the most significant failure modes.
3. **Cross-Procedure Generalization**: Test the dataset's applicability to other laparoscopic procedures (e.g., appendectomy, hernia repair) to assess its broader utility.
