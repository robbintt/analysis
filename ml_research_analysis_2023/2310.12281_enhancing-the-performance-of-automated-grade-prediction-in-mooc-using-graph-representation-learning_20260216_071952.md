# Enhancing the Performance of Automated Grade Prediction in MOOC using Graph Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12281
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12281
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Graph representation learning improves MOOC grade prediction, increasing F1-scores from 0.89 to 0.92

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting student grades in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with greater granularity, specifically focusing on short, targeted exercises called "challenges." Unlike existing methods that overlook the complex relationships between students, courses, and exercises, the authors construct a bipartite interaction graph between students and challenges and leverage advanced graph representation learning techniques to extract structural features. Using unsupervised node embedding methods such as node2vec and DeepWalk, they enhance the predictive performance of machine learning models. Experiments conducted on a large MOOC dataset demonstrate that incorporating structural features significantly improves grade prediction accuracy, with F1-scores increasing from 0.89 to 0.92 for the best-performing model. The proposed approach is particularly effective in identifying at-risk students with lower grades, offering a scalable solution for automated assessment in MOOCs.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a bipartite graph between students and challenges based on their interaction patterns in MOOCs. They apply unsupervised graph representation learning techniques (node2vec and DeepWalk) to extract structural embeddings that capture neighborhood relationships in the graph. These structural features are combined with traditional entity-specific and behavioral features, then used to train machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting) for multi-class grade prediction. The evaluation uses a time-based train/test split where each student's data is split by time to simulate predicting future performance.

## Key Results
- Graph embeddings improve F1-score from 0.89 to 0.92 across all models
- The approach is particularly effective for identifying at-risk students with lowest grades
- Gradient Boosting achieves the highest overall performance among tested models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structural features extracted via node2vec and DeepWalk improve grade prediction performance.
- Mechanism: The bipartite graph between students and challenges encodes latent structural relationships. Node embedding techniques transform this graph into dense vectors that capture neighborhood patterns, which complement entity-specific features.
- Core assumption: Structural relationships between students and challenges contain predictive signal not captured by traditional features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we utilize graph embedding techniques to extract latent structural information encoded in the interactions between entities"
  - [section V-B] "we extracted node embeddings for the users and challenges using two well-known graph representation learning methods, namely node2vec and DeepWalk"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations to graph embedding in MOOC literature in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If the interaction graph lacks sufficient connectivity or the embedding dimension is too low to capture meaningful patterns, performance gains disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Focusing on challenge-level prediction provides higher granularity than course-level prediction.
- Mechanism: Challenges represent smaller, skill-specific exercises. Predicting these requires finer-grained features and captures more immediate learning progress than course-level outcomes.
- Core assumption: Challenge completion patterns are more predictive of immediate learning gaps than course completion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we focus on short, small, and particular exercises, referred to as challenges"
  - [section III] "short, small, and specific exercises, which are called challenges in this study"
  - [corpus] Assumption: neighbor papers focus on course-level quality, not challenge-level prediction
- Break condition: If challenges are too diverse or heterogeneous in nature, the model cannot generalize across challenge types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Unsupervised graph representation learning can improve supervised grade prediction without labeled data.
- Mechanism: Node2vec and DeepWalk generate embeddings using only graph structure, not grades. These embeddings are then used as features in supervised models, providing structural context.
- Core assumption: Graph structure alone contains sufficient signal to improve grade prediction when combined with traditional features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These techniques do not require ground truth labels and can be utilized for various tasks"
  - [section V-B] "One of the main benefits of these graph representation learning methods is their unsupervised training, using only the underlying graph structure without ground truth labels"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in neighbor papers about unsupervised graph learning for grade prediction
- Break condition: If the graph structure is too sparse or the embedding learning fails to converge, the unsupervised approach provides no benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bipartite graphs and graph representation learning
  - Why needed here: The interaction between students and challenges is naturally modeled as a bipartite graph, and node embeddings extract structural features
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a bipartite graph differs from a regular graph and why it's appropriate for student-challenge interactions?

- Concept: Node embedding techniques (node2vec and DeepWalk)
  - Why needed here: These methods generate dense vector representations from graph structure that capture neighborhood relationships
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between node2vec and DeepWalk in terms of how they sample random walks?

- Concept: Multi-class classification with imbalanced classes
  - Why needed here: Grade prediction involves five classes with very different instance counts (34500 vs 3970)
  - Quick check question: How would you handle the class imbalance problem in this dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data ingestion -> Feature extraction -> Graph construction -> Node embeddings -> Feature fusion -> Model training -> Evaluation

- Critical path: Data → Graph construction → Node embeddings → Feature fusion → Model training → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding dimension vs. computational cost
  - Random walk parameters (length, number of walks) vs. embedding quality
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor F1-score on minority classes (0 and 4)
  - No improvement when adding structural features
  - Overfitting to training data with high variance between train/test performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train Gradient Boosting with only traditional features
  2. Graph-only: Train with only structural features (embeddings, degrees, centrality)
  3. Combined: Train with both traditional and structural features, compare performance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do node2vec and DeepWalk structural embeddings specifically improve the prediction of grades for low-performing students in MOOCs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that structural features improve the prediction performance for students with the lowest grades (class 0) and those with grades in the 80-100 range (class 4), but does not provide detailed insights into the mechanism by which these embeddings contribute to better prediction.
- Why unresolved: The study presents empirical results showing improved prediction accuracy with structural embeddings but does not delve into the specific reasons why these embeddings are particularly effective for predicting low-performing students' grades.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the node embeddings, such as visualization of the embedding space or examination of the specific features that contribute most to grade prediction for low-performing students, would provide insights into the mechanisms at play.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the effectiveness of structural features in grade prediction be generalized to other educational contexts beyond MOOCs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on MOOCs and demonstrates the effectiveness of structural features in this specific context. However, it does not explore whether these findings can be generalized to other educational settings, such as traditional classrooms or online courses with different structures.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to a single dataset from a specific MOOC provider, and the unique characteristics of MOOCs (e.g., large enrollment, diverse student backgrounds) may influence the effectiveness of structural features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the study with datasets from different educational contexts, such as traditional classrooms or other online learning platforms, would help determine if the findings are generalizable.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal combination of MOOC-related features and structural features for maximizing grade prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that structural features significantly improve prediction accuracy when combined with MOOC-related features, but it does not explore the optimal combination or the relative importance of each type of feature.
- Why unresolved: The study presents results using a fixed combination of features, and it is unclear whether different combinations or weighting schemes could lead to even better performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the combination and weighting of MOOC-related and structural features, possibly using techniques like feature selection or ensemble methods, would help identify the optimal feature set for grade prediction.

## Limitations

- The evaluation lacks ablation studies isolating the contribution of structural features versus entity-specific features
- No statistical significance tests are reported to verify that performance improvements are not due to chance
- The time-based split methodology could introduce leakage if challenge completion order affects feature values

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that graph embeddings improve prediction performance is supported by empirical results showing consistent F1-score improvements across all three models (0.89→0.92).
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why structural features help is reasonable but not rigorously proven - the paper demonstrates improvement but doesn't establish causality or explain which specific structural patterns drive the gains.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim about identifying at-risk students with lower grades being "particularly effective" is not supported by detailed per-class performance metrics or targeted analysis of low-grade predictions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing traditional features alone versus combined features to quantify the marginal contribution of structural features.

2. Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on F1-scores across multiple random seeds to verify improvements are not due to chance.

3. Analyze per-class performance metrics, especially for the lowest grade class (0), to validate the claim about effectiveness for at-risk students.
