## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical privacy and security challenges in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) foundation models throughout their lifecycle. The authors identify substantial risks including cross-modal privacy leakage, model weight theft, and prompt-based attacks that could expose sensitive geospatial information. The paper proposes a comprehensive blueprint combining federated learning, differential privacy, and secure geospatial tooling protocols to build foundation models that maintain functionality while protecting user privacy and security.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive blueprint for building privacy-preserving and secure GeoAI foundation models that addresses privacy and security risks throughout the model lifecycle. The approach involves privacy-preserving geospatial data processing to handle multimodal data with personal information, private and secure training and serving using federated learning and distributed architectures, secure geospatial tooling protocols to prevent data leakage when connecting to external resources, private and secure interaction mechanisms to detect and block malicious prompts, and secure feedback mechanisms for reinforcement learning. The method focuses on balancing privacy protection with model utility while preventing various attack vectors including cross-modal data association, model weight leakage, and prompt-based exploits.

## Key Results
- Identified critical privacy and security risks in GeoAI foundation models including cross-modal privacy risks, model weight leakage, and malicious prompt-based attacks
- Proposed a comprehensive blueprint combining federated learning, differential privacy, and secure geospatial tooling protocols
- Highlighted the need for evolving technical solutions alongside regulations to ensure ethical and safe development of GeoAI foundation models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-modal privacy risks arise because GeoAI models can associate sensitive geospatial information across modalities (e.g., linking social media posts to building images).
- Mechanism: GeoAI foundation models trained on multimodal geospatial data learn correlations between different data types, allowing them to infer and disclose sensitive information that exists in one modality by analyzing another.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively learn and utilize cross-modal associations during pre-training and fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent studies also reveal that the development and use of foundation models could potentially unveil substantial privacy and security risks, including the disclosure of sensitive information, representational bias, hallucinations, and misuse"
  - [section] "A vision-language model, likewise, may learn the alignment between a building and its residents who have mentioned it on social media. If someone was to upload a picture of that building and asked, 'Who lives in this building?', the model might list all the residents it recognizes from social media."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related work on GeoAI opportunities and challenges but lacks direct evidence about cross-modal privacy risks specifically.
- Break condition: If effective privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy or federated learning are implemented that prevent cross-modal data association during training.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Centralized serving creates inherent privacy risks because user requests containing sensitive geospatial information must be transmitted to and stored on central servers.
- Mechanism: When GeoAI models are hosted on centralized servers, all user interactions (prompts, queries, etc.) travel through and are stored on these servers, creating multiple points of potential data exposure and leakage.
- Core assumption: The centralized infrastructure cannot guarantee that sensitive geospatial information won't be exposed during transmission or storage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Centralized serving brings endogenous privacy risks as all users' requests need to be sent to and stored in a centralized server. Sometimes, these requests may contain sensitive geospatial information that users are unwilling to disclose."
  - [section] "Recent payment leakage and chat history leakage in ChatGPT show that as soon as the data leaves a user's device, avoiding privacy risks becomes inherently challenging."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - The corpus papers focus on opportunities and challenges but don't specifically address centralized serving risks.
- Break condition: If decentralized or federated serving architectures are adopted that keep user data local while still enabling model functionality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Malicious prompts can exploit GeoAI foundation models to extract sensitive training data or access connected geospatial resources.
- Mechanism: Attackers can craft specific prompts that leverage the model's in-context learning capabilities to bypass safety measures, causing the model to reveal memorized training data or interact with external geospatial tools in unauthorized ways.
- Core assumption: The model's prompt-based interaction interface can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs to override safety constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Prompt-based interactions are widely supported in most foundation models with language inputs. Properly designed prompts can leverage the in-context learning (e.g., zero-shot or few-shot learning) ability of foundation models to tackle a wide variety of tasks."
  - [section] "Common prompt attack methods include Do Anything Now (i.e., bypass pre-set content policy), Goal Hijacking (i.e., ignore predefined prompts), etc., which can cause serious privacy and security issues."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - The corpus doesn't contain specific research on prompt-based attacks against GeoAI models.
- Break condition: If robust prompt detection and filtering mechanisms are implemented that can identify and block malicious prompt patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal data alignment in GeoAI
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different geospatial data types (text, images, vectors) can be aligned and associated is crucial for grasping both the capabilities and privacy risks of GeoAI foundation models
  - Quick check question: How might a GeoAI model learn to associate a social media post mentioning "my favorite coffee shop" with satellite imagery of that location?

- Concept: Federated learning and differential privacy
  - Why needed here: These are key technical approaches proposed for building privacy-preserving GeoAI models, and understanding their mechanisms is essential for implementing the blueprint
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between how federated learning and differential privacy protect user data in GeoAI training?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: Since prompt-based interaction is both a key feature and vulnerability of GeoAI models, understanding how prompts work is critical for both utilizing and securing these systems
  - Quick check question: How does in-context learning enable zero-shot learning in foundation models, and why does this create potential security vulnerabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline (multimodal geospatial data preprocessing and privacy protection) -> Training framework (federated/distributed training with privacy guarantees) -> Model serving (centralized or decentralized deployment options) -> Tooling interface (secure protocols for connecting to external geospatial resources) -> Interaction layer (prompt processing and malicious prompt detection) -> Feedback system (secure reinforcement learning mechanisms)

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Privacy-preserving training → Secure serving → Tooling integration → Interaction handling → Feedback incorporation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs. decentralized serving: Centralized offers better performance and easier updates but higher privacy risks; decentralized improves privacy but may sacrifice some functionality
  - Strict privacy protection vs. model utility: More aggressive privacy measures may reduce model performance on geospatial tasks
  - Comprehensive prompt filtering vs. user experience: Aggressive malicious prompt detection may block legitimate queries

- Failure signatures:
  - Data leakage: Sensitive information appearing in model outputs or being exposed through prompt attacks
  - Model poisoning: Performance degradation or harmful outputs resulting from compromised feedback mechanisms
  - Tooling exploitation: Unauthorized access to external geospatial resources through model connections

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Cross-modal privacy risk assessment: Test whether a simple GeoAI model trained on aligned text-image geospatial data can infer sensitive information across modalities
  2. Federated learning baseline: Implement a federated training setup for a basic GeoAI task and measure privacy-utility tradeoff compared to centralized training
  3. Prompt attack resilience: Develop and test a set of malicious prompts against a GeoAI model to evaluate its vulnerability to prompt-based attacks
