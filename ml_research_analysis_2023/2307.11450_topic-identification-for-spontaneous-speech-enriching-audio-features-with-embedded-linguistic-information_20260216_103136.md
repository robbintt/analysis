# Topic Identification For Spontaneous Speech: Enriching Audio Features With Embedded Linguistic Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11450
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11450
- Reference count: 21
- The proposed hybrid approaches achieve 86.12% F1 score and 80.40% UAR on the test set

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses topic identification from spontaneous speech in low-resource languages where ASR systems produce low-quality transcripts. The authors propose and compare audio-only, text-only, and hybrid approaches using a colloquial Finnish speech corpus. A novel embedding transfer method is introduced that enhances audio embeddings with linguistic information by minimizing the distance between audio and text embedding spaces. The hybrid approaches, particularly a multi-task learning model, achieve the best results, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly utilizing audio and text modalities for topic identification in spontaneous speech.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three main approaches for topic identification: audio-only, text-only, and hybrid methods. Audio-only solutions include a CRDNN encoder, an embedding transfer approach that learns linguistically-enhanced audio embeddings, and a pre-trained Wav2vec2 model. Hybrid approaches combine audio and text features through either concatenation or multi-task learning. The embedding transfer method uses three objectives: minimizing L1 loss between audio and word embeddings, preserving acoustic information through filter bank reconstruction, and classification for topic identification. Models are trained using negative log-likelihood loss, with an additional CTC objective for the multi-task model, evaluated on a colloquial Finnish corpus using micro F1 and UAR metrics.

## Key Results
- Audio-only embedding transfer approach outperforms traditional pipeline methods and Wav2vec2 fine-tuning
- Hybrid approaches achieve best results, with multi-task learning model reaching 86.12% F1 and 80.40% UAR
- Semi-supervised text approach using untranscribed data achieves 84.68% F1, demonstrating benefits of additional training data
- Audio-only models perform competitively without requiring full ASR transcripts, important for low-resource scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The embedding transfer approach improves topic identification by aligning audio and text embedding spaces, allowing audio-only models to leverage linguistic information without requiring transcripts.
- Mechanism: The model learns linguistically-enhanced audio embeddings by minimizing the L1 loss between audio embeddings and text embeddings, while also preserving acoustic information through reconstruction of filter bank features.
- Core assumption: The text embedding space contains relevant linguistic information for topic identification that can be transferred to audio embeddings without requiring full ASR transcripts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] and [section] demonstrate the alignment of embedding spaces and show improved performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-task learning approach improves topic identification by optimizing both ASR and topic ID tasks simultaneously, creating an ASR model that is better suited for topic ID.
- Mechanism: By jointly training ASR and topic ID tasks with shared audio encoder parameters, the model learns acoustic representations that are optimized for both transcription and topic classification.
- Core assumption: Optimizing ASR for topic ID improves ASR performance on spontaneous speech compared to optimizing ASR in isolation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] and [section] show the multi-task model achieving the highest performance metrics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using the untranscribed portion of the dataset improves topic identification performance by providing additional training data that captures the full variability of spontaneous speech.
- Mechanism: The semi-supervised approach uses both manually transcribed data and automatically generated transcripts from untranscribed portions, effectively increasing the training dataset size and diversity.
- Core assumption: The untranscribed portion of the dataset contains valuable linguistic patterns that can improve model generalization, even when transcribed automatically.
- Evidence anchors: [section] shows the semi-supervised model achieving best performance, though specific analysis of untranscribed data contribution is not quantified.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Embedding transfer between modalities
  - Why needed here: The paper needs to transfer linguistic information from text embeddings to audio embeddings without requiring full ASR transcripts, which is essential for low-resource scenarios.
  - Quick check question: What loss function is used to align audio and text embedding spaces in the embedding transfer approach?

- Concept: Multi-task learning with hard parameter sharing
  - Why needed here: The multi-task approach requires understanding how to share parameters between ASR and topic ID tasks while maintaining task-specific performance.
  - Quick check question: How are the ASR and topic ID losses combined during training in the multi-task model?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning with automatic transcription
  - Why needed here: The approach uses both manually transcribed and automatically generated transcripts to leverage the full dataset, requiring understanding of how to handle noisy labels.
  - Quick check question: What is the WER and CER of the ASR system used to generate transcripts for the untranscribed portion of the data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio features → Audio encoder → Embedding transfer/alignment → Topic classification (audio-only) or Audio + Text features → Classification layer → Topic prediction
- Critical path: Audio features → Audio encoder → Embedding transfer/alignment → Topic classification (audio-only) or Audio + Text features → Classification layer → Topic prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding transfer vs. direct audio features: Embedding transfer provides linguistic information but adds complexity and pre-training requirements
  - Multi-task vs. pipeline: Multi-task optimizes for topic ID but requires transcribed data; pipeline uses separate models but may not optimize for topic ID
  - Wav2vec2 vs. custom CRDNN: Wav2vec2 has more parameters and pre-training but performs worse on colloquial Finnish
- Failure signatures:
  - Embedding transfer fails if audio and text embedding spaces are incompatible
  - Multi-task learning fails if ASR optimization interferes with topic ID performance
  - Semi-supervised approach fails if automatically generated transcripts are too noisy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the embedding transfer model with only the linguistic loss to verify alignment capability
  2. Compare audio-only CRDNN vs. Wav2vec2 fine-tuning on the same 100-hour subset
  3. Implement the multi-task learning approach with only transcribed data to establish baseline performance before adding untranscribed data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed audio-only and hybrid topic identification approaches perform on languages other than Finnish, particularly on high-resource languages where ASR systems are highly accurate?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on spontaneous Finnish speech, a low-resource language scenario. The authors mention planning to apply experiments to English in the future.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any results or comparisons for languages other than Finnish. It's unclear how the approaches would generalize to high-resource languages or languages with different characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the proposed methods to high-resource languages like English, German, or Mandarin, with detailed comparisons to state-of-the-art ASR-based approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different acoustic feature representations (e.g., Mel-filterbanks, MFCCs, or features from pre-trained self-supervised models) on the performance of the audio-only topic identification models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention planning to replace filter banks with features extracted from pre-trained self-supervised models in future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses filter banks as acoustic features. The impact of using alternative feature representations on model performance is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of audio-only models using different acoustic feature representations, including Mel-filterbanks, MFCCs, and features from various pre-trained self-supervised models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed embedding transfer approach compare to other methods of incorporating linguistic information into audio embeddings, such as contrastive learning or cross-modal attention mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce a novel embedding transfer method that minimizes the distance between audio and text embedding spaces.
- Why unresolved: While the embedding transfer approach is shown to outperform other audio-only solutions, the paper does not compare it to other methods of incorporating linguistic information into audio embeddings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the proposed embedding transfer approach to alternative methods of incorporating linguistic information into audio embeddings, such as contrastive learning or cross-modal attention mechanisms.

## Limitations
- Results are demonstrated only on a single Finnish corpus with 8 specific topics, limiting generalizability
- Semi-supervised approach relies on an external ASR system without reporting its performance (WER/CER)
- Critical hyperparameters and specific architectural details are not provided, affecting reproducibility
- Evaluation focuses only on micro F1 and UAR metrics without deeper analysis of failure cases

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core finding that hybrid audio-text approaches outperform audio-only methods is well-supported by experimental results showing consistent performance improvements.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the embedding transfer approach enables audio-only models to achieve competitive performance without transcripts is supported, but the specific mechanism remains somewhat abstract.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that the untranscribed data significantly improves performance is based on numerical results but lacks analysis of how much improvement comes from data quantity versus ASR quality.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on ASR Quality**: Train the semi-supervised model using ASR transcripts at different quality levels (controlled by WER thresholds) to quantify the relationship between transcription quality and topic identification performance.

2. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Validation**: Apply the embedding transfer approach to a different language (e.g., English or another Uralic language) using the same architecture to test whether the method generalizes beyond Finnish.

3. **Embedding Space Analysis**: Perform qualitative analysis of the audio and text embedding spaces before and after transfer learning, including visualization and similarity comparisons, to validate that meaningful linguistic information is being transferred.
