# Lil-Bevo: Explorations of Strategies for Training Language Models in More Humanlike Ways

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17591
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17591
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: Training on shorter sequences before longer ones improves language model performance on syntactic tasks with a statistically significant 1.8-point improvement.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates strategies for training language models on human-scale data (10M-100M words) to address the gap between large language model data requirements and human language learning. The research explores three training techniques: initial pretraining on music data, training on shorter sequences before longer ones, and targeted masking of specific tokens. Results demonstrate that curriculum learning through sequence length progression provides consistent improvements, while music pretraining shows marginal benefits. The work highlights the challenges of sample-efficient language learning and the limitations of current approaches in achieving human-like learning efficiency.

## Method Summary
The study implements a three-phase training regime on the BabyLM dataset: (1) pretraining on combined music and text data with 64-token sequences for 5 epochs, (2) continuing pretraining on text data with 128-token sequences for 50 epochs, and (3) final pretraining with targeted masked language modeling for 2 epochs with 512-token sequences. A custom unigram SentencePiece tokenizer is trained on the combined dataset, and DeBERTa models (small and base) are evaluated on BLiMP, SuperGLUE, and MSGS benchmarks. The approach compares performance against RoBERTa baselines while exploring curriculum learning, cross-domain transfer from music, and targeted masking for specific linguistic phenomena.

## Key Results
- Training on shorter sequences before longer ones shows statistically significant improvement of 1.8 points on syntactic tasks
- Music pretraining provides only marginal benefits to language model performance
- Targeted masking aids specific tasks like NPI licensing and argument structure but shows limited general improvements
- Models trained on human-scale data achieve lower performance than larger LLMs, highlighting sample efficiency challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Curriculum Learning Through Sequence Length Progression
- **Claim:** Training on shorter sequences before longer ones improves language model performance on syntactic tasks.
- **Mechanism:** Starting with shorter sequences allows the model to first learn basic linguistic patterns and structures before tackling more complex, longer dependencies. This staged approach helps the model build a hierarchical bias for language learning.
- **Core assumption:** The model benefits from learning simpler linguistic structures before more complex ones, similar to how humans acquire language.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Results show that training on shorter sequences outperforms longer ones, with a statistically significant improvement of 1.8 points."
  - [section] "We used a similar training regime to (Press et al., 2021), where we started with a training sequence length of 128 for 50 epochs, before moving to a training sequence length of 512."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus mentions of curriculum learning or sequence progression.
- **Break condition:** If the model overfits to short sequences and cannot generalize to longer contexts, or if the performance gap between short and long sequence training disappears with larger datasets.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Domain Pretraining with Music
- **Claim:** Pretraining on structured non-linguistic data (music) before language training can marginally improve language model performance.
- **Mechanism:** Music, like language, has hierarchical structure and sequential dependencies. Pretraining on music may help the model learn structural biases that transfer to language learning, potentially reaching a stable parameter region faster.
- **Core assumption:** Structural patterns learned from music (e.g., hierarchical organization, sequential dependencies) are transferable to language learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Music pretraining shows marginal benefits, while targeted masking aids specific tasks like NPI licensing and argument structure."
  - [section] "Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020) use this idea to show that training language models on structured data (e.g., music) can help models learn faster."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus mentions of music pretraining or transfer learning from non-linguistic domains.
- **Break condition:** If the marginal benefits disappear with larger language datasets, or if pretraining on other structured data (e.g., code) shows no transfer to language tasks.

### Mechanism 3: Targeted Masking for Specific Linguistic Phenomena
- **Claim:** Masking specific tokens essential to linguistic phenomena (e.g., NPI licensing, filler-gap dependencies) improves model performance on those tasks.
- **Mechanism:** By forcing the model to predict masked tokens that are crucial for specific syntactic structures, the model learns to better understand and score sentences containing those phenomena.
- **Core assumption:** Focusing the model's attention on key tokens for specific linguistic tasks will improve its ability to handle those tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Our targeted Masked Language Modeling augmentation did not seem to improve model performance in general, but did seem to help on some of the specific BLiMP tasks that we were targeting (e.g., Negative Polarity Items)."
  - [section] "For NPI licensing the masked words included 'not', 'only', 'also', 'really', 'probably', 'often', 'certainly', 'clearly'. The list of words which were masked in each category are shown in Table 3 in Appendix A."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus mentions of targeted masking or its effects on specific linguistic phenomena.
- **Break condition:** If the improvement on targeted tasks does not generalize to other related linguistic phenomena, or if random masking shows similar improvements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  - Why needed here: MLM is the core training objective used in this study to train the language models.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between MLM and standard language modeling (predicting the next token)?

- **Concept:** Curriculum Learning
  - Why needed here: The study uses curriculum learning by training on shorter sequences before longer ones to improve model performance.
  - Quick check question: How does curriculum learning differ from standard training where all data is presented in random order?

- **Concept:** Cross-Domain Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: The study explores pretraining on music (a non-linguistic domain) to improve language model performance.
  - Quick check question: What are the key factors that determine whether knowledge can transfer from one domain to another?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** BabyLM data + MAESTRO music data -> Custom SentencePiece tokenizer -> Music pretraining (seq_len=64, 5 epochs) -> Text pretraining (seq_len=128, 50 epochs) -> Targeted MLM (seq_len=512, 2 epochs) -> DeBERTa evaluation on BLiMP, SuperGLUE, MSGS

- **Critical path:**
  1. Tokenize BabyLM data and MAESTRO music data using custom SentencePiece tokenizer
  2. Pretrain on combined music and text data for 5 epochs with short sequences
  3. Continue pretraining on text data for 50 epochs with medium sequences
  4. Fine-tune with targeted MLM for 2 epochs with long sequences
  5. Evaluate on BLiMP, SuperGLUE, and MSGS benchmarks

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Shorter vs. longer sequence lengths: Shorter sequences may help learn basic structures but limit exposure to long-range dependencies.
  - Music vs. text pretraining: Music may provide structural benefits but reduces the amount of language data available for pretraining.
  - Targeted vs. random masking: Targeted masking may improve specific tasks but could limit general language understanding.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overfitting to short sequences: Model performs well on short-sequence tasks but poorly on long-sequence tasks.
  - No transfer from music: Pretraining on music shows no improvement over random pretraining.
  - Ineffective targeted masking: Targeted masking shows no improvement over random masking for specific tasks.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train a baseline DeBERTa model on BabyLM data with random masking and standard sequence length (e.g., 512 tokens).
  2. Train a model with the three-stage training regime (music pretraining, short sequence pretraining, targeted MLM) and compare performance to the baseline.
  3. Conduct ablation studies by removing each component of the three-stage training regime (e.g., no music pretraining, no sequence length progression, no targeted masking) and compare performance to the full model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does pretraining on music that is more "language-like" improve performance on downstream tasks compared to pretraining on random or Zipfian token distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020) showing that pretraining on languages other than the target language, including music, leads to lower perplexities. However, the study used MAESTRO dataset, which is not specifically designed to be "language-like".
- Why unresolved: The paper only explored one music dataset (MAESTRO) and did not systematically vary the musical complexity or "language-likeness" of the pretraining data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing pretraining on different music datasets with varying degrees of structural similarity to language, using the same evaluation tasks (BLiMP, SuperGLUE, etc.).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the effectiveness of targeted MLM vary with the choice of target words and the frequency of their occurrence in the pretraining corpus?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that targeted MLM improved performance on NPI licensing and argument structure tasks, but not systematically across all tasks. It also provides a list of target words for each category.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested a fixed set of target words and did not explore the impact of word frequency or alternative word selection strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study varying the set of target words, their frequencies, and the masking strategy (e.g., information-theoretic approaches) to determine the optimal configuration for improving performance on specific linguistic tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is there an optimal sequence length for pretraining language models, and how does it interact with other factors such as model architecture and dataset size?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that pretraining with 128-token sequences outperforms 512-token sequences, with a statistically significant difference of 1.8 points. However, this comparison is limited to a specific model (DeBERTa) and dataset size (10M words).
- Why unresolved: The study only explored two sequence lengths and did not investigate the interaction with other factors that might influence the optimal sequence length.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying sequence lengths across different model architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT) and dataset sizes, using a diverse set of evaluation tasks to determine the optimal sequence length for each configuration.

## Limitations

- The study lacks comparison with human language learning benchmarks to validate claims about "more humanlike" training approaches
- Marginal improvements from music pretraining (1.8 points) may fall within the margin of error given the small dataset size
- Targeted masking shows benefits only for specific BLiMP tasks rather than general language understanding

## Confidence

- **Medium confidence**: The sequence length progression mechanism (shorter before longer) shows consistent improvement across multiple benchmarks, though the 1.8-point gain is modest and may not generalize to larger datasets.
- **Low confidence**: The music pretraining hypothesis lacks strong empirical support, with only marginal benefits observed that could be due to random variation rather than meaningful transfer learning.
- **Medium confidence**: Targeted masking shows task-specific improvements for NPI licensing and argument structure, but the generalization to broader language understanding remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Learning Comparison**: Conduct a systematic comparison between the proposed training strategies and documented patterns of human language acquisition, including vocabulary growth curves and error patterns across developmental stages.

2. **Scaling Analysis**: Test whether the sequence length progression benefits persist or diminish when scaling up to larger datasets (e.g., 100M+ tokens), which would indicate whether this is a general principle or an artifact of small-scale training.

3. **Transfer Robustness**: Evaluate the music pretraining benefits across multiple non-linguistic domains (e.g., code, mathematical notation) to determine if the observed improvements are specific to music structure or represent a more general cross-domain transfer phenomenon.
