# Exploring the Role of Explainability in AI-Assisted Embryo Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02534
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02534
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Reviews explainable AI methods for embryo selection, identifying limitations and proposing guidelines for increasing interpretability and trustworthiness.

## Executive Summary
This paper reviews the role of explainability in AI-assisted embryo selection for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The authors analyze current work on explainable AI methods applied to embryo image analysis, identifying limitations such as insufficient clinician evaluation and lack of public datasets. They propose guidelines for increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, suggesting the use of expert models targeting different morphokinetic features and ensemble white box models. The paper discusses the importance of explainable AI in decision support systems for clinicians and patients, emphasizing the need for clear explanations to build trust and ensure responsible use of AI in this high-stakes medical context.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a comprehensive review of explainable AI methods for embryo selection, synthesizing existing research and proposing guidelines for improving interpretability. The authors suggest using expert models targeting different morphokinetic features (fragmentation score, ICM and TE grades, etc.) and combining them through an ensemble white box model (e.g., GLM, Decision Tree) to achieve intermediate explainability. They also recommend using feature attribution methods like Grad-CAM to generate saliency maps that highlight relevant regions in embryo images. The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating these methods with clinicians and providing outcome probabilities rather than discrete classifications to reduce automation bias.

## Key Results
- Current XAI methods for embryo selection lack sufficient clinician evaluation and public datasets
- Expert models targeting specific morphokinetic features combined in white box ensemble models can improve interpretability
- Saliency maps and feature attribution methods help visualize which embryo characteristics influence AI predictions
- Presenting outcome probabilities instead of binary classifications reduces automation bias and improves decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explainable AI (XAI) methods improve clinician trust in AI-assisted embryo selection by providing transparent decision-making.
- Mechanism: By using saliency maps and feature attribution methods like Grad-CAM, clinicians can see which parts of embryo images influenced the AI's predictions, aligning with established morphokinetic markers.
- Core assumption: Clinicians will trust AI systems more if they can understand the reasoning behind predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their opaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where transparency in the decision making is key."
  - [section] "By nature, XAI methods for DL are approximations to the model's real behavior. It is worth noting that XAI is critical to ensure that the decision-making process of an algorithm is as transparent and understandable to clinicians and patients as possible."
- Break condition: If XAI methods fail to accurately represent the model's behavior or are too complex for clinicians to interpret, trust may not improve.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ensemble models with expert sub-models improve interpretability by focusing on specific morphokinetic features.
- Mechanism: Different expert models target features like fragmentation score, ICM and TE grades, etc., and their ensemble is a white box model (e.g., GLM, Decision Tree) providing intermediate explainability.
- Core assumption: Breaking down the problem into expert models allows for clearer understanding of each feature's contribution to the overall prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we suggest the use of expert models. Different models targeting different morphokinetic features, such as fragmentation score, ICM and TE grades, ZP and Pronucleus characteristics, and phase transition times. The ensemble of all these experts should be a white box model (e.g., GLM, Decision Tree) to gain an intermediate level of explainability on how each feature contributes to the objective."
- Break condition: If the ensemble model becomes too complex or if the expert models are not accurate, the overall interpretability may not improve.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Providing outcome probabilities instead of discrete outcomes reduces automation bias and improves decision-making.
- Mechanism: Instead of saying "this embryo is good," the system provides "this embryo is good with a probability of 55%," allowing clinicians to make more informed decisions.
- Core assumption: Clinicians will make better decisions when presented with probabilities rather than binary outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "It is recommended to avoid offering the discretized outcome of models (e.g., this embryo is good) in favour of more detailed information, such as outcome probabilities (e.g., this embryo is good with a probability of 55%)."
- Break condition: If clinicians do not understand how to interpret probabilities or if the probabilities are not well-calibrated, this approach may not be effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI) methods
  - Why needed here: To make AI-assisted embryo selection transparent and understandable to clinicians, improving trust and adoption.
  - Quick check question: What are the differences between post-hoc and intrinsic XAI methods, and when would you use each?

- Concept: Morphokinetic features in embryo development
  - Why needed here: To understand the key features that clinicians assess when evaluating embryos, which the AI models aim to replicate or assist with.
  - Quick check question: What are the main morphological characteristics assessed during early embryo development versus blastocyst stage?

- Concept: Clinical workflow in IVF and embryo selection
  - Why needed here: To understand how AI models will be integrated into the existing clinical decision-making process and what the clinicians' needs are.
  - Quick check question: How do embryologists currently evaluate and select embryos for implantation, and where could AI assistance be most valuable?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time-lapse embryo images -> Preprocessing -> Feature extraction (CNN) -> Expert models (fragmentation, ICM grade, TE grade, etc.) -> Ensemble white box model (GLM/Decision Tree) -> Output with probabilities and saliency maps

- Critical path: Image → Feature extraction → Expert models → Ensemble model → Output with explanations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs interpretability: More interpretable models may be less accurate than complex black-box models.
  - Number of expert models: More experts may improve interpretability but increase complexity and training time.
  - Choice of XAI method: Different methods have varying levels of faithfulness and accessibility to clinicians.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low agreement between expert model outputs and clinician assessments
  - XAI explanations not aligning with known morphokinetic markers
  - High variance in predictions across different runs or expert models

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate individual expert models for fragmentation score, ICM grade, and TE grade on a small dataset.
  2. Combine expert models using a simple ensemble method (e.g., weighted average) and compare performance to individual models.
  3. Apply Grad-CAM to the ensemble model and assess if the saliency maps align with known morphokinetic markers, using IoU with segmented regions as a metric.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop XAI methods that are both accurate and clinically interpretable for embryo analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for XAI methods that are both accurate and clinically interpretable, and suggests the use of expert models targeting different morphokinetic features and ensemble white box models.
- Why unresolved: Current XAI methods, such as saliency maps, are often insufficient or not evaluated by medical experts. There is a need for methods that are both accurate and interpretable by clinicians.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the accuracy and interpretability of different XAI methods, including expert models and ensemble white box models, on clinical datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we ensure patient understanding and involvement in AI-assisted embryo selection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of patient involvement and understanding in the decision-making process, and suggests presenting XAI results in a clear and accessible manner under clinician supervision.
- Why unresolved: There is a need to balance patient involvement with the complexity of AI explanations and the clinician's role in interpretation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies evaluating patient comprehension and satisfaction with different XAI presentation methods, as well as their impact on decision-making and trust in the process.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we establish clear accountability and responsibility mechanisms for AI-assisted embryo selection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the ethical and legal concerns raised by the use of opaque AI models, and the need for clear explanations to ensure accountability and responsibility.
- Why unresolved: There is currently a lack of established accountability mechanisms for AI-assisted embryo selection, which raises concerns about who is responsible for potential harm or suboptimal outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and implementation of clear guidelines and regulations for the use of AI in embryo selection, including mechanisms for accountability and responsibility in case of adverse events.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation - The paper primarily discusses theoretical approaches rather than presenting experimental results from actual clinical implementations
- Dataset dependency - Most cited studies use proprietary or non-public datasets, making it difficult to verify reproducibility claims
- Clinician validation gap - There is insufficient evidence showing that proposed XAI methods actually improve clinician decision-making in practice

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general need for explainable AI in medical contexts and the importance of transparency in clinical decision-making
- Medium confidence: The proposed guidelines for improving interpretability, as they are based on reasonable assumptions but lack extensive empirical validation
- Low confidence: Specific claims about the effectiveness of particular XAI methods for embryo selection, due to limited clinical testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing decision-making accuracy with and without XAI-assisted embryo selection systems among embryologists
2. Perform a systematic evaluation of different XAI methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) on a standardized public dataset of embryo images to assess their faithfulness and interpretability
3. Develop and validate a benchmark dataset of embryo images with ground truth annotations that includes both morphological features and clinical outcomes to enable rigorous model evaluation
