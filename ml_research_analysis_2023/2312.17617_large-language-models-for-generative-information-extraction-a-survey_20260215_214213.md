# Large Language Models for Generative Information Extraction: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.17617
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17617
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of generative LLM applications for IE tasks including NER, RE, and EE

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for Information Extraction (IE) tasks. It systematically categorizes methods by IE subtasks and learning paradigms, covering techniques like supervised fine-tuning, few-shot and zero-shot learning, and data augmentation. The survey explores how LLMs can model various IE tasks and discusses universal frameworks that unify multiple IE tasks, highlighting challenges and future directions for leveraging LLMs in IE.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes recent research on applying generative LLMs to IE tasks through a comprehensive literature review. It categorizes approaches based on IE subtasks (NER, RE, EE) and learning paradigms (fine-tuning, few-shot, zero-shot, data augmentation). The survey examines unified frameworks that treat all IE tasks as text-to-structure generation problems, allowing a single LLM backbone to learn common extraction patterns. Key methodologies include sequence-to-structure generation, in-context learning with demonstration examples, and synthetic data generation for augmentation.

## Key Results
- LLMs can effectively model multiple IE tasks simultaneously using unified sequence-to-structure generation frameworks
- In-context learning enables zero-shot and few-shot performance on IE tasks without parameter updates
- Data augmentation with LLMs through synthetic data generation can improve IE model performance and diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can model multiple IE tasks simultaneously using a unified sequence-to-structure generation framework.
- Mechanism: By treating all IE subtasks (NER, RE, EE) as text-to-structure generation problems, a single LLM backbone can learn common extraction patterns and inter-task dependencies through shared parameters and prompt conditioning.
- Core assumption: The structural output formats for different IE tasks can be mapped into a unified representation that the LLM can generate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in using generative LLMs for IE, categorizing methods by IE subtasks and learning paradigms."
  - [section]: "Different IE tasks are highly diversified, with different optimization objectives and task-specific schema, resulting in the need for isolated models to handle the complexity of a large amount of IE tasks, settings, and scenarios (Lu et al., 2022). As shown in Fig. 2, many works solely focus on a subtask of IE. However, recent advancements in LLMs have led to the proposal of a unified seq2seq framework in several studies (Wang et al., 2023c; Sainz et al., 2023)."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on "LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction" and "A Comprehensive Survey on Relation Extraction" but not specifically unified IE frameworks.
- Break condition: If the unified schema cannot capture task-specific nuances or if the generation quality degrades significantly for certain tasks compared to specialized models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to perform IE tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on demonstration examples in the prompt.
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to understand the mapping between input text and structured output by seeing a few examples in the prompt, enabling zero-shot or few-shot performance on new IE tasks.
- Core assumption: The demonstration examples provided in the prompt are representative enough for the LLM to generalize to new instances of the same task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It discusses how LLMs can model various IE tasks like Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, and Event Extraction, and explores techniques like supervised fine-tuning, few-shot and zero-shot learning, and data augmentation."
  - [section]: "Despite the success of LLMs, they face challenges in training-free IE because of the difference between sequence labeling and text-generation models (Gutiérrez et al., 2022). To overcome these limitations, GPT-NER (Wang et al., 2023b) introduces a self-verification strategy, while GPT-RE (Wan et al., 2023) enhances task-aware representations and incorporates reasoning logic into enriched demonstrations."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on "RAG Meeting LLMs" but not specifically on ICL for IE.
- Break condition: If the demonstration examples are too dissimilar from the target instances or if the LLM cannot properly parse the structured output format.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation with LLMs can improve IE model performance by generating synthetic training examples.
- Mechanism: LLMs generate labeled data by either producing structured output directly (data annotation), retrieving relevant knowledge (knowledge retrieval), or generating natural text from structured data (inverse generation), thereby increasing the diversity and quantity of training data.
- Core assumption: The synthetic data generated by LLMs is of sufficient quality and diversity to improve model generalization without introducing harmful noise or biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The survey also covers universal frameworks that unify multiple IE tasks, and highlights challenges and future directions for leveraging LLMs in IE."
  - [section]: "Data augmentation involves generating meaningful and diverse data to effectively enhance the training examples or information, while avoiding the introduction of unrealistic, misleading, and offset patterns. Recent powerful LLMs also demonstrate remarkable performance in data generation tasks (Whitehouse et al., 2023), which has attracted the attention of many researchers using LLMs to generate synthetic data for IE."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on "LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction" but not specifically on data augmentation for IE.
- Break condition: If the synthetic data introduces too much noise or if the model overfits to the augmented examples rather than learning general patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Preprocessor → Prompt generator → LLM backbone → Output parser → Postprocessor → Extracted information
- Critical path: Input → Preprocessor → Prompt generator → LLM backbone → Output parser → Postprocessor → Extracted information
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering: Fine-tuning provides better performance but requires labeled data and computational resources, while prompt engineering is more flexible but may have lower performance.
  - Task-specific vs. universal models: Task-specific models can be optimized for individual IE tasks but require separate models, while universal models are more efficient but may sacrifice some performance.
  - Natural language vs. code-based prompts: Natural language prompts are easier to design but may have less control over the output format, while code-based prompts provide more structure but require more effort to construct.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision/recall: Indicates issues with the LLM's understanding of the task or the quality of the training data.
  - Inconsistent output formats: Suggests problems with the prompt design or output parsing.
  - Hallucinations: Implies that the LLM is generating incorrect information that is not supported by the input text.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple NER model using a pre-trained LLM and in-context learning on a small dataset.
  2. Compare the performance of fine-tuned vs. prompt-based approaches for a specific IE task.
  3. Evaluate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on model performance.
