# SatBird: Bird Species Distribution Modeling with Remote Sensing and Citizen Science Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.00936
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00936
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Combining satellite imagery with environmental data significantly improves bird species encounter rate prediction over using either alone.

## Executive Summary
SatBird introduces a novel task for predicting bird species encounter rates from satellite imagery, leveraging citizen science data from eBird. The dataset, built from Sentinel-2 satellite images and environmental data, includes regions in the USA (summer and winter) and Kenya, with labels derived from presence-absence observation data. Baselines, including SOTA remote sensing models, were benchmarked, showing that combining satellite images with environmental data significantly improves performance. SatBird enables scalable modeling of ecosystem properties worldwide and addresses knowledge gaps in species distribution modeling.

## Method Summary
The method involves predicting bird species encounter rates using a combination of Sentinel-2 satellite images (RGB and NIR reflectance) and environmental rasters (bioclimatic and pedologic variables). The dataset is constructed from eBird complete checklists, which provide presence-absence data for species in specific locations. Models including ResNet-18, Satlas, SatMAE, and MOSAIKS are trained on this dataset using cross-entropy loss and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Top-k accuracy metrics. Range maps are used as binary masks to zero out predicted encounter rates for species outside their known geographical ranges.

## Key Results
- Combining satellite imagery with environmental data significantly improves species encounter rate prediction.
- Range maps as binary masks improve model utility for conservation planning.
- Presence-absence data from complete checklists mitigates observer bias compared to presence-only data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining satellite imagery with environmental rasters improves species encounter rate prediction more than using either alone.
- Mechanism: Satellite imagery provides spatial patterns of land cover, vegetation indices, and habitat structure at fine resolution, while environmental rasters supply long-term climate and soil variables. Together they capture both immediate habitat conditions and underlying environmental drivers.
- Core assumption: The species-environment relationships captured by coarse environmental layers are enriched by fine-scale habitat heterogeneity visible in satellite imagery.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combining satellite images with environmental data significantly improves performance"
  - [section] "combining satellite images with environmental rasters results in a significant improvement, in all metrics"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific combination; inference from reported metrics.
- Break condition: If environmental variables already fully capture the habitat heterogeneity, or if satellite data resolution is too coarse to add meaningful information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Range maps as binary masks prevent geographically impossible species predictions and improve model utility for conservation planning.
- Mechanism: Masking applies a zero encounter rate outside known ranges, forcing the model to focus on ecologically plausible locations and avoiding spurious predictions in regions where the species cannot occur.
- Core assumption: Range maps are accurate enough to serve as hard constraints without overly restricting model flexibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "range maps for each location"
  - [section] "We propose to use range maps from eBird, constructing binary masks to zero-out the predicted encounter rates of species when a given location falls outside of their geographical range"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; assumption based on domain knowledge.
- Break condition: If range maps are incomplete or outdated, masking could eliminate valid predictions for species with shifting distributions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using presence-absence data from complete checklists mitigates observer bias compared to presence-only data.
- Mechanism: Complete checklists record all species observed in a visit, allowing calculation of encounter rates that account for varying observer effort and detectability, leading to more reliable targets for modeling.
- Core assumption: Checklists are truly complete and representative of species detectability at each location.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "labels derived from presence-absence observation data from the citizen science database eBird"
  - [section] "Complete checklists are presence-absence data... and therefore may be considered almost as informative as expert field surveys"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; supported indirectly by the emphasis on complete checklists in the paper.
- Break condition: If checklists are incomplete due to observer expertise differences or if detectability varies greatly among species.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Species distribution modeling and encounter rates
  - Why needed here: The task predicts the probability of encountering a species at a location, which is a standard ecological metric for habitat suitability.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between presence-only and presence-absence data, and why does SatBird use the latter?

- Concept: Remote sensing and environmental covariates
  - Why needed here: Satellite imagery and environmental rasters provide the input features that the model uses to infer habitat conditions.
  - Quick check question: Which Sentinel-2 bands are used and why is the NIR band particularly important for vegetation analysis?

- Concept: Multi-output regression and class imbalance
  - Why needed here: The model must predict encounter rates for many species simultaneously, and targets are sparse (many zeros), requiring careful loss design.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-entropy loss handle the zero-inflated nature of the targets compared to L1/L2 loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input pipeline -> satellite image encoder (CNN/Transformer) -> environmental data encoder (MLP) -> feature fusion -> output layer -> range map masking (optional) -> loss.
- Critical path: The satellite encoder processes 64x64 RGB/NIR images; environmental rasters are normalized and aligned; features are concatenated before the final regression head.
- Design tradeoffs: Using range maps improves realism but may limit predictions in range-shifting scenarios; using environmental-only data is cheaper but less spatially precise; using true color vs reflectance images trades interpretability for NIR information.
- Failure signatures: High MSE on common species indicates poor habitat capture; top-k accuracy much lower than top-30 suggests model overgeneralizes; zero encounter rate predictions for rare species suggest masking or bias issues.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: ResNet-18 on reflectance+environmental rasters (no masking) to establish performance ceiling.
  2. Ablation: ResNet-18 with true color images vs reflectance to evaluate NIR contribution.
  3. Range map masking: Apply binary masks and compare MSE/top-k to unmasked model to quantify utility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating additional remote sensing data sources (e.g., land cover, altitude) improve prediction accuracy for species encounter rates beyond the current benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests incorporating other information such as land cover and altitude data for further improvements.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include experiments with these additional data sources, only noting their potential value.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that integrate land cover and altitude data into the models and comparing the results to the current benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the temporal resolution of satellite imagery affect the accuracy of species encounter rate predictions, especially in regions with rapid landscape changes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the limitation of using a single satellite image to represent a season and plans to include multiple satellite images in future iterations.
- Why unresolved: The current dataset uses only one recent satellite image per hotspot, which may not capture temporal variations in the landscape.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creating a dataset with multiple satellite images over time for each hotspot and evaluating model performance with varying temporal resolutions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed models effectively predict species encounter rates in low-data regimes, such as the Kenya dataset, without significant loss in accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of applying models to the Kenya dataset due to its sparse nature and fewer hotspots.
- Why unresolved: The experiments on the Kenya dataset show limited performance improvements, suggesting difficulty in adapting models to low-data regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new methodologies or model architectures specifically designed to handle low-data regimes and comparing their performance to the current baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the choice of loss function impact the prediction accuracy for species encounter rates, particularly in addressing class imbalance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper experiments with different loss functions, including cross-entropy, L1, L2, and focal loss, finding cross-entropy to be the most effective.
- Why unresolved: While cross-entropy performs best, the paper does not explore other advanced loss functions that might better handle the zero-inflated nature of the targets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with alternative loss functions designed to address class imbalance and zero-inflation, such as weighted or focal loss variations, and comparing their performance to the current benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The absence of baseline comparisons using only satellite imagery or only environmental rasters makes it difficult to isolate the benefit of each input type.
- Reliance on eBird range maps, which may be incomplete or outdated, potentially limiting model applicability for species with dynamic ranges.
- No explicit handling of observer bias differences across species or regions, which could affect encounter rate reliability.

## Confidence

- **Medium**: Combining satellite imagery with environmental rasters improves prediction performance.
- **Medium**: Range maps as binary masks improve model utility for conservation planning.
- **Medium**: Presence-absence data from complete checklists reduces observer bias compared to presence-only data.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the individual and combined contributions of satellite imagery and environmental rasters to model performance.
2. Test model robustness using alternative range map sources or dynamic range data to assess sensitivity to range map accuracy.
3. Evaluate model performance on a dataset from a different geographic region (e.g., tropical forests) to test generalization beyond the USA and Kenya.
