# LLM Based Multi-Document Summarization Exploiting Main-Event Biased Monotone Submodular Content Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03414
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03414
- Reference count: 9
- One-line primary result: Main-event biased monotone submodular function improves ROUGE scores and coherence in multi-document news summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a main event-focused approach for multi-document news summarization that uses a main-event biased monotone submodular function for content extraction and a fine-tuned large language model for rewriting. The method consistently outperforms baseline models on ROUGE metrics and shows better coherence in human evaluation. The approach combines discourse analysis, submodular optimization, and LLM-based rewriting to produce concise, objective summaries that report the main event.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extracts main event sentences using discourse analysis, then selects context sentences through a monotone submodular function that balances coverage, diversity, and main-event relevance. A fine-tuned flan-t5-xl model rewrites the extracted sentences into coherent summaries. The submodular function F(S) = C(S) + λ1 · D(S) + λ2 · Bmain(S) is maximized using a greedy algorithm that provides theoretical approximation guarantees. The method is evaluated on Multi-news and WCEP datasets using ROUGE metrics and human coherence assessment.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms baseline models on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics
- Human evaluation shows better coherence compared to baseline approaches
- Fine-tuned rewriting model achieves BLEU score of 0.30 on summary generation task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The main event extraction biases the summary toward a single coherent narrative by anchoring the extractive process.
- Mechanism: The method first identifies a main event sentence from each document cluster using discourse analysis, then uses that sentence as the seed for greedy selection. This ensures all extracted content is contextually related to the main event.
- Core assumption: The main event sentence is representative of the core meaning of the document cluster.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our primary objective is to succinctly report the main event, ensuring that the summary remains objective and informative."
  - [section] "We rely on an event discourse-based approach to implement the main event extractor Emain."
- Break condition: If the main event extraction fails or picks a non-central sentence, the bias collapses and the summary loses focus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The monotone submodular function enables near-optimal extractive summarization with theoretical guarantees.
- Mechanism: The function F(S) = C(S) + λ1 · D(S) + λ2 · Bmain(S) balances content coverage, diversity, and main-event relevance. The greedy algorithm approximates the optimal summary within a factor of 0.692 due to submodularity.
- Core assumption: C(S), D(S), and Bmain(S) are monotone submodular, ensuring F is monotone submodular.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Lin and Bilmes (2011) deductively showed that C(S) and D(S) are monotonically submodular."
  - [section] "Bmain(S) is monotonically submodular as Coc(i, xmain) is constant for all sentences in the input document set."
- Break condition: If any component function is not submodular, the greedy approximation bound no longer holds.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The fine-tuned LLM rewrites extracted sentences into a coherent summary, leveraging contextual understanding.
- Mechanism: After extracting N sentences biased toward the main event, the system concatenates them with the main event sentence and feeds them to a fine-tuned T5-based model that generates a fluent summary.
- Core assumption: The LLM can generate coherent text when given semantically related sentences as input.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To ensure coherence, we utilize a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) for rewriting the extracted content into a coherent text."
  - [section] "The fine-tuned re-writing model yielded a BLEU score of 0.30."
- Break condition: If the LLM hallucinates or fails to maintain coherence, the final summary quality degrades regardless of extraction quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Submodular functions and their greedy maximization
  - Why needed here: The content selection relies on a monotone submodular function to guarantee near-optimal extractive summaries.
  - Quick check question: What property of a submodular function allows greedy algorithms to provide a constant-factor approximation?

- Concept: Event-based discourse analysis
  - Why needed here: The method uses discourse structure to identify the main event sentence, which anchors the summarization.
  - Quick check question: How does event-based discourse analysis help in distinguishing the main event from supporting information?

- Concept: Sentence representation and similarity metrics
  - Why needed here: Coverage and diversity functions rely on dense sentence representations (e.g., SBERT) to measure topical similarity and cluster sentences.
  - Quick check question: Why is cosine similarity on SBERT embeddings preferred over lexical overlap for measuring topical coverage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Main Event Extractor (Emain) -> Context Extractor (F) -> Rewriter (Z) -> Final summary

- Critical path:
  Document cluster → Emain → Seed sentence → Greedy selection (F) → Extracted sentences → Z → Final summary

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Submodularity provides theoretical guarantees but limits flexibility in combining objectives.
  - Using a fine-tuned LLM for rewriting trades control for fluency and coherence.
  - The method is unsupervised for summarization but requires labeled data for training subcomponents.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low ROUGE scores despite high extraction recall → LLM rewriting issue
  - High extraction diversity but poor coherence → Main event extraction or bias term ineffective
  - Inconsistent performance across datasets → Hyperparameter sensitivity or domain mismatch

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Emain on a small document cluster and verify the main event sentence is central to the narrative.
  2. Test the greedy extraction with C(S) + λ1 · D(S) only (no bias) and compare ROUGE scores to the full method.
  3. Evaluate the rewriter (Z) on a held-out set of extracted sentences to measure coherence and fluency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the main event-focused approach perform on datasets with less structured or less event-centric news articles compared to traditional datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on event-centric news summarization and uses datasets like Multi-news and WCEP, which are event-focused. It mentions creating a dataset with summaries written to report the main event.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the approach's performance on datasets with less structured or less event-centric news articles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on datasets with varied news structures and event centrality to compare performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the fine-tuned LLM for rewriting compare to other state-of-the-art LLMs for text generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a fine-tuned flan-t5-xl model for rewriting and reports a BLEU score of 0.30 for this task.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the main event-biased monotone submodular function perform when applied to non-news text summarization tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on news summarization and introduces a main event-biased monotone submodular function for content extraction. The function's components are designed for topical coverage, diversity, and main event-based importance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the application of the main event-biased monotone submodular function to non-news text summarization tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the function to non-news text summarization tasks and evaluating its performance in terms of content coverage, diversity, and relevance to the main topic.

## Limitations
- Main event extraction relies on discourse analysis which may not generalize across domains
- Performance depends on empirically optimized hyperparameters without systematic exploration
- Theoretical guarantees assume specific mathematical properties that are asserted but not independently verified

## Confidence
- Medium: The experimental results show consistent improvements over baselines, and the theoretical framework is sound, but the lack of hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and the dependence on specific implementation choices reduce confidence in reproducibility.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method's performance when the main event extraction fails or selects non-central sentences to verify the robustness of the main-event bias mechanism.
2. Conduct a systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for α, λ1, λ2, k, and c to determine if the reported values are truly optimal or domain-specific.
3. Evaluate factual consistency and bias mitigation effectiveness beyond coherence to validate the claims of improved objectivity and informative summarization.
