# Leveraging Activation Maximization and Generative Adversarial Training to Recognize and Explain Patterns in Natural Areas in Satellite Imagery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08923
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08923
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Combines activation maximization with Cycle GANs to generate attribution maps identifying naturalness patterns in protected areas, outperforming standard XAI methods with IoU of 93.2% vs 81.2-53.3%

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel framework that integrates activation maximization into Cycle GANs to explain designating patterns in protected natural areas using satellite imagery. The approach generates two images—one maximizing and one minimizing naturalness characteristics—and computes their pixel-wise differences to create attribution maps. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset of Fennoscandian protected areas, the method produces attribution maps that highlight wetlands, water bodies, and bare lands as critical naturalness indicators, providing more complete and valid explanations than standard XAI methods.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in three phases: pattern learning, pattern enhancement, and attribution mapping. First, a single-class classifier is trained on protected areas to learn naturalness patterns. Second, a modified Cycle GAN with two sub-GANs (pattern-maximizer and pattern-minimizer) generates images that either enhance or suppress naturalness characteristics, incorporating activation maximization into the objective function. Finally, attribution maps are created by calculating the average absolute difference between the generated images across all spectral bands, revealing the most influential patterns for classification decisions.

## Key Results
- Attribution maps show wetlands, water bodies, and bare lands as critical naturalness indicators in protected areas
- IoU metrics of 93.2% significantly outperform standard XAI methods (DeepLIFT 81.2%, occlusion sensitivity 53.3%, GradCAM 62.1%)
- Framework aligns with domain knowledge about wilderness characteristics in Fennoscandia
- Method provides more complete and valid explanations for designating patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating activation maximization into the Cycle GAN objective enables generation of images that both maximize and minimize the classifier's activation, creating a clear signal of discriminative patterns.
- Mechanism: The activation maximization loss term (LAM) directly optimizes generated images to increase or decrease the classification score by modifying pixel values while maintaining structural similarity through the L1 similarity loss.
- Core assumption: The classifier's decision boundary correlates with meaningful ecological patterns rather than arbitrary features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our proposed framework produces more precise attribution maps pinpointing the designating patterns forming the natural authenticity of protected areas."
  - [section] "The activation maximization loss term, as proposed in [13] and [11], compels the generator to add features to the generated images that will increase and decrease its classification score for both the pattern-maximizer and pattern-minimizer generators, respectively"
  - [corpus] Found related work on activation maximization for time series and image classification, suggesting this approach is applicable beyond natural areas.
- Break condition: If the classifier learns spurious correlations rather than true ecological patterns, the generated images would highlight misleading features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Comparing maximized and minimized naturalness images through pixel-wise absolute difference reveals the most influential patterns for classification decisions.
- Mechanism: The attribution map is created by calculating the average absolute difference between the pattern-maximized and pattern-minimized images across all spectral bands, with higher differences indicating more important features.
- Core assumption: The difference between enhanced and suppressed pattern images will highlight the features the classifier uses to distinguish natural from anthropogenic areas.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To produce the attribution maps of the characterizing patterns, we calculate the average absolute difference between the generated images for each image band."
  - [abstract] "Our approach outperforms standard XAI methods like DeepLIFT, occlusion sensitivity, and GradCAM in IoU metrics (93.2% vs 81.2-53.3%), providing more complete and valid explanations aligned with domain knowledge about wilderness characteristics."
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence in corpus for this specific comparison approach, but activation maximization literature supports pixel difference methods.
- Break condition: If the generator fails to create meaningful variations between maximized and minimized images, the difference would not reveal discriminative patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining generated attribution maps with domain knowledge validates the explanations by ensuring high attributions correspond to known naturalness indicators like wetlands and bare lands.
- Mechanism: The attribution maps are evaluated against CORINE land cover data to verify that high-importance pixels align with wetlands and bare lands, which are recognized as naturalness indicators.
- Core assumption: Domain knowledge about wetlands and bare lands being naturalness indicators is accurate and complete.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We can conclude that our method, combined with domain knowledge, produces complete and valid explanations that align with the expert's opinions."
  - [abstract] "Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset of Fennoscandian protected areas, the method produces attribution maps showing wetlands, water bodies, and bare lands as critical naturalness indicators."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific validation approach, but the approach is methodologically sound.
- Break condition: If domain knowledge is incomplete or incorrect, the validation would incorrectly reject valid explanations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GANs)
  - Why needed here: The framework requires a generative model that can modify input images while maintaining their structural integrity, which Cycle GANs are designed to do through cycle consistency.
  - Quick check question: How does cycle consistency ensure that the generated images maintain the main structures of the input image while only modifying the patterns that affect classification?

- Concept: Activation Maximization
  - Why needed here: This technique is used to find input patterns that maximally activate the classifier's output, which is essential for generating images that either enhance or suppress naturalness characteristics.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between standard activation maximization and the approach used here where it's integrated into a Cycle GAN objective function?

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI) methods comparison
  - Why needed here: Understanding why this approach outperforms standard XAI methods like DeepLIFT, occlusion sensitivity, and GradCAM is crucial for appreciating the innovation.
  - Quick check question: Why do traditional XAI methods fail to provide "complete and valid explanations" for naturalness patterns compared to the proposed approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image → single-class classifier (pattern learning) → Cycle GAN generates maximized/minimized images → pixel-wise absolute difference → attribution map
- Critical path: The classifier must be trained first, then the Cycle GAN is trained using the classifier's feedback to generate the pattern-maximized and pattern-minimized images
- Design tradeoffs: Using only RGB channels instead of all Sentinel-2 bands reduces computational cost but may miss some spectral information. The λAM = 0.3 weighting balances between generating realistic images and emphasizing discriminative patterns.
- Failure signatures: If the attribution maps highlight non-discriminative vegetation areas or fail to emphasize wetlands and bare lands, the classifier may have learned spurious correlations. If the generated images contain significant artifacts, the Cycle GAN training may be unstable.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the single-class classifier on the AnthroProtect dataset and verify it achieves >95% accuracy on the test set.
  2. Train the modified Cycle GAN with only similarity and cycle consistency losses (without activation maximization) to ensure basic image reconstruction works.
  3. Generate attribution maps for a small validation set and visually inspect whether high-importance areas correspond to wetlands and water bodies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How does the proposed framework's attribution quality compare when applied to datasets with significantly different characteristics (e.g., urban areas, agricultural landscapes, or tropical forests) compared to the Fennoscandian protected areas used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "our approach can be extended to multi-class classifications and various applications" and suggest it is "a promising direction in the Earth sciences."
  - Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the framework on a single dataset (AnthroProtect) representing Fennoscandian protected areas. No validation on other landscape types or land cover classes is provided.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Applying the framework to diverse datasets (urban, agricultural, tropical, etc.) and comparing attribution quality (IoU metrics, alignment with domain knowledge) across these domains would demonstrate generalizability.

- Open Question 2: What is the impact of the weighting factor λ on the trade-off between pattern enhancement quality and computational efficiency in the Cycle GAN training?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention setting λAM = 0.3 and acknowledge "high computational cost and the possibility of generating artifacts" as challenges.
  - Why unresolved: While λ is set to a specific value in the experiments, the paper does not explore how different values affect attribution quality, artifact generation, or computational requirements.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying λ across a range of values while measuring attribution map quality (IoU, visual inspection) and training time/computational resources would clarify this trade-off.

- Open Question 3: Can the proposed attribution maps effectively guide conservation prioritization or monitoring strategies for protected natural areas?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their approach "fosters our understanding of the ecological integrity of the protected natural areas and may contribute to future monitoring and preservation efforts."
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the framework's ability to identify designating patterns but does not validate whether these attributions translate to actionable conservation insights or improved monitoring outcomes.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Case studies applying the attribution maps to actual conservation planning scenarios, demonstrating how identified patterns inform resource allocation, monitoring focus areas, or policy decisions would establish practical utility.

## Limitations

- The framework relies on domain knowledge about naturalness indicators, which may be incomplete or vary across different geographical regions
- Restriction to RGB channels misses potentially important spectral information from other Sentinel-2 bands
- High computational cost of Cycle GAN training and potential for generating artifacts

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism of using activation maximization within Cycle GANs to generate attribution maps, supported by strong quantitative results and alignment with domain knowledge
- **Medium confidence** regarding the generalizability beyond the Fennoscandian protected areas context, as the method relies on domain-specific naturalness indicators
- **Low confidence** remains in the architectural details of the pattern learning classifier and complete training hyperparameter specifications, which could affect reproducibility

## Next Checks

1. Apply the method to protected areas in different biomes to test generalizability of the naturalness indicators
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal λAM weighting by testing values from 0.1 to 0.5
3. Compare attribution maps generated using all Sentinel-2 bands versus only RGB channels to quantify the impact of spectral information on explanation quality
