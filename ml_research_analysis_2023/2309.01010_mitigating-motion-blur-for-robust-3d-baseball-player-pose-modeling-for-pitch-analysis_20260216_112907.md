# Mitigating Motion Blur for Robust 3D Baseball Player Pose Modeling for Pitch Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.01010
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01010
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: 54.2% reduction in 2D loss and 36.2% reduction in 3D loss for baseball pitch pose estimation through selective motion blur augmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate 3D pose estimation for baseball pitchers in broadcast videos, where motion blur significantly degrades pose estimation quality. The authors propose a focused augmentation strategy that selectively introduces motion blur effects in regions with high motion, combined with leveraging in-the-wild videos to improve generalization across different camera positions and lighting conditions. By optimizing augmentation parameters, the method achieves substantial improvements in both 2D and 3D pose estimation accuracy, demonstrating that targeted augmentation can be more effective than complex deblurring pipelines.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines selective motion blur augmentation with in-the-wild video integration to improve baseball pitch pose estimation. Motion flow vectors between consecutive frames are estimated using a transformer network, and motion blur is selectively applied to high-motion regions using oriented filters. The approach also incorporates high-quality slow-motion videos from public sources, generating pseudo-groundtruth poses that are augmented with motion blur to expand the training distribution. A regression-based 2D pose estimator is used due to dataset constraints lacking camera parameters, followed by a transformer-based network for 3D pose estimation and a spectral GCN for mesh regression.

## Key Results
- 54.2% reduction in loss on test dataset for 2D pose estimation
- 36.2% reduction in loss on test dataset for 3D pose estimation
- 29.2% average improvement when integrating the framework with existing pose estimators
- Optimal configuration found with 2 motion blur filters and patch size of 64x64 pixels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Selective motion blur augmentation in high-motion patches improves network robustness to motion blur in pitcher poses
- Mechanism: Optical flow estimation identifies patches with large motion vectors, and oriented motion blur filters are applied only to those regions
- Core assumption: Motion blur effects are localized to regions with high relative motion between frames
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "selectively inducing motion blur effects in specific regions of the frames"
  - [section]: "N patches with most Mt k value is selected as the target regions to introduce motion blur effect"
- Break condition: If motion blur patterns are too sparse or uniform across the frame, the selective approach may not generalize

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating in-the-wild videos with pseudo-groundtruth pose data enhances model generalization
- Mechanism: High-quality slow-motion videos generate pseudo-groundtruth poses, then the same selective motion blur augmentation is applied
- Core assumption: Pose estimation accuracy in high-quality videos transfers to low-quality broadcast frames after augmentation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leveraging in-the-wild videos to make our model robust under different real-world conditions and camera positions"
  - [section]: "leveraged videos from various public sources, featuring slow-motion recordings of pitching actions in professional baseball games"
- Break condition: If pseudo-groundtruth poses are inaccurate or domain shift is too large, performance gains may not materialize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a regression-based 2D pose estimator avoids inaccuracies in keypoint localization
- Mechanism: Direct coordinate regression sidesteps the optimization step needed to project 3D groundtruth poses to 2D camera coordinates
- Core assumption: The dataset lacks reliable camera parameters, making heatmap-based projection inaccurate
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we opted for a regressor-based approach due to potential challenges in achieving accurate overlap between the 2D pose of the pitcher obtained through the optimization process of the camera projection"
  - [section]: "the absence of the camera parameters"
- Break condition: If camera parameters become available or dataset constraints change, heatmap-based methods may become preferable

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Optical flow estimation for motion analysis
  - Why needed here: To identify regions with significant motion for targeted blur augmentation
  - Quick check question: How does the RAFT-based optical flow algorithm handle occluded regions differently from traditional methods?

- Concept: Motion blur filter parameterization and application
  - Why needed here: To synthesize realistic motion blur effects that match broadcast video artifacts
  - Quick check question: What role does the rotation angle ω play in creating realistic motion blur orientation?

- Concept: Pseudo-groundtruth generation from in-the-wild videos
  - Why needed here: To expand training data beyond the limited broadcast dataset with reliable pose annotations
  - Quick check question: How does the quality of pseudo-groundtruth poses affect downstream 3D pose estimation accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Motion blur learning module -> 2D pose estimator -> 3D pose estimator -> 3D body model
- Critical path: Motion blur learning module → 2D pose estimator → 3D pose estimator → 3D body model
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Selective vs. uniform motion blur: Selective is more realistic but computationally heavier
  - Regression vs. heatmap 2D pose: Regression avoids camera parameter dependency but may lose spatial precision
  - In-the-wild data quality: Higher quality videos improve pseudo-groundtruth but may reduce domain similarity
- Failure signatures:
  - 2D loss plateauing: Indicates insufficient motion blur augmentation or poor pseudo-groundtruth quality
  - 3D loss not improving: Suggests 2D pose errors are too large or transformer architecture is inadequate
  - Mesh reconstruction artifacts: Points to issues in spectral GCN or input pose quality
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate optical flow accuracy on consecutive pitch frames with known motion patterns
  2. Test different numbers of blur filters (1, 2, 3) on a subset of training data and measure 2D loss impact
  3. Compare regression vs. heatmap 2D pose estimation on the broadcast dataset with synthetic camera parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed motion blur augmentation strategy compare to more complex deblurring pipelines in terms of computational efficiency and resource requirements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that their focused augmentation strategy "challenges the conventional belief in complex pipelines and shows significant improvements in handling these challenges."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of computational efficiency or resource requirements between their approach and more complex deblurring methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis comparing the computational cost, memory usage, and training/inference time of the proposed method versus state-of-the-art deblurring pipelines would provide clarity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the number of motion blur filters and patch size for different types of fast-moving actions in baseball?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses varying the number of filters and patch sizes in their ablation studies, but does not explore the optimal balance for different action types.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focused on finding optimal parameters for general motion blur, not for specific baseball actions like pitching, batting, or fielding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different filter and patch size combinations for various baseball actions and comparing the results would determine the optimal balance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on other sports or activities with fast-moving subjects beyond baseball?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the method was tested on baseball pitch analysis, but does not explore its applicability to other sports.
- Why unresolved: The study was limited to baseball, and the generalizability of the approach to other sports or activities with fast-moving subjects remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method on datasets from other sports or activities with fast-moving subjects and comparing the results to baseline methods would demonstrate its broader applicability.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on accurate optical flow estimation and pseudo-groundtruth quality from in-the-wild videos
- Performance may diminish if motion blur patterns in broadcast videos differ significantly from those synthesized during training
- Dataset constraints limiting camera parameter availability restrict applicability to other scenarios with proper calibration

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The 54.2% reduction in 2D loss and 36.2% reduction in 3D loss are well-supported by controlled augmentation experiments
- **Medium confidence**: The 29.2% average improvement when integrating with existing pose estimators depends on unspecified baseline models
- **Low confidence**: Claims about generalization to "different real-world conditions and camera positions" lack comprehensive validation across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test the model's performance on broadcast videos from different camera angles and lighting conditions not present in the training data to verify cross-domain robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the in-the-wild video component to isolate its contribution to the reported performance gains
3. Evaluate the optical flow estimation accuracy on consecutive pitch frames with known motion patterns to ensure reliable motion blur synthesis
