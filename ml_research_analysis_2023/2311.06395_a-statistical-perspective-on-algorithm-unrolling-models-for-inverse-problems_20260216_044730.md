# A statistical perspective on algorithm unrolling models for inverse problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06395
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06395
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Optimal GDN depth scales as log(n)/log(ϱ⁻¹ₙ); simple proximal operators enable parametric rate O(D′/√n)

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a rigorous statistical analysis of gradient descent networks (GDNs), a class of algorithm unrolling models for inverse problems. The authors develop a sparse Bayesian framework with spike-and-slab priors to analyze GDNs in a regression setting with known forward models. They establish that the optimal statistical performance is achieved at an unrolling depth of order log(n)/log(ϱ⁻¹ₙ), where n is the sample size and ϱₙ is the convergence rate of the underlying gradient descent algorithm. The work also demonstrates that when the proximal operator of the regularizer is simple, GDNs can achieve parametric convergence rates, while deeper unrolling leads to overfitting.

## Method Summary
The method uses a sparse Bayesian framework with spike-and-slab priors on the parameters of gradient descent networks. The GDN architecture unrolls proximal gradient descent steps, with each proximal operator approximated by a small neural network. The spike-and-slab prior encourages sparsity in the network parameters, with parameters set as ρ₀=n, ρ₁=1, and u=1. Posterior inference is performed using SA-SGLD (stochastic approximation stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics) MCMC sampling. The approach balances approximation error from unrolling depth against variance from finite samples to achieve optimal statistical performance.

## Key Results
- Optimal GDN depth scales as D' ~ log(n)/log(ϱ⁻¹ₙ) for statistical performance
- When proximal operator is simple, GDNs achieve parametric rate O(D′/√n)
- GDNs are prone to overfitting as unrolling depth D′ increases beyond optimal
- Theoretical results validated through numerical examples including elastic net regression, image deblurring, and CelebA image deblurring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GDNs achieve optimal statistical performance when unrolling depth is scaled as \( D' \sim \log(n)/\log(\varrho_n^{-1}) \).
- Mechanism: The statistical error rate of GDNs depends on how well the unrolled proximal gradient descent approximates the true inverse map \( g \). At depth \( D' \), the approximation error is bounded by \( R_0\varrho_n^{D'} \) from convergence of proximal gradient descent. By tuning \( D' \) to balance this bias with the variance term \( O(D'/\sqrt{n}) \), the optimal depth scales logarithmically with sample size.
- Core assumption: H2-(2) holds — proximal gradient descent converges linearly to \( g \) at rate \( \varrho_n \).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that the unrolling depth needed for the optimal statistical performance of GDNs is of order log(n)/log(\varrho_n^{-1})."
  - [section]: "Theorem 5 recommends carefully scaling the depth parameter D′ as \( D′ \sim -\log(n)/\log(\varrho_n) \), for optimal performance."
- Break condition: If H2-(2) fails (no linear convergence), the \( \log(n) \) scaling no longer holds and optimal depth may grow differently.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: When the proximal map of \( R \) is simple, GDNs can achieve parametric rate \( O(D'/\sqrt{n}) \).
- Mechanism: If Prox\(_{\gamma R} \) can be approximated well by a small neural network (low \( \beta_1, \beta_2 \)), the unrolled network directly learns the inverse map without significant bias. The only source of error is the finite-sample variance, scaled by unrolling depth \( D' \).
- Core assumption: H3 holds with small \( \beta_1, \beta_2 \) (simple proximal map).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also show that when the negative log-density of the latent variable x has a simple proximal operator, then a GDN unrolled at depth D′ can solve the inverse problem at the parametric rate \( O(D'/\sqrt{n}) \)."
  - [section]: "For example, if \( \mu \) is as in (20)... our result shows that the GDN achieves the parametric rate \( C_3 \times D'/\sqrt{n} \), for some dimension-dependent constant \( C_3 \)."
- Break condition: If the proximal map is complex (large \( \beta_1, \beta_2 \)), the approximation error dominates and parametric rate is lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GDNs are prone to overfitting as \( D' \) increases beyond the optimal depth.
- Mechanism: As \( D' \) grows, the variance term \( O(D'/\sqrt{n}) \) increases linearly while the bias from approximation may already be negligible. The total error \( O(D'/\sqrt{n}) \) thus grows with \( D' \), indicating overfitting.
- Core assumption: The model class {gW, W ∈ W} is rich enough to fit noise when unrolled too deeply.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our results thus also suggest that algorithm unrolling models are prone to overfitting as the unrolling depth D′ increases."
  - [section]: "Our result thus also suggest that the statistical performance of a GDN unrolled at depth D′ deteriorates as D′ increases, implying an overfitting phenomenon."
- Break condition: If regularization or early stopping is applied, the overfitting trend may be mitigated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sub-Gaussian concentration of the latent variable
  - Why needed here: Assumption H1 requires the conditional distribution of \( x \) given \( y \) to be tightly concentrated around \( g(y) \). This justifies the regression model \( x_i = g(y_i) + \xi_i \) and allows controlling the variance of the estimator.
  - Quick check question: Can you verify that the conditional distribution of \( x \) given \( y \) has sub-Gaussian tails with constant norm \( \sigma_i \)?

- Concept: Linear convergence of proximal gradient descent
  - Why needed here: H2-(2) assumes proximal gradient descent converges linearly to \( g \) with rate \( \varrho_n \). This is essential for bounding the approximation error of the unrolled network.
  - Quick check question: For the specific inverse problem, can you derive or verify the linear convergence rate \( \varrho_n \) of proximal gradient descent?

- Concept: Deep neural network approximation theory
  - Why needed here: H3 requires that the proximal map can be approximated by a neural network with controlled depth and sparsity. This determines the constants \( \beta_1, \beta_2 \) in the statistical rate.
  - Quick check question: Given the form of \( R \), can you construct a neural network approximating Prox\(_{\gamma R} \) and bound its depth and sparsity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - GDN function \( g_W \): unrolled proximal gradient descent with depth \( D' \).
  - Proximal map approximation \( H_W \): feed-forward network approximating Prox\(_{\gamma R} \).
  - Sparse spike-and-slab prior: Bayesian sparsity-inducing prior on network parameters.
  - SA-SGLD sampler: approximate MCMC sampler for posterior inference.

- Critical path:
  1. Define forward model \( f(y|x) \) and prior \( R(x) \).
  2. Construct \( H_W \) approximating Prox\(_{\gamma R} \) (check H3).
  3. Build GDN \( g_W \) by unrolling \( D' \) steps.
  4. Specify spike-and-slab prior (set \( \rho_0 = n, \rho_1 = 1, u = 1 \)).
  5. Run SA-SGLD to sample from posterior.
  6. Evaluate estimator \( g_{\Lambda \odot W} \) and check overfitting.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Unrolling depth \( D' \): deeper → better bias, worse variance/overfitting.
  - Network size in \( H_W \): larger → better proximal approximation, higher complexity.
  - Prior parameters \( u, \rho_0 \): smaller \( u \) → sparser solutions, larger \( \rho_0 \) → tighter shrinkage.
  - Step size \( \gamma \): must satisfy \( 0 < \gamma \leq M^{-1} \) for convergence.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance if \( D' \) too small: large bias, slow convergence.
  - Degradation if \( D' \) too large: overfitting, increasing test error.
  - Numerical instability if \( \gamma \) too large: divergence of unrolled iterations.
  - Ineffective sparsity if \( \rho_0 \) too small: dense solutions, overfitting.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Toy elastic net regression**: Generate synthetic data with known sparse structure. Vary \( D' \) and monitor test error to observe optimal depth and overfitting trend.
  2. **Deblurring with known kernel**: Use a simple Gaussian blur on synthetic images. Compare GDN vs. non-unrolled FNN at different \( D' \) to validate improvement from using forward model.
  3. **Real image deblurring**: Apply to CelebA dataset with Gaussian blur. Test at multiple \( D' \) and check if performance peaks at \( D' \sim \log(n)/\log(\varrho_n^{-1}) \) as theory predicts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise relationship between the unrolling depth D' and the convergence rate ϱ_n of the proximal gradient algorithm, and how does this impact the optimal choice of D'?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the best performance of a GDN is achieved by scaling the network depth as D' ~ log(n)/log(ϱ_n^(-1)).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a rigorous proof or detailed analysis of this relationship, nor does it offer empirical evidence to support this claim.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed theoretical analysis proving the relationship between D' and ϱ_n, along with empirical studies showing the impact of different D' values on the performance of GDNs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the statistical performance of GDNs compare to other deep learning models in inverse problems, especially when the forward model is unknown?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that GDNs, by leveraging the structure of the forward model, can achieve better rates than minimax rates for estimating Lipschitz functions in high-dimensional settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison with other deep learning models or discuss the performance of GDNs when the forward model is not known.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of GDNs and other deep learning models on inverse problems, both with known and unknown forward models, to assess their relative performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational and memory costs associated with implementing GDNs, especially as the unrolling depth D' increases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the gradient of the loss with respect to W is typically computed by back-propagation through the entire network, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational and memory costs of GDNs, nor does it discuss strategies to mitigate these costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study of the computational and memory requirements of GDNs at different depths, along with proposed methods to reduce these costs.

## Limitations

- The theoretical analysis relies heavily on linear convergence of proximal gradient descent, which may not hold for all inverse problems.
- The assumption that proximal operators can be well-approximated by small neural networks may fail for complex regularizers.
- The practical impact of spike-and-slab prior parameters on statistical performance is not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The overfitting trend as unrolling depth increases is well-supported by the variance-bias tradeoff analysis and numerical experiments. The connection between proximal operator complexity and approximation error is rigorously established.

**Medium confidence**: The optimal depth scaling of log(n)/log(ϱₙ⁻¹) assumes specific convergence properties that may not transfer to all problem classes. The parametric rate O(D′/√n) depends on the neural network approximation bounds, which are conservative in practice.

**Low confidence**: The practical impact of the spike-and-slab prior parameters (u, ρ₀, ρ₁) on statistical performance is not thoroughly explored, and their optimal settings for different inverse problems remain unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence verification**: For a specific inverse problem (e.g., deblurring), numerically verify the linear convergence rate ϱₙ of proximal gradient descent to test the validity of the log(n) depth scaling.

2. **Approximation complexity**: For a non-trivial regularizer R, construct the approximating neural network for ProxγR and empirically measure its depth and sparsity to validate the H3 assumption.

3. **Overfitting threshold**: Systematically vary D′ in numerical experiments (elastic net regression, image deblurring) to identify the optimal depth and confirm the deterioration trend beyond this point.
