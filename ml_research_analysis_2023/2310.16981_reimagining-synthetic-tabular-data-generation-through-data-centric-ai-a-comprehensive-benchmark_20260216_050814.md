# Reimagining Synthetic Tabular Data Generation through Data-Centric AI: A Comprehensive Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16981
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16981
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies consistently improve synthetic data utility across classification, model selection, and feature selection tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the integration of data-centric AI techniques to improve synthetic tabular data generation. The authors propose a framework that profiles data samples to guide the generation of more representative synthetic data. Through benchmarking five state-of-the-art generative models on eleven datasets, they demonstrate that data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies consistently improve the utility of synthetic data across tasks like classification, model selection, and feature selection, despite lower statistical fidelity. The results show that different generative models have varying performance, with CTGAN and TVAE offering the best trade-off between high statistical fidelity and strong downstream performance.

## Method Summary
The study benchmarks five generative models (Bayesian networks, CTGAN, TVAE, NFlow, TabDDPM) on eleven tabular classification datasets. Data-centric preprocessing uses Cleanlab, Data-IQ, or Data Maps to profile data into easy, ambiguous, and hard categories, then applies strategies like easy_hard and easy_ambiguous_hard. Postprocessing includes baseline and no_hard strategies. Synthetic data quality is evaluated through statistical fidelity metrics (inverse KL-divergence, MMD, Wasserstein distance) and downstream utility metrics (classification AUROC, Spearman rank correlation for model and feature selection).

## Key Results
- Data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing consistently improve synthetic data utility across classification, model selection, and feature selection tasks
- Statistical fidelity metrics alone are insufficient to evaluate synthetic data quality
- Different generative models excel at different downstream tasks, with CTGAN and TVAE offering the best overall trade-off

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing consistently improve synthetic data utility across tasks
- Mechanism: By profiling data samples into categories (easy, ambiguous, hard) and using these profiles to guide synthetic data generation, the resulting data better reflects real-world data nuances, leading to improved downstream performance
- Core assumption: The data profile categories (easy, ambiguous, hard) are meaningful proxies for real-world data quality and complexity
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Through benchmarking five state-of-the-art generative models on eleven datasets, they demonstrate that data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies consistently improve the utility of synthetic data across tasks like classification, model selection, and feature selection" and [section 3.1.1] "We generate data using each generative model and the combined synthetic data is then Dsynth = Geasy(Deasy train) ∪ Ghard(Dhard train), with generation preserving the ratio of the data segments"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Statistical fidelity metrics alone are insufficient to evaluate synthetic data quality
- Mechanism: High statistical fidelity (e.g., inverse KL-divergence) does not guarantee that synthetic data captures the complex nuances of real-world data, which are crucial for downstream tasks
- Core assumption: Statistical fidelity metrics do not capture the subtle complexities and data quality issues present in real-world data
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "despite seemingly high statistical fidelity" and "despite all generative models providing near-perfect statistical fidelity based on divergence measures, the synthetic data captures the nuances of real data differently" and [section 3.3.1] "The quality of synthetic data is commonly assessed using divergence measures between the real and synthetic data [5, 30]"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different generative models excel at different downstream tasks, and no single model is superior across all tasks
- Mechanism: Each generative model has unique strengths in capturing data distributions and nuances, leading to varying performance on classification, model selection, and feature selection tasks
- Core assumption: The performance of generative models on downstream tasks is not uniform across all tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "different generative models have varying performance, with CTGAN and TVAE offering the best trade-off between high statistical fidelity and strong downstream performance" and [section 5] "Specifically, TabDPPM achieves the highest classification performance, CTGAN performs best in model selection, and TV AE excels in feature selection"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data profiling and categorization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how data samples are categorized into profiles (easy, ambiguous, hard) is crucial for implementing data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories used to profile data samples in this study, and what do they represent?

- Concept: Generative models for tabular data
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with different types of generative models (e.g., Bayesian networks, GANs, VAEs, normalizing flows, diffusion models) is essential for understanding their strengths and weaknesses in synthetic data generation
  - Quick check question: Name two generative models evaluated in this study and briefly describe their approach to generating synthetic tabular data

- Concept: Downstream task evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to evaluate synthetic data quality through downstream tasks (classification, model selection, feature selection) is crucial for interpreting the results and making practical recommendations
  - Quick check question: What are the three downstream tasks used to evaluate synthetic data utility in this study, and why are they important?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data profiling: Cleanlab, Data-IQ, Data Maps
  - Generative models: Bayesian networks, CTGAN, TVAE, normalizing flows, TabDDPM
  - Preprocessing strategies: baseline, easy_hard, easy_ambiguous_hard
  - Postprocessing strategies: baseline, no_hard
  - Evaluation metrics: statistical fidelity (inverse KL-divergence, MMD, Wasserstein distance), data utility (classification performance, model selection, feature selection)

- Critical path:
  1. Profile real data using data-centric methods
  2. Apply preprocessing strategy to real data
  3. Train generative model(s) on preprocessed data
  4. Generate synthetic data
  5. Apply postprocessing strategy to synthetic data
  6. Evaluate synthetic data using statistical fidelity and data utility metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing statistical fidelity and data utility: Higher statistical fidelity does not always translate to better data utility
  - Computational cost vs. performance: More complex preprocessing and postprocessing strategies may improve performance but increase computational requirements
  - Generality vs. specificity: Using a single generative model may be more efficient but may not capture all data nuances as well as using multiple models for different data profiles

- Failure signatures:
  - Synthetic data performs well on statistical fidelity metrics but poorly on downstream tasks
  - No significant improvement in data utility after applying data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing
  - Inconsistent performance across different datasets or generative models

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a single generative model (e.g., CTGAN) on a simple dataset (e.g., Adult) with and without data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing
  2. Compare the performance of two generative models (e.g., CTGAN and TVAE) on the same dataset, focusing on their strengths in different downstream tasks
  3. Investigate the impact of varying the proportion of labeled data noise on the effectiveness of data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies perform across different types of tabular data, such as structured data with high cardinality versus low cardinality features?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that datasets span several domains and contain a highly varied number of samples and features, but does not provide a detailed analysis of performance across different types of tabular data
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a general benchmarking of generative models and data-centric methods without delving into the specifics of how these methods perform on different types of tabular data structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that specifically compare the performance of data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing strategies on datasets with high cardinality features versus low cardinality features, and analyzing the results to determine any significant differences in performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing on the interpretability of the synthetic data generated by different models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the utility of synthetic data in terms of classification performance, model selection, and feature selection, but does not address the interpretability of the synthetic data itself
- Why unresolved: While the paper evaluates the utility of synthetic data, it does not explore how data-centric methods affect the interpretability of the generated data, which is crucial for understanding and trusting the synthetic data
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating how data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing affect the interpretability of synthetic data by assessing the clarity and transparency of the generated data, possibly through user studies or interpretability metrics

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do data-centric methods perform when applied to synthetic data generation in domains with high levels of noise and missing data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper briefly touches on the impact of label noise in the experiments but does not extensively explore the performance of data-centric methods in domains with high levels of noise and missing data
- Why unresolved: The study includes a controlled experiment on label noise but does not address the broader challenge of noise and missing data in real-world applications, which is a common issue in many domains
- What evidence would resolve it: Performing experiments that apply data-centric methods to synthetic data generation in domains known for high noise and missing data, such as healthcare or social media data, and evaluating the performance and robustness of these methods in such contexts

## Limitations
- The study is limited to tabular datasets with <50 features, raising questions about scalability
- The effectiveness of data-centric preprocessing depends heavily on the quality of data profiling tools (Cleanlab, Data-IQ, Data Maps)
- The claim that "no single model is superior across all tasks" may be dataset-dependent

## Confidence
- High confidence: Data-centric preprocessing and postprocessing consistently improve synthetic data utility across tasks
- Medium confidence: Statistical fidelity metrics alone are insufficient to evaluate synthetic data quality
- Medium confidence: Different generative models excel at different downstream tasks

## Next Checks
1. Test the data-centric framework on tabular datasets with >50 features to evaluate scalability limitations
2. Implement cross-validation across additional datasets not included in the original benchmark to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual data profiling components (Cleanlab, Data-IQ, Data Maps) to quantify their specific contributions to performance improvements
