# Improving Language Models Meaning Understanding and Consistency by Learning Conceptual Roles from Dictionary

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15541
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15541
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: CRM learning improves PLMs' meaning awareness by capturing precise conceptual interconnections, enabling concurrent improvement of multiple consistency types while maintaining accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of inconsistent behavior in pre-trained language models (PLMs), which undermines their trustworthiness. The core method idea is to improve PLMs' meaning awareness by learning precise interrelationships between concepts from word-definition pairs in a dictionary, based on the conceptual role theory. The authors propose an efficient parameter integration technique that updates only a few additional parameters to combine the learned interrelationship with PLMs' pre-trained knowledge. The primary results show that the approach can concurrently improve multiple types of consistency, enable efficient knowledge integration, and easily apply to other languages. Specifically, the experiments on English and Korean datasets demonstrate significant improvements in semantic and negational consistency, as well as overall accuracy, compared to baseline models and existing methods.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a Conceptual Role Model (CRM) on dictionary word-definition pairs to learn precise conceptual interrelationships, then integrating these learned representations with pre-trained language models (PLMs) through parameter averaging and low-rank adaptation. The CRM is trained using masked language modeling on dictionary data, capturing meaning through conceptual roles rather than distributional patterns. The parameter integration technique freezes PLM and CRM weights while updating only a small number of parameters, enabling efficient fine-tuning that preserves pre-trained knowledge while incorporating the learned conceptual relationships.

## Key Results
- The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art consistency across semantic, negational, symmetric, and transitive consistency benchmarks while maintaining accuracy on downstream NLU tasks.
- Parameter integration technique reduces trainable parameters from millions to thousands while preserving performance, enabling efficient knowledge integration for large PLMs.
- The method demonstrates cross-lingual applicability, with the Korean CRM trained on 1.6M word-definition pairs outperforming the English CRM trained on 455K pairs.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CRM learning improves PLMs' meaning awareness by capturing precise conceptual interconnections
- Mechanism: The CRM model is trained on word-definition pairs, where each instance contains a target word and its definition. This forces the model to learn the meaning of a concept based on its relationships with other closely interconnected concepts, rather than relying on co-occurrence patterns in general text.
- Core assumption: The conceptual role theory is valid - that a concept's meaning is primarily determined by its interconnections with other concepts rather than its context of occurrence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Based on the conceptual role theory, our method allows PLMs to capture accurate meaning by learning precise interrelationships between concepts from word-definition pairs in a dictionary"
  - [section 2.1]: "Based on the theory, by which the interrelationship between concepts predominantly determines a word's meaning (Deacon, 1998; Santoro et al., 2021; Piantadosi and Hill, 2022), our approach first learns abundant symbol meanings by tracking more precise interconnections through word-definition pairs in a dictionary"
- Break condition: If dictionary definitions don't capture the full meaning of concepts, or if the conceptual role theory doesn't adequately explain human language understanding

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Low-rank adaptation enables efficient parameter integration without catastrophic forgetting
- Mechanism: Instead of fine-tuning all parameters, the method updates only a small number of parameters (A and B matrices) that are multiplied and added to the frozen PLM and CRM weights. This reduces the number of trainable parameters from millions to thousands while preserving pre-trained knowledge.
- Core assumption: PLMs have intrinsic dimensions that can be captured with low-rank matrices, and updating only these dimensions is sufficient for adaptation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2.1]: "We introduce a low-rank adaptation technique (Hu et al., 2022) for the parameter integration, which fixes the pre-trained weights and updates only a few number of parameters based on PLMs' intrinsic dimension (Aghajanyan et al., 2021)"
  - [section 2.2.1]: "As a consequence, the number of trainable parameters is considerably reduced, enabling efficient fine-tuning for large-sized PLMs"
- Break condition: If the intrinsic dimension is too large for low-rank approximation, or if the fixed weights become incompatible with the task

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parameter averaging enables knowledge fusion from multiple models
- Mechanism: The method aggregates weights from PLM, CRM, and potentially other models through simple averaging, then applies low-rank adaptation on top. This combines different inductive biases and knowledge sources.
- Core assumption: Model weights can be meaningfully combined through addition/averaging to create a better initialization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2.2]: "The addition of Wp and Wc in Eq. 3 causes the amplification of the weight scale, which prevents us from using or searching training hyperparameters based on values used in prior studies. Thus, we used the simple averaging aggregation method (Wortsman et al., 2022)"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "To verify the impact of additional knowledge add-up, we incorporated the weights of a RoBERTa-large model trained on the meaning-matching task"
- Break condition: If models have incompatible architectures or if averaging washes out important distinctions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distributional hypothesis vs. conceptual role theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding why dictionary-based learning can improve upon standard PLM pre-training
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between how PLMs learn meaning from text vs. how humans learn from dictionary definitions?

- Concept: Low-rank adaptation and intrinsic dimensions
  - Why needed here: Understanding why updating only a small number of parameters can be effective for large models
  - Quick check question: Why does reducing trainable parameters from millions to thousands still allow effective fine-tuning?

- Concept: Parameter averaging and model fusion
  - Why needed here: Understanding how combining weights from different models can create better initializations
  - Quick check question: What's the mathematical operation used to combine PLM and CRM weights, and why is it necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PLM (RoBERTa) → CRM (dictionary-trained) → Parameter integration (averaging + low-rank adaptation) → Downstream tasks
- Critical path: Dictionary data collection → CRM training → Weight aggregation → Low-rank adaptation → Fine-tuning on downstream tasks
- Design tradeoffs: CRM provides better meaning awareness but requires dictionary data; low-rank adaptation saves compute but may limit expressivity; parameter averaging is simple but may not be optimal
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent behavior persists (CRM didn't help), training instability (bad weight initialization), poor generalization (overfitting to dictionary data)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CRM on English dictionary data and evaluate on a simple semantic task (e.g., word similarity)
  2. Apply parameter integration to RoBERTa-base and evaluate on GLUE tasks
  3. Test the effect of low-rank adaptation by comparing full fine-tuning vs. parameter integration on a small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed approach perform when trained with larger datasets of word-definition pairs, such as those obtained from the Oxford Dictionary API?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that they attempted to collect more data by leveraging the Oxford Dictionary API but were unable to obtain approval for the API key. They also note that the Korean CRM was trained with 1.6M word-definition pairs, which is about four times higher than the English CRM, and achieved better performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results on the performance of the proposed approach when trained with larger datasets of word-definition pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed approach when trained with different sizes of word-definition pair datasets, including those obtained from the Oxford Dictionary API.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed approach compare to other consistency improvement methods, such as semantic consistency regularization and paraphrased data augmentation, in terms of overall performance and resource efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that semantic consistency regularization and paraphrased data augmentation can only address specific consistency types and require expensive training resources for large PLMs. The paper also compares the proposed approach to these methods in terms of accuracy and consistency.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed approach to other consistency improvement methods in terms of overall performance and resource efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed approach perform when applied to other languages beyond English and Korean, and what are the potential challenges and limitations in extending the approach to other languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed approach is readily applicable to other languages due to the relative ease of collecting dictionary data. The paper also provides experimental results on the Korean language.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results on the performance of the proposed approach when applied to other languages beyond English and Korean. The paper also does not discuss the potential challenges and limitations in extending the approach to other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on the performance of the proposed approach when applied to other languages beyond English and Korean, as well as a discussion of the potential challenges and limitations in extending the approach to other languages.

## Limitations
- The approach relies on the availability and quality of dictionary data, which may vary across languages and domains.
- The low-rank adaptation technique, while efficient, may limit the model's expressivity compared to full fine-tuning.
- The method's effectiveness on languages with different dictionary structures or morphologically rich languages remains untested.

## Confidence
- Conceptual role theory application: Medium
- Low-rank adaptation effectiveness: Medium
- Cross-lingual applicability: Low
- Real-world consistency improvement: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on languages with different dictionary structures (e.g., morphologically rich languages) to assess cross-linguistic generalizability.
2. Evaluate performance on downstream tasks that specifically require consistent reasoning across multiple examples.
3. Compare the proposed parameter integration technique against alternative knowledge fusion methods (e.g., adapter-based approaches) to isolate the contribution of each component.
