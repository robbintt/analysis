# Modifications of the Miller definition of contrastive (counterfactual) explanations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.10832
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10832
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Key outcome**: This paper proposes two improved variants of Miller's definition of contrastive explanations based on modified Halpern-Pearl and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses limitations in Miller's definition of contrastive explanations, which was originally based on the Halpern-Pearl (HP) definition of non-contrastive explanations. Since the original HP definition has known issues that produce counterintuitive results in standard examples, the Miller definition inherits and amplifies these problems. The authors propose two improved variants of the Miller definition based on the more robust modified HP and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations. These variants retain the spirit of the original Miller definition while addressing its limitations, and all three variants satisfy an alternative unified definition that is modular with respect to the underlying non-contrastive explanation definition.

## Method Summary
The paper compares three competing definitions of contrastive explanations: the original Miller definition based on the original HP definition, and two improved variants based on the modified HP and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations. The analysis involves formal proofs of equivalence between the variants and a unified modular definition, along with examples demonstrating the behavior of each definition. The authors examine how each definition handles cases involving logical omniscience and certainty conditions, showing that the proposed variants address issues present in the original Miller definition.

## Key Results
- The original Miller definition inherits problematic issues from the original HP definition, including requiring certainty of the explanandum and being too strong in its conditions
- The modified HP and Borner definitions offer more robust alternatives that produce more intuitive results in standard examples
- Two improved variants of the Miller definition are proposed based on the modified HP and Borner definitions, retaining the spirit of the original while addressing its limitations
- All three variants (original Miller, modified HP-based, and Borner-based) satisfy an alternative unified definition that is modular with respect to the underlying non-contrastive explanation definition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The Miller definition of contrastive explanations is problematic because it inherits issues from the original HP definition of non-contrastive explanations.
- **Mechanism**: The original HP definition has issues such as requiring certainty of the explanandum (EX1) and being too strong in its conditions, leading to counterintuitive results. The Miller definition, based on the original HP definition, amplifies these issues by extending them to contrastive explanations.
- **Core assumption**: The original HP definition's problems are inherited and amplified by the Miller definition.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Crucially, the Miller definition was based on the original HP definition of explanations, but this has since been modified by Halpern; presumably because the original yields counterintuitive results in many standard examples."
  - [section] "Examples 1–2 are examples from the literature where the modified HP definition seems more well-behaved than the original."
- **Break condition**: If the original HP definition is not problematic, the Miller definition may not inherit and amplify issues.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The modified HP and Borner definitions offer more robust alternatives to the original HP definition of non-contrastive explanations.
- **Mechanism**: The modified HP definition relaxes the conditions of the original HP definition, allowing for more intuitive results. The Borner definition further addresses issues by introducing the concept of potential explanations and allowing for the omission of certain information based on certainty.
- **Core assumption**: The modified HP and Borner definitions are more robust and address the issues of the original HP definition.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We address these issues by proposing two improved variants based on the more robust modified HP and Borner definitions."
  - [section] "Example 3 says that MD is a modified HP explanation of FF, without reference to B, even though both events are required to start the fire."
- **Break condition**: If the modified HP and Borner definitions do not address the issues of the original HP definition, they may not offer more robust alternatives.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The proposed variants of the Miller definition retain the spirit of the original while addressing its limitations.
- **Mechanism**: The proposed variants are based on the modified HP and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations. They incorporate the foil and contrastive causes while maintaining the modular structure of the original Miller definition.
- **Core assumption**: The proposed variants successfully capture the essence of the Miller definition while addressing its limitations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We address these issues by proposing two improved variants based on the more robust modified HP and Borner definitions."
  - [section] "The proposed variants are based on the modified HP and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations."
- **Break condition**: If the proposed variants do not retain the spirit of the Miller definition or fail to address its limitations, they may not be effective.

  - **Quick check question**: How do contrastive causes and explanations differ from non-contrastive causes and explanations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Causal models and structural equation models -> Definitions of actual causes and non-contrastive explanations (original HP, modified HP, Borner) -> Definitions of contrastive causes and explanations (Miller, proposed variants) -> Examples and analysis of the different definitions

- **Critical path**:
  - Understand the problem with the original HP definition of non-contrastive explanations
  - Learn about the modified HP and Borner definitions as alternatives
  - Understand how the Miller definition of contrastive explanations inherits and amplifies issues
  - Learn about the proposed variants based on the modified HP and Borner definitions

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - The modified HP definition relaxes some conditions of the original HP definition, potentially leading to more intuitive results but also potentially introducing new issues.
  - The Borner definition introduces the concept of potential explanations, which may be more flexible but also more complex.
  - The proposed variants retain the spirit of the Miller definition while addressing its limitations, but may still inherit some issues from the underlying non-contrastive definitions.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - If the proposed variants do not retain the spirit of the Miller definition or fail to address its limitations, they may not be effective.
  - If the modified HP or Borner definitions introduce new issues or are not more robust than the original HP definition, the proposed variants may not be improvements.
  - If the examples used to illustrate the different definitions are not representative or do not capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios, the analysis may be limited.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement the original HP, modified HP, and Borner definitions of non-contrastive explanations and test them on a set of standard examples.
  2. Implement the Miller definition of contrastive explanations and test it on the same set of examples, comparing the results to the non-contrastive explanations.
  3. Implement the proposed variants of the Miller definition based on the modified HP and Borner definitions and test them on the same set of examples, comparing the results to the original Miller definition and the non-contrastive explanations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
No open questions were explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- The paper acknowledges that even the modified HP definition can produce counterintuitive results in certain scenarios involving logical omniscience, suggesting the proposed solutions may not be complete
- The analysis is based on theoretical examples and formal proofs rather than empirical evaluation on real-world datasets
- The unified definition that all variants supposedly satisfy is not fully detailed in the abstract, raising questions about the exact nature of the modular relationship

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The identification of issues with the original HP definition and the general observation that the Miller definition inherits these problems
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that the modified HP and Borner definitions offer more robust alternatives, as this depends on the specific examples chosen
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the proposed variants fully address all limitations of the Miller definition while retaining its essential spirit

## Next Checks
1. Implement a systematic test suite of 10-15 diverse causal scenarios (including those involving logical omniscience) to verify that the modified HP and Borner definitions produce more intuitive results than the original HP definition across a broader range of cases
2. Create a formal comparison table showing exactly which cases are handled differently by each definition variant, identifying any remaining edge cases where counterintuitive results persist
3. Implement the alternative unified definition and verify that all three variants (Miller, modified HP-based, and Borner-based) satisfy it across the test suite, documenting any violations or edge cases where the unified definition fails to capture intuitive contrastive explanations
