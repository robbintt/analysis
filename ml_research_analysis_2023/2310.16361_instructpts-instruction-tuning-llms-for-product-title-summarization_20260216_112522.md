core_contribution: The authors propose InstructPTS, an instruction-based approach
  for Product Title Summarization (PTS) that can generate diverse and controllable
  summaries based on various instructions such as desired length, presence of specific
  words, and summary specificity. The model is trained using a novel instruction fine-tuning
  strategy on a parallel dataset of original product titles and summaries, with the
  ground truth summaries being of two specificity levels (Low and Medium).

# InstructPTS: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for Product Title Summarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.16361
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16361
- **Authors**: 
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Key outcome**: Instruction fine-tuning enables controllable product title summarization with significant BLEU and ROUGE improvements over baselines

## Executive Summary
InstructPTS introduces an instruction-based approach for Product Title Summarization (PTS) that generates diverse, controllable summaries from lengthy e-commerce product titles. Unlike traditional single-summary approaches, InstructPTS can produce summaries with specific lengths, include desired phrases, and vary specificity levels based on natural language instructions. The method uses a novel instruction fine-tuning strategy on parallel datasets, achieving over 14 BLEU and 8 ROUGE point improvements compared to simple fine-tuning. Extrinsic evaluation demonstrates that these summaries preserve sufficient product characteristics for accurate retrieval in large catalogs.

## Method Summary
The approach fine-tunes FLAN-T5 models (BASE, LARGE, XL) using instruction-augmented training on parallel datasets of original product titles and summaries. Seven types of instructions are automatically generated from ground truth data, covering length constraints, phrase inclusion requirements, and specificity levels (Low: 2 words, abstract; Medium: 4 words, specific). The model is trained for up to 50 epochs with early stopping, batch size 32, and AdamW optimizer at learning rate 2e-4. Evaluation combines automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), instruction following accuracy, human preference studies, and retrieval performance using MRR and Hit@k scores on a 5M product catalog.

## Key Results
- InstructPTS achieves over 14 BLEU and 8 ROUGE point improvements versus simple fine-tuning baselines
- FLAN-T5-XL model demonstrates highest instruction following accuracy across all model sizes tested
- Retrieval evaluation shows MRR of 0.398 and Hit@20 of 0.641, indicating effective product identification using summarized titles
- Human evaluation confirms generated summaries are preferred and correctly identify product types/families

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction fine-tuning enables diverse, controllable summaries across multiple dimensions
- Mechanism: Automatically generated instructions from parallel data teach the model to encode and follow natural language constraints
- Core assumption: Model can generalize instruction-following from training data to unseen product titles
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states approach generates summaries according to various criteria; section notes flexibility over single-summary approaches
- Break condition: If instruction following accuracy drops significantly on held-out data

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Larger model size significantly improves text generation and instruction following
- Mechanism: Increased capacity captures complex relationships and enables precise constraint satisfaction
- Core assumption: Model capacity is primary bottleneck for performance
- Evidence anchors: Abstract cites 14/8 BLEU/ROUGE improvements; Table 3 shows XL model achieves highest instruction accuracy
- Break condition: If performance plateaus beyond XL size or fails to improve with additional capacity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Summarization preserves unique product characteristics for effective retrieval
- Mechanism: Summaries retain key discriminative information while reducing noise and redundancy
- Core assumption: Most important retrieval information is preserved in summaries
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions extrinsic retrieval evaluation; Table 7 shows MRR 0.398 and Hit@20 0.641
- Break condition: If retrieval performance drops significantly using summarized versus original titles

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Instruction fine-tuning and its impact on model generalization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how instruction fine-tuning differs from standard fine-tuning and why it's crucial for controllable generation
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between standard fine-tuning and instruction fine-tuning in this work?

- Concept: Text summarization metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) and their interpretation
  - Why needed here: To evaluate and compare the quality of generated summaries
  - Quick check question: How do BLEU and ROUGE scores relate to text summarization output quality?

- Concept: Product catalog retrieval systems and evaluation metrics (MRR, Hit@k)
  - Why needed here: To understand extrinsic evaluation of summary quality through retrieval performance
  - Quick check question: What do MRR and Hit@k scores indicate about product title summary effectiveness in retrieval tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: FLAN-T5 model -> Instruction fine-tuning pipeline -> Parallel dataset -> Summarization generation -> Evaluation (automated metrics, human evaluation, retrieval system)
- Critical path: Model training → Instruction generation → Fine-tuning → Summary generation → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. computational resources
  - Summary length vs. information retention
  - Instruction complexity vs. model following accuracy
  - Automated vs. human evaluation methods
- Failure signatures:
  - Low instruction following accuracy
  - Poor BLEU/ROUGE scores versus baselines
  - Low human preference in pairwise comparisons
  - Decreased retrieval performance using summarized titles
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare instruction fine-tuning vs. standard fine-tuning on small data subset
  2. Evaluate instruction following accuracy for different model sizes
  3. Assess impact of summary length on retrieval performance in controlled environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does inclusion of specific words/phrases in summaries impact downstream tasks like retrieval and recommendation? The paper demonstrates phrase inclusion capability but lacks empirical evidence on practical implications for real-world applications.

- How does summary length preference vary across product categories and impact summarization effectiveness? While the paper notes category-dependent preferences, it lacks systematic analysis of the relationship between summary length, product category, and downstream task performance.

- How does InstructPTS instruction-following capability compare to other state-of-the-art summarization models? The paper compares against baseline models but doesn't comprehensively evaluate against other state-of-the-art models in the field.

## Limitations

- Performance improvement claims rely on potentially weak baselines with incomplete configuration details
- Automatic instruction generation effectiveness across diverse product categories remains uncertain without cross-domain generalization evidence
- Human evaluation methodology lacks details on annotator expertise and inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Retrieval evaluation based on limited sampling (100 products) may not represent full catalog diversity

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Larger model size improving instruction following accuracy - well-supported by direct experimental evidence in Table 3 showing clear performance differences across model sizes.

**Medium Confidence**: Instruction fine-tuning enabling diverse, controllable summaries - supported by abstract but lacks detailed ablation studies isolating instruction-augmented training contribution versus standard fine-tuning.

**Low Confidence**: Summaries retain sufficient unique characteristics for effective retrieval - based on limited sampling (100 products) and may not generalize across all product categories and catalog sizes.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing instruction fine-tuning against standard fine-tuning on identical model architectures to isolate the contribution of the instruction-augmented approach to performance gains.

2. Expand retrieval evaluation to include a larger, more diverse sample of products across different categories and measure the correlation between summary specificity levels and retrieval effectiveness.

3. Implement cross-domain validation by testing the model on product titles from different e-commerce domains (electronics, fashion, home goods) to assess generalization capabilities beyond the training data distribution.
