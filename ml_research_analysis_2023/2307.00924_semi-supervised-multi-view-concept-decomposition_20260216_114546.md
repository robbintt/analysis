# Semi-supervised multi-view concept decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00924
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00924
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SMVCF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets with limited labeled data

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SMVCF, a semi-supervised multi-view concept factorization model that integrates multi-view concept factorization, label propagation, and manifold learning into a unified framework. The method addresses clustering challenges in multi-view data with limited labeled information by learning low-rank latent representations while preserving local geometric structure and propagating labels through similarity relationships. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods across four real-world datasets with varying label ratios.

## Method Summary
SMVCF integrates three components into a unified optimization framework: multi-view concept factorization with adaptive weights for each view, label propagation to leverage limited labeled data, and manifold learning to capture local geometric structure. The model jointly optimizes basis matrices, coefficient matrices, and view weights through iterative updates. The adaptive weight vector balances the importance of different views, while the unified objective function combines reconstruction error, label consistency, and manifold preservation terms with tunable hyperparameters.

## Key Results
- On NGs dataset with 10% labeled data: 95.84% accuracy, 87.50% NMI, 95.84% purity
- Outperforms second-best method by 25.4% accuracy, 30.41% NMI, and 25.4% purity
- Consistent performance improvements across all four tested datasets and label ratios
- Robust performance even with minimal labeled data (10% label ratio)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating multi-view CF, label propagation, and manifold learning into a unified framework improves clustering performance by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data while preserving local data geometry.
- Mechanism: The model jointly optimizes three components: concept factorization to learn low-rank latent representations, label propagation to propagate known labels to unlabeled samples using graph structure, and manifold learning to preserve local neighborhood relationships in the embedding space.
- Core assumption: The three components are complementary and their joint optimization leads to better representation learning than optimizing them separately.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "integrate multi-view CF, label propagation, and manifold learning into a unified framework"
- Break condition: If the components conflict in optimization objectives, leading to poor convergence or representation quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The adaptive weight vector balances the importance of different views, mitigating the adverse effects of information imbalance across views.
- Mechanism: An adaptive weight vector αv is introduced and optimized alongside the factorization matrices, allowing the model to automatically assign higher weights to more informative views while suppressing noisy or less relevant views.
- Core assumption: Different views have varying levels of informativeness and noise, and automatic weighting improves overall clustering performance.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an adaptive weight vector is introduced to balance the importance of different views"
- Break condition: If view weighting becomes unstable or if all views are assigned equal importance despite significant differences in quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Label propagation effectively utilizes limited labeled information by propagating labels from known samples to unlabeled ones through similarity propagation in the data space.
- Mechanism: The model constructs an undirected graph with a weight matrix S based on nearest neighbor relationships and solves a label propagation problem to predict labels for unlabeled samples based on their proximity to labeled samples.
- Core assumption: Samples that are close in the data space should have the same label, and this proximity can be effectively captured through nearest neighbor relationships.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "label propagation methods can propagate labels to unlabeled data"
- Break condition: If the similarity measure fails to capture true label relationships or if the labeled data is too sparse for effective propagation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Concept Factorization (CF)
  - Why needed here: CF overcomes the non-negativity constraint of NMF and can handle both positive and negative values, making it more flexible for real-world data representation.
  - Quick check question: How does CF differ from NMF in terms of constraints and data representation capabilities?

- Concept: Manifold Learning
  - Why needed here: Manifold learning preserves the local geometric structure of the data, which is important for maintaining cluster boundaries and relationships in the learned representation space.
  - Quick check question: Why is preserving local geometric structure important for clustering performance?

- Concept: Label Propagation
  - Why needed here: Label propagation allows the model to leverage limited labeled information by propagating labels to unlabeled samples, improving clustering performance without requiring extensive manual labeling.
  - Quick check question: How does label propagation work in the context of semi-supervised learning, and what are its key assumptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multi-view concept factorization -> Label propagation -> Manifold learning -> Unified optimization
- Critical path: Iteratively update basis matrices W(v), coefficient matrices V(v), and view weights αv until convergence. Order: fix V(v) and αv to update W(v), then fix W(v) and αv to update V(v), finally fix W(v) and V(v) to update αv.
- Design tradeoffs: Balance between reconstruction error, label consistency, manifold preservation, and view weighting. Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimal performance.
- Failure signatures: Poor convergence, unstable view weights, or degraded clustering performance on validation data may indicate issues with parameter settings or component integration.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify convergence behavior on a small dataset with varying λ, β, and γ parameters.
  2. Test the impact of label ratio on clustering performance by gradually increasing the percentage of labeled data.
  3. Compare clustering results with and without the manifold learning component to assess its contribution to performance.
