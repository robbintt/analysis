# SituatedGen: Incorporating Geographical and Temporal Contexts into Generative Commonsense Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2306.12552
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12552
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces SITUATED GEN, a benchmark testing generative commonsense reasoning under geographical and temporal contexts, where current state-of-the-art models significantly lag behind human performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SITUATED GEN, a novel benchmark for evaluating generative commonsense reasoning under geographical and temporal contexts. The task requires machines to generate contrastive sentence pairs (antithesis) given a set of keywords containing geographical or temporal entities. A large-scale English dataset of 8,268 contrastive sentence pairs is constructed by automatically deriving statements from existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks and mining contrastive pairs based on entity-masked sentence similarity. Experiments show that state-of-the-art generative language models, including BART, T5, and InstructGPT, struggle to generate commonsensical sentences and significantly lag behind human performance. The proposed benchmark fills a gap in evaluating commonsense reasoning in constrained text generation and provides a challenging testbed for future research.

## Method Summary
The SITUATED GEN benchmark is constructed through an automatic pipeline that converts QA pairs from existing commonsense benchmarks into statements, identifies geographical/temporal entities, and mines contrastive sentence pairs based on entity-masked sentence similarity. The task requires generating antithesis pairs from shuffled keywords, implicitly requiring keyword grouping based on geographical/temporal relevance. Models are evaluated using standard NLG metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE) combined with BERTScore and a custom MATCH metric for keyword grouping accuracy. Experiments compare BART, T5, FLAN-T5 (fully supervised) and InstructGPT (few-shot) on the constructed dataset.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art models (BART, T5, FLAN-T5, InstructGPT) significantly underperform human baselines on the SITUATED GEN task
- Models struggle particularly with generating sentences that adhere to commonsense plausibility under geographical and temporal constraints
- The benchmark reveals clear gaps in models' ability to perform situated semantic matching and relational reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The automatic dataset construction pipeline creates a high-quality benchmark for situated generative commonsense reasoning by leveraging existing commonsense benchmarks and contrastive sentence mining.
- **Mechanism**: The pipeline first converts QA pairs from existing benchmarks into statements, identifies geographical/temporal entities, and then mines contrastive sentence pairs based on masked sentence similarity. This approach efficiently generates large-scale data with minimal manual effort while ensuring the pairs have parallel structures needed for antithesis.
- **Core assumption**: Masked sentence similarity is a reliable indicator of parallel syntactic structures needed for antithesis generation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "A large-scale English dataset of 8,268 contrastive sentence pairs is constructed by automatically deriving statements from existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks and mining contrastive pairs based on entity-masked sentence similarity."
  - [section]: "We design an automatic pipeline to collect data at scale with quality assurance and minimal human annotation efforts. Concretely, we derive commonsense statements with geographical or temporal contexts from existing commonsense benchmarks and mine contrastive sentence pairs based on entity-masked sentence similarity."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus only shows related papers but doesn't validate the specific masked sentence similarity approach used here.
- **Break condition**: If masked sentence similarity fails to capture true parallel structures, the generated pairs won't form valid antitheses and the dataset quality will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The task design forces models to perform relational reasoning by requiring keyword grouping based on geographical/temporal relevance.
- **Mechanism**: By requiring models to generate contrastive sentence pairs from shuffled keywords containing geographical/temporal entities, the task implicitly requires models to group keywords into two semantically coherent subsets before generation.
- **Core assumption**: The difficulty of the task stems from the need to correctly group keywords rather than just generate grammatically correct sentences.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed benchmark fills a gap in evaluating commonsense reasoning in constrained text generation and provides a challenging testbed for future research."
  - [section]: "The main challenge for machines to solve the SITUATED GEN task lies in situated semantic matching. In order to generate a pair of contrastive sentences, machines need to split the keywords into two groups (either explicitly or implicitly) based on geographical/temporal relevance and perform relational reasoning [32] within/between the keyword groups."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - related papers on commonsense reasoning support the general premise but don't specifically validate this keyword grouping mechanism.
- **Break condition**: If models can solve the task without meaningful keyword grouping (e.g., through memorization or pattern matching), the task fails to measure true relational reasoning ability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The evaluation metrics appropriately measure both fluency and commonsense plausibility of generated outputs.
- **Mechanism**: The evaluation combines standard NLG metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE) with content-oriented metrics (BERTScore) and a custom keyword grouping accuracy metric (MATCH) that directly measures commonsense plausibility.
- **Core assumption**: The MATCH metric effectively captures whether models have correctly grouped keywords according to commonsense knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Experiments show that state-of-the-art generative language models struggle to generate sentences with commonsense plausibility and still lag far behind human performance."
  - [section]: "We employ several widely-used automatic NLG metrics based on n-gram overlap — BLEU [37], ROUGE [26], METEOR [3] — and image caption metrics that focus on the consistency of keywords and their relationships — CIDEr [48] and SPICE [2]. In order to assess the validity of the generated outputs, we include BERTScore [56], a content-oriented and semantic metric."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus shows related work on commonsense reasoning but doesn't specifically validate this particular combination of metrics.
- **Break condition**: If the metrics fail to correlate with human judgment of commonsense plausibility, the evaluation won't accurately reflect model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Entity recognition and classification (identifying geographical and temporal entities)
  - Why needed here: The task specifically requires understanding of geographical and temporal contexts, which depends on correctly identifying and classifying these entities from text.
  - Quick check question: Given the sentence "July is summer in the United States", can you identify which words are geographical entities and which are temporal entities?

- **Concept**: Antithesis and contrastive sentence structure
  - Why needed here: The task requires generating pairs of sentences with similar syntactic structures but opposite semantic content, which is the definition of antithesis.
  - Quick check question: What makes "July is summer in the United States. July is winter in Australia." a valid antithesis pair?

- **Concept**: Commonsense reasoning about geographical and temporal relationships
  - Why needed here: The task tests whether models understand commonsense facts like "July is summer in the northern hemisphere but winter in the southern hemisphere."
  - Quick check question: Why is "July is summer in Australia. July is winter in the United States." not a valid answer to the given keywords?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 
  - Data collection pipeline (QA-to-statement conversion, entity identification, contrastive mining) -> Model training system (BART, T5, FLAN-T5, InstructGPT implementations) -> Evaluation framework (multiple NLG metrics + custom MATCH metric) -> Test infrastructure (manual filtering for quality control)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Construct dataset through automatic pipeline
  2. Train/fine-tune baseline models on constructed dataset
  3. Evaluate model outputs using comprehensive metric suite
  4. Analyze performance gaps between models and human performance

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Automatic vs manual dataset construction: Automatic construction enables large-scale data but may introduce noise
  - Multiple metrics vs single metric: Multiple metrics provide comprehensive evaluation but increase complexity
  - Keyword grouping vs direct generation: Implicit keyword grouping makes the task harder but more realistic

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low MATCH scores indicate models aren't correctly grouping keywords
  - Poor performance on GEO vs TEMP contexts suggests contextual understanding gaps
  - High BLEU/ROUGE but low CIDEr/SPICE indicates surface-level matching without semantic understanding

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare model performance on GEO vs TEMP contexts to identify which is more challenging
  2. Ablate the keyword grouping requirement to see if direct generation performs better
  3. Test few-shot learning capabilities by varying the number of in-context examples for InstructGPT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively address the geographical biases that may be inherited from the source datasets in the SITUATED GEN dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the dataset may inherit geographical biases from the source datasets, resulting in an uneven distribution of commonsense knowledge about western and non-western regions.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential bias issue but does not provide a concrete solution for mitigating it. It only suggests that interested parties should carefully address those biases before deploying the model to real-world settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the geographical distribution of the commonsense statements in the dataset, followed by a concrete strategy to balance the representation of different regions or a comparison of model performance on different geographical contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we improve the automatic pipeline for constructing the SITUATED GEN dataset to reduce noise and increase the quality of the data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that there is noise in the train and dev set, and that the quality of the automatically collected data is measured by annotating a random sample of examples.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides an automatic pipeline for dataset construction, it does not discuss ways to further refine the pipeline to minimize noise and improve data quality. The current quality assessment is based on a small sample, which may not be representative of the entire dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of the noise levels in different stages of the pipeline, followed by proposed improvements to the data collection and filtering processes. This could include comparing the performance of models trained on different versions of the dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop more effective evaluation metrics for the SITUATED GEN task that better capture the nuances of commonsense reasoning under geographical and temporal contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses several automatic NLG metrics and introduces a custom metric (MATCH) to evaluate the performance of models on the SITUATED GEN task. However, it does not discuss the limitations of these metrics or propose alternative evaluation methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that current models struggle to generate sentences adhering to commonsense under the SITUATED GEN setting, but it does not explore whether the evaluation metrics are sufficient to capture the complexity of the task. There may be aspects of commonsense reasoning that are not adequately measured by the current metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current evaluation metrics, followed by the development of new metrics or the adaptation of existing ones to better assess the situated semantic matching and commonsense plausibility aspects of the task. This could include incorporating human evaluation or designing metrics that specifically target the geographical and temporal reasoning components.

## Limitations
- The automatic pipeline may introduce noise into the dataset, potentially affecting model evaluation
- The MATCH metric for keyword grouping accuracy lacks comprehensive validation against human judgments
- The benchmark focuses on geographical and temporal contexts, limiting generalizability to other types of situated commonsense reasoning

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The dataset construction methodology and basic experimental setup are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The evaluation framework combining multiple metrics is sound, but the specific weighting and interpretation of these metrics could benefit from additional validation
- **Medium Confidence**: The observed performance gaps between models and humans are likely real, though the exact magnitude may vary with different evaluation protocols

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive human evaluation to validate the MATCH metric and other automatic metrics against human judgments of commonsense plausibility and keyword grouping quality
2. Test model performance on out-of-distribution geographical and temporal contexts to assess true understanding versus memorization
3. Systematically vary the masked sentence similarity threshold and other parameters in the dataset construction pipeline to understand their impact on benchmark quality and model performance
