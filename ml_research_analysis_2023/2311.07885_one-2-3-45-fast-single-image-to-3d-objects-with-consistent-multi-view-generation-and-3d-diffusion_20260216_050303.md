## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07885
- Reference count: 40

## Executive Summary
One-2-3-45++ introduces a fast method for generating high-fidelity 3D objects from single images by leveraging 2D diffusion models and 3D diffusion priors. The approach fine-tunes a 2D diffusion model to produce consistent multi-view images, then uses multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion models to reconstruct the 3D mesh. This design achieves state-of-the-art performance with under one minute runtime while maintaining strong geometric and texture quality.

## Method Summary
One-2-3-45++ employs a two-stage approach to convert single images to 3D objects. First, it fine-tunes a 2D diffusion model to generate consistent multi-view images by tiling six views into a composite image conditioned on the input. Second, it uses multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion models to lift these consistent views to 3D volumes. The method employs a coarse-to-fine approach, generating low-resolution occupancy volumes followed by high-resolution SDF and color volumes, with texture refinement using multi-view images as supervision.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.6 F-Score and 81.0 CLIP similarity on GSO dataset
- Outperforms existing methods like DreamFusion and Shap-E
- Generates results in under one minute per object
- Demonstrates superior visual quality in user studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Tiling 6 multi-view images into a single composite image during fine-tuning enables inter-view communication and ensures consistency.
- Mechanism: By fine-tuning the 2D diffusion model to generate a tiled composite image conditioned on a single input, the model can attend to each view during generation, producing more consistent multi-view predictions compared to generating each view independently.
- Core assumption: The 2D diffusion model can effectively learn to generate consistent multi-view images when trained on tiled composite images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This is achieved by initially finetuning a 2D diffusion model for consistent multi-view image generation, followed by elevating these images to 3D with the aid of multi-view conditioned 3D native diffusion models."
  - [section] "To generate multiple views in a single diffusion process, we adopt a simple strategy by tiling a sparse set of 6 views into a single image with a3 × 2 layout as shown in Fig. 3. Subsequently, we finetune a pre-trained 2D diffusion net to generate the composite image, conditioned on a single input image. This strategy enables multiple views to interact with each other during the diffusion."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion models to lift the consistent multi-view images to 3D enables high-quality 3D reconstruction with strong generalization.
- Mechanism: The multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model learns to generate plausible 3D shapes conditioned on the consistent multi-view images by training on extensive 3D data. The multi-view images act as a blueprint for 3D reconstruction, while the 3D diffusion network excels at lifting the multi-view images using priors from the 3D dataset.
- Core assumption: The multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model can effectively learn to reconstruct 3D shapes from consistent multi-view images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach aims to fully harness the extensive knowledge embedded in 2D diffusion models and priors from valuable yet limited 3D data. This is achieved by initially finetuning a 2D diffusion model for consistent multi-view image generation, followed by elevating these images to 3D with the aid of multi-view conditioned 3D native diffusion models."
  - [section] "Instead, we propose an innovative way to lift the generated multi-view images to 3D by utilizing a multi-view conditioned 3D generative model. It seeks to learn a manifold of plausible 3D shapes conditioned on multi-view images by training expressive 3D native diffusion networks on extensive 3D data."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-stage coarse-to-fine 3D diffusion approach enables efficient generation of high-resolution 3D volumes.
- Mechanism: The first stage generates a low-resolution full 3D occupancy volume to approximate the shell of the 3D shape, while the second stage generates a high-resolution sparse volume to predict fine-grained SDF values and colors within the occupied area. This approach reduces memory and computational costs compared to generating high-resolution volumes directly.
- Core assumption: The two-stage coarse-to-fine approach can effectively generate high-quality 3D volumes while reducing computational costs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Capturing fine-grained details of 3D shapes necessitates the use of high-resolution 3D grids, which unfortunately entail substantial memory and computational costs. As a result, we follow LAS-Diffusion [87] to generate high-resolution volumes in a coarse-to-fine two-stage manner."
  - [section] "For the first stage, normal 3D convolution is used within the UNet to produce the full 3D occupancy volume F, while for the second stage, we incorporate 3D sparse convolution in the UNet to yield the 3D sparse volume S."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: 2D diffusion model → Multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model → Texture refinement module
- Critical path: 1. Fine-tune 2D diffusion model on tiled composite images to generate consistent multi-view images 2. Use multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model to lift consistent multi-view images to 3D 3. Apply texture refinement module to enhance texture quality
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach for 3D diffusion reduces computational costs but may introduce artifacts or miss fine-grained details
  - Relying on multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion models enables strong generalization but requires extensive 3D training data
  - Employing a lightweight texture refinement module improves texture quality without significantly increasing runtime
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent or misaligned multi-view images (due to failure in the first stage)
  - Poor 3D reconstruction quality (due to failure in the second stage)
  - Texture artifacts or low-quality textures (due to failure in the texture refinement module)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a 2D diffusion model on a small dataset of tiled composite images and evaluate the consistency of the generated multi-view images
  2. Train a multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model on a subset of 3D data and evaluate its ability to reconstruct 3D shapes from consistent multi-view images
  3. Combine the fine-tuned 2D diffusion model and the trained 3D diffusion model to generate 3D meshes from single images and assess the overall quality and runtime

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of One-2-3-45++ scale when using more than six multi-view images, and what is the optimal number of views for balancing quality and computational cost?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes using six-view images tiled into a single image, but does not explore the impact of varying the number of views.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of six-view tiling without exploring the trade-offs of using different numbers of views.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing F-Score, CLIP similarity, and runtime across different numbers of multi-view images would clarify the optimal configuration.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model be extended to handle text-to-3D generation with comparable quality to image-to-3D, and what architectural modifications would be needed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows text-to-3D results but notes that the method currently excels at image-to-3D generation with superior fine-grained control.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates text-to-3D capabilities but does not explore the full potential or limitations of this extension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison studies between text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation using the same model architecture, with quantitative and qualitative assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does One-2-3-45++ perform on real-world images with complex backgrounds or occlusions, and what pre-processing steps would improve robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates on the GSO dataset with clean frontal view images, but does not test on images with complex backgrounds or occlusions.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on controlled dataset images without exploring real-world challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using real-world images with varying background complexity and occlusion levels, along with proposed pre-processing techniques and their impact on results.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on the Objaverse dataset may limit generalization to out-of-distribution inputs
- Substantial computational resources required for training (16 GPUs for 2D fine-tuning, 8 A100s for 3D training)
- Insufficient investigation of failure cases with complex geometries or reflective surfaces

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core technical approach: The two-stage pipeline is well-motivated and technically sound
- Medium confidence in the claimed performance: Benchmark metrics are impressive but evaluation protocol could benefit from more rigorous scrutiny
- Low confidence in generalization claims: Model performance on diverse real-world images beyond controlled datasets is unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on multi-view generation**: Systematically test the impact of varying the number of views (3 vs 6 vs 12) and their arrangement in the composite image to quantify the trade-off between consistency quality and computational cost.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization evaluation**: Test the model on a held-out set of real-world images from diverse sources (e.g., CO3D, Google Scanned Objects) to assess performance degradation and identify failure modes.

3. **Runtime profiling on commodity hardware**: Measure actual inference time across different GPU tiers (RTX 3090, A100, and consumer GPUs) to validate the "under one minute" claim and identify optimization opportunities for broader accessibility.
