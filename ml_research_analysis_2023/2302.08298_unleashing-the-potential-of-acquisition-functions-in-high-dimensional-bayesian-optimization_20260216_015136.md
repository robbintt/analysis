# Unleashing the Potential of Acquisition Functions in High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.08298
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08298
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: AIBO achieves better results with fewer function evaluations compared to standard BO and state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in high-dimensional Bayesian optimization: the poor performance of randomly initialized acquisition function maximizers. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, the authors demonstrate that random initialization leads to over-exploration in high-dimensional spaces, causing the optimization process to focus on regions with high posterior variance rather than promising areas. They propose AIBO, a novel framework that uses multiple heuristic optimizers to generate initial points for the acquisition function maximizer, leveraging knowledge from previously evaluated samples. Experimental results on both synthetic functions and real-world robotics tasks show that AIBO significantly outperforms existing high-dimensional BO methods while requiring fewer function evaluations.

## Method Summary
AIBO is a framework that improves high-dimensional Bayesian optimization by using multiple heuristic optimizers (CMA-ES, GA, random search, and greedy selection) to generate initial points for the acquisition function maximizer. The approach leverages the knowledge of already evaluated samples to create candidates that are more likely to be near promising regions, rather than relying on random initialization that tends to explore areas with high posterior uncertainty. The framework selects a subset of heuristics, generates candidates from each, and uses the top candidates to initialize the acquisition function maximizer, creating a more effective optimization process.

## Key Results
- AIBO significantly outperforms standard BO and state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods on both synthetic and real-world tasks
- The approach achieves better optimization results with fewer function evaluations compared to baseline methods
- Ensemble initialization using multiple heuristics provides more robust performance than any single initialization strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Random initialization leads to over-exploration in high-dimensional BO by focusing the acquisition function maximizer on regions with high posterior variance rather than promising regions.
- Mechanism: In high dimensions, the search space grows exponentially, causing most regions to have high posterior uncertainty. Random initialization samples from this global space, directing the AF maximizer toward these uncertain but unproductive regions, resulting in poor candidate quality.
- Core assumption: The posterior variance is uniformly high across most of the high-dimensional space, and random sampling cannot effectively identify sparse promising regions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Given the large regions of high posterior uncertainty in high dimensions, a randomly initialized acquisition function maximizer is likely to focus on areas with high posterior uncertainty, leading to overly exploring areas that offer little gain."
  - [section]: "Randomly generated global-scale starting points often locate regions of high posterior uncertainty rather than the sparse promising regions. As a result, random initialization can direct the AF maximizer to search in regions of high posterior uncertainty, leading to over-exploration."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the problem dimensionality is low enough that posterior variance is concentrated in a few regions, or if the function landscape has strong structure that random sampling can exploit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using heuristic optimizers (CMA-ES, GA) for initialization provides better candidate points near promising regions than random initialization.
- Mechanism: Heuristic optimizers maintain internal state (like CMA-ES's multivariate normal distribution or GA's population) that evolves with each BO iteration. This state incorporates knowledge from evaluated samples, allowing them to generate candidates in regions more likely to contain optima.
- Core assumption: Heuristic optimizers can effectively use historical data to guide their search toward promising regions, and this guidance transfers well to initializing the AF maximizer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a better initialization approach by employing multiple heuristic optimizers like CMA-ES and GA to generate initial points for the AF maximizer, leveraging the knowledge of already evaluated samples."
  - [section]: "Our key insight is that the existing evaluated samples can help to generate candidates that are more likely near promising regions. To this end, we develop AIBO... to utilize the knowledge of the existing evaluated samples."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the heuristic optimizers' internal state becomes stale or misaligned with the true function landscape, or if the function has deceptive optima that mislead the heuristics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ensemble initialization using multiple heuristics provides more robust performance than any single initialization strategy.
- Mechanism: Different heuristics have different biases and exploration strategies. By combining them, AIBO can maintain diversity in the search and avoid being trapped in local optima that a single heuristic might find.
- Core assumption: The combination of different heuristics provides complementary search capabilities that improve overall robustness and performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our current implementation uses four heuristics to initialize an AF maximizer: CMA-ES, GA, random search and greedy selection. However, any other heuristics can also be added into the initializer set O."
  - [section]: "By incorporating multiple heuristics, the ensemble strategy used by AIBO gives a more robust performance than the individual components."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If one heuristic dominates the others consistently, making the ensemble redundant, or if the computational overhead of maintaining multiple heuristics outweighs the benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Process (GP) regression
  - Why needed here: BO relies on GP as the surrogate model to predict function values and quantify uncertainty, which is essential for constructing the acquisition function.
  - Quick check question: What are the two key outputs of a GP prediction at a new point x, and how are they used in BO?

- Concept: Acquisition functions (UCB, EI)
  - Why needed here: The acquisition function guides the search by balancing exploration (high uncertainty) and exploitation (high predicted value), and its optimization is the focus of this work.
  - Quick check question: How does the UCB acquisition function trade off exploration and exploitation, and what parameter controls this balance?

- Concept: High-dimensional optimization challenges
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses why BO struggles in high dimensions, particularly the curse of dimensionality affecting both the surrogate model and acquisition function optimization.
  - Quick check question: Why does random initialization become increasingly ineffective as dimensionality increases in BO?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GP surrogate model -> Acquisition function (UCB/EI) -> Heuristic optimizers pool (CMA-ES, GA, Random, Greedy) -> AF maximizer (gradient-based or CMA-ES) -> Black-box function evaluator

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize GP with N random samples
  2. Fit GP and construct acquisition function
  3. Select q heuristics from pool
  4. Each selected heuristic generates k candidates
  5. Select top-n candidates per heuristic based on acquisition value
  6. Initialize AF maximizer with these candidates
  7. Find best candidate via AF maximization
  8. Evaluate black-box function at this point
  9. Update heuristics with new sample
  10. Repeat until budget exhausted

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multiple heuristics vs. single heuristic: More robust but higher computational cost
  - Number of candidates per heuristic (k) vs. selected candidates (n): Balance between exploration and computational efficiency
  - Batch size vs. sequential optimization: Parallel evaluation vs. better-informed sequential decisions

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence despite many evaluations: Initialization strategy may not be effective
  - Oscillating between regions: Heuristics may be generating candidates in conflicting regions
  - Slow initial progress: GP may need more warm-up samples or better kernel parameters

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement GP surrogate with Matérn-5/2 kernel and test on a simple 1D function to verify basic BO functionality
  2. Add UCB acquisition function and test on a 2D synthetic function (e.g., Ackley) to verify the full BO loop
  3. Implement CMA-ES heuristic and test its ability to generate good candidates for initializing the AF maximizer on a 10D function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of AIBO compare to other state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods on real-world robotics tasks with dimensions higher than 300?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates AIBO on robotics tasks with dimensions ranging from 14 to 300, but does not explore higher-dimensional tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results for dimensions higher than 300, leaving the performance of AIBO on more complex tasks unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running AIBO on real-world robotics tasks with dimensions higher than 300 and comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods would provide the necessary evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different heuristic optimizers in the AIBO framework on its performance across various high-dimensional optimization problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that AIBO uses multiple heuristic optimizers like CMA-ES and GA, but does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of each optimizer on the performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of the performance of AIBO when using different combinations of heuristic optimizers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with AIBO using different combinations of heuristic optimizers and comparing their performance on various high-dimensional optimization problems would provide the necessary evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of AIBO scale with the number of evaluated samples in extremely high-dimensional spaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates AIBO on problems with dimensions up to 300, but does not explore its performance in extremely high-dimensional spaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results for problems with dimensions significantly higher than 300, leaving the scalability of AIBO in extremely high-dimensional spaces unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running AIBO on problems with dimensions significantly higher than 300 and analyzing its performance as the number of evaluated samples increases would provide the necessary evidence.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple heuristic optimizers is not fully characterized
- Scalability to dimensions beyond 300 remains untested
- Only UCB acquisition function is thoroughly evaluated despite claims of general applicability

## Confidence

**Confidence is Medium** for the core claims about over-exploration from random initialization, as the mechanism is theoretically sound but lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse problem landscapes. **Confidence is Medium-High** for the AIBO framework's effectiveness, supported by experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks, though the results could benefit from more ablation studies isolating the impact of each heuristic.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual and combined contributions of each heuristic optimizer in AIBO
2. Measure wall-clock time and computational overhead compared to baseline methods
3. Test AIBO on problems with deceptive optima to evaluate robustness against local optima trapping
