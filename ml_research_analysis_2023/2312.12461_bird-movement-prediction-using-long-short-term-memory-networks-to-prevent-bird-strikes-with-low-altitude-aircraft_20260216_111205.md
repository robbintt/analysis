# Bird Movement Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks to Prevent Bird Strikes with Low Altitude Aircraft

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12461
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LSTM models achieve MAE < 100 meters for bird movement prediction, outperforming traditional regression methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical safety challenge of bird strikes with low-altitude aircraft, particularly for emerging Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. The study implements and evaluates four LSTM model variants - vanilla, stacked, bidirectional, and encoder-decoder - for predicting bird movement using real-world pigeon movement data. The LSTM models significantly outperform traditional linear and nonlinear regression approaches, achieving prediction errors under 100 meters. By incorporating these predictions into flight planning, the research demonstrates that aircraft departure delays based on predicted bird movements can effectively prevent bird strikes during takeoff, enhancing aviation safety.

## Method Summary
The study uses publicly available pigeon movement data from MoveBank (14,400 data points over 4 hours) to train and test four LSTM model variants. The data is preprocessed with linear interpolation and split into 65% training, 15% validation, and 20% test sets. Models are trained with 300-step input horizons to predict 30-step output horizons, using recursive prediction for many-to-one architectures. Performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across five separate test datasets to ensure robustness. The models are then integrated into a collision detection system that recommends aircraft departure delays based on predicted bird positions.

## Key Results
- LSTM models achieve MAE < 100 meters for both latitude and longitude predictions
- Bidirectional LSTM shows approximately 5-10% better performance than vanilla LSTM
- Recursive prediction methodology extends prediction horizons from 30 to 300 seconds
- Collision prevention through departure delays successfully avoids predicted bird strike scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LSTM models can capture long-term dependencies in bird movement data that simpler models like linear regression cannot. LSTM cells use forget, input, and output gates to selectively remember or discard information over time, allowing them to model complex temporal patterns in sequential bird movement data.

### Mechanism 2
Recursive prediction using many-to-one LSTM models can generate multi-step forecasts by feeding predictions back as inputs. The model predicts one time step ahead, then uses that prediction as input for the next step, creating a chain of predictions for the desired horizon.

### Mechanism 3
Bidirectional LSTM models can achieve better performance by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions. By training on both past and future context (during training), the model can better capture patterns that depend on information from both directions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Recurrent Neural Networks and vanishing gradient problem**: Understanding why vanilla RNNs struggle with long sequences explains why LSTMs were necessary for this problem. Quick check: What specific problem with vanilla RNNs does the LSTM architecture solve?

- **Sequence-to-sequence vs many-to-one prediction architectures**: Different LSTM architectures (vanilla vs encoder-decoder) solve different prediction problems, and choosing the right one matters for performance. Quick check: When would you choose an encoder-decoder architecture over a many-to-one architecture for time series prediction?

- **Time series cross-validation and representative training data**: The paper emphasizes that training data must cover the range of test data for accurate predictions, which is crucial for real-world deployment. Quick check: Why is it problematic if your test data contains values outside the range of your training data in time series prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing pipeline (linear interpolation) -> Four LSTM model variants (vanilla, stacked, bidirectional, encoder-decoder) -> Recursive prediction module -> Performance evaluation with MAE metric -> Collision detection module

- **Critical path**: Data → Preprocessing → Model training/validation → Recursive prediction → MAE evaluation → Collision detection

- **Design tradeoffs**: Many-to-one + recursive vs many-to-many: Recursive approach is more flexible but error-prone; encoder-decoder is more complex but potentially more accurate. Model depth: Stacked LSTM adds complexity but doesn't guarantee better performance. Bidirectional processing: Can improve accuracy but requires future context unavailable in real-time prediction

- **Failure signatures**: Oscillations in predictions indicate error accumulation in recursive predictions; poor performance on test data outside training range suggests need for broader training data; linear regression baselines performing poorly confirms non-linear nature of bird movement

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train vanilla LSTM on full dataset and measure MAE on held-out test set; 2) Implement recursive prediction for 30-step horizon and compare to single-step performance; 3) Train bidirectional LSTM and compare performance to vanilla LSTM on same test sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the LSTM models perform when predicting bird movements over longer time horizons (e.g., 1 hour or more) beyond the 30-second prediction horizon used in this study? The study only tested models for a 30-second prediction horizon, but performance for longer horizons is not evaluated.

### Open Question 2
How do the LSTM models perform when trained and tested on bird movement data from different species, especially those with distinct movement patterns compared to pigeons? The study uses pigeon data but findings may not generalize to all bird species involved in bird strikes.

### Open Question 3
How do the LSTM models perform when incorporating additional environmental and contextual factors (e.g., weather conditions, time of day, season) into the bird movement prediction process? The study uses only bird movement data without explicitly incorporating these additional factors that can significantly impact bird behavior.

## Limitations
- Reliance on pigeon movement data may not fully represent behavior of other high-risk bird species
- Performance metrics focus on MAE, but other metrics like direction accuracy could provide additional insights
- Real-time applicability of bidirectional models is limited since they require future context during prediction

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LSTM models outperforming linear/nonlinear regression (well-established in literature)
- **Medium Confidence**: Recursive prediction methodology (reasonable but error-prone)
- **Medium Confidence**: Collision prevention through departure delays (valid concept but depends on prediction reliability)

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across multiple bird species with different movement patterns to assess generalizability
2. Implement ensemble methods combining multiple LSTM variants to evaluate if accuracy improves
3. Conduct real-world trials comparing flight paths with and without bird movement predictions
