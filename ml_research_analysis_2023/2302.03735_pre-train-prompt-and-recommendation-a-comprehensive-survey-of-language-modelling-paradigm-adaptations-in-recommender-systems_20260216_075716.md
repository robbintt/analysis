## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.03735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03735
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of LMRS adaptations addressing data sparsity, efficiency, and effectiveness

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of how language modeling paradigms are adapted for recommender systems (LMRS). The paper systematically investigates the transfer of knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve recommendation performance across various perspectives such as generality, sparsity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It proposes a taxonomy categorizing existing PLM-based recommender systems based on their training strategies and objectives, analyzing the connection between LM-based training paradigms and different input data types for recommender systems.

## Method Summary
The survey proposes a taxonomy categorizing existing PLM-based recommender systems by training strategies and objectives, analyzing the connection between PLM-based training paradigms and different input data types (textual, sequential, graph, multi-modal). It examines various fine-tuning strategies including full model fine-tuning, partial tuning, and prompt tuning, comparing their tradeoffs between performance and efficiency. The survey identifies open issues and future research directions in this field, providing a foundation for understanding current approaches and potential improvements.

## Key Results
- Pre-training and prompting paradigms effectively address data sparsity issues in recommender systems
- Language modeling paradigms can be adapted to various input data types through appropriate encoding strategies
- Fine-tuning strategies present tradeoffs between training efficiency and recommendation accuracy
- Open issues remain regarding language bias, knowledge transmission, scalability, and privacy concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained language models transfer rich semantic knowledge to recommendation tasks through parameter initialization
- Mechanism: Large-scale pre-training on unsupervised corpora creates general representations that can be fine-tuned for specific recommendation tasks, avoiding training from scratch and mitigating data sparsity
- Core assumption: Knowledge learned from large text corpora is transferable to recommendation domains
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The pre-trained models and the learned representations can be beneficial to a series of downstream NLP tasks"
  - [section] "pre-training provides a better model initialization, which usually leads to better generalization on different downstream recommendation tasks"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average FMR 0.455, indicating substantial research interest in LM adaptations for recommendation
- Break condition: If the source corpus domain is too dissimilar from the target recommendation domain, transfer learning benefits may be minimal

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt learning bridges the gap between pre-training objectives and recommendation tasks
- Mechanism: Carefully designed prompts (hard templates or soft embeddings) reformulate recommendation tasks to align with pre-training objectives, enabling better utilization of pre-trained knowledge
- Core assumption: Task reformulation through prompts can effectively leverage pre-trained representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "prompt learning relies on a suite of appropriate prompts... to reformulate the downstream tasks as the pre-training task"
  - [section] "Prompt learning breaks through the problem of data constraints and bridges the gap of objective forms between pre-training and fine-tuning"
  - [corpus] Multiple survey papers specifically addressing prompt learning in various domains
- Break condition: If prompts are poorly designed or mismatched with the task, performance may degrade below traditional fine-tuning approaches

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-supervised objectives in pre-training capture generalizable patterns applicable to recommendation
- Mechanism: Objectives like masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and replaced token detection create self-supervised learning signals that extract meaningful patterns from unlabeled data
- Core assumption: Self-supervised learning objectives create transferable representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "learning universal representations on large corpora in a self-supervised manner"
  - [section] "Many typical LM-based RSs fall into this category, such as BERT4Rec which modelled sequential user behaviour with a bidirectional self-attention network through Cloze task"
  - [corpus] Research papers implementing various LM objectives (MLM, NSP, RTD) for recommendation tasks
- Break condition: If self-supervised objectives are too generic or not well-aligned with recommendation patterns, the learned representations may lack task-specific relevance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Language modeling objectives (MLM, NSP, AM, RTD)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these objectives is crucial for adapting them to recommendation tasks and designing appropriate pre-training strategies
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between auto-regressive modeling and masked language modeling in terms of context access?

- Concept: Fine-tuning vs prompt tuning tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: Engineers need to understand when to fine-tune entire models versus using prompt-based approaches based on efficiency and performance requirements
  - Quick check question: What are the main efficiency advantages of prompt tuning compared to full fine-tuning?

- Concept: Data type encoding for recommendations
  - Why needed here: Different input data types (textual, sequential, graph, multi-modal) require specific encoding strategies to work with language modeling paradigms
  - Quick check question: How would you encode a user-item interaction graph to make it compatible with transformer-based language models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline (encoding various input types) -> Pre-training module (LM objectives on source corpus) -> Fine-tuning/prompting module (task-specific adaptation) -> Recommendation inference layer (generating recommendations) -> Evaluation pipeline (measuring performance metrics)

- Critical path:
  1. Data encoding → 2. Pre-training → 3. Task adaptation (fine-tuning or prompting) → 4. Inference → 5. Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. efficiency: Larger pre-trained models offer better performance but require more resources
  - Fine-tuning scope: Full model fine-tuning vs. partial tuning vs. prompt tuning affects both performance and efficiency
  - Data type alignment: Different data types require different preprocessing and modeling approaches

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance: May indicate mismatch between pre-training objectives and recommendation tasks
  - Slow convergence: Could suggest inappropriate initialization or learning rate settings
  - Overfitting: Might occur when fine-tuning large models on small recommendation datasets

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement BERT4Rec baseline using MLM objective on sequential recommendation data
  2. Compare full fine-tuning vs. prompt tuning on a small recommendation dataset
  3. Test different data encoding strategies for graph-based recommendation tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively inject domain knowledge into pre-trained language models for recommender systems without causing catastrophic forgetting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions knowledge transmission and injection as an open issue, noting that improper training strategies may cause problems of varying degrees.
- Why unresolved: While some works propose improving model updating efficiency by fine-tuning partial pre-trained models or extra parts with fewer parameters, there is still a need for more research on how to transfer and inject learned domain knowledge for recommendation purposes effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating different knowledge injection methods (e.g., adapter-based approaches, prompt tuning, full fine-tuning) on recommendation tasks with various domains and their impact on performance and catastrophic forgetting.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between training efficiency and recommendation accuracy when using different fine-tuning strategies (e.g., fine-tuning the whole model, partial model, or external parts) for language modeling paradigms in recommender systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different fine-tuning strategies and their trade-offs between training overhead and recommendation performance, noting that more work should be done to compare the performance of different training strategies on recommendation tasks.
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of comprehensive studies comparing the effectiveness of various fine-tuning strategies across different recommendation tasks and data types, making it difficult to determine the optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance, training time, and resource usage of different fine-tuning strategies (e.g., full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, prompt tuning) on a wide range of recommendation tasks and data types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we ensure the privacy and ethical use of pre-trained language models in recommender systems while maintaining high performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights privacy issues and ethical concerns, noting that pre-training processes performed on large-scale corpora without fine-grained filtering may perceive users' sensitive information.
- Why unresolved: Developing language modeling paradigms for recommender systems that balance privacy protection and high performance is challenging, as it requires addressing the trade-off between using rich user data for better recommendations and protecting user privacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating effective privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy) for language modeling paradigms in recommender systems that maintain or improve recommendation performance while protecting user privacy.
