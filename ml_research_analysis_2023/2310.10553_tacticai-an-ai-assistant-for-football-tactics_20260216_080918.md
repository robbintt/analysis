# TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI system for analyzing corner kicks that achieved 90% preference over existing tactics in expert evaluation

## Executive Summary
TacticAI is an AI assistant designed to analyze and optimize football tactics, with a specific focus on corner kicks. The system employs geometric deep learning to represent corner kick situations as graphs, where nodes correspond to players and edges represent interactions between them. Through this approach, TacticAI can predict who will receive the ball, whether a shot will be attempted, and recommend player position adjustments. In a case study with Liverpool FC experts, TacticAI's tactical suggestions were preferred over existing tactics 90% of the time, demonstrating its practical value for coaching decisions.

## Method Summary
TacticAI uses a geometric deep learning pipeline to process spatio-temporal football data into graph representations. Each corner kick situation is encoded as a graph where players are nodes with features including position, velocity, height, and weight, while edges represent interactions between players. The system employs a graph neural network (GNN) as its central model, which computes latent player representations through neighborhood aggregation. The architecture includes separate predictive components for receiver and shot prediction, as well as a generative component for tactical adjustments. Geometric deep learning techniques, specifically D2 group convolutions, are used to encode pitch symmetries and improve data efficiency. The model is trained on a dataset of 9,693 corner kicks from the 2020-2021 Premier League seasons.

## Key Results
- Top-3 accuracy of 0.782 ± 0.039 for receiver prediction
- Test F1 score of 0.64 ± 0.02 for shot prediction
- TacticAI's tactical suggestions were favored over existing tactics 90% of the time in expert evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph representation of corner kick situations enables efficient modeling of player interactions.
- Mechanism: Each player is treated as a node, with edges representing potential interactions. Node features encode player positions, velocities, heights, and weights. Edge features indicate whether players are on the same team.
- Core assumption: The relationships between players (team dynamics, spatial positioning) are more important than absolute positions on the pitch for understanding corner kick tactics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It uses geometric deep learning to efficiently represent corner kick situations as graphs, where nodes correspond to players and edges represent interactions between them."
  - [section] "We represent each corner kick situation as a graph, where each node corresponds to a player. The features associated with each node encode the movements (velocities and positions) and simple profiles (heights and weights) of on-pitch players at the timestamp when the corresponding corner kick was being taken by the attacking kicker..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for graph representation effectiveness in this specific context.
- Break condition: If the relationships between players are not the primary drivers of corner kick outcomes, or if absolute positions on the pitch become crucial for tactical analysis.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Geometric deep learning improves data efficiency by encoding pitch symmetries.
- Mechanism: The model is designed to be invariant to horizontal and vertical reflections of the pitch. This is achieved through D2 group convolutions, which ensure the model's outputs remain consistent under these transformations.
- Core assumption: Corner kick situations are equivalent under horizontal or vertical reflections of the pitch. This means a corner kick from the left side of the pitch is strategically similar to one from the right side (horizontal reflection), and a corner kick from one end of the pitch is similar to one from the other end (vertical reflection).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning."
  - [section] "Uniquely, TacticAI takes advantage of geometric deep learning [5] to explicitly produce player representations that respect several symmetries of the football pitch... Geometric deep learning ensures that TacticAI's player representations will be identically computed under such reflections, such that this symmetry does not have to be learnt from data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for the effectiveness of geometric deep learning in this specific football context.
- Break condition: If the strategic equivalence under pitch reflections does not hold in practice, or if the computational overhead of group convolutions outweighs the benefits in data efficiency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Factorized design allows for flexible downstream use and targeted tactical adjustments.
- Mechanism: The model is trained to predict receivers and shot attempts, and to generate tactical adjustments. The predictive components (receiver and shot prediction) are trained separately, but their outputs are used to inform the generative component (tactical adjustments). This allows coaches to explore alternative player setups and select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success.
- Core assumption: The outcomes of a corner kick (who receives the ball, whether a shot is taken) are influenced by the initial player setup and can be predicted based on that setup.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success."
  - [section] "Equipped with components that are able to potently relate corner kicks with their various outcomes (e.g. receivers and shot events), we can explore the use of TacticAI to suggest adjustments of tactics, in order to amplify or reduce the likelihood of certain outcomes."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for the effectiveness of this factorized design in this specific football context.
- Break condition: If the predictive components are not accurate enough to inform the generative component, or if the tactical adjustments suggested by the generative component do not lead to improved outcomes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: To efficiently model the relationships between players in a corner kick situation.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using GNNs over traditional neural networks for modeling player interactions?

- Concept: Geometric Deep Learning
  - Why needed here: To improve data efficiency by encoding pitch symmetries, which is crucial given the limited availability of high-quality tracking data.
  - Quick check question: How does geometric deep learning differ from traditional deep learning, and why is it particularly useful in this context?

- Concept: Factorized Design
  - Why needed here: To allow for flexible downstream use and targeted tactical adjustments. The predictive and generative components can be used independently or in combination, depending on the needs of the coaches.
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits of separating the predictive and generative components in this system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input graph (players, positions, velocities, heights, weights, team assignments) -> Encoder -> Latent player representations -> Decoder -> Predictions (receivers, shot attempts) or Generated tactical adjustments

- Critical path:
  - Input graph (players, positions, velocities, heights, weights, team assignments) → Encoder → Latent player representations → Decoder → Predictions (receivers, shot attempts) or Generated tactical adjustments

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a graph representation vs. traditional neural networks: Graphs can more naturally model player interactions, but may be more complex to implement and train.
  - Using geometric deep learning vs. traditional deep learning: Geometric deep learning can improve data efficiency, but may require more complex architectures and training procedures.
  - Separating predictive and generative components vs. a single unified model: Separation allows for more flexibility, but may require more coordination between components.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the receiver and shot prediction accuracies are low, it may indicate issues with the encoder or decoder.
  - If the generated tactical adjustments are not realistic or effective, it may indicate issues with the generative component or the factorized design.
  - If the model overfits to the training data, it may indicate issues with the geometric deep learning or the amount of training data.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the receiver prediction component on a small subset of the data and evaluate its accuracy.
  2. Train the shot prediction component on the same subset and evaluate its accuracy.
  3. Use the trained predictive components to generate tactical adjustments for a few corner kick situations and evaluate their realism and effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is TacticAI at predicting shot attempts in situations where the receiver of the corner kick is not the player who ultimately takes the shot?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that TacticAI can predict shot attempts, but does not specifically address scenarios where the receiver is not the shooter.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any data or analysis on this specific scenario.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing TacticAI on a dataset of corner kicks where the receiver is not the shooter, and comparing its shot prediction accuracy to that of other models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can TacticAI's tactical recommendations be generalized to other set pieces, such as free kicks or throw-ins?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on corner kicks, but mentions that the methodology could potentially be applied to other set pieces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any data or analysis on the effectiveness of TacticAI for other set pieces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing TacticAI on datasets of other set pieces, and comparing its performance to that of other models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does TacticAI's performance vary across different leagues and levels of play?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses data from the English Premier League, but does not explore how TacticAI's performance might differ in other leagues or levels of play.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any data or analysis on this topic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing TacticAI on datasets from different leagues and levels of play, and comparing its performance across these different contexts.

## Limitations

- Performance relies on proprietary Liverpool FC dataset, limiting independent verification
- Paper lacks detailed architectural specifications and hyperparameter settings needed for exact reproduction
- Qualitative evaluation uses relatively small sample size (100 samples) and may be subject to presentation order effects

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core concept of using graph representations for corner kick analysis and the basic architectural approach
- Medium confidence: The specific performance metrics (accuracy scores, F1 scores) due to lack of detailed implementation specifications
- Low confidence: The generalization capability beyond the specific dataset and the long-term effectiveness of tactical recommendations

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the receiver prediction accuracy on a publicly available football dataset to verify the model's effectiveness
2. Test the geometric deep learning approach on a different domain with similar symmetry properties to assess generalizability
3. Conduct a larger-scale qualitative study with multiple football clubs to validate the tactical recommendations across different playing styles
