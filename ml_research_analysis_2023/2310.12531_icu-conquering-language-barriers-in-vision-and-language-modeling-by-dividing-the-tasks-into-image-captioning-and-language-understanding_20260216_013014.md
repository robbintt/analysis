# ICU: Conquering Language Barriers in Vision-and-Language Modeling by Dividing the Tasks into Image Captioning and Language Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12531

- Key outcome: ICU achieves state-of-the-art results for five languages and comparable performance for the rest on IGLUE benchmark tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ICU (Image Captioning and Understanding), a novel approach to tackle the scarcity problem in multilingual vision-and-language (V&L) modeling. Instead of developing a single model capable of both multimodal and multilingual processing, ICU divides the task into two stages: image captioning in English using a V&L model, followed by cross-lingual language understanding using a multilingual language model (mLM). This division alleviates the burden of multilingual processing from the V&L model and leverages the higher abundance and quality of multilingual text data. Experiments on two tasks across 9 languages in the IGLUE benchmark demonstrate that ICU achieves state-of-the-art results for five languages and comparable performance for the rest, highlighting its effectiveness in conquering language barriers in V&L modeling.

## Method Summary
ICU employs a two-stage approach to multilingual V&L modeling. First, a V&L model (OFA Large) generates English captions for images. Second, a multilingual language model (mDeBERTaV3 Base) performs cross-lingual inference based on these captions, which are presented in task-specific frame templates. The method leverages the strengths of both models: the V&L model excels at image understanding while the mLM specializes in multilingual text processing. Few-shot learning can further enhance performance by fine-tuning the mLM on task-specific data. The approach addresses the scarcity of multilingual caption data by relying on the abundance of multilingual text data for the language understanding stage.

## Key Results
- ICU achieves state-of-the-art results for five languages on IGLUE benchmark tasks
- Comparable performance to existing methods for the remaining four languages
- Demonstrates effectiveness of dividing V&L tasks between specialized models
- Shows that few-shot learning can further improve cross-lingual task performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dividing multilingual V&L tasks into English image captioning followed by multilingual text-only processing improves performance by leveraging the relative abundance of multilingual text data.
- Mechanism: The V&L model generates high-quality English captions for images, which are then used as input to a multilingual language model (mLM) that performs cross-lingual inference. This division allows the mLM to focus solely on language understanding without the added complexity of multimodal processing.
- Core assumption: English captions generated by the V&L model are sufficiently informative and accurate to serve as effective "alt text" for cross-lingual language understanding tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The burden of multilingual processing is lifted off V&L model and placed on mLM. Since the multilingual text data is relatively of higher abundance and quality, ICU can facilitate the conquering of language barriers for V&L models."
  - [section]: "ICU leverages the strengths of both the V&L model and the mLM. Given that multilingual text data are relatively more abundant and of higher quality, ICU helps alleviate the scarcity problem."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus neighbors don't directly discuss the specific mechanism of dividing tasks between V&L and mLM models.
- Break condition: If the V&L model fails to generate accurate or informative English captions, the subsequent mLM processing will be compromised, leading to poor performance on cross-lingual tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using frame engineering to adapt cross-lingual tasks to mLM-friendly formats improves performance by providing structured input.
- Mechanism: Different frame templates are used to present the image captions in a way that is easily processed by the mLM. This structured input allows the mLM to better understand the task and generate more accurate outputs.
- Core assumption: The mLM can effectively process and understand the structured input provided by the frame templates, even when dealing with code-switching between English captions and target language text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we explore frame engineering techniques, wherein we assign captions to different frames... and demonstrate that the model exhibits sensitivity to different frames when applied to MaRVL."
  - [section]: "we demonstrate that the mLM already achieves good performance in zero-shot scenarios, and the performance can be further improved through few-shot learning."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus neighbors don't directly discuss the specific mechanism of using frame templates to adapt tasks for mLM processing.
- Break condition: If the frame templates are not properly designed or if the mLM struggles with code-switching, the performance gains from frame engineering may be minimal or non-existent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Few-shot learning can further improve performance on cross-lingual tasks by fine-tuning the mLM on task-specific data.
- Mechanism: After the initial zero-shot performance, the mLM is fine-tuned on a small amount of task-specific data (few-shot learning). This allows the mLM to adapt to the specific characteristics of the task and improve its performance.
- Core assumption: The few-shot data is representative of the task and the mLM can effectively learn from this limited data without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we observe that employing few-shot learning techniques for XVNLI further enhances the model's performance."
  - [section]: "The process of freezing the V&L model can make it more efficient by enabling the reuse of captions and leveraging the significantly smaller mLM compared to the standard V&L models."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus neighbors don't directly discuss the specific mechanism of using few-shot learning to improve cross-lingual task performance.
- Break condition: If the few-shot data is not representative or if the mLM overfits to the limited data, the performance gains from few-shot learning may be minimal or the model may even perform worse than the zero-shot baseline.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Image captioning
  - Why needed here: The first stage of ICU involves generating English captions for images using a V&L model. Understanding how image captioning works and its limitations is crucial for implementing and evaluating ICU.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in image captioning, and how do they impact the quality of the generated captions used in ICU?

- Concept: Cross-lingual language understanding
  - Why needed here: The second stage of ICU involves using a multilingual language model to perform cross-lingual inference based on the English captions. Understanding the principles and challenges of cross-lingual language understanding is essential for effectively implementing and evaluating this stage.
  - Quick check question: How do multilingual language models handle code-switching, and what are the potential issues that may arise when processing English captions and target language text?

- Concept: Frame engineering
  - Why needed here: ICU employs frame engineering techniques to adapt cross-lingual tasks to mLM-friendly formats. Understanding the principles and best practices of frame engineering is crucial for effectively designing and implementing these adaptations.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing frame templates for cross-lingual tasks, and how do different frame structures impact the performance of the mLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - V&L model (OFA Large) -> generates English captions for images
  - mLM (mDeBERTaV3 Base) -> performs cross-lingual language understanding based on English captions
  - Frame templates -> structure the input for the mLM
  - Few-shot learning pipeline -> fine-tunes the mLM on task-specific data

- Critical path:
  1. Input image
  2. V&L model generates English caption
  3. Frame template structures the input for mLM
  4. mLM performs cross-lingual inference
  5. (Optional) Few-shot learning fine-tunes mLM

- Design tradeoffs:
  - V&L model size vs. caption quality: Larger V&L models may generate better captions but are more computationally expensive
  - mLM size vs. cross-lingual performance: Larger mLM models may handle cross-lingual tasks better but are more computationally expensive
  - Frame template complexity vs. mLM understanding: More complex frames may provide better structure but may be harder for the mLM to process

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor caption quality: Inaccurate or uninformative English captions from the V&L model
  - mLM struggles with code-switching: Difficulty processing English captions and target language text
  - Frame template mismatch: Frame templates not well-suited for the specific cross-lingual task

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the quality of English captions generated by the V&L model on a held-out image dataset
  2. Test the mLM's ability to handle code-switching by providing English captions and target language text in different frame templates
  3. Assess the impact of few-shot learning on the mLM's performance by fine-tuning on a small amount of task-specific data and comparing to the zero-shot baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ICU's performance compare to end-to-end multilingual V&L models on tasks beyond XVNLI and MaRVL, such as visual question answering or image retrieval?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on XVNLI and MaRVL tasks from the IGLUE benchmark, but acknowledges that adaptation to other tasks like xGQA can be challenging due to caption length limitations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical results or analysis for other V&L tasks beyond the two mentioned. The adaptation process and performance on a broader range of tasks remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments evaluating ICU's performance on a diverse set of V&L tasks, including visual question answering, image retrieval, and other IGLUE tasks, would provide insights into its generalizability and effectiveness across different domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of caption quality and diversity on ICU's performance across different languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] ICU relies on a V&L model to generate English captions, which are then used as input for cross-lingual language understanding. The quality and diversity of these captions could significantly influence the downstream task performance, especially for languages with limited image-caption data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the relationship between caption quality/diversity and ICU's performance. It also does not explore strategies to improve caption generation for languages with scarce resources.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments analyzing the correlation between caption quality/diversity metrics and ICU's performance across languages, as well as studies on techniques to enhance caption generation for low-resource languages, would shed light on this aspect.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ICU handle complex visual scenes and fine-grained details in images, particularly for languages with rich morphological structures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] ICU divides the task into image captioning and language understanding, relying on the V&L model's ability to capture visual information and the mLM's cross-lingual capabilities. However, the paper does not delve into the model's handling of complex visual scenes or its performance on languages with intricate morphological structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks analysis on ICU's performance with complex visual scenes and does not explore its behavior on languages with rich morphological structures, which could pose challenges for cross-lingual understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed experiments evaluating ICU's performance on images with complex scenes and fine-grained details, as well as comparative studies on languages with varying morphological complexities, would provide insights into the model's strengths and limitations in handling such scenarios.

## Limitations
- Performance on languages beyond the five where ICU achieves state-of-the-art results remains merely comparable to existing methods
- The approach depends heavily on the quality of English captions generated by the V&L model, with no direct evaluation of caption quality metrics
- Limited analysis of ICU's performance on complex visual scenes and languages with rich morphological structures

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Dividing tasks): Medium confidence - shows promise but lacks comprehensive validation
- Mechanism 2 (Frame engineering): Medium confidence - demonstrates sensitivity to frames but lacks ablation studies
- Mechanism 3 (Few-shot learning): Medium confidence - shows improvements but raises questions about scalability
- Caption quality assumption: Low confidence - critical assumption not directly evaluated
- Cross-lingual performance: Medium confidence - strong results for five languages but comparable for others

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic evaluation of generated caption quality using established image captioning metrics (e.g., CIDEr, SPICE) on held-out test sets to verify the assumption that English captions provide adequate information for cross-lingual tasks.

2. Perform controlled ablation studies testing ICU performance with intentionally degraded caption quality (e.g., using smaller V&L models or adding noise) to establish the sensitivity of downstream performance to caption quality.

3. Implement cross-validation across different frame template designs for each target language to identify optimal framing strategies and quantify the impact of frame engineering on overall performance.
