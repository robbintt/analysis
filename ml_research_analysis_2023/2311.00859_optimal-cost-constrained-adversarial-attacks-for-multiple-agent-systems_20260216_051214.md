# Optimal Cost Constrained Adversarial Attacks For Multiple Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.00859
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00859
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Optimal adversarial attack strategies in MARL systems reduce recipient rewards by up to 72% compared to random attacks under budget constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of finding optimal adversarial attack strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems where multiple distributed attackers, each with budget constraints, target multiple recipient agents. Unlike previous studies assuming a single limitless attacker, this work considers a more realistic scenario with resource-limited distributed attackers. The key innovation is formulating the problem as a dynamic programming framework that integrates within-step static constrained attack-resource allocation optimization with between-step dynamic programming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimal attacks can significantly reduce the rewards obtained by recipient agents compared to random attacks and no attacks, with reductions of up to 49% and 72% in two different budget constraint scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses dynamic programming to compute optimal adversarial attack strategies under budget constraints. The algorithm operates in two phases: within each time step, a static constrained optimization allocates attacker resources across recipient agents based on attack difficulty and distance metrics; between steps, dynamic programming recursively computes the minimal expected rewards (MPV) for each Dynamic Programming State (DPS). The approach considers two budget constraint scenarios - an all-time constraint where total budget is fixed across all time steps, and an instant cost constraint where each attack action has an associated cost. The method leverages a two-phase interaction model where attackers first corrupt recipient agents' observations (delusional states) before recipients take actions based on these corrupted states.

## Key Results
- Optimal attacks reduced recipient rewards by 49% compared to random attacks under all-time budget constraints
- Optimal attacks achieved 72% reduction compared to random attacks under instant cost constraints
- Optimal attacks achieved 44% reduction compared to no attacks under all-time budget constraints
- Results demonstrated on a simplified 2-recipient, 2-attacker system with T=5 time steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dynamic programming integrates two optimization layers (within-step allocation + between-step planning) to minimize recipient rewards under budget constraints.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses backward recursion to compute minimal expected rewards (MPV) for each Dynamic Programming State (DPS). Within each time step, a static constrained optimization allocates attacker resources across recipient agents. Between steps, dynamic programming updates state values based on transition probabilities and rewards.
- Core assumption: The MDP environment is fully observable to both attacker and recipient groups, and the recipient agents' optimal policies are known in advance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose an optimal method integrating within-step static constrained attack-resource allocation optimization and between-step dynamic programming"
  - [section 3.1]: "We design a dynamic programming between steps to compute such an optimal attack strategy"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on poisoning attacks but don't detail this specific DP+optimization integration
- Break condition: If transition probabilities or recipient policies are unknown or change during execution, the backward DP computation becomes invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: State poisoning attacks work by manipulating recipient agents' delusional states without changing their true states, exploiting the two-phase interaction model.
- Mechanism: Attackers inject false observations during the first phase (t-1 to t-0.5), causing recipient agents to base their actions on incorrect delusional states. Since actions are taken based on delusional states but true states determine rewards, attackers can indirectly control behavior and reduce expected rewards.
- Core assumption: Recipient agents are unaware of the attack and take actions solely based on their delusional states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2]: "attackers perform state poisoning attacks by disturbing recipient agents' observations of their true states"
  - [section 2]: "The 2nd phase, after the attack, from the time index t-0.5 to t, each recipient agent i moves to sa,t,i according to its optimal policy π⋆i,t-0.5(sd,t-0.5,i)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work discusses poisoning but doesn't explicitly model the two-phase state/delusional state separation
- Break condition: If recipient agents detect anomalies in their observations or incorporate uncertainty into their policies, the attack effectiveness diminishes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The "proportional effort success" model links attack spending to state manipulation probability, enabling resource-efficient attacks.
- Mechanism: The probability that a recipient agent's delusional state differs from its true state is max(Σxij/Ct(i,j), 1), where xij is the attack spending from attacker j on recipient i, and Ct(i,j) represents attack difficulty. This creates a non-linear relationship where marginal returns decrease as spending increases.
- Core assumption: Attack success probability grows with spending until saturation, and delusional states are uniformly distributed when successful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.1]: "the probability that the recipient agents' state will transition to σt+0.5 as P(x, sa,t, σk t+0.5)"
  - [section 3.2.1]: "the probability that its delusional state will be different from its true state is max{Σj[xij/Ct(i, j)], 1}"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no related papers discuss this specific spending-probability relationship model
- Break condition: If the actual relationship between spending and attack success deviates significantly from the assumed model, the optimization becomes suboptimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dynamic Programming in Markov Decision Processes
  - Why needed here: The algorithm recursively computes optimal attack strategies by working backward from terminal states
  - Quick check question: Why does backward induction work for finite-horizon MDPs but not infinite-horizon ones?

- Concept: Constrained Optimization and Resource Allocation
  - Why needed here: Attackers must allocate limited budgets across multiple recipients while respecting individual constraints
  - Quick check question: What happens to the optimization if the constraint matrix becomes singular?

- Concept: Two-Phase State Manipulation in Adversarial RL
  - Why needed here: The attack model separates observation corruption from action execution, creating a gap between perceived and actual states
  - Quick check question: How would the attack strategy change if recipient agents could verify their observations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dynamic Programming Engine -> Static Optimizer -> State Transition Model -> Budget Manager
- Critical path: Static Optimizer → DP Update → Next Time Step (for instant cost case) or DP Update → Budget Check → Static Optimizer (for all-time cost case)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity vs. attack optimality: Full DP requires O(|Σ| × |A†| × T) operations
  - Model accuracy vs. practicality: Simplified probability models may not capture real attack dynamics
  - Centralization vs. distributed attacks: The current model assumes coordinated attacks rather than independent agents
- Failure signatures:
  - Budget exhaustion before achieving desired reward reduction
  - Numerical instability in probability calculations when attack spending is very low
  - State space explosion making DP computation infeasible for larger problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the all-time constrained case with simplified state spaces (2 states per agent) to verify DP correctness
  2. Compare random attacks vs. optimal attacks on a 2x2 agent system to measure performance gains
  3. Test sensitivity to budget allocation by varying b1 and b2 while keeping total budget constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed computational complexity analysis, including runtime and memory requirements, for varying numbers of agents and states.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed adversarial attacks perform against different reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the attacks in a specific setting with a finite-horizon Markov game but does not explore their performance against different RL algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a specific RL algorithm and does not investigate the robustness of the attacks against other RL methods.

## Limitations
- Strong modeling assumptions require complete knowledge of recipient agents' optimal policies and transition probabilities
- Proportional effort success model lacks empirical validation and may oversimplify real attack dynamics
- Numerical results limited to small-scale systems (2 recipients, 2 attackers, 5 time steps)

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The mathematical formulation of the dynamic programming algorithm and the integration of static constrained optimization within the DP framework are well-defined and internally consistent.
- Medium Confidence: The two-phase attack model and the state poisoning mechanism are theoretically sound, but their practical effectiveness depends on recipient agents' lack of detection capabilities.
- Low Confidence: The proportional effort success model's parameters (Ct(i,j) and distance dt_ij) and their practical computation are not fully specified, making it difficult to assess real-world applicability.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the algorithm on larger MARL systems (e.g., 10+ agents) to verify computational feasibility and assess whether the attack effectiveness scales as expected.
2. Test the attack strategy's performance under partial information scenarios where transition probabilities or recipient policies are estimated rather than known exactly.
3. Design a physical or simulated MARL environment where the proportional effort success model can be calibrated against actual attack outcomes to validate the spending-probability relationship.
