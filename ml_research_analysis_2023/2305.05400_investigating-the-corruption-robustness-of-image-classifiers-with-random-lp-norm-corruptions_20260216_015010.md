# Investigating the Corruption Robustness of Image Classifiers with Random Lp-norm Corruptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.05400
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05400
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: L0-norm corruption training significantly improves corruption robustness while maintaining or slightly improving classification accuracy, outperforming several state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates robustness of image classifiers against random Lp-norm corruptions, a relatively unexplored area compared to real-world corruption robustness. The authors propose using Lp-norm corruptions for both training and test data augmentation to improve classifier robustness. They introduce a new imperceptible corruption error (iCE) metric to evaluate robustness against small, visually undetectable perturbations across different Lp-norms. The key finding is that training with L0-norm corruptions significantly improves corruption robustness while maintaining or slightly improving classification accuracy, even outperforming several state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. The authors also find that robustness to L0-norm corruptions is only effectively achieved by training on L0-norm corruptions, while robustness to other Lp-norm corruptions transfers across different Lp-norms. They attribute this to the unique volume overlap properties of L0-norm spheres in high-dimensional input space. The results suggest that L0-norm corruption training is a highly effective and simple data augmentation strategy that should be adopted for improving both real-world and Lp-norm corruption robustness.

## Method Summary
The study uses CIFAR-10 dataset and WRN-28-10 model architecture to evaluate corruption robustness. The authors implement an Lp-norm corruption sampling algorithm based on Calafiore et al. 1998 to generate uniformly distributed corruptions within Lp-norm spheres. They train multiple models with various Lp-norm corruptions (L0, L1, L2, L0.5, L50, L∞) both individually and in combinations, with and without state-of-the-art augmentation techniques (TA, RA, AM). The corruption robustness is evaluated using clean error rate, mean Corruption Error (mCE), mean Lp-norm Corruption Error (mCE Lp), and imperceptible Corruption Error (iCE) metrics.

## Key Results
- L0-norm corruption training significantly improves corruption robustness while maintaining or slightly improving classification accuracy
- L0-norm robustness transfers across all Lp-norms, while other Lp-norm robustnesses do not transfer to L0-norm
- L0-norm corruption training outperforms several state-of-the-art data augmentation methods
- Training on a broad range of Lp-norm corruptions (C2C1 model) improves robustness while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: L0-norm training data augmentation maintains or slightly improves classification accuracy while significantly improving corruption robustness.
- Mechanism: L0-norm corruptions randomly zero out or set pixel values to extremes, acting similarly to dropout in the input layer, which has a strong regularizing effect on the training process.
- Core assumption: The regularizing effect of L0-norm corruptions is strong enough to prevent overfitting while maintaining accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "training with L0-norm corruptions significantly improves corruption robustness while maintaining or slightly improving classification accuracy"
  - [section] "One possible explanation for the effectiveness of L0-norm data augmentation is that it essentially represents random zeros or ones in one dimension of the input. This effect is comparable to dropout in the the input layer of the network, a method that has been shown to be very effective in regularizing neural networks"
- Break condition: If L0-norm corruptions cause too much information loss, leading to underfitting or accuracy degradation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Robustness to L0-norm corruptions is only effectively achieved by training on L0-norm corruptions, while robustness to other Lp-norm corruptions transfers across different Lp-norms.
- Mechanism: L0-norm spheres in high-dimensional space have unique volume overlap properties with other Lp-norm spheres, meaning training on L0-norm corruptions covers a broader range of input space that is also covered by other Lp-norm spheres.
- Core assumption: The volume overlap properties of Lp-norm spheres in high-dimensional space are as described in the paper.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "robustness to L0-norm corruptions is only effectively achieved by training on L0-norm corruptions, while robustness to other Lp-norm corruptions transfers across different Lp-norms"
  - [section] "We investigate this unintuitive behaviour by setting up an experiment to evaluate the coverage and overlap of the volumes of two different Lp-norm spheres... Figure 6 shows 6 sub-plots for 6 different Lp-norms, with their epsilon being varied along the x-axis"
- Break condition: If the volume overlap properties are different in practice than what is shown in Figure 6, or if the assumptions about volume overlap do not hold for other datasets or model architectures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on a very broad range of Lp-norm corruptions, as tested with the C2C1 model, outperforms its counterpart C1C1 in terms of corruption robustness while about maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: Combining a wide range of Lp-norm corruptions in training provides a more diverse set of regularizing effects, leading to better generalization and robustness.
- Core assumption: The diversity of Lp-norm corruptions in training provides a meaningful benefit in terms of regularization and robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "C2C1 outperformed its counterpart C1C1, which features a smaller range of corruptions, in terms of corruption robustness while about maintaining accuracy"
  - [section] "The positive effect may also be solely attributable to the small epsilon values of many of the 18 corruptions used for C2C1"
- Break condition: If the diversity of Lp-norm corruptions does not provide a meaningful benefit, or if the small epsilon values are the primary driver of the observed effect.

## Foundational Learning

- Lp-norm distances and their properties:
  - Why needed here: Understanding Lp-norm distances is crucial for understanding the corruption robustness evaluation and training strategies used in the paper.
  - Quick check question: What is the formula for calculating Lp-norm distance, and how does it differ for different values of p?

- Volume overlap properties of Lp-norm spheres in high-dimensional space:
  - Why needed here: The paper's main finding about the transferability of robustness across different Lp-norms relies on the unique volume overlap properties of L0-norm spheres.
  - Quick check question: How do the volume overlap properties of L0-norm spheres differ from other Lp-norm spheres in high-dimensional space?

- Regularization techniques in deep learning:
  - Why needed here: The paper's discussion of L0-norm training as a regularizing technique requires an understanding of common regularization methods in deep learning.
  - Quick check question: What are some common regularization techniques used in deep learning, and how do they work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WRN-28-10 model -> Lp-norm corruption sampling algorithm -> corruption robustness metrics (mCE, mCE Lp, iCE) -> training data augmentation strategies
- Critical path: 1) Apply Lp-norm corruptions to test data using sampling algorithm, 2) Run corrupted test data through classifier, 3) Calculate corruption robustness metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Between diversity of Lp-norm corruptions used in training and computational cost of training on larger number of corruption types
- Failure signatures: 1) Overfitting to specific Lp-norm corruptions used in training, leading to poor generalization, 2) Underfitting due to too much regularization from Lp-norm corruptions, leading to low accuracy, 3) Computational inefficiency from training on too many corruption types
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline model without any Lp-norm corruption data augmentation, evaluate corruption robustness using mCE metric
  2. Train model with L0-norm corruption data augmentation, compare corruption robustness and accuracy to baseline
  3. Train model with combination of Lp-norm corruption data augmentation (e.g., L0, L1, L2), compare corruption robustness and accuracy to baseline and L0-only model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific characteristics of L0-norm corruptions that make them uniquely effective at improving robustness across different Lp-norms, and how can this property be leveraged for other forms of robustness training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that L0-norm training transfers into good robustness against all Lp-norm corruptions, while other Lp-norm trainings do not achieve effective L0-norm robustness. They attribute this to the unique volume overlap properties of L0-norm spheres.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of why L0-norm corruptions are uniquely effective beyond the volume overlap observation. The underlying mechanism that makes L0-norm training so broadly beneficial remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further theoretical analysis of the mathematical properties of L0-norm spheres and their interaction with neural network decision boundaries, or empirical studies comparing L0-norm training with other forms of input dropout or noise injection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the concept of imperceptible corruption error (iCE) be further developed and validated using more advanced distance and similarity measures aligned with human perception limits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce the iCE metric but acknowledge that their selection of imperceptible corruptions is "highly experimental, subjective and probably not generalisable to different image datasets, dimensions or even observers."
- Why unresolved: The iCE metric is based on subjective observations of imperceptibility, and there is no established method for determining what constitutes an imperceptible corruption across different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of perceptual models that can objectively quantify imperceptibility, followed by validation studies comparing human and model responses to corruptions at various levels of the proposed perceptual metric.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal combination of Lp-norm corruptions for training that maximizes both accuracy and robustness, and how does this vary across different neural network architectures and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found that L0-norm corruption training is highly effective but suggest that "training on a very broad range of Lp-norm corruptions in addition appears to be effective." However, they did not systematically explore the optimal combinations or their generalizability.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested a limited set of combinations on one architecture (WRN-28-10) and dataset (CIFAR-10), leaving open questions about generalizability and optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies testing various combinations of Lp-norm corruptions across multiple architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers, ResNet variants) and datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100), with optimization techniques to find Pareto-optimal solutions balancing accuracy and robustness.

## Limitations

- The proposed volume overlap theory explaining L0-norm uniqueness is compelling but not conclusively proven
- Study focuses on CIFAR-10 with specific model architecture (WRN-28-10), limiting generalizability to other datasets and model types
- iCE metric, while addressing an important gap, requires further validation to ensure it reliably captures visual imperceptibility across diverse corruption types and image contents

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The empirical findings that L0-norm corruption training improves robustness while maintaining accuracy, and that L0-norm robustness transfers across Lp-norms while other Lp-norm robustnesses do not transfer to L0
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed mechanism explaining L0-norm uniqueness through volume overlap properties in high-dimensional space
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of L0-norm corruption training over existing state-of-the-art augmentation methods

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate L0-norm corruption training effectiveness on ImageNet and other datasets to verify the robustness findings extend beyond CIFAR-10

2. Conduct ablation studies that systematically vary the volume overlap properties (e.g., by constraining input dimensions) to more directly test the proposed explanation for L0-norm uniqueness

3. Perform human perceptual studies comparing iCE scores with actual human detection rates across different corruption types and image classes to validate the metric's reliability
