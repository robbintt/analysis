# Explaining Speech Classification Models via Word-Level Audio Segments and Paralinguistic Features

- Primary result: Novel perturbation-based approach for explaining speech classification models through word-level audio segments and paralinguistic features, validated across two tasks and languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel perturbation-based approach to explain speech classification models at two levels: word-level audio segments and paralinguistic features. The method computes attribution scores by measuring how model predictions change when masking individual word segments or applying controlled transformations to paralinguistic features like pitch, speed, noise, and reverberation. The approach is validated on two state-of-the-art speech models (wav2vec-2.0 and XLS-R) across three datasets covering intent classification in English and Italian, plus emotion recognition.

## Method Summary
The approach uses perturbation-based explanations where word-level attributions are computed by masking individual audio segments aligned to transcripts and measuring prediction changes. Paralinguistic attributions are generated by systematically transforming raw audio signals (pitch shifting, time stretching, noise addition, reverb) and computing the effect on model predictions. The method employs speech recognition (WhisperX) for word-level timestamp alignment and generates visualizations showing both word importance heatmaps and paralinguistic feature impact plots.

## Key Results
- Word-level explanations reveal how each word-related audio segment impacts model predictions
- Paralinguistic feature explanations quantify how pitch, speed, noise, and reverberation changes affect outcomes
- Explanations are faithful to model inner workings and plausible to humans
- Validated across two state-of-the-art models, two tasks (Intent Classification, Emotion Recognition), and two languages (English, Italian)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Perturbation-based explanations reveal model decision-making by measuring output changes when removing specific audio segments. The method masks individual word-level audio segments and computes the difference in prediction probability between original and masked audio, quantifying each segment's contribution to the model's decision. Core assumption: output change is directly proportional to segment importance. Break condition: if the model uses complex interactions between multiple audio segments that cannot be isolated through simple masking, attribution scores may not accurately reflect true importance.

### Mechanism 2
Paralinguistic feature perturbations isolate non-lexical information's impact on model predictions. The method systematically transforms paralinguistic features (pitch, time stretching, noise, reverb) and measures prediction probability changes, creating interpretable heatmaps of feature importance. Core assumption: controlled transformations maintain semantic content while isolating acoustic characteristics. Break condition: if the model is highly sensitive to signal-to-noise ratios or other global acoustic properties, controlled perturbations may not isolate the intended paralinguistic feature.

### Mechanism 3
Word-level audio-transcript alignment enables semantically meaningful explanations. The method uses speech recognition systems (WhisperX) to generate word-level timestamps, creating audio segments that correspond to actual spoken words rather than arbitrary time windows. Core assumption: speech recognition timestamp accuracy is sufficient for meaningful word-level audio segments. Break condition: if speech recognition accuracy is poor for the target language or acoustic conditions, word-level segments may not correspond to actual words, invalidating explanations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speech signal processing basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how audio masking, pitch shifting, and time stretching work at the signal level is essential for implementing the perturbation techniques
  - Quick check question: What happens to the audio waveform when you apply a pitch shift transformation?

- Concept: eXplainable AI fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The perturbation-based explanation approach builds on established XAI principles like faithfulness and plausibility evaluation
  - Quick check question: How does the comprehensiveness metric differ from sufficiency in evaluating explanations?

- Concept: Speech recognition and alignment
  - Why needed here: Word-level explanations require accurate audio-transcript alignment to create meaningful segments
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when aligning audio to transcripts in languages with non-phonetic writing systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio preprocessing → Speech recognition alignment → Perturbation module → Model inference → Attribution calculation → Visualization
- Critical path: Audio input → Word-level segmentation → Mask application → Model prediction → Attribution computation → User visualization
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time vs. offline processing trade-offs; accuracy of speech recognition vs. explanation quality; complexity of perturbation techniques vs. interpretability
- Failure signatures: Poor speech recognition accuracy → Misaligned word segments; model sensitivity to perturbations → Unreliable attributions; visualization complexity → User confusion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate word-level alignment accuracy on test dataset using ground truth transcripts
  2. Test perturbation sensitivity by measuring prediction changes with controlled noise addition
  3. Compare word-level attributions against random baseline to establish baseline faithfulness metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the intersectional effect of multiple masked words impact the accuracy and interpretability of word-level audio segment explanations? The current methodology does not account for combined effects of multiple masked words, which could lead to incomplete or misleading explanations. This remains unresolved and requires experiments comparing different masking strategies.

### Open Question 2
How do perturbation techniques and third-party speech libraries impact the accuracy and interpretability of paralinguistic explanations? The choice of perturbation techniques and speech libraries may introduce biases or artifacts affecting explanation quality. This requires systematic variation of techniques and libraries with analysis of resulting changes.

### Open Question 3
How do generated explanations compare to human-generated explanations in terms of interpretability and trustworthiness? While faithfulness has been assessed, plausibility and interpretability from a human perspective remain unevaluated. This requires user studies comparing generated vs. human explanations.

## Limitations

- Word-level explanations depend heavily on speech recognition accuracy, which may introduce errors in noisy environments or for languages with complex phonetic structures
- Perturbation-based mechanism assumes simple masking captures true importance, but may not hold for models using complex audio feature interactions
- Claims about approach working across "two tasks and languages" are based on limited testing with two models and three datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: General perturbation-based approach for generating explanations is sound and follows established XAI principles. Faithfulness metrics are well-established.

**Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of word-level explanations depends on speech recognition accuracy, which varies across languages and acoustic conditions. Human plausibility claims are based on qualitative visualizations rather than systematic studies.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about approach working across "two tasks and languages" are based on limited testing. Generalizability to other speech classification tasks or languages remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Speech Recognition Accuracy Validation**: Measure alignment error rate between generated word-level timestamps and ground truth transcripts across different acoustic conditions and languages to quantify potential errors in word-level explanations.

2. **Interaction Effect Analysis**: Design experiments to test whether complex interactions between audio segments affect the reliability of masking-based attribution, potentially comparing against interaction-aware explanation methods.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the approach to at least two additional speech classification tasks (e.g., speaker identification, speech pathology detection) with different model architectures to assess generalizability beyond the tested scenarios.
