# Detecting Speech Abnormalities with a Perceiver-based Sequence Classifier that Leverages a Universal Speech Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.13010
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13010
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Perceiver-based model achieves 83.1% average accuracy on detecting 14 speech abnormality attributes from clinical recordings.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Perceiver-based sequence classifier for detecting speech abnormalities associated with neurological disorders. The model leverages a Universal Speech Model (USM) pretrained on 12 million hours of audio, using class-specific latent representations via cross-attention and a factorized projection to predict multiple attributes of disordered speech. The approach allows the model to focus on different regions of the input signal for different classes and is data efficient. Results show the model outperforms standard transformer and perceiver baselines with 83.1% average accuracy on a Mayo Clinic corpus.

## Method Summary
The method uses a Perceiver-based sequence classifier that takes frozen USM encodings as input. Cross-attention maps the encoded audio sequence to a fixed set of class-specific latent representations, allowing each target class to focus on different regions of the audio signal. A factorized projection then maps these latents to logits for the 14 binary classification tasks. The model is jointly trained on pooled task data with task ID as input, using encodings from the middle layer (layer 11) of the USM.

## Key Results
- Perceiver model with class-specific latents achieves 83.1% average accuracy across 14 binary speech abnormality attributes
- USM pretraining is crucial; surprisingly, ASR-optimized encodings outperform BEST-RQ for this medical diagnostics task
- Middle USM layers (layer 11) provide optimal mix of acoustic and phonetic information (83.1% vs 79.6% for final layer)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Class-specific latent representations enable the model to focus on different regions of the input signal for different classes.
- **Mechanism:** Cross-attention maps encoded audio sequences to fixed class-specific latent representations, allowing each class to attend to different signal regions.
- **Core assumption:** Different speech abnormalities require attention to different parts of the audio signal.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract and section 4.1 discussion of class-specific latents; no direct citation in neighbor papers.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pretraining with ASR provides beneficial representations for detecting speech abnormalities.
- **Mechanism:** USM pretrained on ASR learns general speech representations capturing both acoustic and phonetic information.
- **Core assumption:** ASR-pretrained models learn general speech features that transfer to other speech-related tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions ASR pretraining benefits; section 4.2 shows ASR-optimized encodings perform better than BEST-RQ.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Middle USM layers provide optimal mix of acoustic and phonetic information.
- **Mechanism:** Middle layers retain more acoustic information while having some phonetic structure, suitable for detecting abnormalities requiring both cues.
- **Core assumption:** Different layers capture different types of information (acoustic vs. phonetic).
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract shows 83.1% vs 79.6% for middle vs final layers; section 4.3 explains middle layers perform better than lower or higher layers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Cross-attention with learned latent variables
  - **Why needed:** To compress long audio sequences into fixed representations while allowing different classes to focus on different signal regions.
  - **Quick check:** How does cross-attention differ from self-attention in terms of input and output dimensions?

- **Concept:** Factorized projection for sequence classification
  - **Why needed:** To map class-specific latent representations to logits while capturing joint time-feature dependencies.
  - **Quick check:** Why is a factorized projection used instead of a simple dense layer after averaging latent representations?

- **Concept:** Transfer learning with pretrained speech models
  - **Why needed:** To leverage large amounts of unsupervised speech data for a small, specialized dataset.
  - **Quick check:** What are the potential risks of using a model pretrained on ASR for a medical diagnostics task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** USM (32-layer conformer) → Perceiver (cross-attention) → Factorized projection → Classification head
- **Critical path:** USM → Perceiver (cross-attention) → Factorized projection → Classification
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - USM encodings vs. training from scratch: USM provides better performance but requires access to pretrained weights
  - Class-specific latents vs. shared latents: Class-specific latents allow more flexibility but increase parameter count
  - Factorized projection vs. simple pooling: Factorized projection captures joint time-feature dependencies but adds complexity
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance on certain attributes: May indicate need for different layer encodings or model architecture
  - Overfitting on training data: May indicate need for more regularization or data augmentation
  - Inconsistent results across data splits: May indicate sensitivity to specific speakers in training set
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train baseline transformer model with USM encodings to establish performance reference
  2. Train perceiver model with class-specific latents and factorized projection to compare against baseline
  3. Experiment with encodings from different USM layers to find optimal layer for task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How do the factorized projection layers capture joint time-feature dependencies, and how does this compare to other methods of pooling or summarizing sequence information?
- **Question:** How do the class-specific latent representations capture different characteristics of speech abnormalities, and how do they differ from each other?
- **Question:** How do encodings from different layers of the USM capture different aspects of speech, and how can this be leveraged to improve the model's performance?

## Limitations
- Non-public Mayo Clinic dataset restricts independent verification of 83.1% accuracy claims
- Limited ablation studies on USM layers and pretraining strategies based on single corpus
- Unclear generalizability to other medical speech datasets or broader disordered speech tasks

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in general approach: Perceiver-based models with cross-attention and class-specific latents are theoretically sound for sequence modeling
- **Medium confidence** in specific performance claims: Methodology is rigorous but non-public dataset and lack of detailed hyperparameters make exact replication difficult
- **Low confidence** in mechanism explaining middle layer superiority: Based on single dataset with somewhat speculative reasoning about acoustic vs phonetic information

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Transparency:** Request or simulate a small, public subset of Mayo Clinic data (or similar clinical speech dataset) to validate claimed accuracy and assess robustness to different data splits
2. **Layer Ablation on Public Data:** Reproduce USM layer ablation study on public disordered speech corpus (e.g., TORGO or UA-Speech) to verify middle layers consistently outperform final layers across datasets
3. **Generalization Across Disorders:** Test model on multiple neurological disorder datasets to evaluate whether Perceiver-based approach and USM encodings generalize beyond Mayo Clinic corpus, particularly for disorders not represented in original study
