# A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Summarization with Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.06114
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06114
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of GNN-based graph summarization methods covering GRNs, GCNs, GAEs, GATs, and GRL approaches

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for graph summarization, covering four main architectural categories: graph recurrent networks, graph convolutional networks, graph autoencoders, and graph attention networks. The paper systematically categorizes existing approaches and identifies key open challenges including multi-layer graphs, dynamic graphs, multi-label graphs, task-based summarization, and evaluation benchmarks. It also explores the emerging direction of using graph reinforcement learning to evaluate and improve graph summary quality.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involved collecting papers from major conferences (SIGKDD, Neurips, ICLR, ICML, KDD, WWW, IJCAI, VLDB) and journals (ACM, IEEE, Elsevier, Springer) on GNN-based graph summarization. Papers were categorized into four technical groups based on their underlying GNN architecture: GRN-based, GCN-based, GAE-based, and GAT-based approaches. The analysis examined contributions, methodologies, and open challenges for each category, while compiling benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for the field.

## Key Results
- GNNs enable effective graph summarization by learning low-dimensional representations that preserve key structural and attribute properties
- Different GNN architectures address specific summarization challenges through varying information propagation and aggregation mechanisms
- Graph reinforcement learning shows promise for improving summary quality through task-specific optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GNNs enable effective graph summarization by learning low-dimensional representations that preserve key structural and attribute properties of large graphs.
- Mechanism: GNNs use message-passing between nodes and their neighbors to aggregate local information, iteratively refining node representations. This process captures both local and global graph patterns, which are then compressed into lower-dimensional embeddings that retain essential characteristics.
- Core assumption: The graph structure contains sufficient signal in local neighborhoods to infer global patterns when aggregated across multiple layers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GNN is the most successful deep learning-based with multi-layer deep neural networks that can achieve reduced dimensionality."
  - [section] "The major advantage of GNN models for graph summarization over traditional methods is their ability to represent large graph features by low-dimensional vectors."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: When graph structures are highly irregular or lack consistent local patterns that can be meaningfully aggregated across layers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different GNN architectures (GRN, GCN, GAE, GAT) address specific summarization challenges by varying how information propagates and is aggregated across graph structures.
- Mechanism: Each GNN variant optimizes a different aspect of the summarization process - GRNs use recurrent units for temporal dependencies, GCNs apply convolutional filters for spectral/spatial information, GAEs focus on reconstruction from compressed representations, and GATs use attention to weight neighbor contributions dynamically.
- Core assumption: The choice of architecture significantly impacts the quality and type of graph summary produced for different application scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We structure the paper into four categories, including graph recurrent networks, graph convolutional networks, graph autoencoders, and graph attention networks."
  - [section] "Graph summarization approaches can be categorized under three main categories (see Figure 2): aggregation, selection, and transformation."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on privacy and dynamic aspects rather than architectural categorization.
- Break condition: When the summarization task requirements don't align with the strengths of the chosen GNN architecture type.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph reinforcement learning (GRL) improves graph summary quality by learning optimal summarization strategies through interaction with the graph structure and task-specific feedback.
- Mechanism: GRL agents explore different summarization actions (node/edge selection, grouping, transformation) and receive rewards based on summary quality metrics, learning to generate task-specific summaries that balance information preservation with compression.
- Core assumption: The summarization quality can be effectively quantified and optimized through reinforcement learning frameworks that provide meaningful reward signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "There is a blooming line of research on GRL for graph summarization elaborating on using it for evaluating and improving the quality of graph summaries."
  - [section] "For example, [Amiri et al., 2018] introduced a task-based GRL framework to automatically learn how to generate a summary on a given network."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors for GRL applications in graph summarization.
- Break condition: When reward signals are ambiguous or when the action space for summarization is too large for effective exploration.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph theory fundamentals (nodes, edges, adjacency, degree, centrality measures)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these concepts is essential for interpreting how GNNs operate on graph structures and what properties need to be preserved during summarization
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between node degree centrality and eigenvector centrality in measuring node importance?

- Concept: Deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders, attention mechanisms)
  - Why needed here: GNN variants build upon these foundational architectures, and understanding their principles helps explain how information flows through different GNN types
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism in GATs differ from the fixed aggregation in traditional GCNs?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, autoencoders)
  - Why needed here: Graph summarization fundamentally involves reducing high-dimensional graph data to lower-dimensional representations while preserving key properties
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between linear dimensionality reduction (like PCA) and nonlinear approaches (like autoencoders) in preserving data structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph data input → GNN model selection (GRN, GCN, GAE, GAT) → Training pipeline with loss functions → Embedding generation → Summary construction → Quality evaluation → (Optional) RL-based refinement
- Critical path: Graph data preprocessing → GNN model training → Embedding generation → Summary construction → Quality evaluation → (Optional) RL-based refinement
- Design tradeoffs: Tradeoff between summary compression ratio and information preservation; computational efficiency versus model complexity; static versus dynamic graph handling capabilities.
- Failure signatures: Poor summary quality indicated by high reconstruction error, inability to preserve key graph properties, or task-specific performance degradation; training instability due to graph size or complexity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic GCN-based summarization on small synthetic graphs with known ground truth to verify information preservation
  2. Compare different GNN architectures (GCN vs GAT vs GAE) on standard benchmark graphs for summarization quality
  3. Implement simple reinforcement learning framework to optimize summary construction based on task-specific rewards

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can graph summarization methods be effectively adapted to handle multi-layer graphs with heterogeneous node and edge types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies multi-layer graphs as an open challenge, noting that current techniques fail to provide interpretable representations of layered graphs with properties related to nodes, edges, actors, and layers.
- Why unresolved: Existing GNN-based methods are not practically suitable for analyzing large-scale multi-layer graphs due to the presence of redundant or irrelevant data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of GNN-based summarization techniques that can handle multi-layer graphs while preserving interpretability and key properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for evaluating graph summaries across different applications and tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses evaluation benchmarks as an open challenge, noting that current metrics focus on information loss, visualization, or sparsity, and more elaboration is needed for complex cases involving visualization and multi-resolution summaries.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating the "goodness" of graph summaries is application-specific and can be done from different perspectives, making it challenging to establish universal evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can assess graph summaries across various applications and tasks, considering multiple perspectives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can task-based graph summarization be effectively performed on streaming and heterogeneous graphs while leveraging human feedback in the learning process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies task-based summarization as an open challenge, noting that different summaries are required for various purposes and tasks, and research on streaming and heterogeneous graphs is underexplored.
- Why unresolved: Current task-based summarization methods are limited in their ability to handle streaming and heterogeneous graphs, and the integration of human feedback in the learning process is not well-established.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of task-based summarization techniques that can handle streaming and heterogeneous graphs while incorporating human feedback to improve the learning process.

## Limitations
- The rapidly evolving nature of this field means new approaches may have emerged since the survey's completion
- The categorization into four GNN types may not capture all emerging variants or hybrid approaches
- The effectiveness of GRL for graph summarization remains largely theoretical with limited empirical validation

## Confidence

- High confidence: The categorization of GNN architectures and their fundamental mechanisms for graph summarization
- Medium confidence: The identification of open challenges and future research directions
- Low confidence: The practical effectiveness of reinforcement learning approaches for improving summary quality, due to limited empirical evidence

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test at least two different GRL frameworks on standard benchmark graphs to evaluate their effectiveness in improving summary quality compared to traditional GNN methods.

2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing all four GNN categories (GRN, GCN, GAE, GAT) on the same graph summarization tasks to quantify their relative strengths and weaknesses.

3. Test the surveyed methods on dynamic graph datasets to assess their performance on evolving graph structures and identify specific limitations for temporal graph summarization.
