# Curriculum Graph Machine Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.02926
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02926
- Reference count: 9
- This paper provides a comprehensive survey of curriculum graph machine learning (Graph CL), categorizing methods by task granularity and learning approach.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of curriculum graph machine learning (Graph CL), which integrates curriculum learning principles with graph neural networks to address performance limitations caused by random data sample ordering during training. The paper systematically categorizes Graph CL methods into node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks, and further divides them into predefined and automatic curriculum learning approaches. Through detailed analysis of representative methods including CLNode, GNN-CL, MentorGNN, and others, the survey identifies key challenges specific to graph data and outlines future research directions for the field.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys Graph CL methods that combine graph machine learning with curriculum learning principles, using difficulty measurers to score data samples and training schedulers to arrange samples in meaningful order. Methods are divided into predefined approaches using heuristic-based policies and automatic approaches using computable metrics. The survey covers representative methods across three task granularities: node-level (CLNode, GNN-CL), link-level (GCN-WSRS), and graph-level (TUNEUP, CurGraph). The paper identifies challenges including the uniqueness of graph data, complexity of method design, and diversity of tasks, while calling for theoretical guarantees, principled methods, and comprehensive evaluation protocols.

## Key Results
- Graph CL methods improve model performance by organizing training samples from easy to hard, mimicking human learning principles
- Three task granularity categories (node-level, link-level, graph-level) provide a systematic framework for organizing Graph CL methods
- Major challenges include handling graph data's non-Euclidean nature, designing effective difficulty metrics, and achieving generalization across different graph tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Curriculum graph learning improves model performance by organizing training samples from easy to hard, aligning with human learning principles.
- Mechanism: The method orders graph data samples based on difficulty metrics (e.g., label distribution, node degree, Laplacian perturbation) and feeds them sequentially to the model during training.
- Core assumption: Graph data samples have varying difficulty levels that can be measured and that ordering them improves learning efficiency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "curriculum learning (CL) is proposed to mimic human's learning process, and has been proved to be effective in boosting the model performances"
  - [section 2.2] "Curriculum learning (CL), which mimics the human's learning process of learning data samples in a meaningful order, aims to enhance the machine learning models by using designed training curriculum"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related papers but no direct evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If difficulty metrics cannot accurately differentiate sample difficulty, or if random ordering performs equally well.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automatic curriculum learning dynamically adapts to model training status by using model feedback (e.g., loss, attention weights) to adjust sample difficulty.
- Mechanism: Methods like MentorGNN use a teacher model to reweight graph signals based on the student model's performance, creating a feedback loop that adjusts the curriculum during training.
- Core assumption: Model performance feedback can reliably indicate sample difficulty and guide curriculum adjustment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "MentorGNN derives a curriculum for pre-training GNNs to learn informative node representations... a teacher model that is a graph signal reweighting scheme gradually generates a domain-adaptive curriculum"
  - [section 4.2] "The difficulty of training samples is measured by the teacher model and the training process is scheduled by the introduced learning threshold"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention curriculum learning but don't provide direct evidence for this specific feedback mechanism
- Break condition: If the feedback signal becomes unstable or noisy, leading to oscillating curriculum adjustments.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph-specific difficulty metrics account for the non-Euclidean nature and complex dependencies in graph data, making curriculum learning more effective than in Euclidean data domains.
- Mechanism: Methods like CLNode use multi-perspective difficulty measures considering local label distribution and global feature patterns specific to graph topology.
- Core assumption: The unique properties of graph data (non-Euclidean space, complex relationships) require specialized difficulty metrics different from image/text domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "graph data lies in a non-Euclidean space. Besides, there exist complex relationships and dependencies between entities in graphs"
  - [section 3] "To tackle the non-trivial challenges introduced in Section 2... integrate the strengths of graph machine learning and curriculum learning, and further propose tailored methods"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work but no direct evidence for graph-specific metric effectiveness
- Break condition: If graph-agnostic difficulty metrics perform equally well, suggesting the non-Euclidean nature doesn't significantly impact curriculum effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and message passing
  - Why needed here: The survey focuses on curriculum learning applied to GNNs, so understanding GNN fundamentals is essential
  - Quick check question: How does the message passing function in equation (1) aggregate neighbor information?

- Concept: Curriculum learning vs. standard training
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts curriculum learning with random data ordering, requiring understanding of both approaches
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between predefined and automatic curriculum learning strategies?

- Concept: Graph task granularity (node-level, link-level, graph-level)
  - Why needed here: The survey categorizes methods based on task granularity, so understanding these distinctions is crucial
  - Quick check question: How do the representation learning objectives differ between node-level and graph-level tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Difficulty measurer → Training scheduler → Graph model backbone → Data pipeline → Performance evaluation
- Critical path: Difficulty measurement → Sample ordering → Model training → Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Predefined vs. automatic difficulty measurement (expert knowledge vs. model feedback)
  - Discrete vs. continuous scheduling (computational efficiency vs. adaptability)
  - Task-specific vs. general curriculum strategies (performance vs. applicability)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on simple datasets (curriculum too complex)
  - Slow convergence (difficulty metrics not well-calibrated)
  - Unstable training (automatic scheduler overreacting to noise)
  - No improvement over random ordering (difficulty measurement ineffective)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement CLNode on Cora dataset comparing with random ordering baseline
  2. Test MentorGNN on graph transfer learning task with varying curriculum types
  3. Evaluate GCN-WSRS on link prediction with different negative sampling curricula

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can theoretical guarantees be established for curriculum graph machine learning to better understand its optimization and effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly calls for developing theoretical analysis on graph CL, inspired by general curriculum learning, to understand the mechanism and effectiveness of graph CL methods.
- Why unresolved: Most existing graph CL methods lack fundamental theoretical analysis, relying instead on empirical evaluations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs or theoretical bounds demonstrating convergence guarantees or performance improvements specific to graph CL methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can graph CL methods be designed to handle distribution shifts between training and testing graph data for better generalization and transferability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that most graph CL methods are overly dependent on graph labels and lack generalization and transferability, especially when distribution shifts occur.
- Why unresolved: Current methods do not adequately address scenarios where testing data distribution differs from training data, leading to performance drops.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing improved performance on out-of-distribution graph data or reduced performance drops when distribution shifts occur.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What comprehensive evaluation protocols and benchmarks are needed to fairly compare different graph CL methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for developing unified benchmarks with unified metrics to evaluate and compare different graph CL methods, incorporating datasets with different hardness and evaluation metrics.
- Why unresolved: Existing works use varied datasets and evaluation metrics, making it difficult to compare methods fairly.
- What evidence would resolve it: A standardized benchmark suite with consistent evaluation metrics that demonstrates clear performance differences between graph CL methods.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of graph-specific difficulty metrics over domain-agnostic approaches
- Lack of comprehensive comparison of computational overhead across different curriculum learning strategies
- No original experimental validation of the claimed mechanisms - relies primarily on secondary sources

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The categorization framework for Graph CL methods (node-level, link-level, graph-level tasks) is well-supported by existing literature and provides a logical organizational structure.
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed benefits of curriculum learning for graph neural networks are supported by theoretical arguments and some empirical results, but comprehensive ablation studies validating each mechanism are missing.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that graph-specific difficulty metrics are fundamentally superior to generic metrics lacks direct comparative evidence in the survey.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing graph-specific difficulty metrics (like CLNode) against generic metrics across multiple benchmark datasets to quantify performance differences.
2. Implement ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each curriculum learning component (difficulty measurement, scheduling strategy, feedback mechanism) to overall performance gains.
3. Perform computational complexity analysis comparing predefined versus automatic curriculum learning approaches on graphs of varying sizes to identify scalability bottlenecks.
