# Explainable AI for Earth Observation: Current Methods, Open Challenges, and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04491
- Reference count: 31
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of XAI methods for remote sensing organized by application areas rather than techniques

## Executive Summary
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods in remote sensing, organized by application areas rather than XAI techniques. The authors survey post-hoc interpretability methods like LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM that are widely used in remote sensing tasks including pixel/scene classification, environmental monitoring, object detection, and data fusion. They highlight that while deep learning has revolutionized remote sensing analysis, its "black-box" nature necessitates XAI approaches for building trust, validating results, and improving decision-making. The chapter notes that current XAI applications in remote sensing are mostly direct applications of computer vision methods with limited adaptation to remote sensing data's unique characteristics.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a survey of XAI methods specifically for Earth observation applications, organizing the content according to remote sensing application areas rather than XAI methodologies. The approach focuses on post-hoc interpretability techniques including LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, and CAM methods applied to various remote sensing tasks such as classification, object detection, unmixing, and data fusion. The survey examines how these methods are currently implemented in remote sensing contexts and identifies gaps between computer vision applications and the unique characteristics of remote sensing data.

## Key Results
- Post-hoc interpretability techniques dominate remote sensing XAI applications due to their compatibility with existing deep learning models
- Current XAI methods in remote sensing are primarily direct applications of computer vision techniques without adequate adaptation to remote sensing data characteristics
- The chapter predicts increasing interest in XAI for remote sensing with more elaborate adaptations and novel approaches needed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Organizing XAI methods by remote sensing application areas improves usability for Earth observation researchers compared to organizing by XAI technique.
- Mechanism: Researchers in remote sensing typically think in terms of their specific application tasks (classification, detection, fusion) rather than abstract XAI techniques. By mapping methods to applications, the chapter provides a direct reference for practitioners to find relevant XAI approaches without needing to translate from general computer vision contexts.
- Core assumption: Remote sensing researchers prioritize application-specific relevance over methodological breadth when seeking XAI solutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "organized according to prominent Earth observation application fields"
  - [section] "the present work differentiates itself as it has been prepared specifically towards the remote sensing audience through a careful content organization that has been structured not according to XAI methodologies but instead according to primary remote sensing application areas"
- Break Condition: If remote sensing researchers predominantly seek XAI methods by technique type rather than application area, this organization would become less useful.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Post-hoc interpretability techniques are currently dominant in remote sensing applications because they can be applied to existing black-box models without requiring model redesign.
- Mechanism: Remote sensing has widely adopted deep learning models that are inherently black-box. Post-hoc methods like Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME allow practitioners to add interpretability to these models after training, making them practical solutions that don't require abandoning
