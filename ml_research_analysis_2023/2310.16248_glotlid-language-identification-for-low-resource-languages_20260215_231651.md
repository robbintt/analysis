# GlotLID: Language Identification for Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16248
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GlotLID-M achieves F1 score of 0.77 and FPR of 0.0006 on UDHR, outperforming four baselines for low-resource language identification

## Executive Summary
GlotLID-M is a language identification model covering 1665 low-resource languages using FastText architecture trained on a diverse corpus spanning 1832 languages. It addresses the critical need for reliable LID tools in low-resource language corpora creation through broad coverage, uncertainty assessment, and efficiency. The model outperforms four baselines (CLD3, FT176, OpenLID, and NLLB) on UDHR benchmark with strong performance on both low-resource and high-resource dominated datasets like FLORES-200.

## Method Summary
GlotLID-M uses FastText with character n-gram embeddings (n=2 to 5) trained on GlotLID-C corpus containing 289 million sentences across 1832 languages. The training employs temperature-based upsampling (T=0.3) for low-resource languages to address class imbalance. The model incorporates confidence thresholding for uncertainty assessment, returning "undetermined" when predictions fall below a probability threshold. Macrolanguages are handled through language label consolidation. Evaluation uses multiple benchmarks including GlotLID-C test set, FLORES-200, and UDHR with F1 score and false positive rate metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 score of 0.77 and FPR of 0.0006 on UDHR benchmark for low-resource languages
- Performs well on FLORES-200 with F1 of 0.92 and FPR of 0.001, despite high-resource language dominance
- Outperforms four baseline models (CLD3, FT176, OpenLID, NLLB) across evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FastText's n-gram character embeddings enable effective language identification even for low-resource languages with limited training data.
- Mechanism: By representing words as bags of character n-grams, FastText captures subword patterns that are shared across related languages while remaining discriminative enough to distinguish between them. This is particularly valuable for low-resource languages where individual word embeddings would be poorly estimated.
- Core assumption: Character n-gram distributions are sufficiently distinctive across languages and stable enough to generalize from limited examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GlotLID-M uses a FastText architecture trained on a diverse corpus (GlotLID-C) spanning 1832 languages"
  - [section]: "FastText provides an open-source codebase for training, which supports customization and extension of GlotLID-M"
- Break condition: If languages share highly similar n-gram distributions (e.g., closely related dialects with minimal orthographic differences), the model may struggle to distinguish them.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temperature-based upsampling of low-resource languages in training data addresses class imbalance and improves model performance on underrepresented languages.
- Mechanism: By sampling sentences from low-resource languages proportionally to p^(1/T)/T where T is temperature (set to 0.3), the model sees more examples from underrepresented languages during training, preventing them from being overshadowed by high-resource languages.
- Core assumption: Low-resource languages benefit more from increased representation in training data than they suffer from potential overfitting on limited examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Following Arivazhagan et al. (2019), NLLB Team et al. (2022) and Burchell et al. (2023), we perform up-sampling for low resource languages"
  - [corpus]: "GlotLID-C comprises 289 million sentences (i.e., lines of data) totaling 40GB and spans 1832 languages"
- Break condition: If the minimum amount of training data per language is too small (less than 30-40 sentences), even temperature-based upsampling cannot produce reliable representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Confidence thresholding allows selective filtering of uncertain predictions, reducing false positives in low-resource language identification.
- Mechanism: By setting a probability threshold θ (e.g., 0.5), the model only assigns a language label when sufficiently confident, otherwise returning "undetermined". This is particularly effective for low-resource languages where the model may be uncertain due to limited training data.
- Core assumption: The confidence scores produced by the FastText classifier are well-calibrated and meaningful for decision-making.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GlotLID-M's broad coverage, uncertainty assessment, and efficiency make it a valuable tool for improving the quality of low-resource language corpora"
  - [section]: "FastText meets the requirement of uncertainty assessment because it provides confidence scores that can serve as thresholds to effectively mitigate noise in the data"
- Break condition: If the calibration of confidence scores is poor (as noted in §F for some low-confidence cases), thresholding may discard too many correct predictions or retain too many incorrect ones.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Character n-gram representation in text classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding how FastText represents text as character n-grams is crucial for understanding why it works well for low-resource languages and how to potentially extend or modify it
  - Quick check question: How does representing words as character n-grams help when dealing with morphologically rich languages or languages with limited training data?

- Concept: Temperature-based sampling in imbalanced datasets
  - Why needed here: The upsampling strategy used to balance the training data across languages is key to understanding the model's performance on low-resource languages
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between temperature T and the sampling probability p^(1/T)/T, and why does a lower temperature (0.3) help low-resource languages?

- Concept: Confidence calibration in probabilistic classifiers
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of confidence thresholding depends on whether the classifier's probability estimates are well-calibrated
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a classifier to be "well-calibrated," and why is this important for setting confidence thresholds in LID?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GlotLID-C corpus → preprocessing (script validation, deduplication) → train/test split → FastText classifier with character n-gram embeddings (n=2 to 5) → Temperature-based upsampling → Confidence thresholding → Evaluation on benchmarks

- Critical path: Corpus curation → Model training with upsampling → Confidence threshold tuning → Evaluation on benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - FastText vs transformer: FastText is more efficient but may miss long-range dependencies; transformers are more expressive but computationally expensive
  - Number of languages: Including more languages increases coverage but may reduce performance on individual languages due to data dilution
  - Confidence threshold: Higher thresholds reduce false positives but increase false negatives; lower thresholds do the opposite

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on closely related languages suggests insufficient discriminative power in character n-grams
  - Degradation on low-resource languages suggests insufficient training data despite upsampling
  - Poor calibration of confidence scores suggests the threshold mechanism won't work effectively

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate model performance on a held-out subset of languages with varying amounts of training data to identify the minimum effective training size
  2. Test different temperature values (e.g., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) to find the optimal balance between low-resource and high-resource language performance
  3. Implement and test different confidence threshold strategies (fixed threshold vs. adaptive threshold based on language frequency) on the validation set
