# Towards LogiGLUE: A Brief Survey and A Benchmark for Analyzing Logical Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00836
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00836
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Language models excel most at abductive reasoning, followed by deductive reasoning, while performing least effectively on inductive reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of logical reasoning in language models by providing a comprehensive survey of recent progress and creating a new benchmark, LogiGLUE. The benchmark consists of 24 diverse datasets spanning deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning tasks. The authors standardize these datasets into a unified Seq2Seq format and train an instruction fine-tuned language model, LogiT5, using single-task, multi-task, and chain-of-thought knowledge distillation approaches. They evaluate LogiT5 and other LLMs on LogiGLUE, finding that LLMs show varying proficiency across different reasoning types, with abductive reasoning being the strongest.

## Method Summary
The authors created LogiGLUE by standardizing 24 existing logical reasoning datasets into a unified Seq2Seq format. They trained LogiT5, a fine-tuned version of Flan-T5-large, using three approaches: single-task training on individual datasets, multi-task training across all datasets, and chain-of-thought knowledge distillation from larger models. The training used weighted sampling to handle dataset size imbalances. The benchmark was evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, with performance measured across the three reasoning types.

## Key Results
- LLMs excel most at abductive reasoning, followed by deductive reasoning, while performing least effectively on inductive reasoning
- Multi-task training significantly improves performance on low-resource datasets (5-8% gains on αARCT and FOLIO) while maintaining performance on high-resource tasks
- Chain-of-thought knowledge distillation with 15K samples improved LogiQA performance by 4%, while smaller datasets (3K, 6K) showed no improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LogiGLUE's standardized Seq2Seq format enables better model performance and easier dataset integration compared to heterogeneous task formats.
- Mechanism: By converting diverse logical reasoning tasks into a unified Seq2Seq format, the benchmark eliminates format-specific architectural constraints and allows models like LogiT5 to learn cross-task reasoning patterns more effectively.
- Core assumption: The Seq2Seq format preserves task semantics while being flexible enough for different reasoning types.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We have standardized these datasets into Seq2Seq tasks to facilitate straightforward training and evaluation for future research." [section] "We convert them into a singular format... ensures consistency in the input, ruling out performance disparities arising from different inputs."
- Break condition: If the conversion process introduces task-specific artifacts or loses critical information needed for certain reasoning types, the unified format could degrade performance on specialized tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task training on LogiGLUE improves performance on low-resource datasets through knowledge transfer while maintaining performance on high-resource tasks.
- Mechanism: Training LogiT5 on multiple datasets simultaneously allows it to learn general logical reasoning patterns that benefit smaller datasets, while larger datasets already provide sufficient signal for optimal performance.
- Core assumption: Logical reasoning skills transfer across different task types and domains within the benchmark.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "One benefit of multi-task training compared to the single task training is that the low resources data can benefit from other tasks... it showcases higher proficiency compared to its single-task counterpart, notably performing better by 5% and 8% on the αARCT and FOLIO tasks, respectively." [section] "The tasks with large training set did not reap any benefits from multi-task training, such as αNLI and ANLI datasets."
- Break condition: If logical reasoning skills are highly domain-specific rather than transferable, multi-task training could lead to interference and degraded performance across tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Chain-of-thought knowledge distillation from larger models to Flan-T5 improves logical reasoning performance by providing explicit reasoning traces.
- Mechanism: Distilling CoT from Llama-7B to Flan-T5 provides the smaller model with step-by-step reasoning examples that guide it toward correct logical inferences rather than relying solely on pattern matching.
- Core assumption: The larger model's reasoning traces capture generalizable logical patterns rather than task-specific heuristics.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "We apply such a CoT fine-tuning strategy and conduct experiments on LogiQA... we observe that the model performance increase when the number of epoch increase." [section] "an increased dataset size of 15K samples facilitated a 4% improvement in performance, suggesting that CoT distillation becomes more beneficial with a larger volume of data."
- Break condition: If the distilled CoT traces contain errors or are task-specific rather than generalizable, the student model may learn incorrect reasoning patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logical reasoning types (deductive, inductive, abductive)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the three reasoning types is essential for interpreting LogiGLUE's task design and evaluating model performance across different reasoning paradigms.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes deductive reasoning from inductive reasoning in terms of certainty of conclusions?

- Concept: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) systems vs. language model approaches
  - Why needed here: Provides historical context for why LLMs represent a paradigm shift in logical reasoning and helps understand the limitations of previous approaches.
  - Quick check question: What were the main limitations of KR systems that LLMs help overcome?

- Concept: Multi-task learning principles and knowledge transfer
  - Why needed here: Critical for understanding why LogiT5's multi-task training strategy is expected to improve performance on low-resource datasets.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions does multi-task learning typically improve model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LogiGLUE benchmark (24 datasets) → LogiT5 model (Flan-T5-large fine-tuned) → Evaluation pipeline (in-domain and out-of-domain testing)
- Critical path: Dataset standardization → Multi-task training → CoT distillation (optional) → Evaluation across reasoning types
- Design tradeoffs: Unified Seq2Seq format simplifies training but may lose task-specific advantages; multi-task training improves low-resource performance but risks interference; CoT distillation adds complexity but provides reasoning guidance
- Failure signatures: Poor generalization to out-of-domain datasets suggests over-fitting to in-domain patterns; inconsistent performance across reasoning types may indicate format conversion issues; degraded performance on high-resource tasks after multi-task training suggests negative transfer
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune Flan-T5 on individual LogiGLUE datasets to establish single-task baselines
  2. Train LogiT5 using multi-task learning with weighted sampling across all in-domain datasets
  3. Apply CoT distillation from Llama-7B to Flan-T5 using LogiQA and evaluate performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do language models show superior performance on abductive reasoning compared to deductive reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that LLMs excel most in abductive reasoning, followed by deductive reasoning, while performing least effectively on inductive reasoning. They observe that the αNLI dataset (abductive) yielded better results than the ANLI dataset (deductive), despite similar training sizes.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this might be due to differences in context length or other factors, but doesn't provide a definitive explanation for this performance difference.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies comparing model performance on abductive vs deductive tasks with controlled variables like context length, complexity, and dataset size would help determine the root cause.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal size threshold for datasets where multi-task training becomes beneficial for logical reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that multi-task training significantly benefits tasks with small training sets (like αARCT and FOLIO), but provides no benefit for tasks with large training sets (like αNLI and ANLI). However, they don't specify the exact threshold.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a binary observation (small vs large datasets) without quantifying what constitutes "small" or "large" in terms of training sample count.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying training set sizes across a range of logical reasoning tasks would help identify the precise threshold where multi-task training transitions from beneficial to unnecessary.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the observed improvement from chain-of-thought knowledge distillation scale with the size of the distilled dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors find that CoT fine-tuning with 15K samples improves performance by 4% on the LogiQA dataset, while 3K and 6K samples show no improvement. However, they don't test whether even larger datasets would yield further improvements.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests three dataset sizes (3K, 6K, 15K) and doesn't explore whether the improvement continues to scale beyond 15K samples.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training with increasingly larger CoT datasets (e.g., 30K, 60K, 100K samples) and measuring performance improvements would reveal whether there's a saturation point or if benefits continue to accrue.

## Limitations

- The reliance on dataset conversion to a unified Seq2Seq format may introduce task-specific artifacts that affect reasoning performance
- The effectiveness of chain-of-knowledge distillation is uncertain, as the quality and generalizability of reasoning traces from larger models to smaller ones is not thoroughly validated
- The study's focus on English datasets limits its applicability to multilingual reasoning contexts

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The comparative performance ranking of reasoning types (abductive > deductive > inductive) is well-supported by the experimental results across multiple datasets and models
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of multi-task training for low-resource datasets is demonstrated, but the mechanism for knowledge transfer and its generalizability across different reasoning domains requires further investigation
- Low Confidence: The claim that CoT distillation significantly improves logical reasoning performance is based on limited experiments and may be dataset-dependent rather than representing a generalizable improvement

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing model performance on original vs. converted task formats to quantify any information loss or artifact introduction during standardization

2. Evaluate LogiT5 on completely out-of-domain logical reasoning datasets not included in LogiGLUE to assess true generalization beyond the benchmark's scope

3. Perform systematic evaluation of distilled CoT traces for logical validity and consistency, including human evaluation of reasoning quality across different task types
