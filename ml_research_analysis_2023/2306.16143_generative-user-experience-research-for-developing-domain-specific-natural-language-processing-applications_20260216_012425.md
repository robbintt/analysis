# Generative User-Experience Research for Developing Domain-specific Natural Language Processing Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.16143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16143
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: A methodology for integrating generative UX research into developing domain-specific NLP applications, demonstrated through a semantic search prototype for process industry operations

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a methodology for developing domain-specific NLP applications by integrating generative UX research throughout the development cycle. The approach emphasizes early involvement of domain experts through contextual inquiries and concept evaluations, creating applications that directly address user needs and workflows. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study developing a semantic search prototype for process industry operations, which outperforms traditional keyword search methods by 3-10 times in accuracy metrics.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines data-driven NLP approaches with user-driven generative UX research, involving domain experts from concept ideation through prototype evaluation. The process begins with contextual inquiries to understand user workflows and pain points, followed by concept evaluation using Wizard of Oz prototyping. The prototype phase employs simple but robust NLP techniques (fastText embeddings, context expansion) to demonstrate the concept quickly. The methodology concludes with user value evaluation comparing pre and post-implementation assessments, ensuring the final application meets identified needs while maintaining technical feasibility.

## Key Results
- Prototype outperforms BM25 and keyword search baselines by 3-10 times in precision, mAP, and nDCG metrics
- Involving domain experts in early stages increases their trust and interest in the final NLP application
- The synergy between UX and NLP research reveals opportunities and constraints not visible through either discipline alone
- Simple NLP methods (fastText embeddings) combined with UX insights can create high-value applications without cutting-edge techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Involving domain experts early increases their trust in the final NLP application.
- Mechanism: Generative UX research captures users' stories, pain points, and needs during ideation, which informs prototype development to directly address those needs. This creates a sense of ownership and relevance for the users.
- Core assumption: Domain users will recognize their input in the final prototype and perceive it as more valuable and trustworthy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A key finding of our case study is that involving domain experts increases their interest and trust in the final NLP application."
  - [section 7]: "The core idea of generative research is that involving domain users increases their interest and trust in the final application since the application addresses their needs."
- Break condition: If user input is collected but not meaningfully incorporated into the prototype, or if the prototype fails to address the identified pain points.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining UX and NLP research reveals opportunities and constraints that neither discipline alone would uncover.
- Mechanism: UX research identifies user needs and workflow patterns, while NLP research evaluates data quality and technical feasibility. Together, they inform a prototype that is both technically viable and user-centered.
- Core assumption: The intersection of user needs and data capabilities is where the most impactful solutions lie.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7]: "The synergy reveals opportunities and constraints of the data- and user-driven nature through exploratory data analysis and contextual inquiries."
  - [section 3]: "The methodology combines both data- and user-driven approaches that correspondingly come from ML/NLP and UX research."
- Break condition: If either UX or NLP insights are ignored during development, leading to a solution that is either technically unfeasible or fails to meet user needs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prototyping with simple, robust methods can still yield high user value if the method addresses the core user need.
- Mechanism: The prototype uses fastText embeddings and context expansion to handle domain-specific language, which is sufficient to demonstrate the value of semantic search without requiring cutting-edge NLP techniques.
- Core assumption: Users value the functionality (semantic search) more than the sophistication of the underlying NLP model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3]: "For the prototype phase, we follow a UX principle 'fail fast, fail often' and start with simpler techniques that require less time and resources."
  - [section 6.1]: "Our prototype outperforms all baselines, e.g., BM25, by 3-10 times in various metrics."
- Break condition: If the prototype's performance is too poor to demonstrate the value of the concept, or if users perceive the method as inadequate.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contextual inquiries
  - Why needed here: They are a key method in generative UX research to understand how domain users interact with existing systems and identify their pain points.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main objectives of the contextual inquiries described in Section 4.2?

- Concept: Domain-specific language challenges
  - Why needed here: Understanding the unique characteristics of the domain language (e.g., abbreviations, IDs, chemical formulas) is crucial for developing an effective NLP solution.
  - Quick check question: What two significant signs of domain language were observed in the qualitative analysis (Section 4.1)?

- Concept: Semantic search vs. keyword search
  - Why needed here: The prototype aims to provide more effective access to information by understanding the meaning of queries, not just matching keywords.
  - Quick check question: How does the prototype's ranking mechanism (harmonic mean of document and term similarities) differ from a simple keyword search?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - SQL database (data source)
  - Preprocessing pipeline (context expansion, text normalization)
  - FastText word embeddings (semantic representation)
  - Boolean/TF-IDF representations (exact match)
  - Search index (storage)
  - Retrieval and ranking engine (semantic search + exact match + ranking)
  - User interface (frontend)

- Critical path:
  1. User submits query
  2. Query is preprocessed and vectorized
  3. Boolean search retrieves candidate documents
  4. Semantic similarity scores documents
  5. Documents are ranked using harmonic mean
  6. Top results are returned to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using fastText instead of transformer models for speed and robustness vs. potentially lower accuracy on complex queries
  - Context expansion for handling IDs vs. manual effort to create dictionaries
  - Linear search for simplicity vs. scalability for large datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision@k metrics indicate poor semantic understanding or irrelevant results
  - User feedback indicates the search doesn't match their mental model of the domain
  - Context expansion fails to handle new IDs not in the dictionary

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of context expansion on baseline keyword search vs. BM25
  2. Test the prototype's performance on a diverse set of query topics from the domain
  3. Conduct a user study to compare the prototype's effectiveness against the old keyword search method

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can generative UX research be systematically integrated into the full-cycle development of domain-specific NLP applications to improve both accuracy and user value?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a methodology combining generative UX research with NLP development, emphasizing user involvement from concept ideation to prototype evaluation.
- Why unresolved: While the methodology is proposed and tested in a case study, its broader applicability and effectiveness across diverse NLP domains and user contexts remain to be validated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful replication of the methodology in multiple NLP domains with varying user groups, demonstrating consistent improvements in both model accuracy and user satisfaction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal strategies for balancing data-driven and user-driven approaches in the development of domain-specific NLP applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of combining data-driven (exploratory data analysis) and user-driven (generative UX research) approaches for concept creation and prototype development.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a clear framework for determining the appropriate balance between these approaches in different development scenarios, nor does it explore the trade-offs involved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance and user acceptance of NLP applications developed using varying degrees of data-driven and user-driven approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the accuracy of semantic search systems for domain-specific languages be improved, particularly in handling out-of-vocabulary terms and complex query semantics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies challenges in representing domain-specific language and proposes solutions like fastText word embeddings and context expansion, but acknowledges room for improvement in phrase-level semantics.
- Why unresolved: The prototype evaluation shows limitations in handling complex queries and retrieving documents based on phrase-level semantics, indicating the need for more advanced techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of novel semantic search methods that effectively handle out-of-vocabulary terms and complex query semantics in domain-specific languages, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to the proposed approach.

## Limitations
- The methodology relies on qualitative user feedback which may not generalize beyond the specific process industry domain studied
- The prototype evaluation involved only 3 domain experts, limiting statistical power and representativeness
- The "fail fast, fail often" approach using simple NLP methods may not scale to more complex domain requirements
- No comparison of development time or resource requirements between this methodology and traditional NLP development approaches

## Confidence
- High confidence: The effectiveness of contextual inquiries for identifying user needs and the basic semantic search architecture
- Medium confidence: The claim that involving domain experts increases their trust in the final application (based on 3 expert evaluations)
- Medium confidence: The assertion that the synergy between UX and NLP research reveals unique opportunities (limited to one case study)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the methodology with a larger sample of domain experts across multiple organizations to verify generalizability of user trust and value findings
2. Compare development timelines and resource requirements between this integrated UX-NLP approach and traditional NLP development methods
3. Test the prototype with more complex query types and larger datasets to evaluate scalability and robustness of the simple fastText-based approach
