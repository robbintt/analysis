# Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.13165
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13165
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of multimodal large language models covering knowledge representation, learning objectives, model construction, information fusion, and prompt usage

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), tracing their evolution from single-modality models in the 1980s through four distinct stages to the current era of large-scale multimodal systems. The paper systematically covers the technical aspects of MLLMs including knowledge representation, learning objectives, model structure construction, information fusion, and prompt usage. It reviews various algorithms, datasets, and applications across domains such as image captioning, text-to-image generation, sign language recognition, and emotion recognition. The survey also identifies key challenges in the field including modalities expansion, training time optimization, and lifelong learning, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research on multimodal large language models through a comprehensive literature review, organizing technical content around five key aspects: knowledge representation (tokenization and embedding of different modalities), learning objectives (contrastive learning, masked modeling, etc.), model structure construction (architecture design), information fusion (methods for combining modalities), and prompt usage. The survey draws from 40 references spanning the evolution of multimodal research and presents practical guidance for implementing MLLMs while identifying open challenges and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Multimodal models integrate diverse data types to overcome limitations of text-only LLMs by combining information from images, text, audio, and other modalities
- The evolution of multimodal research has progressed through four distinct stages: single-modality, modality conversion, fusion, and large-scale multimodal models
- Technical aspects such as knowledge representation, learning objectives, and information fusion are crucial for effective multimodal model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal models integrate diverse data types to overcome the limitations of pure text-based LLMs.
- Mechanism: By combining information from images, text, audio, and other modalities, these models can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and perform better on tasks that require cross-modal reasoning.
- Core assumption: Different modalities provide complementary information that, when combined, lead to better performance than any single modality alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While the latest large language models excel in text-based tasks, they often struggle to understand and process other data types. Multimodal models address this limitation by combining various modalities, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of diverse data."
  - [section] "Multimodal perception is a fundamental component for achieving general artificial intelligence, as it is crucial for knowledge acquisition and interaction with the real world."
- Break condition: If the modalities are not properly aligned or if the model fails to effectively fuse information from different sources, the benefits of multimodality may not be realized.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The evolution of multimodal research has progressed through four distinct stages, each building upon the previous one.
- Mechanism: Starting from single-modality models in the 1980s, the field has evolved to include modality conversion, fusion, and large-scale multimodal models. Each stage introduced new techniques and capabilities that expanded the scope of multimodal learning.
- Core assumption: Technological advancements and increased computational power have enabled the progression through these stages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "During the evolution of multimodal research, four distinct stages can be identified, as shown in Fig.2."
  - [section] "In recent years, the development of multimodal models has showcased additional application possibilities."
- Break condition: If the rate of technological progress slows down or if there are fundamental limitations in multimodal learning that cannot be overcome, the evolution of the field may stagnate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The technical aspects of multimodal models, such as knowledge representation, learning objectives, and information fusion, are crucial for their performance.
- Mechanism: Proper handling of these technical aspects ensures that the model can effectively process and integrate information from different modalities, leading to better overall performance.
- Core assumption: The choice of technical components and their implementation significantly impacts the model's ability to learn and reason across modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The technical points of multimodal large models include, but are not limited to, knowledge representation, learning objective selection, model structure construction, information fusion, and the usage of prompts, as shown in Fig. 3."
  - [section] "Using different learning objectives in combination can enhance the performance of multimodal models."
- Break condition: If the technical aspects are not well-designed or if there are fundamental limitations in the chosen approach, the model's performance may suffer.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge representation -> Learning objectives -> Model structure construction -> Information fusion -> Prompt usage
- Critical path: Data selection -> Model architecture design -> Learning objective choice -> Training/fine-tuning -> Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs computational efficiency vs performance; choice of fusion method (early vs late vs hybrid) affects both performance and resource requirements
- Failure signatures: Poor alignment between modalities, ineffective information fusion, overfitting to specific tasks, catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a basic multimodal model on a simple dataset (e.g., COCO for image captioning) to verify that the core components are functioning correctly
  2. Test the model's performance on a more complex task (e.g., visual question answering) to identify any limitations or areas for improvement
  3. Evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new tasks and datasets to assess its versatility and robustness
