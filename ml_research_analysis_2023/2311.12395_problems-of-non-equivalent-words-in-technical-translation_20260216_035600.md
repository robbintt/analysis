# Problems of Non-equivalent Words in Technical Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12395
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12395
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Examines challenges in translating non-equivalent words between English and Russian in technical translation

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the complexities of translating non-equivalent words in technical translation between English and Russian. The author identifies that non-equivalence occurs when concepts, terms, or semantic distinctions in the source language lack direct equivalents in the target language, particularly for culture-specific concepts and semantically complex words. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding different types of non-equivalence and proposes systematic strategies for translators to address these challenges, including cultural substitution, paraphrasing, and using loan words with explanations.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical analysis of non-equivalent words in technical translation, examining the challenges that arise when source language concepts lack direct equivalents in the target language. The author analyzes common problems of non-equivalence at word level, including culture-specific concepts, semantically complex words, and differences in meaning distinctions between languages. While no computational methods or empirical experiments are conducted, the study identifies and classifies strategies for dealing with non-equivalence based on existing translation theory and provides illustrative examples from English-Russian translation contexts.

## Key Results
- Non-equivalent words create translation challenges due to cultural and semantic differences between languages
- Three main types of non-equivalent vocabulary identified: culture-specific concepts, semantically complex words, and meaning distinction differences
- Systematic strategies proposed for handling non-equivalence include superordinate translation, cultural substitution, paraphrasing, and loan words with explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Non-equivalent words create translation challenges because target languages may lack direct lexical equivalents for source language concepts, particularly for culture-specific or semantically complex terms.
- Mechanism: When a source language contains words expressing concepts unknown or not lexicalized in the target language, translators must employ strategies like cultural substitution, paraphrasing, or using loan words with explanations to convey meaning.
- Core assumption: Cultural and semantic differences between languages create systematic gaps in vocabulary equivalence that require strategic handling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "translating words which do not have equivalent in target language is not easy and finding proper equivalent of those words are very important"
  - [section] "Non-equivalence occurs when the message in the source language is not transferred equally to the target language"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on technical translation methods but don't directly address cultural non-equivalence mechanisms
- Break condition: When source and target languages share sufficient cultural context or when standardized technical terminology exists across languages

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different languages make different distinctions in meaning, creating non-equivalence even when concepts exist in both cultures but are categorized differently.
- Mechanism: Translators must recognize that one language may make more or fewer distinctions in meaning than another, requiring careful analysis of semantic fields and appropriate mapping strategies.
- Core assumption: Languages inherently categorize concepts differently based on cultural and linguistic evolution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Source and Target Languages Make Different Distinctions in Meaning: What one language regards as an important distinction in meaning another language may not perceive as relevant"
  - [abstract] "differences in meaning distinctions between languages"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus focuses on technical terminology translation rather than semantic distinction differences
- Break condition: When semantic distinctions are universal or when standardized international terminology bridges linguistic differences

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-equivalence at word level requires systematic translation strategies that can be classified and applied based on the type of non-equivalence encountered.
- Mechanism: Translators can use classification systems (like Ivanov's three-group division) to identify the type of non-equivalence and apply appropriate strategies such as superordinate translation, cultural substitution, or paraphrasing.
- Core assumption: Non-equivalence types are predictable and can be systematically addressed with established translation strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Classification of non-equivalent vocabulary can be conducted by genetic trait" and detailed classification system provided
  - [section] "Strategies used for dealing with non-equivalence at word level in technical translation are translation by more general word (superordinate); translating by more neutral/less expressive word; translating by cultural substitution..."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus neighbors discuss translation workflows but not systematic classification approaches
- Break condition: When non-equivalence is too context-specific to fit classification systems or when creative solutions are required beyond established strategies

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural context in translation
  - Why needed here: Technical translation often involves culture-specific concepts that don't have direct equivalents, requiring understanding of both source and target cultural frameworks
  - Quick check question: How would you translate a culture-specific food item that has no equivalent in the target language?

- Concept: Semantic field analysis
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different languages categorize and distinguish meanings helps identify non-equivalence types and select appropriate translation strategies
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in how English and Russian categorize family relationships linguistically?

- Concept: Translation strategy classification
  - Why needed here: Different types of non-equivalence require different approaches, and knowing the classification system helps translators select appropriate methods systematically
  - Quick check question: When would you choose cultural substitution over paraphrasing as a translation strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source text → Non-equivalence identification → Strategy selection → Translation implementation → Quality verification → Final output
- Critical path: Source text → Non-equivalence identification → Strategy selection → Translation implementation → Quality verification → Final output
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing literal accuracy with cultural appropriateness, choosing between preserving source language nuances versus ensuring target language comprehension, and deciding when to use loan words versus explanations.
- Failure signatures: Misinterpretation of cultural context, loss of semantic precision, awkward or unnatural target language output, failure to recognize non-equivalence types, inappropriate strategy selection.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test translation of culture-specific terms using different strategies (cultural substitution vs. paraphrasing) and evaluate comprehension by native speakers
  2. Analyze semantic field differences between source and target languages for technical terminology and document translation challenges
  3. Implement Ivanov's classification system on a sample text and measure translation accuracy and efficiency compared to ad-hoc approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific metrics or quantitative measures could be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for handling non-equivalent words in technical translation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses various strategies for dealing with non-equivalence but does not provide empirical results or quantitative metrics to evaluate their effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical frameworks and classifications of non-equivalent vocabulary without presenting data-driven approaches to measure strategy success.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using standardized evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy rates, readability scores, comprehension tests) across different translation strategies applied to the same source texts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do cultural and linguistic differences between English and Russian specifically impact the frequency and types of non-equivalent words encountered in technical translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions culture-specific concepts and linguistic factors affecting equivalence but does not provide a detailed comparative analysis between English and Russian.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies general types of non-equivalence, it lacks a systematic comparison of how these manifest specifically between the two languages studied.
- What evidence would resolve it: Corpus-based analysis of technical documents translated between English and Russian, categorizing non-equivalent instances and their resolution strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can machine translation systems effectively handle non-equivalent words in technical texts, and what are their limitations compared to human translators?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on human translation strategies but does not address the role of machine translation in dealing with non-equivalence.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to human translation methods and does not explore how emerging technologies perform in this domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of machine vs. human translations of technical texts, focusing on accuracy and handling of non-equivalent vocabulary.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation or quantitative metrics provided to evaluate translation strategies
- Limited practical examples demonstrating the complexity of actual technical translation scenarios
- Focus on English-Russian translation may not generalize to other language pairs

## Confidence

- High confidence: The identification of non-equivalence as a real challenge in technical translation
- Medium confidence: The classification of non-equivalent vocabulary into three groups based on cultural specificity
- Low confidence: The practical effectiveness of proposed translation strategies without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment translating technical documents containing non-equivalent terms, comparing outcomes using different strategies (cultural substitution vs. paraphrasing vs. loan words) and measuring comprehension by target language experts.

2. Develop a standardized test corpus of English-Russian technical terms that includes culture-specific concepts, semantically complex words, and meaning distinctions, then validate the classification system's accuracy in predicting translation difficulty.

3. Interview professional technical translators to assess whether the proposed strategies align with their actual practice and identify gaps between theoretical recommendations and practical needs.
