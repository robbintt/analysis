# KITLM: Domain-Specific Knowledge InTegration into Language Models for Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03638
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03638
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 1.5× improvement in exact match scores over GPT-3.5-turbo on MetaQA using iterative retrieval with ColBERTv2

## Executive Summary
KITLM introduces a knowledge-infused language model framework that enhances domain-specific question answering by integrating relevant structured knowledge from knowledge graphs. The key innovation is an iterative retrieval mechanism using ColBERTv2 that selects pertinent triples for each question-answer pair, effectively mitigating noise while maintaining model simplicity. KITLM demonstrates significant performance improvements on both MetaQA and AeroQA datasets while requiring substantially less computational resources than traditional pre-training approaches.

## Method Summary
KITLM employs an iterative retrieval approach where ColBERTv2 selects top-k triples for each question-answer pair, followed by triple distillation that filters out irrelevant triples based on entity presence. The framework fine-tunes T5-large with knowledge-infused context rather than pre-training on large corpora with triples. The method includes a question augmentation mechanism that appends distilled triples to the query for subsequent retrieval iterations, refining the search space progressively. This approach achieves domain adaptation through contextual knowledge integration during fine-tuning rather than expensive continual pre-training.

## Key Results
- 1.5× improvement in exact match scores compared to GPT-3.5-turbo on MetaQA dataset
- Similar performance gains demonstrated on AeroQA, a newly curated aviation domain dataset
- Significant computational efficiency compared to traditional pre-training methods
- Effective performance on both 1-hop and 2-hop question answering tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Iterative retrieval with ColBERTv2 improves multi-hop QA by filtering noise at each hop. At each hop, ColBERTv2 retrieves top-k triples, which are distilled to keep only those containing entities from the current context set. This reduces irrelevant triples before the next hop. The approach assumes relevant triples at each hop are likely to contain entities from the previous hop's filtered set.

### Mechanism 2
KITLM achieves domain-specific performance gains without full continual pre-training, saving compute. Instead of pre-training T5 on large corpora with triples, KITLM selects relevant triples per question and appends them as context during fine-tuning only. The assumption is that contextual triples during fine-tuning provide sufficient domain adaptation compared to pre-training.

### Mechanism 3
KITLM's question augmentation ("Question Booster") improves retrieval relevance in later hops. After each hop, distilled triples are appended to the question, providing additional context for the next retrieval step, narrowing the search space. The approach assumes adding retrieved triples to the query incrementally refines the semantic space and improves precision.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge graph structure (subject, relation, object triples)**: Understanding triple format is essential for reasoning about retrieval and filtering in KITLM. Quick check: What are the three components of a KG triple, and how are they used in multi-hop reasoning?

- **Iterative filtering and context augmentation**: The core algorithm repeatedly filters and augments the query; misunderstanding this loop leads to incorrect implementation. Quick check: In a 2-hop QA, how many times does KITLM retrieve and filter triples, and what changes in the query each time?

- **ColBERTv2 late interaction model**: KITLM uses ColBERTv2 for retrieval; knowing how it scores triples is key to tuning k and interpreting results. Quick check: How does ColBERTv2 score a query-triple pair, and why is this suitable for KG retrieval?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: AviationKG/WikiMovies → verbalize triples → ColBERTv2 indexer → KITLM retriever → triple distiller → T5-large fine-tuner → AeroQA/MetaQA evaluation
- **Critical path**: 1) Load KG → verbalize triples 2) Index triples with ColBERTv2 3) For each QA pair: Retrieve top-k triples → Filter by entity presence → Append filtered triples to question → Repeat N times for N-hop 4) Fine-tune T5 on processed dataset
- **Design tradeoffs**: Retrieval breadth (k) vs noise: larger k increases recall but also noise; Pre-training vs fine-tuning: KITLM avoids costly pre-training but may underfit on rare knowledge; Entity-based filtering: assumes entities are well-linked; fails on sparse KGs
- **Failure signatures**: Performance collapse on sparse KGs; Overfitting on small datasets; Retrieval failures when entity names are ambiguous or missing
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation: Compare 1-hop vs 2-hop retrieval filtering on MetaQA; 2) Retrieval tuning: Sweep k=1,3,5,10 on AeroQA and measure EM; 3) Augmentation effect: Compare KITLM with and without question booster on 2-hop MetaQA

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can knowledge infusion techniques be optimized for different domains, such as healthcare and aviation, to improve the performance of language models in specialized tasks? The paper discusses domain-specific datasets but does not explore optimization for different domains or potential challenges.

- What is the impact of using different types of knowledge graphs (e.g., general vs. domain-specific) on the performance of language models in question-answering tasks? The paper mentions KG usage but does not explore the effectiveness of different KG types on model performance.

- How can the iterative retrieval mechanism in KITLM be further improved to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of multi-hop question answering? The paper introduces the mechanism but does not investigate alternative retrieval methods or optimizations that could further enhance accuracy and efficiency.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic datasets (MetaQA, AeroQA) with limited validation on naturally occurring domain-specific QA data
- Ablation studies comparing iterative vs single-step retrieval are incomplete, lacking direct experimental comparison
- Effectiveness depends critically on entity linking quality in knowledge graphs, which varies significantly across domains
- Claims about computational efficiency relative to pre-training are difficult to verify without detailed training cost breakdowns

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: KITLM's basic architecture (iterative retrieval + T5 fine-tuning with KG context) is sound and technically implementable
- **Medium Confidence**: The 1.5× improvement claim over GPT-3.5-turbo is credible given task specificity, though absolute numbers should be verified
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency relative to pre-training are difficult to verify without detailed training cost breakdowns across different KG sizes

## Next Checks

1. Implement and compare KITLM with and without iterative retrieval filtering on MetaQA to verify the noise reduction benefit
2. Evaluate KITLM on naturally occurring aviation questions from pilot forums or technical documentation, not just the curated AeroQA dataset
3. Test KITLM performance across KGs with varying triple densities (sparse vs dense) to establish the minimum viable KG quality threshold for effective knowledge infusion
