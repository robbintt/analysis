# Feature representations useful for predicting image memorability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.07679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07679
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CNN models with feature representations similar to the inferior temporal (IT) cortex achieve higher accuracy in predicting image memorability

## Executive Summary
This study investigated which feature representations in CNN models are most useful for predicting image memorability. By analyzing 16,860 layers across 64 CNN models pretrained for object recognition, researchers found that layers with high memorability prediction accuracy showed higher brain similarity with the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Fine-tuning these models for memorability prediction revealed that brain similarity with the IT cortex at the penultimate layer positively correlated with memorability prediction accuracy. The best fine-tuned model achieved accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art CNN models, suggesting that CNNs' success in predicting memorability relies on acquiring feature representations similar to those in the IT cortex.

## Method Summary
The study used the LaMem dataset containing 60,000 images with memorability scores. Researchers extracted outputs from each layer of 64 pretrained CNN models (ImageNet-trained) and used PLS regression to predict memorability scores from these outputs. They computed brain similarity between each layer and visual cortex regions (V1, V2, V4, IT) using Brain-Score. Memorability prediction accuracy was measured using Spearman's correlation. After initial analysis, all 64 models were fine-tuned on the LaMem dataset, and the correlation between memorability accuracy and brain similarity was re-evaluated for the fine-tuned models.

## Key Results
- Layers with high memorability prediction accuracy showed higher brain similarity with the IT cortex
- Fine-tuning CNN models for memorability prediction revealed positive correlation between IT cortex brain similarity and memorability prediction accuracy
- The best fine-tuned model (DualPathNet92) achieved memorability prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
High memorability prediction accuracy in CNN models is driven by feature representations that closely resemble those of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. The IT cortex is the highest stage in the ventral visual pathway and is critical for object recognition. CNNs that develop IT-like representations can better capture the abstract, high-level features that correlate with memorability. Core assumption: Memorability is inherently a brain-based phenomenon, so representations that align with brain activity—especially in the IT cortex—will yield better predictions. Evidence: layers with high memorability prediction accuracy had higher brain similarity with the IT cortex; model performance for memorability prediction depends on how well the model acquires feature representations embedded in the deeper region within the ventral visual stream.

### Mechanism 2
Fine-tuning CNN models on memorability datasets strengthens the relationship between memorability prediction accuracy and IT cortex brain similarity. During fine-tuning, the model adjusts its weights to optimize for memorability, which encourages the network to develop or enhance IT-like feature representations that are useful for this task. Core assumption: Fine-tuning on memorability-specific data reinforces the brain-inspired feature acquisition process. Evidence: fine-tuning of the 64 CNN models for memorability prediction revealed that brain similarity with the IT cortex at the penultimate layer positively correlated with the memorability prediction accuracy; model performance for memorability prediction relies on feature representation acquisition of the IT cortex.

### Mechanism 3
Memorability prediction relies more directly on IT cortex representations than object recognition does. While both tasks benefit from IT-like features, memorability prediction can be achieved with fewer additional processing steps, making it more tightly coupled to IT-level representations. Core assumption: The IT cortex plays a more direct role in memorability than in object recognition. Evidence: model performance for both memorability and object recognition depends on IT cortex feature representations, although there is a difference between memorability and object recognition in the strength of relationship with the IT cortex; object recognition accuracy was not positively correlated with brain similarity with the IT cortex at the penultimate layer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Brain-Score and brain similarity metrics**
  - Why needed here: Brain-Score quantifies how closely a CNN layer's representations match neural activity in different brain regions. Understanding this metric is essential for interpreting the study's results.
  - Quick check question: How is brain similarity between a CNN layer and a brain region computed using Brain-Score?

- **Concept: Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression**
  - Why needed here: PLS regression is used both to predict brain activity from CNN outputs and to predict memorability scores from CNN outputs. Understanding PLS is key to grasping how predictions are made.
  - Quick check question: In the context of this study, what is the role of PLS regression when predicting memorability scores?

- **Concept: Spearman's correlation coefficient**
  - Why needed here: Spearman's correlation is used to measure the accuracy of memorability predictions. Knowing how it differs from Pearson's correlation is important for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might Spearman's correlation be preferred over Pearson's correlation for evaluating memorability prediction accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CNN models (64 pretrained ImageNet models) -> Brain-Score evaluation pipeline -> Memorability dataset (LaMem) -> PLS regression module -> Fine-tuning pipeline

- **Critical path**:
  1. Extract outputs from each CNN layer for memorability images
  2. Use PLS regression to predict memorability scores
  3. Compute Spearman's correlation between predicted and actual memorability
  4. Use Brain-Score to compute brain similarity for each layer
  5. Analyze correlation between memorability accuracy and brain similarity
  6. Fine-tune models on memorability dataset
  7. Repeat steps 1-5 for fine-tuned models

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using many different CNN architectures increases generalizability but adds computational cost
  - Focusing on IT cortex similarity may miss other relevant brain regions
  - Fine-tuning improves memorability accuracy but may reduce object recognition performance

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low correlation between memorability accuracy and brain similarity suggests the model isn't capturing the right features
  - Overfitting during fine-tuning (high training accuracy, low validation accuracy)
  - Computational bottlenecks when evaluating many layers across many models

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce the correlation between memorability accuracy and IT cortex similarity for a subset of CNN models
  2. Compare memorability prediction accuracy before and after fine-tuning on the LaMem dataset
  3. Test whether replacing the IT cortex similarity metric with V4 or V2 similarity changes the results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific feature representations in the IT cortex are most critical for image memorability prediction, and how do they differ from those used for object recognition? Basis: The study found that memorability prediction accuracy correlates with brain similarity to the IT cortex, but object recognition accuracy does not correlate with brain similarity at the penultimate layer. Why unresolved: The study identified that IT cortex representations are important but did not pinpoint which specific features or representations within the IT cortex are most crucial for memorability. What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of neural activity patterns in the IT cortex during memorability tasks, combined with feature importance analysis from CNN models, could identify specific IT cortex features critical for memorability.

### Open Question 2
How do low-level visual features in early visual cortices (V1, V2) contribute to image memorability, given the moderate correlation observed with V2 brain similarity? Basis: The study found moderate correlation between memorability prediction accuracy and brain similarity with V2 cortex, suggesting low-level features may play an auxiliary role. Why unresolved: While a correlation was observed, the specific mechanisms by which early visual features contribute to memorability remain unclear. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic manipulation of low-level visual features in images and measurement of their impact on memorability scores, combined with neural activity analysis in early visual cortices, could clarify their role.

### Open Question 3
Can we design neural network architectures that more effectively mimic IT cortex representations to improve memorability prediction beyond current state-of-the-art models? Basis: The study suggests that CNN success in memorability prediction depends on acquiring IT-like representations, and the best model (DualPathNet92) achieved high accuracy. Why unresolved: While the study shows IT-like representations are important, it did not explore architectural designs specifically optimized for capturing these representations. What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of novel architectures explicitly designed to mimic IT cortex processing, followed by comparison with current models on memorability prediction tasks, would provide evidence.

## Limitations

- The study relies on correlational evidence from a single dataset (LaMem), making it difficult to establish causality between IT similarity and memorability prediction
- The direction of causality remains unclear: does memorability prediction accuracy drive IT-like feature acquisition, or vice versa?
- Absence of comparable studies in the corpus makes independent validation difficult

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The observed correlation between memorability prediction accuracy and IT cortex similarity (abstract, p.5, p.6)
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that memorability prediction relies more directly on IT representations than object recognition (p.6)
- **Low confidence**: The mechanism explaining why IT similarity specifically enables memorability prediction (abstract, p.5)

## Next Checks

1. Test the IT-memorability correlation on an independent memorability dataset to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing IT cortex similarity from the model to assess impact on prediction accuracy
3. Evaluate whether models fine-tuned on object recognition tasks show similar IT-memorability correlations as those fine-tuned on memorability
