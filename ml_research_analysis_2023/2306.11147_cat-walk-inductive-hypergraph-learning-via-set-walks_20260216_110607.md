# CAT-Walk: Inductive Hypergraph Learning via Set Walks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.11147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11147
- Reference count: 40
- CAT-Walk achieves 9% and 17% average improvements in transductive and inductive hyperedge prediction settings respectively

## Executive Summary
CAT-Walk introduces SetWalk, a novel temporal higher-order random walk on hypergraphs that captures complex temporal and structural patterns. It employs a two-step anonymization process using SetMixer, a permutation-invariant pooling strategy, to hide hyperedge identities. The method encodes hyperedges using a simple yet effective neural network that leverages MLP-Mixer for efficient temporal walk encoding. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate CAT-Walk's superior performance in hyperedge prediction tasks, achieving 9% and 17% average improvements in transductive and inductive settings, respectively. It also shows competitive performance in dynamic node classification tasks.

## Method Summary
CAT-Walk is a hypergraph learning method that uses SetWalks for temporal higher-order random walks, SetMixer for permutation invariant pooling, and MLP-Mixer for walk encoding. The model performs hyperedge prediction and dynamic node classification on temporal hypergraphs. It samples SetWalks with temporal and structural biases, anonymizes nodes and hyperedges using SetMixer, encodes walks using MLP-Mixer with time encoding, and makes predictions through a neural network layer.

## Key Results
- Achieves 9% and 17% average improvements in transductive and inductive hyperedge prediction tasks respectively
- Outperforms existing methods on 10 benchmark datasets including NDC Class, High School, Primary School, Congress Bill, Email Enron, Email Eu, Question Tags M, Users-Threads, NDC Substances, and Question Tags U
- Shows competitive performance in dynamic node classification on High School and Primary School datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SetWalks can distinguish higher-order interactions that clique-expansion (CE) walks cannot, even with a finite number of samples. SetWalks are defined as sequences of hyperedges rather than sequences of nodes, capturing the semantic meaning of multi-way interactions that CE walks lose when decomposing hyperedges into pairwise edges. The core assumption is that a hypergraph with all vertices in one hyperedge (higher-order interaction) is semantically different from a hypergraph where each pair of vertices forms a separate hyperedge (pairwise interactions).

### Mechanism 2
SetMixer captures higher-order dependencies between node positional encodings within hyperedges better than simple pooling functions. SetMixer uses a token mixer with Softmax over features to create permutation-invariant, higher-order interactions between node encodings, while simple pooling (e.g., Mean) treats each node independently. The core assumption is that the order of nodes in a hyperedge is not important, but their joint encoding is.

### Mechanism 3
The two-step anonymization process (node identity hiding + hyperedge identity hiding) makes the model inductive by removing dependence on specific node/hyperedge identities. First, replace node identities with positional encodings based on their appearance in sampled SetWalks. Second, aggregate these positional encodings using SetMixer to obtain hyperedge positional encodings, removing dependence on hyperedge identities. The core assumption is that the model can learn from positional encodings alone without needing to know the actual identities of nodes or hyperedges.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Extension to hypergraphs via clique expansion
  - Why needed here: To understand baseline approaches that SetWalks and SetMixer are compared against
  - Quick check question: How does clique expansion transform a hypergraph into a graph, and what information is lost in this process?

- **Random walks on graphs and hypergraphs**: Understanding SetWalks vs existing random walk methods
  - Why needed here: To understand the difference between SetWalks and existing random walk methods on hypergraphs
  - Quick check question: How does the sampling probability differ between a hypergraph random walk and a simple random walk on the clique expansion of a hypergraph?

- **Permutation invariant functions**: Importance in hypergraph learning
  - Why needed here: To understand why SetMixer is needed and how it differs from other pooling functions
  - Quick check question: Why is permutation invariance important when aggregating node encodings in a hyperedge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: SetWalk -> SetMixer -> Time Encoding -> MLP-Mixer -> Neural Network
- **Critical path**:
  1. Sample SetWalks from the hypergraph
  2. Anonymize nodes and hyperedges using SetMixer
  3. Encode SetWalks using MLP-Mixer and time encoding
  4. Make predictions using the neural network
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Simplicity vs. expressiveness: SetWalks are more complex than clique-expansion walks but capture more information
  - Computational cost vs. performance: Sampling more SetWalks and using longer walks improves performance but increases computation
  - Fixed walk length vs. variable walk length: Current implementation uses fixed-length walks, but variable-length walks might be more expressive
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on inductive tasks: Indicates the anonymization process is not removing identity dependence
  - Similar performance to clique-expansion methods: Indicates SetWalks are not capturing higher-order interactions
  - Overfitting to training data: Indicates the model is not generalizing well to unseen patterns
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare AUC on hyperedge prediction with and without SetWalks (use clique-expansion walks instead)
  2. Compare AUC with and without SetMixer (use simple pooling instead)
  3. Compare AUC on inductive vs. transductive tasks to verify the model is not relying on node identities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of CAT-Walk scale with increasing hypergraph size and temporal complexity beyond the tested datasets? The paper mentions scalability analysis but only tests up to 1.6x10^5 hyperedges on the High School dataset. It's unclear how CAT-Walk performs on much larger hypergraphs or those with more complex temporal dynamics. Evidence would come from extensive experiments on hypergraphs with orders of magnitude more hyperedges and longer time spans, comparing CAT-Walk's performance and runtime to other methods.

### Open Question 2
How does the choice of the temporal bias coefficient α impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen patterns in the inductive setting? The paper mentions hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for α but doesn't thoroughly investigate its impact on inductive generalization. While the paper shows that α affects performance on the test set, it doesn't explore how different values of α influence the model's ability to generalize to entirely new patterns or nodes in the inductive setting. Evidence would come from experiments systematically varying α in the inductive setting, evaluating the model's performance on hyperedges involving nodes or patterns not seen during training.

### Open Question 3
How does CAT-Walk's performance compare to other methods when applied to dynamic node classification tasks on datasets beyond High School and Primary School? The paper only reports results on node classification for High School and Primary School datasets. The paper's node classification results are limited to two specific datasets, leaving open the question of how CAT-Walk performs on other types of dynamic node classification tasks. Evidence would come from experiments applying CAT-Walk to node classification on a diverse set of datasets with different characteristics (e.g., varying hypergraph density, temporal patterns, node attributes).

## Limitations
- The two-step anonymization process may not be necessary for all hypergraph datasets - its effectiveness likely depends on the specific structure of temporal interactions
- The claim that SetWalks capture "complex dynamic laws" is supported primarily through benchmark performance rather than explicit qualitative analysis of the learned patterns
- The method's computational complexity scales with the number of sampled walks and walk length, which may limit scalability to very large hypergraphs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The superior empirical performance on hyperedge prediction tasks (9% transductive, 17% inductive improvements) is well-supported by the experimental results across 10 datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which SetMixer captures higher-order dependencies is plausible but not exhaustively validated through ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that two-step anonymization enables true inductive learning is supported but could benefit from more direct analysis of what patterns the model learns

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with known higher-order vs pairwise interaction patterns to directly validate Mechanism 1
2. Perform extensive ablation studies varying the number of SetWalk samples and walk lengths to quantify the tradeoff between performance and computational cost
3. Analyze attention patterns in SetMixer to verify it is indeed capturing meaningful higher-order dependencies rather than acting as a simple pooling function
