# Enhancing Student Performance Prediction on Learnersourced Questions with SGNN-LLM Synergy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.13500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13500
- Reference count: 12
- This paper proposes combining Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) with Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings to improve prediction accuracy and robustness for learnersourced multiple-choice questions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting student performance on learnersourced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in online learning platforms. The authors propose a novel approach that combines Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) with Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Their method employs a signed bipartite graph to model student answers and leverages contrastive learning to handle noise in the data. Additionally, LLM-generated semantic embeddings of questions are integrated to address the cold-start problem for new questions. The proposed LLM-SBCL model is evaluated on five real-world datasets from the PeerWise platform, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The LLM-SBCL model combines signed bipartite graph representation learning with semantic embeddings from Large Language Models. The method constructs a signed bipartite graph where students and questions form separate node sets, with positive edges for correct answers and negative edges for incorrect ones. Two separate Graph Attention Networks (GATs) process positive and negative edges respectively. Contrastive learning with inter-view and intra-view losses enhances noise resilience through graph augmentation. LLM-generated semantic embeddings of knowledge points from MCQ content are integrated to address cold-start scenarios. The model concatenates structural and semantic embeddings, passing them through an MLP for final prediction.

## Key Results
- Achieves binary F1 score of 0.908 on the Law dataset
- Demonstrates consistent improvements across all five PeerWise datasets
- Shows average 6.4% increase in binary F1 score for cold-start scenarios compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive learning on signed bipartite graphs enhances noise resilience by learning representations that align similar correct/incorrect interactions while contrasting different ones.
- Mechanism: The model creates two augmented graph views by randomly flipping edge signs. It then applies separate GNNs for positive and negative edges, using inter-view contrastive loss to pull together representations from the same encoder and intra-view loss to contrast representations from different encoders. This forces the model to learn robust node embeddings that are invariant to random noise in student answers.
- Core assumption: Random edge flips simulate noise patterns in learnersourced data, and the contrastive objective can distinguish true patterns from noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our methodology employs a signed bipartite graph to comprehensively model student answers, complemented by a contrastive learning framework that enhances noise resilience."
  - [section] "To address this, we employ a contrastive objective for robust signed bipartite graph representation learning, encompassing two losses: (a) Inter-view contrastive loss and (b) Intra-view contrastive loss."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations of contrastive learning on signed bipartite graphs found in related papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-extracted semantic embeddings of knowledge points in MCQs provide complementary information to structural graph embeddings, improving cold-start prediction.
- Mechanism: The model uses GPT-3.5 to extract weighted knowledge point terms from MCQ content (stem, options, answer, explanation). These semantic embeddings capture the intrinsic knowledge required to answer correctly, independent of student interaction data. By concatenating these with graph-derived structural embeddings, the model gains additional signal for questions with few or no interactions.
- Core assumption: MCQ correctness depends on understanding underlying knowledge points, and LLM can accurately extract these from question text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, LLM's contribution lies in generating foundational question embeddings, proving especially advantageous in addressing cold start scenarios characterized by limited graph data."
  - [section] "We posit that MCQ response accuracy hinges on students' comprehension of underlying knowledge within questions."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations of LLM for MCQ knowledge extraction in the corpus, though related work exists on LLMs for educational content.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Separating positive and negative edges into different graph views allows the model to learn distinct semantic representations for correct and incorrect answers.
- Mechanism: The signed bipartite graph is partitioned into positive and negative subgraphs, each processed by separate GAT encoders. This design respects the fundamentally different semantic meanings of correct and incorrect answers, allowing the model to capture distinct patterns in how students interact with questions based on answer correctness.
- Core assumption: Correct and incorrect answers have fundamentally different semantic relationships that should be modeled separately rather than combined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This graph structure segregates students and questions into separate sets of nodes. Positive edges denote correct student answers, while negative edges indicate incorrect responses."
  - [section] "Considering the distinct semantic attributes of positive and negative edges—positive edges representing correct answers by users and negative edges indicating incorrect answers—we employ separate GNN encoders for each edge type."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while signed graph neural networks exist, the specific approach of separate encoders for positive/negative edges in bipartite graphs is not directly supported by corpus papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their application to bipartite graphs
  - Why needed here: The core problem is predicting student performance on questions, which naturally forms a bipartite graph structure. GNNs are essential for learning node representations that capture complex interaction patterns between students and questions.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how GNNs process bipartite graphs versus standard graphs, and why is this important for signed bipartite graphs?

- Concept: Contrastive learning framework for graph representation
  - Why needed here: The learnersourcing data contains noise from incorrect question creation and random answering. Contrastive learning helps the model learn noise-robust representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar instances.
  - Quick check question: How does the InfoNCE loss function work in the context of signed bipartite graphs, and what is the difference between inter-view and intra-view contrastive loss?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic extraction from educational content
  - Why needed here: New questions lack sufficient interaction data for accurate prediction. LLM-extracted knowledge points provide semantic context that supplements structural information from the graph.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the prompt used to extract knowledge points from MCQs, and how does the weighting mechanism work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline -> Graph construction -> Dual GAT encoding -> Graph augmentation -> Contrastive loss computation -> LLM semantic extraction -> Embedding fusion -> MLP prediction -> Cross-entropy loss
- Critical path: Graph construction → Graph encoding → LLM semantic extraction → Embedding fusion → Prediction → Loss computation → Backpropagation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate vs. unified encoders for positive/negative edges: Separate encoders capture distinct semantics but increase model complexity
  - Random vs. structured graph augmentation: Random augmentation is simpler but may not capture all noise patterns
  - LLM integration level: Full integration vs. pretraining affects training efficiency and model performance
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with high correctness rates (>90%) may indicate overfitting to specific patterns
  - Contrastive loss dominating training may suggest hyperparameter β is too high
  - Inconsistent results across runs may indicate instability in graph augmentation or LLM processing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with only graph structural information (no LLM embeddings) on biology dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Train with only LLM embeddings (no graph information) on cold-start subset to measure semantic contribution
  3. Vary the contrastive loss weight β across [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0] to find optimal balance between prediction and robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the performance of LLM-SBCL compare to traditional knowledge tracing methods in predicting student performance on learnersourced MCQs?
- How does the inclusion of semantic embeddings from MCQs impact the performance of the model in cold start scenarios compared to other cold start solutions?
- How does the choice of LLM affect the quality of the semantic embeddings and the overall performance of the model?

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation scope to PeerWise datasets may not generalize to other learnersourcing platforms
- LLM dependency raises concerns about reproducibility, computational cost, and potential biases
- Contrastive learning assumes random noise patterns, but real-world noise may have systematic biases

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core methodology of combining signed graph neural networks with contrastive learning is technically sound and well-supported by the mathematical framework.
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of LLM-extracted semantic embeddings for cold-start prediction is supported by experimental results but relies heavily on the quality and consistency of the LLM's knowledge extraction capabilities.
- Low confidence: The generalizability of the approach beyond PeerWise datasets and the robustness to different types of noise patterns in learnersourced data remain uncertain without broader evaluation.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the model on at least two additional learnersourcing platforms with different question types and student populations to assess generalizability beyond PeerWise datasets.

2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing different LLM models (including open-source alternatives) and knowledge extraction methods to quantify the impact of LLM dependency on performance and cost.

3. Systematically vary noise patterns in the training data (systematic biases, class-imbalanced noise, temporal noise) to test the robustness of the contrastive learning approach beyond random edge flips.
