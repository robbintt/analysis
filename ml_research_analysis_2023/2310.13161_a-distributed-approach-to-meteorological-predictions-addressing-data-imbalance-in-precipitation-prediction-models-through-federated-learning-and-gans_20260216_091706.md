# A Distributed Approach to Meteorological Predictions: Addressing Data Imbalance in Precipitation Prediction Models through Federated Learning and GANs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13161
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GAN-based augmentation (CGANs, WGANs-GP) outperforms SMOTE in federated precipitation prediction, achieving highest accuracy, AUC, and G-mean scores

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of data imbalance in precipitation prediction by combining federated learning with GAN-based data augmentation. The approach tackles the underrepresentation of rainy days in weather datasets by generating synthetic samples using various GAN architectures. The method is evaluated across nine Australian weather stations in both centralized and federated settings, demonstrating that GAN-based augmentation techniques significantly outperform traditional SMOTE and baseline imbalanced models across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The method involves training deep learning models on weather data from nine Australian weather stations, with data augmentation applied to address class imbalance. Five augmentation techniques are compared: SMOTE, CGANs, Minority GANs, SMOTE GANs, and WGANs-GP. Models are trained in both centralized and federated settings, with federated learning preserving privacy by training locally at each station and aggregating model updates. The deep learning architecture consists of dense layers with Gaussian noise added for privacy in the federated setting. Training uses 10 communication rounds with batch size 64, learning rate 0.001, and RMSprop optimizer.

## Key Results
- GAN-based augmentation techniques (particularly CGANs and WGANs-GP) outperform traditional SMOTE and baseline imbalanced models across accuracy, AUC, and G-mean metrics
- In federated learning settings, CGANs and WGANs-GP achieve highest performance across all evaluation metrics
- CGANs offer the best G-mean score, indicating balanced performance across both classes
- Federated learning successfully preserves privacy while leveraging decentralized data sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GAN-based augmentation improves minority class representation by generating synthetic samples that match the real data distribution more closely than SMOTE
- Mechanism: The generator in GANs learns the joint distribution of features and class labels (CGANs) or the Wasserstein distance between real and generated samples (WGANs-GP). The discriminator provides adversarial feedback, guiding the generator to produce high-quality synthetic samples that are added to the minority class
- Core assumption: Synthetic data generated by GANs preserves statistical properties and correlations of the original minority class without introducing significant noise or mode collapse
- Evidence anchors: Primary results show GAN-based techniques outperform SMOTE and baseline models in terms of accuracy, AUC, and G-mean metrics

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Federated learning preserves data privacy and leverages decentralized data sources, improving model generalization across diverse geographical regions
- Mechanism: Each weather station trains a local model on its augmented data, with only model updates sent to a global server for aggregation. This allows the global model to learn from collective knowledge without exposing raw data
- Core assumption: Local data distributions are sufficiently diverse and representative of global weather patterns, and the communication protocol is secure
- Evidence anchors: The approach allows leveraging data from multiple centers without accumulating data in a single facility

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evaluating model performance using metrics that account for class imbalance (AUC and G-mean) provides more accurate assessment than accuracy alone
- Mechanism: Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets as a model can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class. AUC measures area under ROC curve, indicating model's ability to discriminate between classes across all thresholds
- Core assumption: Minority class (rainy days) is the critical class for weather prediction, and its correct classification is as important as majority class
- Evidence anchors: The goal of imbalanced learning is to find an optimal classifier that provides balanced predictive accuracy for both minority and majority classes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data imbalance and its impact on classification models
  - Why needed here: Precipitation data is inherently imbalanced with rainy days being less frequent than non-rainy days, leading to biased models that favor majority class
  - Quick check question: If a dataset has 90% non-rainy days and 10% rainy days, and a model always predicts "non-rainy," what would be its accuracy and why is this problematic for weather prediction?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants
  - Why needed here: GANs are used to generate synthetic samples of minority class (rainy days) to balance dataset and improve model performance
  - Quick check question: In a GAN, what are the roles of the generator and discriminator, and how do they compete to improve quality of generated samples?

- Concept: Federated learning and its privacy-preserving mechanism
  - Why needed here: Weather data is collected at decentralized stations, and privacy concerns may prevent centralizing data. Federated learning allows training on decentralized data without sharing raw data
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning differ from traditional centralized learning in terms of data privacy and model training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data sources (9 weather stations) -> Preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering, normalization) -> Data augmentation (SMOTE, CGANs, Minority GANs, SMOTE GANs, WGANs-GP) -> Model (deep learning with dense layers, Gaussian noise for federated setting) -> Training (centralized/federated) -> Evaluation (accuracy, AUC, G-mean)

- Critical path: 1) Collect and preprocess data from weather stations, 2) Apply data augmentation techniques to balance dataset, 3) Train deep learning model on balanced data (centralized or federated), 4) Evaluate model using appropriate metrics (AUC, G-mean)

- Design tradeoffs: Centralized vs. federated learning (centralized simpler but raises privacy concerns, federated preserves privacy but introduces communication overhead), different GAN variants (varying stability, computational cost, and quality of generated samples)

- Failure signatures: Poor model performance (insufficient data augmentation, mode collapse in GANs, significant heterogeneity in local data distributions), high communication costs (frequent model updates or large model sizes), privacy breaches (vulnerabilities in federated learning protocol)

- First 3 experiments: 1) Train deep learning model on imbalanced data (baseline) and evaluate using accuracy, AUC, and G-mean, 2) Apply SMOTE to balance data and retrain model, comparing performance with baseline, 3) Apply CGANs to balance data and retrain model, comparing performance with baseline and SMOTE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Claims about GAN-based augmentation superiority are supported primarily by internal benchmarking against SMOTE and baseline models, with no external validation on independent datasets
- Specific GAN architectures and hyperparameters remain underspecified, potentially limiting reproducibility
- Federated learning setup with only 10 communication rounds may not capture convergence behavior in larger-scale deployments

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Superiority of GAN-based augmentation over SMOTE for precipitation prediction is well-supported by reported metrics across multiple GAN variants
- Medium Confidence: Effectiveness of federated learning for preserving privacy while improving model generalization, though limited communication rounds suggest this may not reflect full convergence
- Low Confidence: Claims about real-world deployment readiness, given lack of external validation and underspecified architectural details

## Next Checks

1. Validate GAN-generated samples against independent precipitation datasets to assess sample quality and diversity preservation
2. Test federated learning convergence behavior with increased communication rounds (20-50) and varying local dataset sizes
3. Conduct ablation studies removing Gaussian noise in federated setting to quantify privacy-utility tradeoff
