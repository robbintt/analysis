# TILFA: A Unified Framework for Text, Image, and Layout Fusion in Argument Mining

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05210
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05210
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Achieved 86.47 micro F1-score on ImageArg Argumentative Stance Classification subtask, outperforming baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TILFA, a unified framework for multimodal argument mining that combines text and image information to classify stances in tweets. The authors address the challenge of detecting argumentative stances in tweets containing both text and images with embedded text. By using DeBERTa for text encoding and LayoutLMv3 for image encoding (which captures text, layout, and image information), TILFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageArg dataset. The framework also employs back-translation and WordNet-based data augmentation to address data imbalance and limited training data.

## Method Summary
TILFA uses DeBERTa to encode tweet text and LayoutLMv3 to encode images, with the latter specifically chosen for its ability to detect optical characters and recognize layout details. The framework employs multimodal fusion via concatenation of text and image representations. To address data imbalance and limited dataset size, the authors apply back-translation (translating to another language and back) and WordNet-based synonym replacement for nouns. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer on an NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.47 micro F1-score on the Argumentative Stance Classification subtask of ImageArg Shared Task 2023
- Outperformed baseline models by a large margin on multimodal argument mining
- Demonstrated effectiveness of LayoutLMv3 over traditional image encoders (ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG) for this task
- Showed that simple concatenation fusion outperforms more complex fusion methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion using LayoutLMv3 improves stance detection by capturing both visual objects and text/layout in images.
- Mechanism: LayoutLMv3 integrates text, layout, and image information in a unified multimodal framework, allowing it to detect optical characters and understand layout details crucial for stance determination.
- Core assumption: Optical characters and layout in images carry significant stance-relevant information that traditional image encoders miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It excels at not only understanding text but also detecting optical characters and recognizing layout details in images."
  - [section 3.3]: "As highlighted by Liu et al. (2022), traditional image encoders like ResNet50, ResNet101 (He et al., 2016), VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) are good at identifying objects but fall short in recognizing optical characters in images... So considering the importance of this layout information of characters in images, we employ LayoutLMv3 (Huang et al., 2022)) to encode the images..."
- Break condition: If images contain minimal text or layout information, or if text/layout information is not stance-relevant.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation using back-translation and WordNet improves model performance by addressing data imbalance and increasing training data size.
- Mechanism: Back-translation enriches underrepresented classes by translating to another language and back, maintaining stance while creating variation. WordNet-based augmentation replaces nouns with synonyms to create new training examples.
- Core assumption: Creating semantically similar but varied examples preserves original stance while increasing data diversity and balance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "To address this, we preprocess the data through bask-translation (Yu et al., 2018). We translate the English tweet text belonging to the underrepresented label (e.g., positive in abortion topic) to a random language (e.g., French, German) and then back to English."
  - [section 3.2]: "We employ data augmentation methods since our ImageArg training set is limited... We first utilize spaCy to tokenize the tweet text and extract the nouns in it. Then we find all their synonym sets in WordNet (Miller, 1994)."
- Break condition: If synonym replacement changes meaning or stance, or if back-translation introduces errors that alter original meaning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The simplest multimodal fusion method (concatenation) performs best because it directly combines text and image representations without introducing complexity.
- Mechanism: Concatenation simply appends hidden states from text and image encoders, allowing the model to learn how to weigh each modality during training.
- Core assumption: Complex fusion methods (cross-modal attention, semantic similarity attention) are not well-suited for this specific task or dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "The first simply concatenates the hidden states from text and image inputs. The second method, named cross-modal multi-head attention, is adapted from Yu et al. (2021). And the third is a new approach adapted from ESIM (Chen et al., 2017)."
  - [section 4.2]: "When it comes to multimodal fusion methods, the simplest Concatenation works best. We think it may because the second method is initially applied in video field (Yu et al., 2021), and the third one in pure text field (Chen et al., 2017). So, neither of them is suitable to be migrated to this task."
- Break condition: If dataset characteristics change or if more complex fusion methods are specifically designed for this type of multimodal task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning and fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: The task requires combining information from text and images to determine stance, making multimodal learning essential.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion approaches in multimodal learning?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques for NLP
  - Why needed here: The dataset is small and imbalanced, requiring augmentation to improve model performance and generalization.
  - Quick check question: How do back-translation and synonym replacement differ in their effects on text meaning and style?

- Concept: Pre-trained multimodal models (LayoutLMv3)
  - Why needed here: LayoutLMv3 is specifically designed to handle text, layout, and image information in documents, making it ideal for this tweet-based multimodal task.
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between LayoutLMv3 and traditional image-only encoders like ResNet?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text → DeBERTa → Text features; Image → LayoutLMv3 → Image features; Text features + Image features → Concatenation → Classification head

- Critical path: Text → DeBERTa → Text features; Image → LayoutLMv3 → Image features; Text features + Image features → Concatenation → Classification head

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LayoutLMv3 vs traditional image encoders: Better handling of text/layout in images but potentially higher computational cost
  - Concatenation vs complex fusion methods: Simplicity and effectiveness vs potential for better performance with more sophisticated approaches
  - Augmentation techniques: Improved data balance and diversity vs risk of introducing noise or changing meaning

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on abortion topic despite good gun control results: Likely data imbalance or topic-specific challenges
  - Degradation when using complex fusion methods: Suggests dataset characteristics favor simple approaches
  - Performance drop without augmentation: Indicates dataset size and imbalance are significant challenges

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance using LayoutLMv3 vs ResNet/VGG on the abortion topic to isolate the impact of optical character recognition
  2. Test different fusion methods (concatenation, cross-modal attention, semantic similarity attention) to confirm concatenation is optimal
  3. Evaluate the impact of augmentation by training with and without back-translation and WordNet augmentation on both topics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using different image encoders (e.g., ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16) on the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of different image encoders, including ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and LayoutLMv3, in Section 4.2.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides experimental results for each image encoder but does not analyze the reasons behind the differences in performance or provide a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each encoder.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more in-depth analysis of the characteristics of each image encoder, such as their ability to handle different types of images or their computational efficiency, would help explain the observed performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed data augmentation method (WordNet-based) compare to other data augmentation techniques for multimodal argument mining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes the use of WordNet-based data augmentation in Section 3.2 and provides experimental results in Table 2.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the proposed data augmentation method to other techniques, such as image-based augmentation or more advanced text-based methods, leaving open the question of whether the proposed method is the most effective for this task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different data augmentation techniques and comparing their performance would provide insights into the relative effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the current multimodal fusion methods, and how can they be improved?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses three multimodal fusion methods in Section 3.3 and notes that the simplest method (Concatenation) performed the best, suggesting that the other methods may not be suitable for this task.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the current fusion methods or propose potential improvements or alternative approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Exploring different fusion architectures, such as attention-based methods or more complex neural networks, and comparing their performance to the current methods would help identify potential improvements and better understand the limitations of the existing approaches.

## Limitations

- Data Dependence: Model performance heavily depends on ImageArg dataset characteristics, which may not generalize to other multimodal argument mining tasks or datasets.
- Generalizability of Fusion Approach: While concatenation proved optimal for this specific task, the authors acknowledge this might be due to other methods being designed for different domains (video and pure text).
- Augmentation Validity: Back-translation and WordNet-based augmentation may introduce artifacts or alter meaning in ways that don't generalize to real-world data.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The overall framework architecture (using DeBERTa + LayoutLMv3 + multimodal fusion) is well-established and the reported performance metrics are verifiable against the ImageArg dataset.
- Medium Confidence: The specific claim that LayoutLMv3 is superior to traditional image encoders for this task, based on the reasoning that optical characters and layout details are crucial for stance detection.
- Low Confidence: The assertion that concatenation is the optimal fusion method because other methods were "not suitable to be migrated to this task."

## Next Checks

1. Cross-topic validation: Test the framework on additional topics beyond gun control and abortion to verify that performance gains are not topic-specific and that LayoutLMv3's advantages in handling text/layout persist across diverse domains.

2. Fusion method adaptation: Implement and test properly adapted versions of cross-modal attention and semantic similarity attention specifically designed for this multimodal argument mining task, rather than using off-the-shelf implementations from other domains.

3. Augmentation robustness check: Conduct human evaluation of augmented examples to verify that back-translation and WordNet-based synonym replacement preserve the original stance and meaning, and test model performance with and without augmentation on held-out test sets to measure actual impact on generalization.
