# Targeted Reduction of Causal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.18639
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18639
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: TCR learns concise high-level causal models that preserve consistency under interventions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Targeted Causal Reduction (TCR), a method for extracting concise causal explanations from complex models. TCR learns a high-level Structural Causal Model (SCM) that explains a specific target variable by transforming a low-level model, while preserving causal consistency under interventions. The method optimizes an information-theoretic objective balancing cause and mechanism consistency, with optional homogeneity regularization for interpretability.

## Method Summary
TCR transforms a complex low-level SCM into a concise high-level causal model explaining a specific target variable. The method learns two mappings: τ maps low-level variables to high-level causes, and ω maps low-level interventions to high-level interventions. An information-theoretic objective minimizes the KL divergence between pushed-forward low-level and high-level interventional distributions, ensuring causal consistency. Homogeneity regularization can be added to align τ and ω maps for improved interpretability. The method provides analytical solutions for linear Gaussian cases and demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic and mechanical systems.

## Key Results
- TCR successfully identifies interpretable high-level causal factors in mechanical systems like double-well potentials
- The method provides analytical solutions for linear Gaussian cases with unique identifiability under certain conditions
- Homogeneity regularization improves interpretability by aligning cause and mechanism mappings while maintaining consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TCR preserves causal consistency under interventions by minimizing KL divergence between pushed-forward low-level and high-level interventional distributions
- Core assumption: Low-level model can be expressed as SCM and interventional data is available
- Evidence: [abstract] "TCR learns a high-level SCM...while preserving causal consistency under interventions" and [section 3.2] uses KL divergence for consistency

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Identifiability is guaranteed when all intervened variables are included in the high-level cause set
- Core assumption: Linear Gaussian SCM with prior intervention distribution covering neighborhood of zero
- Evidence: [section 3.4] shows unique linear TCR solutions whenΩ = 𝜋(1)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Homogeneity regularization aligns cause and mechanism consistency by enforcing similarity between τ and ω maps
- Core assumption: User values interpretability and accepts tradeoff with consistency
- Evidence: [section 4] introduces homogeneity regularization to improve interpretability

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  - Why needed: TCR is built on SCM framework to represent causal dependencies
  - Quick check: What are the three components of an SCM and how do they relate?

- Concept: Interventional Distributions and Do-Calculus
  - Why needed: TCR relies on interventional data to learn high-level causal model
  - Quick check: How does shift intervention modify structural equations and distribution?

- Concept: Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence
  - Why needed: Consistency loss uses KL divergence to measure distributional differences
  - Quick check: What properties make KL divergence suitable for measuring intervention consistency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Low-level SCM -> Target variable -> High-level SCM, with τ and ω mappings connecting them

- Critical path:
  1. Define low-level SCM and target variable
  2. Specify prior distribution over interventions
  3. Choose alignment function π
  4. Initialize high-level model parameters
  5. Optimize consistency loss (with optional homogeneity regularization)
  6. Evaluate learned high-level causal model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear vs. non-linear mappings: Trade interpretability for flexibility
  - Gaussian vs. non-Gaussian assumptions: Trade computational efficiency for accuracy
  - Consistency vs. homogeneity: Trade causal accuracy for interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - High consistency loss indicates poor causal representation
  - Large τ-ω discrepancy suggests prediction-intervention mismatch
  - Poor generalization indicates overfitting or unrepresentative intervention prior

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Toy linear Gaussian model with known ground truth for validation
  2. Double well potential for non-linear dynamics assessment
  3. Two-branch graph with multiple high-level causes for scalability testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does TCR perform on high-dimensional continuous variables beyond linear Gaussian cases?
- Basis: Paper discusses Gaussian approximations suggesting limitations
- Why unresolved: Analysis focuses on linear Gaussian cases
- Resolution: Experiments on non-linear/non-Gaussian high-dimensional datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can TCR scale to large-scale simulations with many interventions?
- Basis: Paper mentions computational burden of many interventions
- Why unresolved: Acknowledges burden but provides no scalability solutions
- Resolution: Experiments demonstrating performance on large-scale simulations

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does intervention prior choice affect learned TCR?
- Basis: Paper discusses role of prior P(i) in learning objective
- Why unresolved: Acknowledges impact but lacks comprehensive analysis
- Resolution: Experiments varying intervention priors and analyzing resulting solutions

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees primarily established for linear Gaussian models
- Homogeneity regularization introduces consistency-interpretability tradeoff without rigorous analysis
- Experimental validation limited to relatively simple domains

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in core claims due to coherent framework and experimental validation, but limited to specific model classes

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TCR on real-world dataset with known causal structure to assess high-level factor discovery
2. Investigate homogeneity regularization impact on consistency across different domains
3. Extend identifiability analysis to non-linear and non-Gaussian models
