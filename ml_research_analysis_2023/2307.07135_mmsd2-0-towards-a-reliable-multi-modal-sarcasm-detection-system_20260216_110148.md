# MMSD2.0: Towards a Reliable Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07135
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Multi-view CLIP framework achieves 85.64% accuracy and 84.10% F1 score on MMSD2.0 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two critical issues in multi-modal sarcasm detection: spurious cues in existing benchmarks causing model bias, and unreasonable negative sample annotations. The authors introduce MMSD2.0, a corrected dataset that removes hashtags and emojis and re-annotates unreasonable samples via crowdsourcing. They also propose a novel multi-view CLIP framework that leverages text, image, and text-image interaction perspectives using pre-trained CLIP models. Experimental results demonstrate that MMSD2.0 successfully mitigates model bias, and the multi-view CLIP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The approach involves two main components: dataset correction and model architecture innovation. For dataset correction, the authors remove hashtag and emoji words from text and re-annotate unreasonable negative samples through crowdsourcing, creating MMSD2.0. For the model, they propose a multi-view CLIP framework that uses three perspectives - text-only, image-only, and text-image interaction - to extract sarcasm cues from multiple angles. The framework uses pre-trained CLIP models and aggregates information from all views using late fusion for final sarcasm detection.

## Key Results
- MMSD2.0 successfully mitigates model bias by removing spurious cues and improving dataset quality
- Multi-view CLIP achieves 85.64% accuracy and 84.10% F1 score on the corrected dataset
- The proposed framework significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multi-modal sarcasm detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing spurious cues (hashtags and emojis) reduces model bias by forcing reliance on cross-modal relationships
- Mechanism: By stripping text of hashtags and emoji words that show unbalanced distribution between sarcastic and non-sarcastic samples, models cannot rely on these superficial patterns and must instead learn to understand the relationship between text and image
- Core assumption: The presence of hashtags and emojis creates a statistical shortcut that models can exploit without understanding multi-modal incongruity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "removes the spurious cues (hashtags and emojis) and re-annotates unreasonable samples via crowdsourcing"
  - [section]: "we remove hashtag words from text in the MMSD dataset... This allows the model to capture image features and using them to guide the final prediction, rather than relying on the hashtag word number as a spurious cue"
- Break condition: If the remaining text-image pairs still contain other spurious cues not addressed by the authors, bias mitigation may be incomplete

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Re-annotating unreasonable negative samples improves dataset quality and model reliability
- Mechanism: The original MMSD dataset labeled all samples without #sarcasm tags as non-sarcastic, which is unreasonable since sentences without this tag can still express sarcasm. Re-annotation via crowdsourcing corrects these labels, making the dataset more reliable
- Core assumption: The original negative sample labeling strategy was systematically flawed and required human judgment to correct
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "re-annotates unreasonable samples via crowdsourcing"
  - [section]: "MMSD simply considers the samples without special hashtags like '#sarcasm' as negative sample... We argue that this construction operation is unreasonable because samples without #sarcasm tag can also express sarcasm intention"
- Break condition: If crowdsourced annotations introduce new biases or inconsistencies, the dataset quality improvement may be limited

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-view CLIP framework leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge to capture sarcasm cues from different perspectives
- Mechanism: The framework uses three views - text-only, image-only, and text-image interaction - to extract sarcasm cues from multiple angles, then aggregates them using late fusion. This approach naturally inherits knowledge from CLIP's pretraining on image-text pairs
- Core assumption: Sarcasm detection benefits from modeling different perspectives of the same input rather than a single fused representation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leverages multiple perspectives (text, image, and text-image interaction) using pre-trained CLIP models for sarcasm detection"
  - [section]: "multi-view CLIP utilizes different sarcasm cues captured from multiple perspectives... and aggregates multi-view information for final sarcasm detection"
- Break condition: If one view consistently dominates the others in contribution, the multi-view architecture may be unnecessarily complex

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-modal incongruity
  - Why needed here: Sarcasm often relies on the contrast between text and image content
  - Quick check question: How would you determine if an image contradicts the sentiment expressed in text?

- Concept: Spurious correlation in datasets
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models can learn shortcuts rather than true relationships
  - Quick check question: What patterns in training data might allow a model to classify correctly without understanding the task?

- Concept: Pre-trained vision-language models
  - Why needed here: The approach leverages CLIP's pretraining on image-text pairs
  - Quick check question: What is the core idea behind contrastive learning in CLIP?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer: Text and image pairs → CLIP encoders: Separate text and image encoders → Three view modules: Text view, image view, interaction view → Aggregation layer: Late fusion of three outputs → Output layer: Binary classification
- Critical path: Text/image → CLIP encoding → view processing → aggregation → prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Multi-view approach adds complexity but captures richer features; debiasing dataset reduces performance on original benchmark
- Failure signatures: If text-only or image-only views dominate performance, may indicate spurious cues still present or insufficient cross-modal learning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline CLIP text-only and image-only models to establish individual modality performance
  2. Implement text view module and measure performance gain over text-only baseline
  3. Add image view module and measure performance gain over combined text+image baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the long-term effects of using MMSD2.0 on downstream tasks like sentiment analysis and opinion mining?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential benefits of MMSD2.0 for building reliable multi-modal sarcasm detection systems, which could impact downstream tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the immediate benefits of MMSD2.0 for sarcasm detection and does not explore the long-term effects on other NLP tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of models trained on MMSD2.0 versus traditional datasets on various downstream tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the multi-view CLIP framework handle sarcasm detection in scenarios with more than two modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the multi-view CLIP framework captures sarcasm cues from text, image, and text-image interaction views.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the framework's scalability or performance when additional modalities are introduced.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the framework's performance on datasets with more than two modalities, such as video or audio.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the spurious cue removal and re-annotation processes used in MMSD2.0 be generalized to other datasets with similar issues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces MMSD2.0 as a correction dataset that removes spurious cues and re-annotates unreasonable samples.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of these processes to other datasets or tasks beyond sarcasm detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies applying the spurious cue removal and re-annotation processes to other datasets and evaluating the impact on model performance and bias.

## Limitations

- The specific impact of each debiasing step (spurious cue removal vs re-annotation) is not individually validated through ablation studies
- The paper lacks analysis of inter-annotator agreement and quality control measures for the crowdsourced re-annotations
- No comparison with alternative model architectures that could achieve similar performance without the multi-view complexity

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Claims about the existence of spurious cues (hashtags and emojis) in the original MMSD dataset and their potential to create model bias.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about the effectiveness of the multi-view CLIP framework in leveraging pre-trained multimodal knowledge.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the reasonableness of the new annotations in MMSD2.0 without discussion of annotation agreement or quality control.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on spurious cues**: Run experiments on MMSD2.0 with and without hashtag/emoji removal to quantify the specific contribution of debiasing to overall performance improvement.

2. **Individual view contribution analysis**: Measure the performance of text-only, image-only, and interaction views separately, then analyze their relative contributions through ablation and feature importance analysis.

3. **Annotation quality validation**: Conduct inter-annotator agreement analysis on the crowdsourced re-annotations and compare with alternative annotation approaches to verify the reasonableness of the new labels.
