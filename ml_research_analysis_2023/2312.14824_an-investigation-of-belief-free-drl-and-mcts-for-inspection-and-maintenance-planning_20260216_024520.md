# An investigation of belief-free DRL and MCTS for inspection and maintenance planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14824
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Belief-free DRL (+RQN) outperforms MCTS in expected life cycle cost while MCTS provides lower cost variance

## Executive Summary
This paper compares two reinforcement learning approaches for maintenance planning of a deteriorating component: a deep recurrent Q-network architecture (+RQN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The +RQN architecture is designed to handle partially observable Markov decision processes by embedding observation-action history directly into LSTM hidden states, bypassing explicit belief state computation. The performance of both methods is evaluated on a single-component deterioration problem with varying levels of observation noise, showing that +RQN achieves lower expected life cycle costs across all noise levels while MCTS provides slightly lower cost variance.

## Method Summary
The study compares +RQN (a belief-free deep recurrent Q-network with dueling architecture) against MCTS for maintenance planning of a deteriorating component. The problem is formulated as a POMDP where deterioration state D and rate K evolve stochastically, but only noisy observations of D are available. +RQN uses LSTM layers to implicitly track belief states through observation-action history, while MCTS explicitly computes belief states using UCT for action selection. Both methods are evaluated on their ability to minimize expected life cycle costs across different observation noise levels.

## Key Results
- +RQN achieves lower expected life cycle costs than MCTS across all observation noise levels
- MCTS provides slightly lower cost variance compared to +RQN
- +RQN network achieves faster computation times once trained compared to MCTS
- Performance gap widens as observation noise increases, with +RQN maintaining advantage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: +RQN bypasses belief state computation by embedding observation-action history directly into LSTM hidden states
- Mechanism: LSTM layer maintains high-dimensional state that approximates belief without explicit Bayesian updates
- Core assumption: The LSTM can learn sufficient statistics of belief from observation-action sequences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "+RQN architecture dispenses with computing the belief state and directly handles erroneous observations"
  - [section 3.1]: "The LSTM layer can be interpreted as a high-dimensional embedding of the history or a high-dimensional approximator of the belief state"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus support for LSTM approximating belief
- Break condition: LSTM fails to capture long-term dependencies or belief structure when observation noise is too high

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dueling architecture separates value and advantage estimation for more stable Q-value learning
- Mechanism: V network estimates state value, A network estimates action advantages, combined to form Q-values with mean correction
- Core assumption: Separating V and A improves optimization stability compared to standard Q-network
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "Wang et al. [51] report that this configuration has superior performance compared to standard DQNs"
  - [section 3.2]: Explicit formula for Q-value using V and A streams with mean correction
  - [corpus]: Weak - Wang et al. referenced but not directly examined in corpus
- Break condition: Value and advantage streams become poorly correlated, leading to unstable updates

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MCTS with UCT balances exploration and exploitation through visitation count-based exploration term
- Mechanism: Action selection uses Q-value estimate minus exploration bonus proportional to ln(parent visits)/action visits
- Core assumption: Exploration bonus appropriately balances exploitation of known good actions with trying less-visited options
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "To make use of the exploitation-exploration tradeoff [54], we implement the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm"
  - [section 4.2]: Explicit UCT formula showing exploitation term minus exploration term
  - [corpus]: Weak - only general MCTS concepts, no specific UCT performance evidence
- Break condition: Constant c in UCT formula is poorly tuned, leading to either insufficient exploration or excessive random behavior

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: The maintenance planning problem involves hidden deterioration state observable only through noisy measurements
  - Quick check question: What are the three key components of a POMDP compared to a regular MDP?

- Concept: Belief state and belief-MDP transformation
  - Why needed here: Understanding why traditional approaches compute belief states helps explain why +RQN's approach is novel
  - Quick check question: How does the belief state capture all information available to the decision maker?

- Concept: Deep Q-Networks and dueling architecture
  - Why needed here: +RQN builds on DQN architecture with dueling streams for improved stability
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Q(s,a), V(s), and A(s,a) in the dueling architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Observation and previous action → FC layers → LSTM → FC layers → Dueling streams (V and A) → Q-values
- Critical path: Data flows from observation/action input through LSTM to produce Q-values for action selection
- Design tradeoffs: Belief-free approach trades computational simplicity for potential suboptimality compared to belief-based methods
- Failure signatures: Poor performance with high observation noise, failure to capture belief structure, unstable training with improper hyperparameters
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train +RQN on low observation noise case and verify convergence to near-optimal policy
  2. Test MCTS with varying numbers of rollouts to find performance/computation tradeoff
  3. Compare belief state tracking in +RQN trajectories against ground truth belief to assess approximation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the performance of the +RQN architecture change when the belief state is included as an additional input?
- What is the impact of observation error on the MCTS performance when using erroneous observations instead of exact beliefs?
- How does the performance of the +RQN architecture generalize to different system lifetimes and deterioration distributions?

## Limitations

- LSTM belief approximation may fail under high observation noise conditions
- Performance comparison limited to single-component system
- Limited exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity in both methods

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The comparative methodology and experimental design are sound
- Medium Confidence: The dueling architecture improves Q-value stability (supported by literature but not directly validated here)
- Low Confidence: The LSTM can reliably approximate belief states without explicit tracking (mechanism not empirically verified)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing +RQN performance with and without the LSTM belief approximation component
2. Measure the actual divergence between +RQN's implicit belief estimates and ground truth belief states across different noise levels
3. Test both methods on more complex multi-component systems to assess scalability of the performance claims
