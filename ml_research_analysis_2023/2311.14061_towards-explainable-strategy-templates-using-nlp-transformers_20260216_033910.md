# Towards Explainable Strategy Templates using NLP Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.14061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14061
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Framework converts complex mathematical strategy templates from DRL into natural language explanations using NLP techniques

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework that translates complex mathematical strategy templates from Deep Reinforcement Learning into natural language explanations. The method combines symbolic math parsing using SymPy, semantic role identification with spaCy, and GPT-4 enrichment to create user-friendly explanations of DRL strategies. Demonstrated on automated agent negotiation scenarios, the approach makes DRL strategies more accessible to non-technical users while acknowledging that fully automating explanation validation remains an open challenge.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a six-step workflow to convert mathematical strategy templates into natural language explanations. It begins with SymPy parsing mathematical expressions into identifiable units (variables, constants, functions, operators, and structure), then uses spaCy to extract semantic meanings of these entities. A rule-based system maps these parsed elements to predefined linguistic structures, which are then enriched with GPT-4 to create more natural explanations. The framework includes customization for different audiences (expert vs layperson) and validation using BERT for semantic accuracy and clarity.

## Key Results
- Successfully translates mathematical strategy templates into natural language explanations
- Demonstrates customization capabilities for different audience types (expert vs layperson)
- Shows potential for making DRL strategies accessible to non-technical users
- Identifies automated explanation validation as an open challenge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mathematical expressions are translated into natural language by decomposing them into identifiable units using symbolic parsing
- Mechanism: SymPy parses expressions into variables, constants, functions, operators, and structure for rule-based mapping
- Core assumption: Mathematical expressions follow consistent syntactic patterns that can be reliably decomposed
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions parsing mathematical expressions; section describes parsing into identifiable units like variables, constants, functions, operators; corpus evidence is weak with no direct papers addressing symbolic math parsing for NLP explanation generation
- Break condition: If expressions contain ambiguous or non-standard notation that SymPy cannot parse consistently

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic roles of variables and expressions are extracted using NLP techniques to provide context for translation
- Mechanism: spaCy identifies semantic roles of mathematical entities, mapping them to human-understandable concepts
- Core assumption: Semantic roles can be accurately identified from mathematical notation using NLP
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions semantically interpreting variables and structures; section describes using spaCy to correlate mathematical entities with semantic roles; corpus evidence is weak with no direct papers addressing semantic role identification for mathematical variables
- Break condition: If mathematical notation lacks clear semantic meaning or if spaCy cannot accurately identify roles

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4 enriches basic rule-based explanations to make them more natural and human-like
- Mechanism: Basic explanations are passed to GPT-4 for elaboration and simplification
- Core assumption: GPT-4 can generate coherent, contextually appropriate natural language from structured input
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions utilizing GPT to refine and contextualize explanations; section provides example of GPT-4 elaboration from basic phrasing to detailed explanation; corpus evidence is weak with no direct papers addressing using GPT-4 for explaining mathematical strategy templates
- Break condition: If GPT-4 generates explanations that are inaccurate or fail to capture intended meaning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symbolic mathematics parsing using SymPy
  - Why needed here: To decompose mathematical expressions into identifiable units for translation
  - Quick check question: What Python library is used to parse and symbolically manipulate mathematical expressions in this framework?

- Concept: Semantic role identification using spaCy
  - Why needed here: To decode the roles and semantic significance of variables and expressions
  - Quick check question: Which NLP library is used to correlate mathematical entities with semantic roles?

- Concept: Transformer-based text generation using GPT-4
  - Why needed here: To enrich basic explanations and make them more natural and human-like
  - Quick check question: Which model is used to refine and contextualize the explanations generated by the rule-based system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SymPy -> spaCy -> Rule-based system -> GPT-4 -> BERT
- Critical path: Parse mathematical expression → Extract semantic meaning → Create rule-based system → Enrich explanation with GPT-4 → Customize explanation style → Validate and refine explanations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Rule-based vs. fully automated explanation generation: Rule-based provides structure but may lack flexibility
  - GPT-4 enrichment: Improves naturalness but adds complexity and potential for inaccuracy
- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to parse complex mathematical expressions
  - Inaccurate semantic role identification
  - GPT-4 generating irrelevant or incorrect explanations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test SymPy parsing on simple mathematical expressions from strategy templates
  2. Verify spaCy semantic role identification for variables in mathematical expressions
  3. Evaluate GPT-4 enrichment of basic rule-based explanations on a sample strategy template

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the automated validation process be improved to ensure explanations are both accurate and comprehensible across diverse domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that "ensuring an automated process of comprehensibility and relevance in generated explanations of different mathematical strategies still remains an open challenge."
- Why unresolved: The current approach relies on manual review and BERT for semantic validation, which may not fully capture the nuances required for diverse domains like finance or logistics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of automated validation metrics that measure both accuracy and comprehensibility across multiple domains, with empirical validation showing improved user understanding.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the framework handle increasingly complex mathematical expressions while maintaining clarity in explanations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the framework on strategy templates but doesn't test its limits with more complex mathematical expressions or larger strategy templates.
- Why unresolved: The current framework's scalability and ability to maintain explanation quality with increased complexity is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing with progressively more complex strategy templates, measuring explanation quality and user comprehension across complexity levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be extended to generate interactive explanations that allow users to ask follow-up questions about specific strategy components?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "interactive query handling" as part of the proposed workflow but doesn't detail how this would be implemented.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the concept but doesn't provide implementation details or testing of interactive capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and user testing of an interactive explanation system that allows users to query specific components of strategy templates, measuring effectiveness through user studies.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of symbolic parsing and semantic role identification, with no empirical validation across diverse mathematical expressions
- GPT-4 enrichment introduces potential for generating explanations that may sound plausible but contain inaccuracies
- The approach appears tested only on negotiation strategy templates, limiting generalizability to other DRL applications
- Fully automating explanation validation remains an open challenge

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The multi-component architecture combining SymPy, spaCy, rule-based systems, and GPT-4 for explanation generation is technically sound and follows established NLP practices. The workflow structure and integration of multiple techniques is well-specified.

**Medium Confidence**: The translation from mathematical expressions to natural language explanations through rule-based systems is plausible given the described mechanisms, but the specific rules and their coverage are not detailed. The semantic role identification approach using spaCy is reasonable but unproven for mathematical notation.

**Low Confidence**: The GPT-4 enrichment's ability to consistently produce accurate, contextually appropriate explanations for complex strategy templates is uncertain without systematic evaluation. The customization for different audience types lacks specific implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. **Symbolic Parsing Robustness**: Test SymPy's ability to parse a diverse set of mathematical expressions from different DRL strategy templates to identify edge cases or parsing failures.

2. **Semantic Role Accuracy**: Evaluate spaCy's semantic role identification on mathematical variables by comparing automated assignments against human-annotated semantic meanings across multiple template domains.

3. **Explanation Validation Protocol**: Develop and apply a systematic evaluation framework to assess the accuracy and clarity of GPT-4-enriched explanations, including both automated metrics and human expert review.
