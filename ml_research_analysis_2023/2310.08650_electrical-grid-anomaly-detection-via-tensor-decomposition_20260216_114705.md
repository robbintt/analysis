# Electrical Grid Anomaly Detection via Tensor Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.08650
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08650
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Tensor decomposition significantly outperforms PCA and NMF in detecting power grid attacks in SCADA systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel application of tensor decomposition for anomaly detection in electrical grid SCADA systems. The authors employ Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) to model multi-dimensional interactions in SCADA events, capturing complex relationships between RTU ID, number of points requested, channel, and time. Through extensive testing on synthetic anomalies, the tensor-based approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional matrix factorization methods, achieving PR AUC scores up to 0.996 on various attack scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method constructs tensor representations of SCADA messages with dimensions including RTU ID, number of points requested, channel, and time. CP-APR tensor decomposition is applied to learn normal patterns from real-world SCADA data, with Poisson regression handling the sparse count nature of the data. The trained models score individual messages using P-values derived from the learned Poisson distributions, enabling real-time anomaly detection. Performance is evaluated against synthetic attacks generated by a proprietary simulator and compared to PCA and NMF baselines.

## Key Results
- Tensor decomposition achieved PR AUC scores of 0.996, 0.973, and 0.973 on three different attack scenarios
- The time-exclusive tensor model outperformed the time-inclusive model on all tests
- Tensor-based models significantly outperformed PCA and NMF baselines across all attack types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tensor decomposition captures multi-dimensional interactions in SCADA messages better than matrix factorization. By representing data as a tensor with dimensions like RTU ID, Points Requested, Channel, and Time, the model preserves complex relationships that would be lost when flattening into a matrix. This enables detection of anomalies that only manifest across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

### Mechanism 2
CP-APR with Poisson regression is particularly suited for sparse count data in SCADA systems. The Poisson distribution naturally models count data and CP-APR's multiplicative update algorithm efficiently handles the extreme sparsity in SCADA message tensors by computing only non-zero values.

### Mechanism 3
The probabilistic framework enables real-time scoring of individual messages. Each message is scored by calculating its P-value under the learned Poisson distribution, allowing immediate anomaly detection during testing without batch processing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor decomposition (CP-APR)
  - Why needed here: SCADA messages have multiple interacting attributes that need to be modeled simultaneously
  - Quick check question: What advantage does tensor decomposition have over matrix factorization for multi-dimensional data?

- Concept: Poisson regression for count data
  - Why needed here: SCADA messages are naturally represented as counts of events rather than continuous measurements
  - Quick check question: Why is Poisson regression more appropriate than Gaussian assumptions for sparse count data?

- Concept: P-value based anomaly scoring
  - Why needed here: Enables real-time detection of anomalous messages as they arrive
  - Quick check question: How does calculating a P-value for each message enable immediate anomaly detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → Tensor construction → CP-APR training → P-value scoring → Anomaly flagging
- Critical path: Training data preparation → Tensor decomposition model training → Anomaly detection deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Higher-dimensional tensors capture more complex relationships but increase computational complexity and require more training data
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on time-dimension anomalies, overfitting to training data patterns, inability to detect novel attack types
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare tensor decomposition performance with and without time dimension on black box attack data
  2. Test model sensitivity by varying the rank parameter and measuring AUC scores
  3. Evaluate detection performance on anomalies that only differ in temporal patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the inclusion of more message types and values into a higher-order tensor affect the accuracy and specificity of anomaly detection in SCADA systems?

### Open Question 2
What are the optimal temporal granularity estimation techniques for SCADA messages, and how would they impact the accuracy of anomaly detection models?

### Open Question 3
How would the inclusion of time as a dimension in the tensor representation affect the model's ability to detect anomalies that occur at abnormal times but have correct values?

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetically generated attacks rather than naturally occurring intrusions
- Anonymized data prevents validation on other electrical grid systems, limiting generalizability
- Computational requirements for high-dimensional tensor decomposition may become prohibitive at scale

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (multi-dimensional modeling): High confidence
- Mechanism 2 (Poisson regression for sparse counts): Medium confidence
- Mechanism 3 (real-time P-value scoring): Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on naturally occurring anomalies or real intrusion datasets to validate synthetic attack representativeness
2. Conduct computational scaling analysis to determine maximum message throughput for real-time anomaly detection
3. Validate detection performance across multiple electrical grid systems to assess generalizability beyond the LANL dataset
