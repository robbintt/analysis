# Towards a Standardized Reinforcement Learning Framework for AAM Contingency Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10805
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10805
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Framework integrates contingency management as MDP within AAM-Gym simulation for RL algorithm prototyping and evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for contingency management in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). The authors formulate the contingency management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and integrate it into the AAM-Gym simulation environment. This enables rapid prototyping and evaluation of RL algorithms for safety-critical decision-making during AAM flights. The framework includes models for various hazards such as battery consumption uncertainty, navigation loss, and wind fields. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the likelihood of aircraft reaching their destination is strongly correlated with initial energy levels, with higher energy levels resulting in better performance. The framework provides a community benchmark for future RL algorithm development in AAM contingency management.

## Method Summary
The method involves formulating contingency management as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the AAM-Gym simulation environment. The MDP includes state variables like aircraft heading, altitude, speed, energy level, and wind information. Actions include heading changes, landing, no alert, and using the assigned flight route. Rewards are based on terminal states and landing outcomes using multivariate Gaussian distributions. The framework is implemented using BlueSky as the backend and UAMToolkit for traffic generation. Preliminary experiments vary maximum initial energy levels and probability of navigation loss to evaluate performance.

## Key Results
- Framework enables rapid prototyping of RL algorithms for contingency management
- Preliminary results show strong correlation between initial energy levels and aircraft reaching destination
- Provides community benchmark for future RL algorithm development in AAM contingency management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework enables rapid prototyping of RL algorithms by integrating contingency management as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the AAM-Gym simulation environment.
- Mechanism: MDP formulation provides a structured way to represent the state transitions, actions, and rewards for the RL agent to learn optimal contingency policies. AAM-Gym provides a realistic simulation environment for the agent to interact with and learn from.
- Core assumption: The MDP accurately models the contingency management problem and the AAM-Gym environment is representative of real-world AAM operations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In this work, we formulate the contingency management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and integrate the contingency management MDP into the AAM-Gym simulation framework."
  - [section III.A] "By leveraging AAM-Gym, new RL use-cases, such as contingency management, can be developed to explore the trade-offs of AI/RL-based decision-making functions with existing approaches."
- Break condition: If the MDP formulation does not accurately capture the key aspects of the contingency management problem, or if AAM-Gym does not provide a sufficiently realistic simulation environment, the learned policies may not generalize well to real-world scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework allows for systematic evaluation and comparison of different RL algorithms for contingency management.
- Mechanism: By providing a standardized environment (AAM-Gym) and MDP formulation, the framework enables fair comparison of different RL algorithms on the same set of metrics and scenarios. This allows for objective assessment of algorithm performance.
- Core assumption: The metrics defined in the framework accurately capture the key aspects of contingency management performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This enables rapid prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluation of existing systems, thus providing a community benchmark for future algorithm development."
  - [section IV.E] "The RL framework extends the capabilities of AAM-Gym and allows users to define performance metrics to help assess the CM algorithm within a Hydra configuration file."
- Break condition: If the defined metrics do not accurately reflect the real-world requirements for contingency management, the comparisons may not be meaningful for practical deployment.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework allows for exploration of the impact of different hazard models on contingency management performance.
- Mechanism: The framework includes models for various hazards such as battery consumption uncertainty, navigation loss, and wind fields. By varying these hazard models, the impact on contingency management performance can be studied.
- Core assumption: The hazard models included in the framework accurately represent the real-world hazards that AAM vehicles may encounter.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.C] "The hazards initially modeled by the RL framework include: uncertainty in battery consumption, max charge capacity due to number of charge cycles, wind information, and navigation capability."
  - [section IV.A] "This experiment explores the impact of modeling an increased consumption rate on the battery model, differences in maximum charge capacity, and activating probability of loss of navigation, Pnav, per aircraft per simulation step."
- Break condition: If the hazard models are not comprehensive or do not accurately represent real-world hazards, the learned policies may not be robust to the full range of contingencies that could occur in practice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: MDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling the contingency management problem as a sequential decision-making process with stochastic transitions.
  - Quick check question: What are the five key components of an MDP?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Why needed here: RL algorithms can learn optimal policies for the MDP by maximizing cumulative rewards through repeated interaction with the environment.
  - Quick check question: What is the main objective of an RL agent in an MDP?

- Concept: Simulation environments for RL
  - Why needed here: A realistic simulation environment like AAM-Gym is needed to train and evaluate RL algorithms for contingency management without risking real aircraft or passengers.
  - Quick check question: What are the key requirements for a simulation environment to be suitable for RL training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - AAM-Gym simulation environment -> UAMToolKit for traffic generation -> MDP formulation for contingency management -> Hazard models (battery, navigation, wind) -> RL algorithm implementation -> Performance metrics definition

- Critical path:
  - Generate traffic scenarios with UAMToolKit
  - Initialize AAM-Gym with hazard models and MDP
  - Train RL agent through interaction with AAM-Gym
  - Evaluate agent performance using defined metrics
  - Iterate on hazard models and MDP design as needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity of MDP state and action spaces vs. learning efficiency
  - Fidelity of hazard models vs. computational tractability
  - Choice of RL algorithm vs. sample efficiency and convergence properties
  - Level of realism in AAM-Gym vs. simulation speed

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on held-out test scenarios
  - Instability or divergence during training
  - Policies that are overly conservative or overly risky
  - Failure to account for key hazards or contingencies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate a simple RL algorithm (e.g. DQN) on a basic MDP with a single hazard (e.g. battery uncertainty) and compare to a rule-based baseline.
  2. Vary the maximum initial energy level and observe the impact on the fraction of aircraft reaching their destination, as in the preliminary results.
  3. Add a second hazard (e.g. navigation loss) and evaluate the impact on contingency management performance compared to the single-hazard case.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different reinforcement learning algorithms perform in the AAM contingency management framework when faced with various hazards like battery consumption uncertainty and navigation loss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work will explore various state-of-the-art RL approaches and tune selected ones through surrogate optimization.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents preliminary results with unequipped scenarios and does not evaluate any RL algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics comparing multiple RL algorithms (e.g., DQN, PPO, A3C) across different hazard configurations and energy levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal reward structure for training RL agents in contingency management scenarios that balance safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents a reward model with components for state, hazard, and action rewards, but notes that further analysis is required.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses a basic reward structure and does not explore how different reward configurations affect agent behavior or performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of agent performance using different reward structures (e.g., weighted combinations, sparse vs. dense rewards) and their impact on safety metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the complexity of the state space affect the learning performance and generalization ability of RL agents in AAM contingency management?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that AAM-Gym allows access to extensive aircraft and environment information, but does not investigate the impact of state space complexity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not present experiments varying the state space complexity or analyzing the relationship between state dimensionality and agent performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing agent performance with different subsets of available state information and analysis of learning curves and generalization across scenarios.

## Limitations

- Does not conclusively prove framework's ability to improve upon existing contingency management approaches

## Confidence

- **Medium**: The framework's potential to provide a community benchmark for future RL algorithm development, pending further validation and comparison studies.
- **Low**: The framework's ability to significantly improve upon existing contingency management approaches, as the preliminary experiments do not include a direct comparison to baseline methods.

## Next Checks

2. **Baseline Comparison**: Implement and evaluate a rule-based or model-based contingency management algorithm within the AAM-Gym framework to establish a baseline for comparison with RL-based approaches.

3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate the learned policies' robustness to variations in hazard models, MDP parameters, and simulation scenarios to ensure generalization to real-world contingencies.
