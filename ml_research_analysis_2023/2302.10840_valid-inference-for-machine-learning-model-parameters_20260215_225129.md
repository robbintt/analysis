# Valid Inference for Machine Learning Model Parameters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.10840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10840
- Reference count: 3
- The paper proposes a framework for constructing valid confidence sets for the risk minimizer of a machine learning model using ε-neighborhoods around the empirical risk minimizer.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of making valid inferences about machine learning model parameters by constructing confidence sets that contain the true risk minimizer with specified probability. The key innovation is examining the ε-neighborhood around the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) and showing this forms a valid confidence set when the empirical risk uniformly converges to the population risk. The framework leverages bootstrapping techniques to estimate the distribution of these confidence sets without requiring knowledge of the data-generating distribution, enabling the assignment of confidence levels to arbitrary regions of the parameter space.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs confidence sets by examining ε-neighborhoods around the empirical risk minimizer (ERM). It first computes the ERM on observed data, then defines the set of ε-almost empirical risk minimizers (ε-AERMs) as those parameters within ε of the ERM in terms of risk. This ε-neighborhood forms a valid confidence set for the true risk minimizer under uniform convergence assumptions. The paper demonstrates that bootstrapping can estimate the distribution of these confidence sets by resampling from the observed data and computing ε-AERMs for each resample. This allows for assigning confidence levels to arbitrary parameter regions using belief and plausibility functions from imprecise probability theory.

## Key Results
- The ε-neighborhood around the empirical risk minimizer forms a valid confidence set for the true risk minimizer under uniform convergence
- Bootstrapping can estimate the distribution of confidence sets without knowledge of the data-generating distribution
- Sets with low plausibility cannot contain the risk minimizer, enabling valid hypothesis testing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ε-neighborhood around the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) forms a valid confidence set for the true risk minimizer.
- Mechanism: If the empirical risk uniformly converges to the population risk, then the ERM is close to the true risk minimizer with high probability. By examining a sufficiently large ε-neighborhood around the ERM, we can ensure this neighborhood contains the true risk minimizer with high probability.
- Core assumption: The ML model has the uniform convergence property with respect to the data-generating distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The key idea is to examine the ε-neighborhood around the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) and show that this set is a valid confidence set for the true risk minimizer if the empirical risk uniformly converges to the population risk."
  - [section 4] "THEOREM 1. Let (H,L) have uniform convergence function f. Suppose that the risk minimizer θ0 exists. Then ˆΘεS is a 1−α level confidence set for θ0 if m≥f(ε/2,α)."
- Break condition: If the uniform convergence property does not hold, the ERM may be far from the true risk minimizer, and the ε-neighborhood may not contain it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bootstrapping can estimate the distribution of valid confidence sets without knowledge of the data-generating distribution.
- Mechanism: By resampling from the observed data and computing the set of ε-AERMs for each resample, we can approximate the distribution of these sets. This allows us to assign confidence levels to arbitrary regions of the parameter space.
- Core assumption: The ML model has the strong uniform convergence property, which extends uniform convergence to bootstrap resampling distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we demonstrate that this distribution can be well-approximated using bootstrapping techniques."
  - [section 6] "In order for bootstrapping to be useful, we require slightly stronger conditions on our ML model: DEFINITION 10. An ML model (H,L) has the strong uniform convergence property..."
- Break condition: If the strong uniform convergence property does not hold, the bootstrap distribution may not accurately reflect the true distribution of the confidence sets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sets of low plausibility cannot contain the risk minimizer.
- Mechanism: By studying the distribution of valid confidence sets (via belief and plausibility functions from imprecise probability theory), we can assign a notion of confidence to arbitrary regions of the parameter space. Sets with low plausibility are unlikely to contain the risk minimizer.
- Core assumption: The distribution of the set of ε-AERMs can be characterized by belief and plausibility functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show that studying the distribution of this confidence set allows us to assign a notion of confidence to arbitrary regions of the parameter space"
  - [section 5] "Knowledge of the distribution of ε-AERMs can be used to assign a conﬁdence to the proposition that a given region of the parameter space contains the risk minimizer."
- Break condition: If the belief and plausibility functions do not accurately characterize the distribution of the confidence sets, the assigned confidence levels may be incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Uniform convergence property
  - Why needed here: The uniform convergence property is the core assumption that allows the ε-neighborhood around the ERM to form a valid confidence set. Without it, the ERM may not be close to the true risk minimizer.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the uniform convergence property and the strong uniform convergence property? (Answer: The strong version extends uniform convergence to bootstrap resampling distributions.)

- Concept: Imprecise probability theory
  - Why needed here: Imprecise probability theory, specifically belief and plausibility functions, is used to characterize the distribution of the set of ε-AERMs. This allows us to assign confidence levels to arbitrary regions of the parameter space.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between belief and plausibility functions? (Answer: Belief functions are lower bounds on the probability that the risk minimizer is in a set, while plausibility functions are upper bounds.)

- Concept: Bootstrapping
  - Why needed here: Bootstrapping is used to estimate the distribution of valid confidence sets when the data-generating distribution is unknown. This allows us to assign confidence levels to arbitrary regions of the parameter space without making strong assumptions about the data.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the sample plausibility and the bootstrapped plausibility? (Answer: Sample plausibility is based on a single sample, while bootstrapped plausibility is based on the distribution of resamples from that sample.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ML model (H,L) -> ERM computation -> ε-neighborhood construction -> Bootstrapping module -> Belief/plausibility functions
- Critical path:
  1. Compute ERM on observed data
  2. Compute set of ε-AERMs around ERM
  3. If desired, use bootstrapping to estimate distribution of ε-AERMs
  4. Compute belief and plausibility functions for regions of interest
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Choice of ε: Larger ε gives more valid confidence sets but less informative regions
  - Choice of resampling method: Different methods may give different bootstrap distributions
  - Computational cost: Bootstrapping can be expensive, especially for complex models
- Failure signatures:
  - Confidence sets that are too large or too small
  - Bootstrapped distributions that do not match the true distribution
  - Belief and plausibility functions that do not accurately reflect the true probabilities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify uniform convergence property for a simple ML model (e.g., linear regression)
  2. Compute valid confidence sets for a known parameter using the ε-neighborhood approach
  3. Compare bootstrapped and true distributions of confidence sets for a simple model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do non-uniformly-learnable machine learning models perform under the proposed framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to study to what extent the theory still applies to non-uniformly-learnable ML models.
- Why unresolved: The paper only considers models with the uniform convergence property, leaving the performance of other models unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the framework to non-uniformly-learnable models, analyzing the validity and coverage of the resulting confidence sets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the statistical power of the hypothesis tests that use valid plausibilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to investigate the statistical power of the hypothesis tests that use valid plausibilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on validity and coverage, but does not analyze the power of the resulting tests.
- What evidence would resolve it: Power calculations and simulations comparing the tests to alternative approaches, determining the optimal sample sizes and significance levels for desired power levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can tighter bounds on uniform convergence functions be obtained for common machine learning models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the confidence sets and hypothesis tests can be overly-conservative and plan to investigate tighter bounds.
- Why unresolved: The paper relies on general bounds, which can lead to conservative results. Tighter bounds specific to common models could improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deriving and validating tighter bounds for uniform convergence functions for popular models like neural networks, SVMs, etc., using techniques like Rademacher complexity or covering numbers.

## Limitations
- The framework relies critically on the uniform convergence property, which may not hold for all models or data distributions
- Bootstrapping requires the stronger uniform convergence property, which is an even more restrictive assumption
- The choice of ε presents a fundamental tradeoff between validity and informativeness of confidence sets

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The theoretical framework for constructing valid confidence sets using ε-neighborhoods around the ERM, assuming uniform convergence
- Medium Confidence: The practical utility of bootstrapping to estimate the distribution of confidence sets and assign confidence levels to arbitrary regions
- Medium Confidence: The application of belief and plausibility functions from imprecise probability theory to characterize confidence set distributions

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical validation of uniform convergence**: Test the uniform convergence property for common ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forests) on benchmark datasets to verify the foundational assumption holds in practice.
2. **Bootstrap coverage analysis**: Systematically evaluate the coverage properties of bootstrapped confidence sets across different parameter regions, sample sizes, and data distributions to identify scenarios where the strong uniform convergence property may fail.
3. **Computational efficiency benchmarking**: Measure the computational costs of the full pipeline (ERM computation, ε-neighborhood construction, bootstrapping) for models of increasing complexity to assess practical scalability.
