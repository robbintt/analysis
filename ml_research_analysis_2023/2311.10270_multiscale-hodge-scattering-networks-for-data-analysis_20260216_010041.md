# Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10270
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MHSNs achieve competitive results on signal and graph classification with far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art GNNs, including 86.1% accuracy for 5-NN graph article classification and MAE of 3.13 for aspirin molecular energy prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks (MHSNs), a novel feature extraction method for signals defined on simplicial complexes of arbitrary dimension. The approach generalizes geometric scattering networks by using multiscale basis dictionaries (κ-HGLET and κ-GHWT) on simplicial complexes instead of diffusion wavelets on graphs. The method cascades moments of the modulus of dictionary coefficients in a layered structure similar to CNNs, producing features that are invariant to reordering of simplices. MHSNs demonstrate strong performance on signal classification, domain classification, and molecular dynamics prediction tasks while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability.

## Method Summary
MHSNs extract features from signals on simplicial complexes by cascading moments of the modulus of multiscale basis dictionary coefficients. The method constructs κ-HGLET and κ-GHWT dictionaries using hierarchical bipartition trees, applies these dictionaries to the input signal, and computes moments of the modulus of the resulting coefficients. These features are invariant to simplex reordering and capture multiscale geometric structure. The method naturally supports local pooling operations through the hierarchical partition tree. For classification tasks, features are extracted and used with simple models like SVM with Gaussian kernel, while for regression tasks like molecular dynamics prediction, SVR with Gaussian kernel is employed.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.1% accuracy for 5-NN graph article category classification, outperforming traditional methods
- Competitive results on domain classification with significantly fewer parameters (e.g., 3,784 vs 340,000 for DimeNet on molecular dynamics)
- Obtained MAE of 3.13 for energy prediction of aspirin molecule, demonstrating effectiveness for molecular dynamics applications
- Successfully applied to Science News dataset (1042 articles, 8 categories) and various benchmark graph datasets (COLLAB, DD, IMDB-B, IMDB-M, MUTAG, PROTEINS, PTC)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The multiscale basis dictionaries (κ-GHWT and κ-HGLET) enable efficient signal decomposition by leveraging hierarchical partitioning of the simplicial complex.
- Mechanism: The hierarchical bipartition tree partitions the simplicial complex at multiple scales, creating a collection of orthogonal bases where each level corresponds to a different scale of detail. This allows for sparse approximations of signals that are piecewise constant over the partitioned regions.
- Core assumption: The signals on simplicial complexes are locally smooth or piecewise constant, making them well-approximated by the multiscale basis functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Both the κ-GHWT and the κ-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors"
  - [section 2.3]: "The κ-HGLET is a generalization of the Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET) from functions on the nodes of a graph, to functions on the κ-simplices in a given simplicial complex"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus lacks direct discussion of basis dictionaries' approximation properties
- Break condition: If signals are highly oscillatory or lack local structure, the sparse approximation advantage diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The scattering transform architecture with modulus nonlinearities provides translation/quasi-invariance and stability to deformations.
- Mechanism: By cascading wavelet convolutions with pointwise modulus operations, the network creates features that are invariant to local deformations while preserving discriminative information. The hierarchical structure ensures stability to small perturbations.
- Core assumption: The underlying signals have geometric structure that can be captured by wavelet-like filters at multiple scales.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients"
  - [section 3]: "The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus focuses on other methods rather than scattering transform properties
- Break condition: If the signal variations are too rapid or the underlying structure is highly irregular, the invariance properties may break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Local pooling operations defined through the hierarchical partition tree provide more expressive features than global pooling alone.
- Mechanism: Instead of only aggregating features globally across the entire simplicial complex, local pooling operates within each region at each scale of the partition tree, capturing local statistics that are lost in global pooling.
- Core assumption: The local structure of the simplicial complex contains discriminative information that global pooling cannot capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs"
  - [section 3.1]: "We can gather all of the moments ≤ Q and of orders ≤ M to have a total of QPMm=0(JJm) features for a given signal"
  - [section 3.1]: "In general, we can gather all of the moments ≤ Q and of orders ≤ M to have a total of QPMm=0(JJm) features for a given signal"
- Break condition: If the signals are highly localized and the number of simplices is small, local pooling may not provide significant advantages over global pooling.

## Foundational Learning

- Simplicial complexes and Hodge Laplacians:
  - Why needed here: The paper operates on signals defined on simplicial complexes rather than simple graphs, requiring understanding of higher-dimensional structures and their associated Laplacians
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a simplicial complex and a graph, and how does the Hodge Laplacian generalize the graph Laplacian?
- Multiscale basis dictionaries:
  - Why needed here: The method uses κ-GHWT and κ-HGLET dictionaries as the wavelet-like transforms in the scattering network
  - Quick check question: How do the κ-GHWT and κ-HGLET dictionaries differ from traditional wavelet transforms, and why are they suitable for simplicial complexes?
- Scattering transforms:
  - Why needed here: The network architecture cascades moments of modulus operations similar to scattering transforms
  - Quick check question: What properties do scattering transforms provide that make them useful for feature extraction, and how do they differ from learned convolutional filters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input signal on κ-simplices -> Multiscale basis dictionaries (κ-GHWT/κ-HGLET) -> Scattering transform layers (dictionary coefficients, modulus, pooling) -> Invariant features
- Critical path:
  1. Construct simplicial complex from input data
  2. Generate κ-GHWT/κ-HGLET dictionary via hierarchical bipartition
  3. Apply scattering transform with specified pooling strategy
  4. Use extracted features with simple ML model (SVM, logistic regression)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - κ-GHWT vs κ-HGLET: κ-GHWT has O(n log n) computational cost vs O(n³) for κ-HGLET, but κ-HGLET may provide better approximation for certain signals
  - Global vs local pooling: Global pooling provides permutation invariance but may lose local structure; local pooling preserves more information but requires more parameters
  - Order of scattering (M) and number of moments (Q): Higher values provide more expressive features but increase computational cost exponentially
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets where signals are not piecewise constant or lack local structure
  - Computational intractability for very large simplicial complexes due to dictionary generation cost
  - Overfitting when using high-order scattering with insufficient training data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic scattering transform with κ=0 on a small graph dataset to verify correctness
  2. Compare κ-GHWT vs κ-HGLET performance on a dataset with known piecewise constant structure
  3. Test global vs local pooling strategies on a dataset where local structure is known to be important

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How can the MHSN coefficients be interpreted to identify important relationships within graphs that can be used to narrow the training space of various attention mechanisms/graph transformers for large-scale problems?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state this as a planned direction of research: "we will explore how the MHSN coefficients can be used to identify important relationships within graphs that can be used to narrow the training space of various attention mechanisms/graph transformers for large-scale problems."
  - Why unresolved: This is a future research direction mentioned by the authors, not something they have yet investigated or provided results for.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating how MHSN coefficients can effectively identify important graph relationships, and empirical results showing how this information can be used to improve attention mechanisms or graph transformers on large-scale problems.

- **Question**: How can the optimization method proposed by Weber be applied to synthesize an input signal that generates the significant scattering transform coefficients at the specified coefficient indices?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention: "we plan to examine the optimization method proposed by Weber [51, Chap. 4], which synthesizes an input signal that generates the significant scattering transform coefficients at the specified coefficient indices."
  - Why unresolved: This is another future research direction that the authors have not yet explored or provided results for.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of how Weber's optimization method can be applied to MHSN coefficients, along with examples of synthesized input signals and their corresponding significant coefficients.

- **Question**: How can the MHSN be extended to handle node and edge features, as well as higher-order structures beyond simplices?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper focuses on simplicial complexes, the authors mention applications to molecular dynamics and graph classification, which often involve additional node/edge features and higher-order structures. The current MHSN formulation does not explicitly address these aspects.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed discussion or results on how to incorporate node/edge features or handle higher-order structures beyond simplices.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A proposed extension of the MHSN framework to handle node/edge features, along with experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness on problems involving such features. Additionally, a discussion of how to handle higher-order structures beyond simplices and their potential benefits.

## Limitations

- Computational complexity claims for κ-GHWT vs κ-HGLET lack empirical validation on real datasets
- Comparison with state-of-the-art GNNs is limited, as MHSN experiments use much smaller networks without fully exploring architectural differences
- The assumption that signals on simplicial complexes are locally smooth or piecewise constant may not hold for all application domains
- Several key implementation details remain underspecified in the paper

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical foundation of MHSNs and their ability to extract invariant features from simplicial complex data
- **Medium confidence**: The computational efficiency claims and comparison with GNNs, pending more extensive ablation studies
- **Medium confidence**: The molecular dynamics prediction results, as they show promising performance but could benefit from testing on additional molecular systems

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on pooling strategies**: Systematically compare global, local, and no pooling across multiple datasets to quantify the exact contribution of local pooling to performance gains
2. **Computational complexity validation**: Implement both κ-GHWT and κ-HGLET on progressively larger simplicial complexes to empirically verify the claimed O(n log n) vs O(n³) complexity differences
3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test MHSNs on additional molecular dynamics datasets beyond aspirin and paracetamol to assess whether the strong performance generalizes to different molecular families and properties
