# Structured Radial Basis Function Network: Modelling Diversity for Multiple Hypotheses Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.00781
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00781
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Introduces s-RBFN for multi-modal regression using CVT-based diversity control

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Structured Radial Basis Function Network (s-RBFN) to address multi-modal regression problems through an ensemble framework that generates multiple hypotheses. The method trains individual predictors to form centroidal Voronoi tessellations based on their losses and true labels, then uses these predictions to construct a structured dataset for a radial basis function network. This approach enables the s-RBFN to interpolate the loss function and approximate the target distribution while controlling diversity parametrically. The closed-form least-squares solution provides computational efficiency, and experiments demonstrate superior performance on air quality and energy appliance datasets compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
The s-RBFN method involves training multiple hypotheses predictors (MHP) that form centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) based on individual losses and true labels. The structured dataset from CVT predictions serves as input for training a radial basis function network with one basis function per predictor. Diversity is controlled through a parameter ε that shapes tessellation formation. The method offers two training approaches: a closed-form least-squares solution for speed and a gradient-descent variant for flexibility with any loss type. The framework enables efficient interpolation of the meta-loss function while simultaneously fitting the target distribution, with theoretical guarantees for convergence through fixed-point iteration between predictors and CVT mass centers.

## Key Results
- s-RBFN outperforms state-of-the-art models on air quality and energy appliance datasets in terms of RMSE
- Closed-form least-squares training provides computational efficiency compared to iterative methods
- Parametric diversity control via ε parameter prevents mode collapse while maintaining generalization
- Analytical derivations of expected loss for Gaussian basis functions provide insights into ensemble diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The s-RBFN interpolates the loss function of multiple hypothesis predictors by forming a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) based on individual predictor losses.
- Mechanism: During training, each predictor forms a CVT region. The s-RBFN uses these regions' predictions as input data, with one basis function centered per predictor. This allows the s-RBFN to approximate the meta-loss function while simultaneously fitting the target distribution.
- Core assumption: The individual predictors' losses can be accurately represented by a structured radial basis function network where each basis function corresponds to a CVT region.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "During the training of the predictors, first the centroidal Voronoi tessellations are formed based on their losses and the true labels... A radial basis function network, with each basis function focused on a particular hypothesis, is subsequently trained using this structured dataset."
  - [section]: "It is proved that this structured model can efficiently interpolate this tessellation and approximate the multiple hypotheses target distribution and is equivalent to interpolating the meta-loss of the predictors."
- Break condition: If the predictors fail to form meaningful CVTs (e.g., due to poor initialization or similar loss values), the basis functions cannot adequately represent the loss landscape.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The s-RBFN enables closed-form least-squares training while controlling diversity parametrically.
- Mechanism: The structured dataset from CVT predictions allows least-squares optimization of s-RBFN weights. The diversity parameter ε controls how tessellations are formed, preventing mode collapse and allowing trade-offs between diversity and generalization.
- Core assumption: The CVT-based structured dataset enables efficient least-squares optimization without sacrificing the ability to model diverse hypotheses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The least-squares approach for training the structured ensemble model provides a closed-form solution for multiple hypotheses and structured predictions."
  - [section]: "The s-RBFN by least-squares is presented which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the fastest algorithm for structured regression including parametric diversity in ensemble learning."
- Break condition: If the structured dataset becomes too sparse or ill-conditioned (e.g., very few samples per CVT region), least-squares may fail or produce unstable solutions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The s-RBFN has a fixed-point iteration algorithm between predictors and CVT mass centers during training.
- Mechanism: The s-RBFN fitting process creates a mapping between predictor predictions and CVT mass centers. This is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for CVT optimization, enabling global and local convergence guarantees.
- Core assumption: The s-RBFN loss minimization process can be represented as a fixed-point iteration that converges to optimal CVT mass centers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "It is demonstrated in this work that the s-RBFN with MHP can be represented as a fixed-point iteration algorithm. By equivalence between the fitting of a multiple hypotheses distribution with a s-RBFN... global and local convergence for the s-RBFN could be proved."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no directly comparable methods found in corpus.
- Break condition: If the loss landscape has multiple local minima that are not well-connected, the fixed-point iteration may converge to suboptimal solutions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Voronoi tessellations and centroidal Voronoi tessellations
  - Why needed here: The CVT formation based on predictor losses is fundamental to structuring the input dataset for the s-RBFN and controlling diversity.
  - Quick check question: What property makes a Voronoi tessellation "centroidal"?

- Concept: Radial basis function networks and interpolation
  - Why needed here: The s-RBFN uses RBF interpolation to approximate the loss function across the CVT regions.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of basis function (e.g., Gaussian) affect the interpolation properties?

- Concept: Ensemble diversity and its relationship to generalization
  - Why needed here: The diversity parameter ε controls how predictors are weighted in tessellations, directly affecting the trade-off between diversity and performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the theoretical relationship between ensemble diversity and bias-variance trade-off?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Individual predictors (MHP generators) → form CVTs based on losses
  - CVT regions → provide structured input dataset for s-RBFN
  - s-RBFN with M basis functions → interpolates loss function and fits target distribution
  - Diversity parameter ε → controls tessellation formation and diversity level
  - Training modes: least-squares (closed-form) or gradient descent (loss-agnostic)

- Critical path:
  1. Train individual predictors while recording losses
  2. Form CVTs based on losses with diversity parameter ε
  3. Extract structured dataset from CVT predictions
  4. Train s-RBFN using least-squares or gradient descent
  5. Use trained s-RBFN for final predictions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of predictors M vs. computational cost and diversity
  - Diversity parameter ε vs. generalization performance
  - Least-squares vs. gradient descent: speed vs. flexibility with loss functions
  - Basis function choice (Gaussian vs. others) vs. interpolation properties

- Failure signatures:
  - Mode collapse: All predictors converge to same region, CVT becomes degenerate
  - Overfitting: s-RBFN fits noise in structured dataset, poor test performance
  - Underfitting: Insufficient basis functions to represent loss landscape complexity
  - Ill-conditioning: Structured dataset leads to unstable least-squares solution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with M=2 predictors and ε=0 (no diversity) to verify basic functionality
  2. Increase ε gradually to observe diversity effects on training vs. test performance
  3. Compare least-squares vs. gradient descent training for a simple regression problem
