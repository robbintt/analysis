# Designing Interpretable ML System to Enhance Trust in Healthcare: A Systematic Review to Proposed Responsible Clinician-AI-Collaboration Framework

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11055
- Reference count: 0
- This systematic review investigates interpretable machine learning (ML) methods in healthcare, identifying interpretability processes across three levels and proposing a robust clinician-AI collaboration framework to enhance trust and usability.

## Executive Summary
This systematic review examines interpretable machine learning methods in healthcare to address the critical need for transparency in AI-driven medical decision-making. The study reviews 74 publications and identifies interpretability processes across three levels: pre-processing (data exploration, standardization), interpretable modeling (white-box, hybrid, and joint methods), and post-processing (attribution, visualization, game theory). The review proposes a comprehensive framework integrating clinician-AI communication, data scientist support, and ethical oversight to enhance trust and usability. Key findings include the dominance of post-processing explainability methods, particularly SHAP and LIME, and the limited application of XAI in wearable devices and large language models. The paper identifies challenges including balancing interpretability with accuracy and addressing ethical concerns, while future directions emphasize user-centered design, continuous improvement, and uncertainty quantification.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of 74 publications to investigate interpretable ML methods in healthcare applications. The methodology classifies interpretability processes into three distinct phases: pre-processing interpretability (including exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and standardization), interpretable modeling (white-box, hybrid, and joint methods), and post-processing interpretability (attribution, visualization, and game theory). The study identifies key trends and gaps in the literature, with particular focus on explainability methods like SHAP and LIME. Based on this review, the authors propose a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple communication channels and support systems to enhance trust in AI-driven healthcare decision-making.

## Key Results
- Post-processing explainability methods, particularly SHAP and LIME, dominate the current landscape of interpretable ML in healthcare
- The proposed framework integrates clinician-AI communication, data scientist support, and ethical oversight to create a robust trust feedback loop
- Limited application of XAI exists in wearable health trackers and medical large language models, representing significant opportunities for future research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating clinician-AI communication and data scientist help desk creates a robust trust feedback loop in clinical decision support systems.
- Mechanism: The framework provides three communication channels (clinician-AI, data scientist, quality/ethical boards) that iteratively refine model explanations and outputs based on real-world clinical feedback.
- Core assumption: End-user trust in AI-driven medical decisions depends on transparent, interpretable explanations and continuous quality improvement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proposes a robust framework integrating clinician-AI communication, data scientist support, and ethical oversight to enhance trust and usability"
  - [section] "This center encompasses four essential components: (1) Clinician -AI Communication Desk, (2) Data Scientist Help Desk, (3) Quality Assessment Board, and (4) Ethical Review Board"
- Break Condition: If feedback loops are disconnected or quality assessment is delayed, trust will erode and model performance may degrade without detection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-processing interpretability (exploratory data analysis, feature selection, standardization) reduces bias and improves model robustness before training.
- Mechanism: By understanding dataset characteristics, identifying biases, and standardizing descriptions, the framework ensures that AI models are trained on clean, balanced, and well-documented data, leading to more reliable predictions.
- Core assumption: Model performance and fairness are fundamentally determined by data quality and preprocessing steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The interpretability process is classified into three parts: pre -processing interpretability, interpretable modeling, and post -processing interpretability"
  - [section] "Understanding data is crucial for making AI systems more explainable, efficient, and robust. This involves techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), explainable feature engineering, standardizing dataset descriptions..."
- Break Condition: If preprocessing is skipped or performed poorly, models may inherit or amplify hidden biases, leading to unreliable or unfair clinical decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-processing explainability methods (SHAP, LIME, visualization) translate complex model decisions into actionable insights for clinicians.
- Mechanism: Attribution and visualization techniques decompose model predictions into understandable feature contributions, enabling clinicians to verify and trust AI recommendations.
- Core assumption: Clinicians require interpretable explanations that link specific features to clinical outcomes to adopt AI tools confidently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key findings include the dominance of post-processing explainability methods, particularly SHAP and LIME"
  - [section] "LIME (Local Interpretable Model -Agnostic Explanations) was utilized for activity recognition in elderly individuals using wearable sensors"
- Break Condition: If explanations are overly technical or misaligned with clinician mental models, adoption will stall despite technical accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI) taxonomy (black-box, gray-box, white-box models)
  - Why needed here: The paper repeatedly distinguishes between model types and their interpretability levels, which is foundational to understanding the proposed framework.
  - Quick check question: Can you define the key difference between a black-box and a white-box model in one sentence?

- Concept: Clinical decision support system (CDSS) workflow
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built around improving interpretability within CDSS, so understanding the clinical workflow is critical.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main stages of interpretability in the proposed CDSS framework?

- Concept: Quality assessment in AI systems
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes evaluation metrics and continuous improvement, which are essential for deploying trustworthy AI in healthcare.
  - Quick check question: Name two dimensions from the quality assessment framework that directly impact clinical trust.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Pre-processing Layer: EDA, feature selection, dataset standardization, augmentation
  - Model Selection Layer: White-box, hybrid, joint, and architectural adjustment methods
  - Post-processing Layer: Attribution (SHAP, LIME), visualization, game theory, knowledge extraction
  - Support Infrastructure: Clinician-AI Communication Desk, Data Scientist Help Desk, Quality Assessment Board, Ethical Review Board
  - Evaluation Layer: Accuracy, reliability, robustness, interpretability, usability, human-AI interaction, ethics, responsiveness, compliance, validation, transparency, scalability

- Critical path: Data → Pre-processing → Model Selection → Post-processing → Evaluation → Continuous Improvement
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. interpretability (e.g., DNNs are accurate but less interpretable)
  - Complexity vs. usability (simpler explanations may be more actionable but less complete)
  - Real-time vs. batch processing (interactive explanations vs. offline analysis)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor data quality → biased or unstable predictions
  - Over-reliance on post-hoc explainability → trust without verification
  - Missing ethical oversight → deployment of biased or unsafe models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement SHAP on a small EHR dataset to visualize feature importance and validate against clinician intuition.
  2. Compare white-box vs. black-box models on a clinical task (e.g., diabetes prediction) and measure interpretability vs. accuracy trade-off.
  3. Simulate a feedback loop by having clinicians review model predictions and adjust preprocessing based on their input.
