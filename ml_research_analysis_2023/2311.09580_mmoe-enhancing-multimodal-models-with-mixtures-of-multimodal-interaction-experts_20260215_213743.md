# MMoE: Enhancing Multimodal Models with Mixtures of Multimodal Interaction Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09580
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09580
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on sarcasm and humor detection with 2% overall improvement and over 10% gains on specific interaction types

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MMOE (Mixture of Multimodal Interaction Experts), a novel approach to enhance multimodal models by training specialized expert models for different types of multimodal interactions. The framework first classifies data points by their interaction type (redundancy, uniqueness, or synergy) and then applies tailored models for each category. Experiments on sarcasm detection tasks demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MMOE achieving new state-of-the-art results and providing insights into multimodal dataset analysis.

## Method Summary
The MMOE framework works by first training unimodal classifiers for each modality and a multimodal classifier to obtain partial and full label estimations. Data points are then categorized into multimodal interaction types using distance metrics between classifier outputs. For each interaction category, specialized expert models are trained using few-shot in-context learning with large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo. The approach leverages the insight that different multimodal interaction patterns require distinct modeling approaches, allowing each expert to focus on specific patterns present in its interaction type.

## Key Results
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on sarcasm and humor detection tasks
- Shows 2% overall performance improvement compared to single unified models
- Demonstrates over 10% improvement on specific interaction types where specialized experts excel
- Provides a scalable and easy-to-implement framework for multimodal interaction analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different multimodal interaction types require specialized modeling approaches because a single model cannot capture all interaction patterns effectively.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "train separate expert models for each type of multimodal interaction, such as redundancy present in both modalities, uniqueness in one modality, or synergy that emerges when both modalities are fused."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Measuring modality disagreement and redundancy/unique/synergy (RUS) provides a principled way to categorize multimodal interactions without requiring ground truth labels.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2.3] "We convert model-predicted partial labels into agreement and disagreement by comparing the output of unimodal classifiers against each other."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: In-context learning with few-shot examples for each interaction type allows the approach to adapt to different interaction patterns without extensive fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2.4] "We implement few-shot in-context learning based on large language models (LLMs) using data points that are categorized as the same multimodal interaction type."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal interaction types (redundancy, uniqueness, synergy)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these interaction types is fundamental to implementing the categorization and expert selection components of the MMOE framework
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between modality redundancy and modality synergy in terms of classifier output distances?

- Concept: Information decomposition and distance metrics in label space
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on measuring distances between classifier outputs to categorize interactions, requiring understanding of how information is distributed across modalities
  - Quick check question: What does it mean when d(f1, f2) is small versus large, and how does this relate to agreement vs disagreement?

- Concept: In-context learning and few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The expert models use in-context learning rather than traditional fine-tuning, requiring understanding of how to construct effective few-shot examples
  - Quick check question: How would you construct a few-shot prompt for a new data point that needs to be classified as having "disagreement synergy"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Unimodal classifiers (f1, f2) for each modality
  - Multimodal classifier (fM) for joint prediction
  - Interaction categorization module using distance metrics
  - Expert model pool (one per interaction type)
  - Routing mechanism to select appropriate expert
  - Output aggregation layer

- Critical path:
  1. Input modalities → unimodal classifiers → δ1, δ2
  2. Input modalities → multimodal classifier → δM
  3. δ1, δ2, δM → distance calculations → interaction classification
  4. Interaction classification → expert model selection
  5. Selected expert → final prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More interaction categories provide finer-grained specialization but increase complexity and data requirements
  - Using larger expert models improves performance but increases computational cost
  - The approach trades training complexity (multiple experts) for better handling of diverse interaction types

- Failure signatures:
  - High disagreement between unimodal classifiers with low multimodal performance suggests synergy cases are being misclassified
  - Uniform performance across interaction types indicates the categorization isn't capturing meaningful differences
  - Large performance gaps between interaction types suggests some expert models are underfitting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train single multimodal model on all data, measure overall F1
  2. Interaction categorization: Implement RUS categorization, analyze distribution of interaction types in dataset
  3. Expert specialization: Train separate experts for each interaction type, compare performance to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the MMOE framework be extended to handle more than two modalities effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the current method is limited to two modalities and cannot expand to multiple modalities yet.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a solution or methodology for scaling the MMOE framework to more than two modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a generalized version of MMOE that can handle three or more modalities, along with empirical results showing improved performance on such datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective architectures for expert models in handling different types of multimodal interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses Socratic models and few-shot prompting with large language models (LLMs) for expert models, but notes that designing more useful and effective multimodal experts for each interaction type is left as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore or compare different architectural approaches for expert models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of various expert model architectures (e.g., transformer-based, graph neural networks) applied to the same tasks, with performance metrics indicating which architectures are most effective for specific interaction types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of distance function in measuring modality disagreement and interaction types affect the performance of MMOE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses L1 distance as the distance function for measuring modality disagreement and interaction types, but does not explore alternative distance metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how different distance functions might impact the classification of multimodal interactions or the overall performance of the MMOE framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of MMOE using different distance functions (e.g., L2 distance, cosine similarity) across various tasks, with analysis of how these choices influence interaction classification and model accuracy.

## Limitations
- The approach is currently limited to two modalities and cannot be directly extended to multiple modalities
- Performance depends heavily on the quality of unimodal classifier outputs for interaction categorization
- Requires sufficient data for each interaction type to train effective expert models, which may be challenging for rare interaction patterns

## Confidence
- Confidence assessment for MMoE's core claims is Medium
- The methodology shows promise but has uncertainties around interaction classification robustness and scalability

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply MMOE to a different multimodal task (e.g., humor detection or multimodal sentiment analysis) with distinct interaction patterns to verify the approach's generalizability beyond the MUSTARD dataset.

2. **Interaction classification robustness**: Systematically vary the distance thresholds and unimodal classifier architectures to quantify how sensitive the interaction categorization is to these hyperparameters, and test whether performance degrades when classification accuracy drops.

3. **Expert model comparison**: Replace the in-context learning approach with traditional fine-tuning for expert models to determine whether the few-shot methodology is essential to the performance gains or if standard training would achieve similar results.
