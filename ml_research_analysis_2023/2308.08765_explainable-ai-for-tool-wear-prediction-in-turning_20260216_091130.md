# Explainable AI for tool wear prediction in turning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08765
- Reference count: 24
- Random Forest classifier achieved 92.31% accuracy in binary tool wear classification

## Executive Summary
This study developed an Explainable AI framework for predicting tool wear in turning operations using sensor data from orthogonal tube turning experiments. The approach combines a Random Forest classifier with Shapley value explanations to achieve high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The framework successfully identifies temperature as the most significant predictor of tool wear, providing manufacturing operators with actionable insights into tool condition monitoring.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves collecting sensor data during orthogonal tube turning experiments with 1018 steel tubes and tungsten carbide inserts at varying cutting speeds. Time series data from acceleration (aX, aY, aZ), acoustics (two microphones), temperature, and spindle speed are preprocessed by windowing into 7 equal parts and extracting features (variance for acceleration/acoustic, area under curve for temperature). A Random Forest classifier is trained on 60% of the 146 data points and evaluated on the remaining 40%, with Shapley values calculated to explain feature contributions to predictions.

## Key Results
- Random Forest classifier achieved 92.31% accuracy in binary classification of tool condition
- Temperature was identified as the most significant feature for decision-making through Shapley analysis
- True positive rate of 94.5% and false positive rate of 6.3% demonstrate balanced performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Random Forest classifier maps input sensor features to tool condition with 92.31% accuracy.
- Mechanism: Ensemble of decision trees votes on binary classification; majority vote determines final output.
- Core assumption: Input features contain sufficient signal to distinguish worn vs unworn tool states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model achieved 92.31% accuracy in binary classification of tool condition (worn vs. unworn)."
  - [section] "The Random-Forest classification (RFC) model is used to map a set of input featuresX to their corresponding and known labels Y"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Shapley values decompose model predictions to explain feature contributions.
- Mechanism: Game theory framework calculates marginal contribution of each feature across all possible feature subsets.
- Core assumption: Feature attribution is additive and consistent across model predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Shapley values were used to explain model predictions, revealing that temperature was the most significant feature for decision-making."
  - [section] "Through the SHAP criterion, the prediction of the model is decomposed among all the input features involved in the decision making process."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temperature data is the dominant predictor of tool wear state.
- Mechanism: Temperature correlates strongly with friction and energy dissipation during cutting, which increase as tool wears.
- Core assumption: Thermal signatures are reliable indicators of tool degradation across different cutting speeds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the tool temperature was identified as the most significant feature in determining the classification of available versus failed cutting tools."
  - [section] "the temperature data was the most vital feature for the final model prediction."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Random Forest ensemble learning
  - Why needed here: Handles non-linear relationships between multi-sensor inputs and tool condition without requiring extensive feature engineering.
  - Quick check question: Why use ensemble of trees rather than a single decision tree for this classification task?

- Concept: Shapley value attribution
  - Why needed here: Provides human-interpretable explanation of which sensor inputs drive model decisions, critical for manufacturing operator trust.
  - Quick check question: How does Shapley value calculation differ from simple feature importance scores?

- Concept: Binary classification evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Accuracy alone can be misleading with imbalanced classes; TPR, FPR, MCC provide more complete performance picture.
  - Quick check question: What does an MCC of 0.823 indicate about model performance compared to random guessing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sensor data acquisition → Preprocessing (windowing, feature extraction) → Random Forest training → Shapley explanation → Operator interface
- Critical path: Data collection → Model training → Model evaluation → Shapley explanation generation → Operator decision support
- Design tradeoffs: More sensors increase feature richness but add complexity; Random Forest balances accuracy with interpretability vs. deep learning
- Failure signatures: High FPR indicates false alarms; low TPR indicates missed worn tools; Shapley values shifting unexpectedly may indicate sensor drift
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify sensor data collection is working by checking raw time series plots
  2. Train Random Forest on 60% of data and validate on remaining 40% to establish baseline accuracy
  3. Generate Shapley values for test predictions to confirm temperature is indeed the dominant feature

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific thermo-mechanical features (beyond temperature) would most improve tool wear prediction accuracy when incorporated into the ML model?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that future work will consider "more thermo-mechanical features" and specifically mentions "the feed rate" as an example.
- Why unresolved: The current study only used temperature as a thermo-mechanical feature and found it was most significant, but other potentially important features were not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing and comparing model accuracy with additional thermo-mechanical features (like feed rate, cutting force, vibration patterns) incorporated into the training data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would a convolutional neural network-based XAI framework perform compared to the current random forest approach for tool wear prediction?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose developing "an image-based XAI framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for better explainability" in future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study used a random forest classifier, while CNNs could potentially extract more complex patterns from sensor data, especially image-based data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of tool wear prediction accuracy and explanation quality between CNN-based and random forest-based XAI frameworks on the same dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between false positive and false negative rates for practical tool wear detection in manufacturing environments?
- Basis in paper: The paper reports both true positive rate (94.5%) and false positive rate (6.3%), suggesting these metrics are important for evaluating model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't discuss the practical implications of different error types or what balance would be most acceptable for manufacturing operators.
- What evidence would resolve it: Real-world testing of the model in manufacturing environments to determine which error type causes more operational issues and what threshold operators would find acceptable.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (146 total data points) limits generalizability and increases overfitting risk
- Single workpiece material (1018 steel) may not represent broader machining applications
- Binary classification doesn't capture progressive wear stages

## Confidence
- Random Forest 92.31% accuracy claim: High confidence
- Temperature as dominant feature claim: Medium confidence
- Model interpretability through Shapley values: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test model on unseen tool wear scenarios beyond binary classification to assess real-world robustness
2. Verify temperature feature dominance across multiple workpiece materials and cutting conditions
3. Implement cross-validation with data augmentation to confirm model performance isn't overfitted to the specific dataset
