# SemEval-2022 Task 7: Identifying Plausible Clarifications of Implicit and Underspecified Phrases in Instructional Texts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.12102
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12102
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** Best system achieved 68.9% accuracy, 10.5 percentage points below human upper bound of 79.4%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SemEval-2022 Task 7, which focuses on identifying plausible clarifications of implicit and underspecified phrases in instructional texts. The task involves distinguishing between plausible and implausible clarifications in how-to guides, where clarifications are presented as fillers in a cloze task format. The dataset consists of manually clarified how-to guides with alternative clarifications generated using language models and human plausibility judgments collected. The best system achieved an accuracy of 68.9%, only 10.5 percentage points below the human upper bound of 79.4%. The results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art methods can effectively model the task, with potential for further improvement. Additionally, the study shows that predictions by the top system can identify contexts with multiple plausible clarifications with an accuracy of 75.2%.

## Method Summary
The task involves identifying plausible clarifications of implicit and underspecified phrases in instructional texts. The dataset includes manually clarified how-to guides from wikiHowToImprove, with alternative clarifications generated using language models and human plausibility judgments collected. Participating teams fine-tuned Transformer architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, RoBERTa, etc.) on the provided training data for a classification task with three labels (IMPLAUSIBLE, NEUTRAL, PLAUSIBLE). The evaluation used accuracy as the main metric, with Spearman's rank correlation for ranking tasks. The study explored different approaches including single models, multi-loss objectives, and ensemble strategies to capture various underspecification phenomena.

## Key Results
- Best system achieved 68.9% accuracy, 10.5 percentage points below human upper bound of 79.4%
- All teams except one outperformed the BERT baseline on the test set
- Top system identified contexts with multiple plausible clarifications with 75.2% accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning transformer models on small-scale, pattern-rich data enables robust disambiguation of underspecified references.
- Mechanism: The model learns to map a cloze-style input (context + filler) to a plausibility score by leveraging contextual embeddings from pre-trained Transformers and adjusting them for the specific task of clarification ranking.
- Core assumption: Small but carefully curated datasets (19,975 training instances) with high-quality human judgments can generalize to unseen clarification contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - The best system achieved 68.9% accuracy, only 10.5 percentage points below human upper bound of 79.4%.
  - All teams but one also outperform our BERT-based baseline, which is a linear classification model based on the checkpoint provided by the Transformer library (Wolf et al., 2020) and fine-tuned on our training data.
- Break condition: If the training data lacks diversity in underspecification patterns, the model may overfit to seen phenomena and fail on novel types of clarifications.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-loss and ensemble strategies improve robustness across different underspecification phenomena.
- Mechanism: By training separate models for each phenomenon type (implicit reference, fused head, noun compound, metonymy) or using multi-loss objectives, the system captures nuanced semantic differences that single-model fine-tuning may miss.
- Core assumption: Different clarification types have distinct linguistic patterns that benefit from specialized model architectures or hyperparameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - X-PuDu found that different hyperparameters worked best depending on the phenomenon/extraction pattern. Based on this finding, different individual models were trained and combined in an ensemble.
  - The best system achieved an accuracy of 68.9%, only 10.5 percentage points below the human upper bound of 79.4%.
- Break condition: If the cost of maintaining multiple models outweighs performance gains, a simpler unified model may be preferred.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training can serve as a strong baseline for plausibility ranking without extensive fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: Using models like BERT or ELECTRA in a zero-shot or few-shot setting, the model leverages its pre-trained knowledge of language plausibility to score fillers without task-specific adaptation.
- Core assumption: Large-scale pre-training captures sufficient linguistic regularities to distinguish plausible from implausible clarifications in instructional texts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Given the similarity of our task to general cloze tasks, several teams experimented with models that were merely self-supervised and not fine-tuned on task-specific training data.
  - The best system achieved an accuracy of 68.9%, suggesting that even non-fine-tuned models can achieve reasonable performance.
- Break condition: If the pre-trained model's distributional knowledge does not align well with the instructional domain, performance may degrade significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cloze task formulation for evaluation of discourse-level understanding.
  - Why needed here: The task frames clarification plausibility as a fill-in-the-blank problem, enabling systematic comparison of fillers against context.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a cloze task and a multiple-choice question in NLP evaluation?

- Concept: Human plausibility judgments and their aggregation.
  - Why needed here: Human ratings provide the gold standard for training and evaluation, and their aggregation (averaging) defines class labels.
  - Quick check question: How does the threshold selection (e.g., ≤2.5 for IMPLAUSIBLE) affect label distribution and model training?

- Concept: Fine-tuning transformer models on classification tasks.
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained representations to the specific task of ranking clarification plausibility.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between linear classification and ordinal regression in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Context sentences + candidate filler
  - Encoder: Pre-trained Transformer (BERT, DeBERTa, ELECTRA, etc.)
  - Task head: Linear layer for classification or regression
  - Output: Plausibility label (IMPLAUSIBLE/NEUTRAL/PLAUSIBLE) or score
  - Ensemble layer (optional): Weighted combination of multiple models

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained checkpoint
  2. Tokenize input (context + filler)
  3. Forward pass through encoder
  4. Apply classification/regression head
  5. Aggregate predictions (for ensembles)
  6. Map scores to labels (if needed)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single model vs. ensemble: Simplicity vs. robustness across phenomena
  - Classification vs. ranking: Interpretability vs. finer-grained evaluation
  - Fine-tuning vs. zero-shot: Data efficiency vs. leveraging pre-trained knowledge

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on NEUTRAL class: Imbalanced label distribution or ambiguous instances
  - Poor generalization to unseen phenomena: Overfitting to training patterns
  - High variance across runs: Insufficient training data or unstable optimization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune BERT-base on the training set with linear classification head; evaluate on dev set.
  2. Add multi-loss objective (classification + regression) to capture ordinal nature of labels.
  3. Train separate models per phenomenon type and ensemble their predictions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can the performance of systems in identifying multiple plausible clarifications be further improved?
- How can the NEUTRAL label be better handled to improve system performance?
- How can the task be extended to consider a wider range of clarification patterns beyond referring expressions?
- How can individual differences in plausibility judgments be better accounted for in the task?

## Limitations

- The evaluation setup focuses on four specific linguistic phenomena, potentially missing other types of implicit references
- The dataset size (19,975 training instances) is modest, with remaining performance gap to human upper bound
- The study doesn't fully explore domain transfer - performance on non-how-to instructional texts remains unknown
- Generation of alternative clarifications using language models may introduce artifacts not representing natural language variation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that transformer fine-tuning achieves 68.9% accuracy, only 10.5 percentage points below human performance
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of multi-loss and ensemble strategies based on X-PuDu's approach
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about unsupervised pre-training serving as a strong baseline supported by participant experiments

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the top-performing system on a held-out set of how-to guides from different domains to assess domain robustness and identify performance degradation patterns.

2. Conduct a detailed error analysis focusing on NEUTRAL class predictions to determine whether the model struggles with genuinely ambiguous cases or if the label distribution affects performance.

3. Test whether models trained on English data can effectively transfer to similar clarification tasks in other languages, starting with closely related languages like German or French to assess linguistic generalization.
