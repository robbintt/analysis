# Traffic-Domain Video Question Answering with Automatic Captioning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.09636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09636
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 6.5 percentage point accuracy improvement on SUTD-TrafficQA benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TRIVIA, a weak supervision method that injects traffic-domain knowledge into video-language models by automatically generating natural language captions from structured knowledge graphs. The approach uses off-the-shelf video annotation tools to extract object, position, color, trajectory, and speed information from traffic videos, stores this data in a symbolic knowledge graph, and generates synthetic captions for fine-tuning video-language models. Evaluated on the SUTD-TrafficQA benchmark, TRIVIA improves VIOLET's accuracy from 32.7% to 39.2%, representing a 19.88% relative increase over baseline settings.

## Method Summary
TRIVIA works by first extracting objects and their behaviors (position, speed, trajectory) from traffic videos using automatic annotation tools. This information is stored in a symbolic knowledge graph using the HANS framework, then converted to natural language captions through template-based methods. These video-caption pairs are used to fine-tune a pre-trained video-language model (VIOLET) using curriculum learning, where the model progressively learns from simpler to more complex traffic scenarios. The approach leverages weak supervision by generating synthetic training data rather than requiring manual annotation.

## Key Results
- Improves VIOLET video-language model accuracy from 32.7% to 39.2% on SUTD-TrafficQA
- Achieves 6.5 percentage point absolute improvement (19.88% relative increase)
- Demonstrates effectiveness of traffic-domain knowledge injection through synthetic captioning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weak supervision using synthetic captions derived from structured knowledge graphs can inject traffic-domain knowledge into video-language models.
- Mechanism: Off-the-shelf video annotation tools extract objects, positions, colors, trajectories, and speeds from traffic videos. This data is stored in a symbolic knowledge graph using the HANS framework. Template-based methods generate natural language captions describing these objects and their behaviors. These video-caption pairs fine-tune a pre-trained video-language model, improving its performance on traffic-domain tasks.
- Core assumption: Automatically generated captions accurately represent essential elements of traffic scenes and the video-language model can effectively learn from these captions during fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirical findings obtained from the SUTD-TrafficQA task highlight the substantial enhancements achieved by TRIVIA, elevating the accuracy of representative video-language models by a remarkable 6.5 points (19.88%) compared to baseline settings."
  - [section III. E. Traffic-Domain Knowledge Injection]: "One effective strategy for injecting domain-specific knowledge into language models...is through the process of fine-tuning them on data specific to that domain."
  - [corpus]: Weak. While the corpus contains related video QA papers, none specifically discuss the use of synthetic captions derived from structured knowledge graphs for traffic-domain knowledge injection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Curriculum learning during fine-tuning helps the video-language model progressively learn from simpler to more complex traffic scenarios.
- Mechanism: The fine-tuning process follows a curriculum learning approach, where the model is initially exposed to simpler traffic scenarios and gradually progresses to more complex ones. This allows the model to build a strong foundation of basic traffic knowledge before tackling more challenging reasoning tasks.
- Core assumption: Traffic scenarios can be effectively ordered by complexity, and the model benefits from learning simpler concepts before more complex ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirical findings obtained from the SUTD-TrafficQA task highlight the substantial enhancements achieved by TRIVIA, elevating the accuracy of representative video-language models by a remarkable 6.5 points (19.88%) compared to baseline settings."
  - [section IV. C. Experimental Setup]: "We show how our synthetic captioning method can improve the accuracy of the VIOLET video-language model [15] on SUTD-TrafficQA [53] task, by 6.5 percentage points, through curriculum learning [39]."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains papers on video QA, but none explicitly mention the use of curriculum learning in the context of traffic-domain knowledge injection.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on a combination of raw traffic videos and automatically generated captions allows the model to learn a joint representation of visual and textual information relevant to traffic scenarios.
- Mechanism: The VIOLET video-language model is fine-tuned on pairs of raw traffic videos and their corresponding automatically generated captions. This process allows the model to learn to associate visual features from the videos with textual descriptions of traffic objects and their behaviors.
- Core assumption: The VIOLET model can effectively learn from the combination of visual and textual information provided by the video-caption pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirical findings obtained from the SUTD-TrafficQA task highlight the substantial enhancements achieved by TRIVIA, elevating the accuracy of representative video-language models by a remarkable 6.5 points (19.88%) compared to baseline settings."
  - [section IV. C. Experimental Setup]: "VIOLET undergoes a traffic knowledge injection process and is subsequently fine-tuned on the training subset of SUTD-TrafficQA, followed by evaluation on the test subset."
  - [corpus]: Weak. While the corpus contains papers on video QA, none specifically discuss the use of fine-tuning on video-caption pairs for traffic-domain knowledge injection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object detection and tracking in videos
  - Why needed here: To extract relevant information about objects (cars, pedestrians, etc.) and their behaviors (position, speed, trajectory) from traffic videos.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in detecting and tracking objects in traffic videos, and how do the chosen annotation tools address these challenges?

- Concept: Knowledge graph construction and querying
  - Why needed here: To store and manage the extracted information from traffic videos in a structured format that can be easily queried to generate captions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the HANS knowledge graph framework, and how is it used to represent traffic-domain information?

- Concept: Template-based natural language generation
  - Why needed here: To convert the structured information stored in the knowledge graph into natural language captions that can be used to fine-tune the video-language model.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of using template-based methods for generating captions from structured data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw traffic videos -> Object detection/tracking tools -> HANS knowledge graph -> Template-based caption generation -> VIOLET video-language model -> SUTD-TrafficQA benchmark
- Critical path: 1) Extract objects and behaviors from raw traffic videos using annotation tools 2) Store extracted information in HANS knowledge graph 3) Generate natural language captions using template-based methods 4) Fine-tune VIOLET model on video-caption pairs 5) Evaluate on SUTD-TrafficQA benchmark
- Design tradeoffs: Using off-the-shelf annotation tools vs. developing custom tools for traffic videos; using a symbolic knowledge graph vs. more flexible representation; using template-based caption generation vs. more advanced language generation methods
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on SUTD-TrafficQA could indicate issues with annotation tools, knowledge graph, caption generation, or fine-tuning process; high variance in model performance across different traffic scenarios could indicate issues with curriculum learning approach
- First 3 experiments: 1) Evaluate accuracy of object detection and tracking tools on sample traffic videos 2) Generate captions for small set of traffic videos and manually assess quality and relevance 3) Fine-tune VIOLET model on small subset of video-caption pairs and evaluate on held-out set of traffic QA questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the quality of automatic annotations impact the performance of TRIVIA on downstream traffic video question answering tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that the generated annotations may contain noise and mentions that future research should analyze the effects of annotation quality on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how annotation quality affects TRIVIA's performance. It only mentions that annotations may be noisy without quantifying the impact.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying the quality of annotations (e.g., perfect vs. noisy) and measuring TRIVIA's performance on SUTD-TrafficQA would provide empirical evidence of the impact of annotation quality.

- Question: Can TRIVIA's knowledge injection methodology be extended to capture more complex reasoning tasks beyond basic scene understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the majority of improvements are attributed to basic questions and that future work aims to broaden the scope of scene knowledge to enable advanced reasoning like counterfactual inference and event forecasting.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on improving performance on basic questions and does not demonstrate TRIVIA's effectiveness on more complex reasoning tasks. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide evidence of extension to complex tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing TRIVIA's effectiveness on more complex reasoning tasks in SUTD-TrafficQA (e.g., counterfactual inference, event forecasting) would demonstrate the methodology's applicability beyond basic scene understanding.

- Question: How would replacing the template-based caption generation with large language models like ChatGPT affect TRIVIA's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that template-based captions have a basic structure and suggest that incorporating large language models like ChatGPT could improve caption quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses template-based caption generation without exploring alternatives. While the authors suggest potential improvements, they do not provide empirical evidence of the impact of using advanced language models.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment comparing TRIVIA's performance using template-based captions versus ChatGPT-generated captions on SUTD-TrafficQA would quantify the impact of using more sophisticated caption generation methods.

## Limitations
- Relies on off-the-shelf annotation tools and template-based caption generation without rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness
- Proprietary traffic-tuned tracker raises reproducibility concerns
- Evaluation limited to single benchmark (SUTD-TrafficQA) without ablation studies to isolate component contributions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core claim that injecting traffic-domain knowledge improves VQA performance is well-supported by 6.5 percentage point accuracy improvement on SUTD-TrafficQA. The mechanism of using structured knowledge graphs for weak supervision is conceptually sound.
- Medium Confidence: Effectiveness of curriculum learning in this specific application is plausible but not conclusively demonstrated. Paper shows improved results but doesn't provide detailed analysis of how different curriculum orderings affect performance.
- Low Confidence: Claim that specific combination of HANS framework and template-based generation is optimal lacks supporting evidence. Paper doesn't compare against alternative knowledge representation methods or caption generation approaches.

## Next Checks
1. **Annotation Tool Validation**: Evaluate accuracy of object detection and tracking on held-out set of traffic videos, measuring precision, recall, and tracking consistency across different traffic scenarios and lighting conditions.

2. **Caption Quality Assessment**: Conduct human evaluation of 100 randomly sampled generated captions to measure relevance, accuracy, and coverage of traffic-domain concepts, comparing against ground truth descriptions when available.

3. **Knowledge Graph Effectiveness**: Perform ablation study removing knowledge graph component and using direct video-to-caption pairs instead, measuring impact on model performance and training efficiency to quantify value of structured representation.
