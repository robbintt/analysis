# Privacy-preserving Early Detection of Epileptic Seizures in Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.08794
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08794
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Primary result**: Proposed SETR-PKD framework achieves 83.9% accuracy for detecting tonic-clonic seizures halfway through their progression using optical flow features and progressive knowledge distillation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SETR-PKD, a privacy-preserving framework for early detection of epileptic seizures in video data. The method leverages optical flow features to preserve patient privacy while retaining critical motion information needed for seizure detection. The core innovation is progressive knowledge distillation, where transformer models trained on longer video segments gradually transfer knowledge to models operating on shorter segments, enabling earlier predictions. The framework achieves 83.9% accuracy for detecting tonic-clonic seizures halfway through their progression, outperforming direct knowledge distillation and other baselines across different fractions of video input.

## Method Summary
The SETR-PKD framework combines optical flow feature extraction with transformer-based progressive knowledge distillation for early seizure detection. First, optical flow information is extracted from video frames using the TV-L1 algorithm, creating privacy-preserving motion representations. A transformer encoder (SETR block) processes these motion tokens with multi-head self-attention to learn temporal relationships in seizure patterns. The progressive knowledge distillation component trains models on different video segment lengths (k=4, 8, or 16), with knowledge gradually transferred from models trained on longer segments to those operating on shorter ones. The system is trained using a weighted combination of cross-entropy, KL divergence, and MSE loss functions across 50 epochs with batch size 16 and learning rate 1e-3.

## Key Results
- Achieves 83.9% accuracy for detecting tonic-clonic seizures at halfway point of progression
- Progressive knowledge distillation outperforms direct knowledge distillation across all segment lengths
- Maintains better accuracy retention compared to LSTM-based methods when using partial video segments
- Effective on both in-house dataset (40 TCS samples) and public GESTURES dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optical flow features preserve patient privacy while retaining seizure motion semiotics
- Mechanism: Optical flow encodes temporal differences between consecutive frames without capturing identifiable visual information about the patient's identity or appearance
- Core assumption: Motion patterns specific to tonic-clonic seizures can be adequately represented by optical flow without RGB context
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states optical flow "encodes the seizure motion semiotics while preserving the privacy of the patient"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Progressive knowledge distillation enables accurate early detection by transferring knowledge from longer to shorter video segments
- Mechanism: Knowledge flows gradually from models trained on full video samples to models operating on progressively shorter segments, reducing the feature mismatch between teacher and student models
- Core assumption: Consecutive video segments share sufficient similarity that knowledge transfer between them remains effective
- Evidence anchors: Proposed PKD "operates in steps" and "is more effective than direct distillation"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transformer-based processing of motion tokens effectively captures temporal relationships in seizure patterns
- Mechanism: The SETR block uses multi-head self-attention to model temporal dependencies between motion tokens, with class embeddings representing overall sample characteristics
- Core assumption: Seizure motion patterns exhibit sufficient temporal structure that can be learned through attention mechanisms
- Evidence anchors: "We leverage transformers to effectively learn temporal relations between the extracted spatial features of the seizure patterns"

## Foundational Learning

- **Optical flow computation and feature extraction**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on extracting motion information while preserving privacy
  - Quick check question: How does the TV-L1 algorithm differ from other optical flow methods, and why might it be preferred for seizure detection?

- **Knowledge distillation and progressive training strategies**
  - Why needed here: The early detection capability depends on understanding how knowledge can be transferred between models trained on different video segment lengths
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between progressive knowledge distillation and direct knowledge distillation, and why does this matter for temporal data?

- **Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms**
  - Why needed here: The SETR block uses transformers to process temporal sequences, requiring understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and multi-head attention
  - Quick check question: How does the addition of class embeddings in the transformer architecture help with classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Optical flow extraction → Feature extraction → SETR processing → Progressive Knowledge Distillation → Early detection prediction
- **Critical path**: Optical flow extraction pipeline → Feature extractor → SETR block → Progressive Knowledge Distillation framework → Loss functions
- **Design tradeoffs**: Privacy vs. detection accuracy (optical flow vs. RGB); Early detection capability vs. model complexity (progressive vs. direct distillation); Computational efficiency vs. temporal resolution (number of segments k)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on shorter segments indicates insufficient knowledge transfer; Degraded accuracy suggests feature extraction is not capturing sufficient seizure characteristics; High false positives may indicate class imbalance
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline evaluation: Run SETR without knowledge distillation on full video samples to establish maximum achievable accuracy
  2. Progressive vs. direct distillation comparison: Test both approaches across different segment lengths to validate the progressive advantage
  3. Sensitivity analysis: Vary the number of segments k to find optimal balance between early detection and accuracy retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions but leaves several implications unresolved regarding optimal progressive distillation parameters and generalization to seizure types beyond tonic-clonic seizures.

## Limitations
- Extremely small dataset size (40 seizure samples) raises concerns about generalizability and potential overfitting
- Optical flow features may not capture all relevant seizure characteristics, particularly if seizures involve subtle spatial patterns beyond motion
- Progressive knowledge distillation may not be robust across seizure types with highly variable progression patterns

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of using optical flow for privacy preservation and the overall framework architecture are well-established concepts
- **Medium confidence**: The progressive knowledge distillation approach shows promise but the limited dataset size makes it difficult to assess true effectiveness
- **Low confidence**: The specific quantitative claims about 83.9% accuracy at halfway detection should be interpreted cautiously given the small sample size

## Next Checks
1. External validation on larger datasets: Test SETR-PKD framework on larger, publicly available seizure video datasets to assess generalizability
2. Feature ablation study: Compare detection performance using different feature extraction methods to quantify information loss from using optical flow exclusively
3. Cross-patient generalization test: Evaluate model performance when training on patients from one demographic group and testing on patients from different demographic groups
