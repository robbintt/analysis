# Studying the Effects of Sex-related Differences on Brain Age Prediction using brain MR Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11577
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Sex-specific models performed similarly to mixed-sex models, but both showed poor generalization across datasets

## Executive Summary
This study investigated sex-related differences in brain age prediction models using MRI data from two sources (CC359 and CamCAN). The authors found that models trained on specific datasets showed poor generalization to external data, with performance disparities across sex subgroups. Interestingly, models trained on combined male and female data did not consistently outperform sex-specific models. Grad-CAM interpretability analysis revealed that models trained on different sex subgroups focused on different brain regions, highlighting the importance of careful experimental design and dataset composition in developing fair and generalizable brain age prediction models.

## Method Summary
The study used two MRI datasets (CC359 and CamCAN) with balanced sex distributions, preprocessed through skull stripping, registration to MNI152 atlas, and intensity scaling. A Simple Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN) with 7 convolutional blocks and modified regression head was trained using Adam optimizer with MAE loss. The authors trained six models (female-only, male-only, and balanced from each dataset) and evaluated them on four test sets (30 females/males from each dataset). Grad-CAM was used for interpretability analysis, averaging maps from early and final convolutional layers.

## Key Results
- Models trained on specific datasets showed poor generalization to external datasets
- Sex-specific models performed similarly to mixed-sex models in terms of accuracy
- Grad-CAM revealed different brain regions were important for models trained on different sex subgroups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Models trained on dataset-specific demographics fail to generalize to external datasets.
- Mechanism: Training on a single dataset embeds dataset-specific variance that does not transfer across datasets.
- Core assumption: Learned feature representations are tightly coupled to the training dataset's distribution.
- Evidence anchors: "models trained on a specific dataset showing poor generalization to external data"; "MAE of all three models was significantly lower on CC_F and CC_M (sourced from CC359) compared to Cam_F and Cam_M."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sex-specific model performance differences are not consistently tied to training sample size.
- Mechanism: Even with balanced training sets, sex-specific models perform similarly to mixed-sex models, indicating sex differences are not the dominant source of variation.
- Core assumption: Brain morphological differences between sexes are accounted for in mixed training.
- Evidence anchors: "Models trained on combined male and female data did not consistently outperform sex-specific models"; "minimal variation among the F, M, and A model variants."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Grad-CAM interpretability reveals model decisions focus on different brain regions depending on training set composition.
- Mechanism: Training on single-sex vs. mixed data leads models to emphasize different anatomical regions, even with similar overall performance.
- Core assumption: Grad-CAM maps accurately reflect the model's learned decision regions.
- Evidence anchors: "Interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM revealed that models trained on different sex subgroups focused on different brain regions"; "models trained on a specific dataset identified significantly different features when trained using a single-sex subgroup versus a mixed-sex group."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dataset bias and its impact on model fairness
  - Why needed here: The study's core focus is how sex and dataset biases affect model performance and fairness.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between bias in training data vs. bias introduced by the model?

- Concept: Generalization in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates poor generalization across datasets, a critical limitation for clinical deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model trained on dataset A perform poorly on dataset B even if both contain similar tasks?

- Concept: Interpretability methods (Grad-CAM)
  - Why needed here: The study uses Grad-CAM to understand model decision regions and detect potential biases.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of Grad-CAM in terms of localization accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation → Interpretability analysis
- Critical path: Skull stripping → Registration → Intensity scaling → Train/test split → Model training → MAE evaluation → Grad-CAM analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-sex vs. mixed-sex training: potential for reduced bias vs. loss of generalizability
  - Grad-CAM averaging: improved robustness vs. loss of fine-grained localization
  - Augmentation: reduced overfitting vs. possible distortion of anatomical features
- Failure signatures:
  - High MAE on external datasets → poor generalization
  - Inconsistent performance across sex subgroups → potential bias
  - Grad-CAM maps focused outside brain → model overfitting to non-informative features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a model on CC359 only, evaluate on CamCAN → confirm generalization gap
  2. Compare sex-specific vs. mixed-sex training within same dataset → measure performance parity
  3. Generate Grad-CAM maps for each model variant → identify differences in decision regions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do brain age prediction models trained on sex-balanced datasets compare to those trained on sex-specific datasets in terms of fairness and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "Models trained on combined male and female data did not consistently outperform sex-specific models" and that "Our results demonstrated variations in model generalizability across sex-specific subgroups."
- Why unresolved: The study found that combined models did not consistently outperform sex-specific models, but it did not determine which approach is more fair or accurate across different datasets and populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of model performance across various demographic groups and datasets, including statistical tests to determine significance of differences in fairness and accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying reasons for the differences in brain regions identified as important by models trained on different sex subgroups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "Grad-CAM revealed that models trained on different sex subgroups focused on different brain regions" and observed variations in the regions considered significant for prediction.
- Why unresolved: While the study identified differences in brain regions, it did not investigate the reasons behind these variations or their implications for model interpretability and fairness.
- What evidence would resolve it: In-depth analysis of the biological and statistical factors contributing to the differences in identified brain regions, potentially involving expert neuroimaging analysis and correlation with known sex-related brain structure differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can experimental design be optimized to ensure fairness and reliability in brain age prediction models across diverse populations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that "This underlines the critical role of careful experimental design in generating fair and reliable outcomes" and suggest that future work should focus on "designing and optimizing predictive models that specifically address sex-related differences."
- Why unresolved: While the study highlights the importance of experimental design, it does not provide specific guidelines or methodologies for optimizing design to ensure fairness and reliability across diverse populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of experimental design frameworks that incorporate diverse datasets, statistical methods for detecting and mitigating bias, and guidelines for model evaluation across different demographic groups.

## Limitations

- The study does not specify whether sex differences in brain morphology were explicitly measured or modeled, limiting interpretation of performance patterns
- Dataset composition details (age distribution, scanner parameters) are not fully reported, making generalizability assessment difficult
- Grad-CAM analysis methodology lacks details on how anatomical region differences were quantified and validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Generalization failure across datasets is well-demonstrated with clear MAE differences
- **Medium confidence**: Sex-specific vs. mixed model performance comparison, as the lack of systematic differences could be due to multiple factors
- **Medium confidence**: Interpretability findings, as Grad-CAM is an indirect measure of model decision-making

## Next Checks

1. Conduct explicit statistical analysis of sex-related brain morphological differences in the datasets to determine if morphological differences could explain performance patterns
2. Test model generalization using a third external dataset with different acquisition parameters to confirm dataset bias findings
3. Perform ablation studies on the Grad-CAM averaging methodology to determine sensitivity of interpretability findings to technical implementation choices
