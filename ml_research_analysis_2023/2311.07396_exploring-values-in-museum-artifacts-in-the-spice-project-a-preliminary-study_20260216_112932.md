# Exploring Values in Museum Artifacts in the SPICE project: a Preliminary Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07396
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07396
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: A semantic reasoning tool (DEGARI 2.0) classifies museum artifacts using combined value-emotion concepts through TCL logic, tested on 12 items from Hecht Museum

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DEGARI 2.0, a semantic reasoning tool developed within the SPICE project that leverages commonsense reasoning and moral foundations theory to associate museum artifacts with combined values and emotions. The system uses a probabilistic extension of typicality-based Description Logic (TCL) to generate novel prototypical value concepts by combining emotional features extracted from lexical resources with moral value features from the eMFD dictionary. Tested on a small subset of 12 items from the Hecht Museum in Haifa, the approach enables more inclusive interpretations of cultural content by suggesting items associated with both similar and novel value stances.

## Method Summary
The DEGARI 2.0 system uses Typicality-based Compositional Logic (TCL) to generate synthetic value-emotion prototypes by combining emotional features from the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon with moral value features from the eMFD dictionary. The system preprocesses museum item descriptions using NLTK and TreeTagger to extract lemmatized terms and identify frequent keywords. These representations are then compared against TCL-generated prototypes, with items classified if they contain all rigid properties and at least 30% of typical properties of the compound emotion under consideration. The approach enables classification of items into combined value-emotion categories such as degradation-disgust and sanctity-awe.

## Key Results
- Successfully classified 12 museum items from Hecht Museum using combined value-emotion concepts
- Generated novel prototypical value concepts through TCL by integrating NRC emotional features with eMFD moral foundations
- Enabled recommendation of culturally relevant items based on both similar and contrasting value stances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system combines emotional features with moral values using TCL to generate novel value-emotion prototypes.
- Mechanism: TCL's typicality-based reasoning framework allows creation of hybrid concepts by integrating emotion intensity scores from NRC lexicon with moral foundation features from eMFD. These hybrid prototypes classify museum items based on lexical matches.
- Core assumption: Words frequently used in describing an item are also typical of the emotions/values they represent.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "The obtained synthetic 'symbolic hybrids' (they only contain up to 7 features for each generated concepts) are prototypes of value concepts able to capture in a better way the strong connection between emotions and values." [section] "Once the association of lexical features to the emotional and value concepts in the is obtained and the hybrid emotion-values concepts are generated via the logic TCL, the system is able to reclassify cultural items..."
- Break condition: If lexical frequency doesn't correlate with prototypicality, or if NRC and eMFD lexicons don't align well for the domain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The system recommends items not only similar to user preferences but also with contrasting value stances.
- Mechanism: By classifying items into combined value-emotion categories, the system can surface both similar and dissimilar items based on value distance in the conceptual space.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from exposure to both reinforcing and challenging value perspectives.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This tool can suggest cultural items that are associated not only with the values of already experienced or preferred objects, but also with novel items with different value stances." [section] "On the other side, it enables the recommendation of similar and opposite items based on values and emotions, which in turn enable forms of critical exploration..."
- Break condition: If users prefer echo chambers or if recommendation diversity reduces engagement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system provides explainable AI recommendations by mapping items to specific value-emotion prototypes.
- Mechanism: Each recommendation is traceable to the lexical triggers and the TCL reasoning that generated the classification, supporting transparency.
- Core assumption: Users trust recommendations more when they understand the reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "TCL allows us to provide a formal, explainable framework for combining prototypical descriptions of value concepts." [section] "The system has been launched on an experimental subset of 12 items... The item 'Catapult' is classified by DEGARI with the {degradation-disgust} combined concept because the description contains the key-words 'molestation' and 'weapons'."
- Break condition: If explanations are too complex for users to understand or if transparency reduces perceived recommendation quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Description Logics with typicality operators (ALC+TR)
  - Why needed here: Forms the logical foundation for TCL's non-monotonic reasoning and prototypical concept generation.
  - Quick check question: How does a typicality operator T(C) differ from a standard DL concept C?

- Concept: Moral Foundations Theory (MFT)
  - Why needed here: Provides the structured value taxonomy (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity) that the system maps to emotions.
  - Quick check question: What are the five moral foundations in Haidt's model and what evolutionary basis does each have?

- Concept: Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions
  - Why needed here: Supplies the emotional dimension that gets combined with moral values in the hybrid prototypes.
  - Quick check question: How many basic emotions does Plutchik's model include and how are they organized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: JSON item descriptions -> NLTK + TreeTagger preprocessing -> NRC+eMFD knowledge base -> TCL probabilistic reasoning engine -> Value-emotion classification with explanations

- Critical path: Preprocess text -> Extract frequent terms -> Match against TCL prototypes -> Classify if ≥30% typical properties matched -> Generate explanation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prototype complexity (7 features max) vs. classification accuracy
  - Strict matching (≥30% threshold) vs. recall of relevant items
  - Manual emotion-value mapping vs. automated discovery

- Failure signatures:
  - No classifications returned -> Preprocessing error or threshold too high
  - Wrong classifications -> Lexicon misalignment or TCL prototype generation issue
  - Slow performance -> Inefficient prototype matching or large knowledge base

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test preprocessing pipeline on sample Wikipedia text and verify term frequency extraction
  2. Manually verify TCL prototype generation for one emotion-value pair
  3. Classify a known item and check if lexical triggers match the expected prototype

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed "hybrid moral values" concepts perform compared to traditional single-dimension value classifications in terms of accuracy and inclusivity when applied to larger museum collections?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a preliminary study on 12 items and describes the system's ability to combine moral values with emotions to create more nuanced classifications, but doesn't compare this approach to traditional methods.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation was limited to a small subset of items from one museum, making it impossible to assess comparative performance at scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying both the hybrid value-emotion approach and traditional single-dimension classification to a large, diverse museum collection with ground truth labels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal threshold percentage of typical properties that should match between a cultural item and a combined value-emotion concept for reliable classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using "at least the 30% of the typical properties" as the current threshold but doesn't explore whether this is optimal.
- Why unresolved: The 30% threshold appears to be an arbitrary choice without empirical justification or sensitivity analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of different threshold values across multiple museum collections to determine the point where precision and recall are optimally balanced.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do museum visitors perceive and respond to recommendations based on combined value-emotion classifications compared to traditional interest-based recommendations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses how the system can suggest "novel items with different value stances" to open visitors to "more inclusive interpretations," but doesn't evaluate user experience or engagement.
- Why unresolved: The system was tested on classification accuracy rather than user experience or engagement metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing engagement metrics (time spent, return visits, item exploration depth) between visitors receiving value-emotion recommendations versus traditional interest-based recommendations.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on only 12 items from a single museum limits generalizability
- System performance metrics and classification accuracy are not reported
- Manual mapping between moral foundations and emotions may not capture all nuanced relationships in cultural contexts

## Confidence
- High: The technical feasibility of combining NRC and eMFD lexicons using TCL framework
- Medium: The classification mechanism's ability to identify relevant value-emotion associations
- Low: The recommendation diversity claims and user benefit from contrasting value stances

## Next Checks
1. Scale validation: Test the system on a larger dataset of 50-100 museum items from multiple cultural institutions to assess scalability and consistency
2. User study: Conduct a small-scale user study (n=20) to evaluate whether explanations of value-emotion classifications improve user trust and engagement with recommendations
3. Ablation analysis: Compare system performance when using moral foundations only, emotions only, versus the combined approach to quantify the added value of the hybrid prototypes
