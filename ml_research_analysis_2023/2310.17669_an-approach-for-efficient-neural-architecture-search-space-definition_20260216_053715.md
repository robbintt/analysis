# An Approach for Efficient Neural Architecture Search Space Definition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17669
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 6
- One-line primary result: Hierarchical cell-based search space achieves 0.35% error on MNIST with 15M parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel hierarchical cell-based search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The approach aims to optimize search-time while being general enough to handle most state-of-the-art CNN architectures. The search space is structured hierarchically with cells containing parallel pipelines of configurable blocks, allowing exploration of architectures with varying depth, width, and spatial resolution. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are used to balance accuracy and parameter efficiency during the search process.

## Method Summary
The method employs a hierarchical cell-based search space where each cell contains parallel pipelines of configurable blocks. These blocks can include various operations (convolutions, pooling, merge) with options for batch normalization, activation functions, and skip connections. The search space allows for depth variations through block-level operations, width variations through pipeline-level parallelism, and spatial resolution control through cell-level downsampling/upsampling/samesampling. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimizes two competing objectives: minimizing classification error and minimizing the number of parameters. The approach is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend and tested on the MNIST dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.35% error rate on MNIST dataset
- Produces architectures with 15 million parameters
- Validates the viability of the hierarchical search space for CNN architecture search

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical cell-based search space enables exploration of architectures with both depth and width variations while controlling spatial resolution. The search space is structured in layers of cells, where each cell contains parallel pipelines of configurable blocks. This allows simultaneous search over block-level operations (depth), pipeline-level parallelism (width), and cell-level spatial resolution control (downsampling/upsampling/samesampling). The hierarchical organization enables efficient exploration of complex architectures without exponential explosion in search space size.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm effectively balances accuracy and parameter efficiency in the search process. The EA optimizes two competing objectives simultaneously: minimizing classification error and minimizing the number of parameters. This produces a Pareto front of architectures that represent different trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The evolutionary approach handles the discrete, combinatorial nature of architecture search better than gradient-based methods for this search space.

### Mechanism 3
Configurable block operations with options (batch norm, activation, skip) enable searching architectures with varying complexity and regularization patterns. Each block can contain different operations (convolutions of various kernel sizes, pooling) combined with options for batch normalization, activation functions, and skip connections. This allows the search to discover architectures with different levels of complexity, regularization, and residual connections without requiring predefined block templates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks and their architectural components
  - Why needed here: Understanding the building blocks (convolutions, pooling, residual connections) is essential for designing and evaluating the search space
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a standard convolution and a depthwise separable convolution, and when might each be preferred?

- Concept: Neural Architecture Search methodologies and search space design
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on cell-based NAS approaches and extends them hierarchically; understanding these foundations is crucial for evaluating the novelty and effectiveness
  - Quick check question: How does cell-based NAS differ from earlier macro-architecture search approaches, and what are the trade-offs?

- Concept: Multi-objective optimization and evolutionary algorithms
  - Why needed here: The search uses a multi-objective EA to balance accuracy and parameter efficiency; understanding these optimization concepts is necessary to evaluate the search strategy
  - Quick check question: What is a Pareto front, and why is it useful for NAS when considering multiple objectives like accuracy and model size?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Search Space Definition: Cell-based hierarchical structure with configurable blocks and resolution control
  - Optimization Engine: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (pymoo)
  - Implementation Framework: Keras with TensorFlow backend
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Training on MNIST with accuracy and parameter count metrics
  - Output: Pareto front of architectures representing different accuracy-efficiency trade-offs

- Critical path:
  1. Define block operations and options
  2. Construct cell-based hierarchical search space
  3. Configure multi-objective EA parameters
  4. Run evolutionary search to generate architectures
  5. Evaluate generated architectures on target dataset
  6. Analyze Pareto front for best trade-offs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Search space expressiveness vs. search efficiency: More complex search spaces enable finding better architectures but require more computational resources
  - Fixed vs. learned cell structure: Fixed cell-based approaches are more efficient but may miss innovative architectures
  - Number of objectives: More objectives provide better characterization of trade-offs but complicate the search

- Failure signatures:
  - Search space too restrictive: All architectures converge to similar designs, indicating lack of diversity
  - Search space too large: Evolution fails to converge or finds only random architectures
  - Implementation bugs: Architectures fail to compile or train properly due to invalid configurations
  - Poor objective balance: Evolution focuses only on accuracy and ignores parameter efficiency (or vice versa)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify basic search space construction: Generate a small set of architectures with different block configurations and verify they compile and train correctly on MNIST
  2. Test EA convergence: Run EA with reduced population size and generations on a simpler search space to verify the optimization loop works
  3. Validate multi-objective optimization: Run full search and verify the Pareto front contains architectures with varying accuracy-parameter trade-offs, checking that the constraint on maximum parameters is enforced

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed hierarchical search space compare in terms of search efficiency and solution quality to existing cell-based and hierarchical NAS frameworks like DARTS, Auto-DeepLab, or DCNAS?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a novel hierarchical search space but only validates it on MNIST with preliminary results, without benchmarking against other state-of-the-art NAS methods
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks comparative experiments against other NAS frameworks on the same datasets and tasks, making it difficult to assess the relative performance and efficiency of the proposed approach
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison experiments on standard benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) against DARTS, Auto-DeepLab, DCNAS, and other state-of-the-art NAS methods, measuring both accuracy and search time

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the flexibility of the proposed search space (ability to handle most state-of-the-art CNN architectures) impact its scalability and search efficiency on larger, more complex datasets like ImageNet or Cityscapes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper aims to create a general search space that can handle most state-of-the-art CNN architectures and mentions future work on larger datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides preliminary results on MNIST, which is a relatively simple dataset. It is unclear how the search space would perform on more complex, high-resolution datasets with larger search spaces
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on larger, more complex datasets like ImageNet or Cityscapes, comparing the performance and search efficiency of the proposed method to existing approaches

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different block configurations (e.g., different kernel sizes, activation functions, or regularization techniques) on the performance of the searched architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the user needs to provide a set of blocks for the search space and provides examples of different block configurations
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different block configurations on the performance of the searched architectures. It is unclear which block configurations are most effective and how they contribute to the overall performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies or sensitivity analyses on the impact of different block configurations on the performance of the searched architectures, identifying the most effective configurations and their contribution to overall performance

## Limitations

- Scalability concerns on complex datasets beyond MNIST remain unaddressed
- Limited comparative analysis against state-of-the-art NAS methods
- Computational cost of exploring the hierarchical search space not fully characterized

## Confidence

- High: The hierarchical cell-based search space structure is correctly implemented and produces valid CNN architectures
- Medium: The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm effectively balances the accuracy-parameter trade-off on MNIST
- Low: The approach generalizes well to complex vision tasks and maintains computational efficiency at scale

## Next Checks

1. Test the search space on CIFAR-10/100 to verify performance on more challenging image classification tasks
2. Perform ablation studies to determine which components of the hierarchical structure contribute most to performance
3. Measure and report wall-clock time for the evolutionary search process to assess practical feasibility for larger-scale problems
