# Accurate synthesis of Dysarthric Speech for ASR data augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08438
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08438
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Proposed modified neural multi-talker TTS approach for generating dysarthric speech with severity and pause controls, improving ASR WER by 12.2% baseline and 6.5% additional with controls

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a modified neural multi-talker TTS approach for generating synthetic dysarthric speech to augment ASR training data. The method incorporates a dysarthria severity level coefficient and a pause insertion model, allowing synthesis of speech with varying severity levels and pause patterns. Subjective evaluations found the perceived dysarthric-ness of the synthesized speech to be similar to true dysarthric speech, especially at higher severity levels. ASR experiments on the TORGO dataset showed that using synthetic dysarthric speech for training improved WER by 12.2% compared to the baseline, with additional improvements of 6.5% when including severity and pause controls.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a modified FastSpeech2 TTS model with a severity level predictor and pause insertion model to generate synthetic dysarthric speech. The model is trained on the TORGO dataset (8 dysarthric speakers, 7 normal speakers) and uses speaker embeddings to learn individual dysarthric voice characteristics. The variance adaptor applies frame-level masking to control pitch, energy, duration, and severity coefficients, with the pause insertion model generating pause locations based on sentence length and severity. The synthesized speech is then used to augment DNN-HMM ASR training on fMLLR features.

## Key Results
- Synthetic dysarthric speech improves ASR WER by 12.2% compared to baseline
- Addition of severity level and pause controls further decreases WER by 6.5%
- Subjective evaluations show synthesized speech perceived as similarly dysarthric to true dysarthric speech at higher severity levels
- Model learns speaker-specific characteristics like stutter-like patterns and phoneme confusion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding severity level and pause controls improves ASR WER by modeling dysarthric-specific prosodic and acoustic variations.
- Mechanism: The synthesis model conditions on severity coefficients and pause insertion parameters to generate speech that matches the dysarthric distribution across severity levels. This allows training data augmentation to reflect the true variability in dysarthric speech, which improves ASR robustness.
- Core assumption: The synthetic speech accurately captures severity-dependent prosodic and pause characteristics that are representative of real dysarthric speech.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "addition of the severity level and pause insertion controls decrease WER by 6.5%"
  - [section] "The speaking rate is often substantially slower for talkers with dysarthria" and "pause duration over sentence length for the group with higher severity level is increased by a higher rate"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing; no direct comparison to these mechanisms in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If synthetic speech fails to capture real dysarthric pause patterns or severity-dependent duration changes, augmentation will not improve ASR performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frame-level masking in the variance adaptor allows precise control of pitch and energy at the temporal resolution of individual frames, improving prosody modeling.
- Mechanism: Frame-level masking enables independent adjustment of pitch and energy per frame after duration alignment, allowing the model to learn dysarthric-specific energy envelope variations and pitch instabilities that vary across phonemes.
- Core assumption: Frame-level modifications capture dysarthric pitch and energy variability better than phoneme-level modifications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "masking is a method of padding to the maximum length of the input sequence which are phonemes or the maximum length of the output sequence which is here the mel spectrogram length"
  - [section] "a recent variant of the paper found that phoneme level feature is more effective and their synthesized speech is more natural" (Chien et al. 2021) - suggesting phoneme level may be preferred, but frame level was used here.
  - [corpus] Weak or missing; no direct evidence about masking effectiveness in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If phoneme-level masking provides better prosody modeling for dysarthric speech, frame-level masking may degrade naturalness or fail to capture variability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-talker TTS with speaker embeddings learns individual dysarthric voice characteristics from limited data, enabling personalized synthesis.
- Mechanism: The model uses speaker embeddings to condition synthesis on individual speaker traits (e.g., stutter-like characteristics, phoneme confusion patterns) learned from small training sets, allowing augmentation that reflects each speaker's unique dysarthric patterns.
- Core assumption: Even with limited dysarthric speech data per speaker, the model can learn sufficient speaker-specific characteristics to generate realistic synthetic speech.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the system learned to model stutter-like characteristics for some speakers" and "The system learned specific phoneme confusion patterns around place and manner of articulation"
  - [section] "Individual dysarthric characteristics are learned by the system itself from the training data corresponding to individual speakers, as part of the speaker embedding process"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing; no direct evidence about speaker embedding effectiveness for dysarthric speech in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If speaker embeddings cannot learn sufficient characteristics from limited data, synthetic speech will lack speaker-specific authenticity, reducing ASR benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dysarthria severity levels and their acoustic correlates
  - Why needed here: The model conditions on severity to generate appropriate prosodic variations; understanding severity-level differences is critical for setting coefficients and evaluating synthesis.
  - Quick check question: What are the three severity categories used in this work and how do they differ in terms of pause frequency and duration?

- Concept: TTS variance adaptor and controllable prosodic parameters
  - Why needed here: The model modifies pitch, energy, duration, and severity coefficients through the variance adaptor; understanding this module is essential for debugging synthesis issues.
  - Quick check question: How does the variance adaptor use coefficients to adjust the target mel-spectrogram duration and prosody?

- Concept: ASR data augmentation principles
  - Why needed here: The goal is to improve ASR by training on synthetic dysarthric speech; understanding how augmentation improves robustness is key to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing training data diversity (e.g., varying severity and prosody) typically improve ASR WER for impaired speech?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text -> Phoneme sequence -> Encoder hidden states
  - Variance adaptor applies duration, pitch, energy, severity modifications and inserts pauses
  - Decoder generates mel-spectrogram from modified hidden states
  - Mel-spectrogram -> Waveform (vocoder not detailed in paper)
  - Synthetic speech used to augment ASR training data

- Critical path:
  1. Text → Phoneme sequence → Encoder hidden states
  2. Variance adaptor applies duration, pitch, energy, severity modifications and inserts pauses
  3. Decoder generates mel-spectrogram from modified hidden states
  4. Mel-spectrogram → Waveform (vocoder not detailed in paper)
  5. Synthetic speech used to augment ASR training data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frame-level vs. phoneme-level masking: Frame-level allows finer temporal control but may be harder to learn; phoneme-level may be more stable but less precise.
  - Number of severity levels: Three levels balance model complexity and data requirements but may miss intermediate severities.
  - Pause insertion model simplicity: Simple model based on sentence length and severity is easy to implement but may not capture complex pause patterns.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor WER improvement: Synthetic speech may not accurately capture dysarthric characteristics.
  - Unnatural prosody: Frame-level masking or severity coefficients may be incorrectly tuned.
  - Speaker similarity issues: Model may not learn sufficient speaker-specific traits from limited data.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary severity coefficient from 0 to 2 with fixed pitch/energy/duration to observe prosodic changes in synthesized speech.
  2. Test different combinations of pitch, energy, and duration coefficients to find optimal augmentation settings.
  3. Compare ASR WER with and without synthetic data augmentation across all severity levels to validate effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out any open questions, but several potential research directions emerge from the work:
- How does the proposed method compare to other dysarthric-specific data augmentation techniques?
- How well does the method generalize to dysarthric speech from different sources or with different characteristics?
- How does the proposed method perform in real-world applications, such as improving communication for dysarthric individuals or aiding in diagnosis and treatment?

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation scope: Only tested on TORGO dataset with DNN-HMM ASR model
- Lack of detailed implementation specifications: Exact FastSpeech2 architecture, hyperparameters, and ASR model details not provided
- No evidence of generalizability: Method only evaluated on North American English speakers with cerebral palsy-related dysarthria

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the claim that synthetic dysarthric speech improves ASR WER: The paper reports specific WER improvements (12.2% baseline, 6.5% with severity/pause controls) with clear experimental methodology and reproducible results on a well-known dataset.

**Medium confidence** in the claim that frame-level masking improves prosody modeling: While the paper describes the mechanism, it lacks direct comparisons to phoneme-level alternatives and does not provide ablation studies demonstrating frame-level superiority for dysarthric speech.

**Low confidence** in the claim that the model captures speaker-specific dysarthric characteristics: The paper mentions learned characteristics but provides minimal quantitative evidence, relying instead on qualitative observations without systematic speaker similarity evaluations.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on masking strategy**: Implement both frame-level and phoneme-level masking variants, train each on TORGO, and compare ASR WER improvements and subjective naturalness ratings to determine which approach better captures dysarthric prosody.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train the TTS model on TORGO, generate synthetic speech, and evaluate ASR performance on a different dysarthric speech dataset (e.g., Nemours) to assess model generalizability across datasets and speaker populations.

3. **Severity coefficient sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary severity coefficients from 0 to 2 in increments of 0.25, generate synthetic speech at each level, and measure corresponding changes in ASR WER and objective prosody metrics (e.g., speaking rate, pause duration) to validate the coefficient-to-prosody mapping.
