# TexFusion: Synthesizing 3D Textures with Text-Guided Image Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.13772
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13772
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TexFusion generates diverse, high-quality, globally coherent 3D textures 10x faster than previous methods using 2D diffusion models

## Executive Summary
TexFusion introduces a novel approach for text-guided 3D texture synthesis that leverages 2D image diffusion models to generate high-quality textures for 3D objects. Unlike previous methods that rely on slow optimization processes, TexFusion achieves state-of-the-art results by applying diffusion model denoising across multiple 2D rendered views of a 3D object and aggregating the predictions on a shared latent texture map. The method generates final RGB textures by optimizing a neural color field on decodings of 2D renders of the latent texture, avoiding the over-saturation issues common in Score Distillation Sampling approaches.

## Method Summary
TexFusion operates by applying a diffusion model's denoiser to multiple 2D rendered views of a 3D object, then aggregating these denoising predictions on a shared latent texture map. The method uses Stable Diffusion 2.0 as its diffusion backbone and employs a Sequential Interlaced Multiview Sampler (SIMS) that interleaves texture aggregation with denoising steps across multiple camera views. To ensure 3D consistency, TexFusion selects the most direct view for each texture pixel using a quality metric based on negative Jacobian magnitude. The final output textures are produced by optimizing a neural color field on the decodings of 2D renders of the latent texture, using both L2 and VGG-based perceptual losses to smooth out inconsistencies while preserving semantic content.

## Key Results
- Achieves 10x speed improvement (3 minutes vs 30 minutes) compared to previous text-guided 3D texture synthesis methods
- Generates textures with more natural tones and higher diversity compared to Score Distillation Sampling-based approaches
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on FID metrics and user studies evaluating naturalness, detail, artifacts, and prompt alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
TexFusion achieves 3D consistency by interleaving texture aggregation with denoising steps across multiple camera views. At each denoising step, rendered images from different camera views are projected into a shared latent texture map, guided by a quality metric that selects the most direct view for each texture pixel. This ensures all views contribute consistent information throughout the generation process.

### Mechanism 2
The method avoids over-saturation by using regular diffusion sampling instead of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). TexFusion uses standard DDIM sampling with classifier-free guidance applied only to depth and text conditioning, allowing the diffusion model to generate more natural tones while maintaining alignment with the text prompt and geometry.

### Mechanism 3
TexFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining multi-resolution refinement with neural color field distillation. It first generates a low-resolution latent texture map using cameras that cover the entire object, then refines with higher-resolution cameras and a larger texture map. The final RGB texture is obtained by optimizing a neural color field that maps 3D spatial coordinates to colors, reconciling inconsistencies introduced by the decoder.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
  - Why needed here: TexFusion relies on the denoising mechanism of diffusion models to iteratively refine texture predictions from noise
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between the noise schedule αt and the denoising step in Eqn. 2?

- **Concept**: Classifier-free guidance
  - Why needed here: TexFusion uses classifier-free guidance to control the alignment of texture to both depth and text without requiring separate classifier networks
  - Quick check question: How does the wjoint parameter in the formula (1 - wjoint)εθ(x) + wjointεθ(x; d, text) control the strength of conditioning?

- **Concept**: UV parameterization and texture mapping
  - Why needed here: TexFusion operates on UV-parameterized texture maps, requiring understanding of how 3D surface points map to 2D texture coordinates
  - Quick check question: What geometric property determines whether a UV parameterization is injective (one-to-one)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 3D mesh + text prompt -> Camera setup -> SIMS sampling -> Latent texture map -> Multi-view decoding -> Neural color field optimization -> RGB texture output

- **Critical path**: 1) Camera setup and UV parameterization, 2) SIMS sampling with latent texture aggregation, 3) Neural color field optimization

- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-view sampling vs. single-view sampling (multi-view ensures 3D consistency but requires more rendering passes), Nearest neighbor vs. bilinear filtering for texture sampling (nearest neighbor maintains noise distribution but introduces aliasing), Fixed vs. adaptive camera configuration (fixed configuration simplifies implementation but may not optimally cover complex geometries)

- **Failure signatures**: Texture appears flat or lacks detail (likely caused by insufficient noise scale or temperature parameter in SIMS), Visible seams or stitching artifacts (indicates quality-based aggregation is failing to resolve view conflicts), Over-saturation or unrealistic colors (suggests guidance weights are too high or conditioning is too weak)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test SIMS with a simple geometry (cube) and single camera view to verify basic denoising functionality, 2) Add multiple camera views to a simple geometry to verify quality-based aggregation and 3D consistency, 3) Test the full pipeline on a complex geometry with known UV parameterization to verify end-to-end functionality and identify bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does TexFusion perform on highly occluded geometries where a single camera cannot observe the entire surface? The paper mentions that for human characters, a single camera does not adequately cover the entire surface due to occlusions, and they use 3 sets of 8 cameras to address this issue. While the paper addresses this issue for human characters, it does not explore how TexFusion performs on other highly occluded geometries or provide a general solution for handling occlusions.

### Open Question 2
Can TexFusion be extended to generate textures for non-triangular mesh representations, such as point clouds or voxel grids? The paper mentions that TexFusion can be applied to any geometry representation for which a textured surface can be rendered, but all experiments use surface meshes. The paper does not explore the application of TexFusion to other geometry representations, and it is unclear how the rendering and inverse rendering functions would be adapted for these representations.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of camera views and their configuration affect the quality and consistency of the generated textures? The paper mentions that they use a canonical set of cameras for most objects and tailor cameras to specific objects to improve resolution and ameliorate occlusions. The paper does not provide a systematic study of how different camera configurations affect the generated textures, and it is unclear what the optimal camera setup is for various object types and shapes.

### Open Question 4
Can TexFusion be combined with other 3D generative models to jointly generate geometry and textures? The paper mentions that TexFusion can be used to generate textures for given 3D geometries, but it does not explore the possibility of using it in conjunction with 3D generative models. The paper focuses on texturing existing 3D geometries and does not investigate the potential of using TexFusion as a component in a larger 3D generative pipeline.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies on a relatively small dataset of 35 meshes with 86 mesh-text pairs, which may not adequately represent the diversity of real-world 3D content
- The user study sample size of 15 participants provides limited statistical power for the perceptual quality claims
- The performance on highly complex geometries with intricate UV parameterizations remains untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The speed advantage claim (3 minutes vs 30 minutes) is directly measurable and well-supported by the experimental setup
- The over-saturation issue with SDS methods is a well-documented phenomenon in diffusion literature
- The basic functionality of multi-view aggregation improving consistency over single-view approaches

**Medium Confidence:**
- The claim of "state-of-the-art" performance is supported by FID metrics but limited by the small evaluation dataset
- The assertion that TexFusion generates "more natural tone" textures compared to SDS methods relies on subjective user study results
- The generalizability claim across "broad range of geometry and texture types" is based on testing on 35 meshes from various sources

**Low Confidence:**
- The exact contribution of the interleaving approach versus full-view denoising first (as used in TEXTure) is not clearly isolated
- The long-term stability and consistency of generated textures across multiple generations is not evaluated
- The performance on professional-grade 3D assets with production-quality UV mappings is untested

## Next Checks

1. **Scale-up validation**: Test TexFusion on a significantly larger dataset (500+ meshes) representing diverse geometry types, UV parameterizations, and topology complexity to validate the generalizability claims and identify failure modes on challenging geometries.

2. **Ablation study on aggregation strategy**: Systematically compare the quality-based aggregation approach against alternatives (bilinear filtering, nearest neighbor) and against the full-view denoising approach used in concurrent work, measuring both consistency metrics and visual quality.

3. **Long-term consistency evaluation**: Generate multiple textures for the same mesh-text prompt pair across different random seeds and evaluate the consistency of generated features (color palettes, pattern distributions) using statistical similarity measures beyond FID.
