# CoSMo: A constructor specification language for Abstract Wikipedia's content selection process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02539
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: A novel language embedding multilinguality directly into content selection specifications for Abstract Wikipedia

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoSMo, a modeling language designed to enable community-driven content selection for Abstract Wikipedia. CoSMo innovates by embedding multilingual support directly into the language specification, allowing users to create constructors in their preferred language that automatically fetch labels from Wikidata. The language supports both declarative content and functions, includes both classes and instances, and takes a modular approach where constructors are first-class citizens. Through a rigorous stakeholder-informed design process and formal logic-based semantics, CoSMo aims to separate information modeling from linguistic rendering while supporting complex multilingual content generation.

## Method Summary
The paper presents CoSMo through a systematic design process involving stakeholder consultation, iterative specification development, and formal logic-based formalization. The methodology included gathering requirements from Abstract Wikipedia stakeholders, designing both textual and diagrammatic notations, and validating the language against use cases from the requirements phase. The language was formalized using first-order logic to ensure technology independence, and preliminary evaluation was conducted to assess expressiveness against the specified requirements.

## Key Results
- CoSMo successfully embeds multilinguality by mapping constructor elements to Wikidata items with automatic label fetching
- The language supports both declarative content and functions while maintaining separation of information modeling from linguistic rendering
- Evaluation demonstrates CoSMo can represent various use cases from requirements while meeting design principles like role support and modularity
- The formalization using first-order logic provides a technology-independent specification that can be implemented across different platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CoSMo enables true multilingual modeling by embedding language labels directly into the specification rather than post-processing or translating after modeling.
- Mechanism: Each constructor element is mapped to a Wikidata item (Q or P), and the interface automatically renders the element's label in the user's selected language. This means the same model file works for any language without manual translation steps.
- Core assumption: Wikidata has stable, multilingual labels for all required items and these labels remain consistent over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "multilinguality is embedded in the modelling language"
  - [section 3.2]: "the language is de facto multilingual, because it can fetch the label in one's desired language from Wikidata"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on translation tools but not on multilingual modeling languages, so no direct support.
- Break Condition: Wikidata items are deleted, merged, or labels become inconsistent across languages.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CoSMo separates content selection from linguistic realization, allowing reuse of constructors across different natural language generation systems.
- Mechanism: The language only specifies what data to select and relationships between data, not how to phrase or order it in natural language. This creates a clean interface between content selection and linguistic processing stages.
- Core assumption: Downstream NLG systems can consume the declarative content structure without needing linguistic hints embedded in the constructor.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "separation of the information modelling from the natural language rendering aspects"
  - [section 5.2]: "the language only specifies what data to select and relationships between data, not how to phrase or order it in natural language"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers discuss NLG pipelines but don't address separation of content selection from realization.
- Break Condition: NLG systems require linguistic cues in constructors to generate coherent text, making the separation insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CoSMo's modular design with first-class constructors enables compositional content selection and reuse across different contexts.
- Mechanism: Constructors can be defined at instance or type level, combined, specialized, or generalized, and referenced by other constructors, creating a library of reusable content selection patterns.
- Core assumption: Users will create and organize constructors in ways that maximize reuse rather than creating isolated, one-off specifications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A fully modular approach, where modules (as so-called 'constructors') are first-class citizens in the language"
  - [section 3.2]: "Constructors can be reused and combined in other constructors"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers discuss modularity in software engineering but not in content selection languages.
- Break Condition: The cost of managing and navigating a large constructor library outweighs the benefits of reuse.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conceptual Data Modeling**: Why needed here: CoSMo builds on and extends traditional conceptual modeling languages but with novel features like multilingual support and functions. Understanding EER, UML, and ORM helps grasp what's being innovated.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between EER diagrams and UML class diagrams in terms of expressing relationships and constraints?

- **First-Order Logic**: Why needed here: The formal semantics of CoSMo are defined using first-order logic, which is essential for understanding the language's precise meaning and behavior.
  - Quick check question: How would you express "A Person has exactly one Birth Date" in first-order logic?

- **Natural Language Generation Pipeline**: Why needed here: CoSMo is positioned as the content selection step in an NLG pipeline, so understanding the full pipeline context is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What are the typical stages in a natural language generation pipeline, and where does content selection fit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CoSMo specification language (textual/diagrammatic) -> Logic-based formal semantics layer -> Wikidata integration for multilingual labels -> Tooling for authoring/validation -> Downstream NLG systems

- **Critical path**: 1) User defines constructor using CoSMo notation 2) Tool validates against formal semantics 3) Constructor is stored with Wikidata Q-item mappings 4) NLG system consumes constructor for content selection 5) Linguistic realization occurs downstream

- **Design tradeoffs**: The choice to embed multilingual support via Wikidata mappings trades off language independence for reliance on Wikidata's stability and coverage. The modular constructor approach trades implementation simplicity for potential complexity in managing constructor libraries.

- **Failure signatures**: If constructors fail to load, check Wikidata item existence and label availability. If NLG output is incorrect, verify the constructor captures the right data relationships. If multilingual rendering fails, check language-specific label availability in Wikidata.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Create a simple instance constructor for a known Wikidata item (like Douglas Adams) and verify it retrieves correct data
  2. Test multilingual rendering by switching interface language and confirming labels update correctly
  3. Combine two existing constructors and verify the composition works as expected in an NLG system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of functions in constructors affect the complexity and performance of the NLG pipeline?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that constructors can contain both static content and functions, and that functions are assumed to be executed on Wikifunctions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide details on how functions are executed or their impact on performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing NLG pipelines with and without function-based constructors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the "no new vocabulary" design rule on the expressiveness and usability of CoSMo?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that vocabulary creation in constructors is prohibited, and users must use existing Wikidata content.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or benefits of this design choice.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing the ease of use and expressiveness of CoSMo with and without the "no new vocabulary" rule.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of a non-perspectivist representation affect the versatility and reusability of constructors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the representation should be the least perspectivist possible to increase reusability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide evidence on the impact of this design choice on reusability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies showing the reusability of constructors with and without a perspectivist representation.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the use of roles in CoSMo compare to other conceptual data modeling languages in terms of expressiveness and ease of use?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that roles are first-class citizens in CoSMo and that they may be named with subject domain-specific names.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the use of roles in CoSMo to other modeling languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of CoSMo and other modeling languages in terms of expressiveness and ease of use.

## Limitations

- The evaluation remains largely qualitative without quantitative metrics on expressiveness, usability, or performance
- Heavy reliance on Wikidata for multilingual support creates a critical external dependency that could affect long-term stability
- The formalization using first-order logic provides theoretical rigor but has not been implemented in a verification system
- Community adoption potential is promising but unproven, as the language is newly introduced and requires significant tooling development

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The language design process was systematic and stakeholder-informed
- **Medium confidence**: The separation of content selection from linguistic realization is theoretically sound
- **Low confidence**: Real-world adoption and usability by non-technical Wikipedia contributors

## Next Checks

1. Implement a prototype tool with full Wikidata integration and test multilingual rendering across 5+ languages for 20+ constructors
2. Conduct usability studies with Wikipedia editors of varying technical backgrounds to assess learning curve and practical utility
3. Benchmark CoSMo's expressiveness against existing modeling languages using a standardized set of content selection scenarios
