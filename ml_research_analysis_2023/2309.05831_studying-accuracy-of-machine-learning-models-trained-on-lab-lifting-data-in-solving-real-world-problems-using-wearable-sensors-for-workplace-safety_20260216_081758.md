# Studying Accuracy of Machine Learning Models Trained on Lab Lifting Data in Solving Real-World Problems Using Wearable Sensors for Workplace Safety

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.05831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05831
- Reference count: 13
- One-line primary result: By refining training data, resolving sensor placement issues, and removing non-salient sensors, F1 score improved from 32.8% to 55%, with best model achieving 64.66%.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of deploying machine learning models trained on controlled lab data to real-world environments for lifting detection using wearable IMU sensors. The authors identify three primary causes of performance degradation: systematic timestamp misalignment between IMU sensors and ground truth labels, model overfitting to non-generalizable features, and lack of representative training data. Through a systematic investigation, they demonstrate that addressing these issues through data refinement, sensor placement correction, and strategic sensor removal can significantly improve model performance in real-world applications. The study provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of human activity recognition (HAR) deployment and offers actionable solutions for improving model generalization.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an LSTM-based model for lifting detection using six IMU sensors placed on different body locations. They collected data in two phases: controlled lab environments with motion capture ground truth (Phase 1&2) and real-world workplace settings (Phase 3). The model architecture consists of a 128-unit LSTM layer followed by two Dense layers (width 5) and an output layer. To address performance degradation, they implemented four key solutions: correcting timestamp misalignment through clock drift detection, removing non-salient sensors identified through saliency mapping, refining training data to better represent real-world scenarios, and strategically selecting sensor subsets. The models were evaluated using F1 score and accuracy metrics on real-world test data.

## Key Results
- F1 score improved from 32.8% to 55% through systematic refinement of training data and sensor selection
- Best-performing model achieved 64.66% F1 score by removing non-salient sensors and resolving timestamp alignment issues
- Saliency mapping revealed model overfitting to arm gyroscope data that was not representative of real-world lifting scenarios
- Timestamp misalignment caused systematic prediction delays of up to several seconds due to IMU clock drift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Systematic offset between IMU sensor timestamps and ground truth labels degrades model performance.
- Mechanism: IMU clocks drift relative to camera clocks during data collection, causing model predictions to lag behind actual events. The model learns to predict based on the offset rather than true temporal patterns.
- Core assumption: IMU sensor data is time-aligned with the ground truth labels; if not, model predictions will be systematically shifted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "It was discovered that several subjects had systematic offsets between the IMU time and the labeling time. This caused the predictions to be delayed by up to several seconds."
  - [section] "Upon investigation, it appears that the IMU clock drifts out of sync with the camera clock over time."
- Break condition: If IMU and camera clocks remain perfectly synchronized throughout data collection, or if the model architecture inherently handles time shifts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Removing non-salient sensors improves model generalization.
- Mechanism: The original model overfits to sensor features that are highly correlated with lifting in the lab (like arm extension) but not representative of real-world scenarios. Removing these sensors forces the model to learn more generalizable features.
- Core assumption: Some sensors contain features that are too specific to the lab environment and hurt generalization to real-world data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In our situation, it actually ends up hurting performance more than helping...removing features not deemed salient to lifting...improved performance significantly."
  - [section] "Models were retrained on their specific sets of sensors and reevaluated on the entire real-world dataset."
- Break condition: If all sensors provide equally generalizable features, or if removing sensors eliminates critical distinguishing features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Saliency mapping reveals model reliance on non-generalizable features.
- Mechanism: Visualizing which input features most influence model predictions shows whether the model is learning from meaningful patterns or overfitting to dataset-specific correlations.
- Core assumption: Model decisions can be traced back to specific input features, and these features can be analyzed for generalizability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Saliency mapping is a technique which uses the weights between neurons as well as an input to create a heatmap of the input features that have the most significance on the output."
  - [section] "As we can see in figure 4, this model uses a single point in our input data as a major indicator of whether a lifting event is occurring or not."
- Break condition: If saliency mapping techniques cannot be applied to the model architecture, or if the saliency maps are ambiguous or misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data alignment and synchronization
  - Why needed here: The paper shows that misaligned timestamps between IMU sensors and ground truth labels cause systematic prediction errors.
  - Quick check question: If IMU data is collected at 25Hz and labeled with camera timestamps, what synchronization method would you use to align them?

- Concept: Transfer learning limitations
  - Why needed here: The authors attempted transfer learning but found it ineffective due to lack of standardized IMU sensor placements across datasets.
  - Quick check question: Why does the lack of standard IMU placement locations prevent effective transfer learning in this HAR application?

- Concept: Feature saliency analysis
  - Why needed here: Saliency mapping revealed that the model was overfitting to arm gyroscope data, which was not representative of real-world lifting scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How would you use saliency mapping to identify whether a model is relying on dataset-specific rather than generalizable features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw IMU sensor data -> Timestamp alignment and filtering -> LSTM layer (128 units) -> Dense layers (width 5) -> Output layer (size 1) -> Performance evaluation
- Critical path: Clean and align training data -> Train LSTM model -> Evaluate on real-world data -> Analyze performance issues -> Apply targeted fixes (sensor removal, data refinement)
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Sensor removal improves generalization but reduces sensitivity to certain lifting types
  - Using raw data performs better than filtering, but filtering could help with noisy real-world deployments
  - Small sliding window (10 frames) improves temporal resolution but may be more sensitive to data alignment issues
- Failure signatures:
  - Consistently delayed predictions indicating clock drift issues
  - Over-reliance on single features suggesting overfitting
  - Large performance gap between lab and real-world data indicating poor generalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify timestamp alignment by comparing IMU data with ground truth labels for several trials
  2. Train baseline model with all sensors and evaluate on real-world data to establish performance gap
  3. Apply saliency mapping to identify which features the model relies on most heavily

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can synthetic IMU data generated from motion capture datasets effectively replace or augment real-world IMU data for training HAR models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors attempted to use synthetic IMU data from the AMASS dataset but were unable to reconcile differences between synthetic and real-world data formats.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while synthetic data generation is possible, technical challenges in matching the data formats (particularly gyroscopic data) prevented successful implementation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A successful implementation showing that models trained on synthetic IMU data can achieve comparable performance to those trained on real-world data when deployed in actual environments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal sensor placement strategy for IMU-based HAR models that need to generalize across different workplace environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that removing non-salient sensors improved performance, but acknowledge this limits model capabilities and may not be optimal for all scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that sensor selection can improve performance for their specific use case, but doesn't explore whether this approach would work across different HAR applications or environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing which sensor configurations work best across multiple HAR tasks and environments, including validation on diverse real-world datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop standardized methods for IMU data collection and labeling that would enable better transfer learning across different HAR applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that lack of standardization in IMU placement prevents effective use of transfer learning and publicly available datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies standardization as a key barrier but doesn't propose specific solutions or demonstrate what standardized approaches might look like.
- What evidence would resolve it: A documented framework for standardized IMU placement, data collection protocols, and labeling schemes that multiple research groups could adopt and validate across different HAR applications.

## Limitations
- Dataset represents a single workplace environment, limiting generalizability to other industrial settings
- Real-world data collection was relatively small, potentially leading to overfitting to this specific scenario
- Exact implementation details of timestamp synchronization remain unclear, making independent reproduction difficult
- Sensor removal strategy introduces tradeoff between model simplicity and detection sensitivity for different lifting types

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The identification of systematic timestamp misalignment as a primary cause of performance degradation is well-supported by both empirical evidence and logical explanation. The clock drift mechanism and its impact on model predictions are clearly demonstrated through direct observation of offset timing issues.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of sensor removal for improving generalization is supported by experimental results, but the underlying mechanism remains partially speculative. While saliency mapping shows which features the model relies on, the causal relationship between feature saliency and real-world performance requires further validation across different tasks and environments.

**Low Confidence**: The transfer learning attempt's failure is attributed to non-standardized sensor placements, but this conclusion is based on a single unsuccessful attempt without exploring alternative transfer learning approaches or normalization techniques that might have overcome this limitation.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Environment Validation: Test the refined model on data collected from a completely different workplace environment with different lifting patterns and sensor placement variations to verify generalization beyond the original real-world dataset.

2. Ablation Study on Sensor Removal: Systematically reintroduce removed sensors one-by-one to quantify the exact contribution of each sensor to performance gains, distinguishing between the benefits of reduced complexity versus the elimination of non-generalizable features.

3. Timestamp Synchronization Robustness: Implement and test alternative timestamp alignment methods (such as cross-correlation or dynamic time warping) to determine whether the specific correction approach used is critical to the performance improvements observed.
