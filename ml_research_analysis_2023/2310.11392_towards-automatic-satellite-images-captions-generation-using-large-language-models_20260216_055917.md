# Towards Automatic Satellite Images Captions Generation Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11392
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11392
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: ARSIC approach achieves CIDEr-D score of 85.93 on RSICD dataset

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of generating accurate captions for satellite remote sensing images, which typically requires extensive human annotation effort and domain expertise. The proposed ARSIC approach leverages large language models (LLMs) and geographical analysis APIs to automatically collect captions for remote sensing images by describing object annotations. ARSIC performs clustering and spatial analysis on image objects, then prompts LLMs to summarize these findings into captions. A pre-trained generative image2text model (GIT) is fine-tuned on the automatically collected captions.

## Method Summary
The ARSIC approach consists of three main steps: (1) developing geographical analysis APIs to detect clusters, identify shapes formed by objects, and calculate distances, (2) prompting LLMs to generate captions based on the geographical analysis results using few-shot prompting technique, and (3) evaluating and selecting the best caption for each image using a combination of CLIP-based image-text matching and diversity measures. The method uses MST clustering to group remote sensing objects based on spatial proximity and type similarity, then leverages LLM's language generation capabilities to synthesize spatial analysis results into natural language captions.

## Key Results
- ARSIC achieves a CIDEr-D score of 85.93 on the RSICD dataset
- The approach effectively reduces human annotation needs for satellite image captioning
- Fine-tuned GIT model performs well on automatically collected captions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) clustering algorithm effectively groups remote sensing objects based on spatial proximity and type similarity.
- Mechanism: MST algorithm connects all objects in the image and forms clusters by removing significantly long edges. Extra length is added to distances between objects of different types to encourage grouping similar objects together.
- Core assumption: Objects of the same type tend to be spatially related and should be clustered together for meaningful caption generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We used the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to connect all the objects in the image and form clusters by removing significantly long edges from the graph."
  - [section] "To encourage grouping objects of the same type into the same cluster, We add extra length to distances between objects of different types."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for MST effectiveness in remote sensing object clustering.
- Break condition: If the number of objects per image exceeds 15, the spatial layout becomes too complex for the LLM to process effectively, potentially reducing caption quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Few-shot prompting with explicit formatting instructions improves LLM's ability to generate accurate and diverse captions from spatial analysis results.
- Mechanism: The LLM is provided with examples showing the expected input format (object groups and spatial relations) and output format (Python list of captions). This guides the LLM to synthesize information rather than simply repeating input details.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively understand spatial relationships and generate natural language descriptions when provided with structured examples and clear formatting instructions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In this work, the summarising behavior of LLM is ensured by providing necessary examples in the prompt, which is more frequently referred to as the 'Few-Shot' prompting technique."
  - [section] "To effectively restrict the response to a computer-readable format, we explicitly instruct the LLM to output the captions in the format of a Python list."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for few-shot prompting effectiveness in remote sensing captioning.
- Break condition: If the LLM is not pre-trained on Python list formatting or spatial relationship descriptions, the explicit formatting instructions may not be effective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining geographical analysis APIs with LLM-generated captions produces higher quality remote sensing image descriptions than using either approach alone.
- Mechanism: APIs perform spatial analysis (clustering, distance calculations, shape detection) that LLMs cannot handle directly. The LLM then synthesizes this structured information into natural language captions, leveraging its language generation capabilities while avoiding numerical processing limitations.
- Core assumption: LLMs have strong language generation capabilities but struggle with numerical data and spatial reasoning, while traditional APIs excel at numerical analysis but cannot generate natural language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ARSIC leverages external APIs to perform simple geographical analysis on images, such as object relations and clustering."
  - [abstract] "We perform clustering on the objects and present the significant geometric relations for LLM to make summarizations."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for the effectiveness of combining APIs with LLMs for remote sensing captioning.
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot effectively understand the structured output from the APIs, the synthesis process may fail to produce meaningful captions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: MST-based clustering algorithms
  - Why needed here: The paper uses MST to group remote sensing objects based on spatial proximity and type similarity, which is crucial for identifying meaningful spatial patterns in satellite images.
  - Quick check question: How does adding extra length to distances between objects of different types affect the clustering results?

- Concept: Few-shot prompting techniques
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on providing the LLM with examples of expected input-output formats to guide caption generation, rather than using extensive instructions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between few-shot prompting and zero-shot prompting in the context of this work?

- Concept: Remote sensing image characteristics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the unique challenges of satellite imagery (aerial perspective, object scale variations, complex spatial relationships) is essential for appreciating why conventional captioning models fail.
  - Quick check question: Why do pre-trained models like BLIP and GIT struggle with aerial images compared to ground-view images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Remote sensing images with bounding boxes → Spatial Analysis APIs (MST clustering, distance calculations, shape detection) → LLM Prompting System → LLM Generation → CLIP-based Evaluator → Diversity Filter → Selected captions

- Critical path: Image → Spatial Analysis APIs → LLM Prompting → LLM Generation → CLIP Evaluation → Caption Selection

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using MST clustering vs. density-based clustering: MST better handles the limited number of objects per image but may be less effective for dense scenes
  - Few-shot prompting vs. zero-shot with detailed instructions: Few-shot is more stable but requires creating example captions
  - Python list formatting vs. natural language output: Python list ensures machine readability but requires LLM familiarity with this format

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering results: Captions may incorrectly group spatially distant but similar objects, or separate spatially close but different objects
  - LLM misunderstanding spatial relations: Captions may contain inaccurate descriptions of object positions or relationships
  - CLIP evaluator bias: May favor generic captions over specific, accurate descriptions if the training data is not diverse enough

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test MST clustering on a small set of images with varying object counts and types to verify it groups objects as expected
  2. Evaluate LLM performance with different prompt formats (few-shot vs. zero-shot with detailed instructions) on the same spatial analysis results
  3. Compare CLIP-based caption evaluation with human judgments on a subset of generated captions to assess alignment quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed ARSIC approach compare to fine-tuning GPT-3.5 directly on satellite image captioning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of GPT-3.5 for satellite image captioning but does not directly compare its performance to the ARSIC approach.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a direct comparison between ARSIC and GPT-3.5 fine-tuned on satellite image captioning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the performance of ARSIC and GPT-3.5 fine-tuned on satellite image captioning tasks would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of threshold for edge removal in the MST-based clustering algorithm affect the quality of generated captions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention setting the threshold at the 75 percentile of edge weights from the entire dataset but do not explore the impact of different threshold values.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the effect of varying the threshold value on the clustering results and subsequent caption generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different threshold values and evaluating the resulting captions' quality would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the ARSIC approach scale with the number of objects in the satellite images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors limit the number of objects to no more than 15 for simplicity, but do not explore the approach's performance with a larger number of objects.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the scalability of the ARSIC approach to satellite images with a higher number of objects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with satellite images containing varying numbers of objects and evaluating the ARSIC approach's performance would provide evidence to resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of MST clustering for remote sensing object grouping remains uncertain due to limited validation and no direct corpus support
- The approach's scalability is questionable, as the spatial layout complexity becomes problematic when object counts exceed 15 per image
