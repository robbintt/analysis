# Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System via Autoencoder

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10001
- Reference count: 36
- One-line primary result: Autoencoder method learns predictive models for unknown stochastic dynamical systems, producing long-term predictions and handling non-Gaussian noises more robustly than GAN-based approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an autoencoder-based method to learn predictive models for unknown stochastic dynamical systems from trajectory data. The method uses deep neural networks to encode noisy trajectory pairs into latent random variables (assumed Gaussian) and decode future states from current states and latent variables. By training on short bursts of trajectory data, the decoder serves as a predictive model for the unknown stochastic system. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to produce accurate long-term predictions and handle systems with non-Gaussian noises, outperforming previous GAN-based approaches in robustness and accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method learns an encoding function to extract latent random variables (modeled as unit Gaussian) from noisy trajectory data, and a decoding function to reconstruct future states given current states and latent variables. Both functions are implemented as deep neural networks (DNNs). The training uses short bursts of trajectory data with a reconstruction loss for the decoder and a distributional loss for the encoder. The autoencoder approach allows more robust DNN training and yields higher accuracy compared to previous methods using GANs. The method automatically detects the true dimensions of unobserved stochastic components by monitoring reconstruction errors across different latent variable dimensions.

## Key Results
- The autoencoder method produces long-term system predictions with higher accuracy than previous GAN-based approaches
- The method successfully handles stochastic systems driven by non-Gaussian noises
- The approach automatically detects true dimensions of unobserved stochastic components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The autoencoder learns latent Gaussian variables that encode the stochastic component of the SDE, enabling accurate long-term predictions.
- Mechanism: The encoder maps pairs of consecutive states (x_n, x_{n+1}) to latent variables z_n assumed to be unit Gaussian. The decoder then reconstructs x_{n+1} from x_n and z_n. Training enforces z to follow a unit Gaussian distribution independent of x_n, which allows the decoder to act as a predictive model for the SDE.
- Core assumption: The unknown SDE can be approximated by an Itô SDE driven by a Wiener process, and the latent variables represent increments of the Brownian motion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Both the encoder and decoder are expressed as deep neural networks (DNNs). Once the DNNs are trained by the trajectory data, the decoder serves as a predictive model for the unknown stochastic system."
  - [section] "Once the hidden variable z is learned by the encoding function, the unknown function G_Δ will be learned by a decoding function."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on general stochastic modeling but not the specific autoencoder latent variable approach.
- Break condition: If the SDE cannot be well-approximated by an Itô SDE with Gaussian noise, the latent variable assumption breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sub-sampling strategy ensures latent variables are independent of current states, improving model generalization.
- Mechanism: Training data pairs (x_n, x_{n+1}) are grouped into batches by randomly sampling x_n from the entire dataset and finding nearest neighbors for x_{n+1}. This prevents the encoder from learning a simple linear mapping dependent on x_n's distribution.
- Core assumption: Independence between latent variables and current states is critical for the model to generalize beyond training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To enforce the independence condition, we recognize that the samples z(i) in the batch B are computed by the encoder via (3.5)."
  - [section] "For each batch B (3.7), let {x(i)_0}^N_{i=1} be sampled from an arbitrary non-Gaussian distribution out of the training data set (3.1)."
  - [corpus] Missing - related papers don't discuss sub-sampling strategies for independence.
- Break condition: If sub-sampling is not performed, the encoder may learn dependencies that hurt generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining distributional loss with moment loss ensures accurate Gaussianity of latent variables.
- Mechanism: The loss function includes a Renyi-entropy-based distance between batch distribution and unit Gaussian, plus moment matching up to 6th order. This combination is more effective than either alone.
- Core assumption: Enforcing higher-order moments is necessary to ensure true Gaussianity beyond just matching the first two moments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Through our extensive numerical experimentation, we have found Renyi-entropy-based distance to be highly effective."
  - [section] "It is necessary to include the moment loss L_moment to ensure Gaussianity of the latent variable z."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss loss functions but not the specific combination used here.
- Break condition: If moment matching is omitted, the latent variables may not be truly Gaussian, hurting model accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Itô stochastic differential equations and flow maps
  - Why needed here: The method assumes the unknown SDE can be approximated by an Itô SDE, and the flow map is what the autoencoder learns to predict.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between an Itô SDE and a Stratonovich SDE?

- Concept: Autoencoder architectures and latent variable models
  - Why needed here: The core method uses an autoencoder where the encoder learns latent Gaussian variables representing the stochastic component.
  - Quick check question: How does an autoencoder differ from a standard feedforward neural network?

- Concept: Probability distributions and statistical distance measures
  - Why needed here: The method uses Renyi entropy and moment matching to enforce Gaussianity of latent variables.
  - Quick check question: What is the Renyi entropy and how does it differ from other entropy measures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Trajectory pairs (x_n, x_{n+1}) -> Encoder DNN -> Latent variables z_n -> Decoder DNN -> Predicted x_{n+1}
- Critical path: Encoder -> Latent variable learning -> Decoder training -> Prediction model
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latent dimension nz: Too small loses stochastic information, too large overfits
  - Batch size: Larger batches better estimate distributions but use more memory
  - Loss weighting λ: Controls balance between reconstruction and distribution fitting
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor long-term predictions: Latent variables not truly Gaussian or dependent on states
  - High training loss but poor predictions: Overfitting or underfitting in DNNs
  - Decoder outputs unrealistic: Incorrect latent dimension or loss function issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train on simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, visualize latent variable distribution
  2. Test prediction accuracy on validation data for increasing time horizons
  3. Compare with baseline GAN-based approach on same problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How robust is the autoencoder sFML approach to high-dimensional latent variables (nz > 10) in real-world stochastic systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the method for 2D and 5D OU processes, but only up to nz = 5. The authors suggest future work to study this rigorously.
- Why unresolved: The paper's numerical examples focus on low-dimensional systems (d ≤ 5). High-dimensional latent variables may introduce computational challenges and require more sophisticated training strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application to high-dimensional stochastic systems (d > 5) with large latent dimensions (nz > 10), demonstrating maintained accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the autoencoder sFML method handle non-stationary stochastic dynamical systems where the underlying SDE parameters change over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes time-homogeneous Itô diffusions (Assumption 2.1). The method is designed for systems with fixed parameters.
- Why unresolved: The method relies on learning a fixed flow map from trajectory data. Non-stationary systems would require learning time-varying parameters or adapting the flow map over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the method's ability to learn and predict non-stationary stochastic systems, with accurate long-term predictions despite changing underlying parameters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the autoencoder sFML approach compare in accuracy and computational cost to other generative models (e.g., normalizing flows, diffusion models) for stochastic dynamical systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the autoencoder approach favorably to GANs used in previous sFML work, citing better training stability and accuracy. However, it does not compare to other modern generative models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing to GANs, but other generative models may offer advantages in certain scenarios. A comprehensive comparison would provide a clearer understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Rigorous comparison of the autoencoder sFML approach to other generative models (e.g., normalizing flows, diffusion models) on a diverse set of stochastic dynamical systems, evaluating both accuracy and computational cost.

## Limitations
- The method assumes the unknown SDE can be well-approximated by an Itô SDE with Gaussian noise, which may not hold for all real-world systems.
- Specific implementation details of the Renyi-entropy-based distance measure are not fully specified, impacting reproducibility.
- The method's performance on real-world noisy data with measurement errors is not demonstrated.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The autoencoder architecture and training procedure are well-defined and theoretically sound for the assumed SDE class.
- Medium confidence: The sub-sampling strategy for ensuring latent variable independence is intuitively justified but lacks extensive empirical validation.
- Medium confidence: The combination of distributional loss with moment matching effectively enforces Gaussianity, though alternative approaches may work equally well.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on real-world stochastic systems with known ground truth to validate performance on noisy measurement data.
2. Compare the autoencoder approach against alternative latent variable models (e.g., variational autoencoders) on the same benchmark problems.
3. Investigate the method's robustness to violations of the Itô SDE assumption by testing on systems with non-Gaussian or discontinuous noise.
