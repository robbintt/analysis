# A Large Language Model-based Computational Approach to Improve Identity-Related Write-Ups

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16659
- Reference count: 6
- The paper presents a computational approach using LLMs to improve identity-related write-ups through prompt-generated cues and Concept Graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel computational approach to enhance written products, specifically identity-related write-ups, using Large Language Models (LLMs). The method employs an iterative process that generates and categorizes cues from LLM responses to identify and address areas for improvement in the write-ups. The approach focuses on two case studies: one using an analogy and one using a metaphor, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in improving central ideas, credibility, and idea flow. The use of Concept Graphs provides a visual representation of the write-up structure and LLM feedback, highlighting opportunities for enhancement.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating prompts to elicit LLM responses, which are then grouped into three categories: cues to be explored, cues for evaluation, and cues to be ignored. Selected cues are prioritized using evaluation cues, separately explored based on priority, and combined from parallel threads. This iterative process aims to improve the quality of write-ups by addressing central ideas, credibility, and idea flow. The approach is validated through two case studies and the use of Concept Graphs to represent connections between concepts in write-ups and LLM responses.

## Key Results
- The iterative exploration loop with categorized cues effectively improves write-ups by addressing central ideas, credibility, and idea flow.
- Using analogies and metaphors as vehicles for identity-related writing increases engagement and understanding.
- Concept Graphs provide a visual representation of write-up structure and LLM feedback, highlighting areas for improvement.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative exploration loop with categorized cues improves writing by addressing central ideas, credibility, and idea flow.
- Mechanism: Prompts generate LLM responses that are grouped into cues to be explored, cues for evaluation, and cues to be ignored. Selected cues are prioritized using evaluation cues, separately explored based on priority, combined from parallel threads, and then used to rewrite the paragraph.
- Core assumption: Grouping and prioritizing cues from LLM responses helps identify the most relevant improvements to a write-up.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The algorithmic approach groups cues into three categories: cues to be explored, cues for evaluation, and cues to be ignored. It prioritizes selected cues using evaluation cues, separately explores selected cues based on priority, and combines cues from separate explorations."
  - [section] "Depending on the current state of the exploration process, the cues in the response can go through three different processing steps, as shown in Figure 1."
  - [corpus] Weak. No corpus evidence directly supports the mechanism of cue categorization and prioritization.
- Break condition: If cue categorization does not lead to actionable improvements or creates irrelevant suggestions, the iterative loop becomes inefficient.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using analogies and metaphors as vehicles for identity-related writing increases engagement and understanding.
- Mechanism: Analogies and metaphors create isomorphisms between concepts in the write-up and familiar narratives, aiding comprehension and emotional impact. The algorithm improves the plausibility and impact of these vehicles by strengthening their soundness and expected emotional outcome.
- Core assumption: Readers can identify and appreciate the isomorphism between concepts in an analogy or metaphor, leading to better understanding and engagement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Two case studies on improving write-ups, one based on an analogy and one on a metaphor, are also presented in the paper."
  - [section] "Analogies have been extensively studied in cognitive psychology and in design sciences [V osniadou and Ortony(1989)]... Understanding analogies implies identifying isomorphic structures among the referred descriptions, including finding the common properties or the similarity degree of the utilized examples in the description [Ferent and Doboli(2013b)], [Weitzenfeld(19 84)]."
  - [corpus] Weak. No corpus evidence directly supports the effectiveness of analogies and metaphors in improving identity-related write-ups.
- Break condition: If readers cannot identify the intended isomorphism or find the analogy/metaphor confusing, engagement and understanding decrease.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concept Graphs (CGs) provide a visual representation of write-up structure and LLM feedback, highlighting areas for improvement.
- Mechanism: CGs represent concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, showing broader context, detailing, alternatives, causality, negation, and connection. Metrics based on CGs quantify explored space, unexplored cases, degree of connection, unconnected ideas, idea inconsistencies, and idea flow.
- Core assumption: Visualizing the relationships between concepts in a write-up and LLM feedback helps identify structural issues and opportunities for improvement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Figure 2 illustrates the representation considered for the authored paragraphs, prompts, and the LLM-generated responses... The representation comprises of clusters of related ideas... so that the clusters describe the context of a sentence or paragraph, as well as its detailing, causal, supporting, or negation relationships between the clusters."
  - [section] "A set of metrics were defined using the proposed representation for input paragraphs, prompts, and LLM responses... The metrics refer to the following aspects: (1) Explored space... (2) Unexplored cases... (3) Degree of connection... (4) Unconnected ideas... (5) Idea inconsistencies... (6) Idea flow."
  - [corpus] Weak. No corpus evidence directly supports the use of Concept Graphs for improving write-ups.
- Break condition: If the CG representation becomes too complex or fails to capture the nuances of the write-up, it loses its utility as a tool for improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: Effective prompts are crucial for generating relevant and useful LLM responses that can guide the improvement of write-ups.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in prompt engineering, and how can they be addressed to improve the quality of LLM responses?
- Concept: Concept Graph Construction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to build and interpret Concept Graphs is essential for visualizing the structure of write-ups and identifying areas for improvement.
  - Quick check question: How do the different types of relationships (broader context, detailing, alternatives, causality, negation, connection) in a Concept Graph contribute to the overall understanding of a write-up?
- Concept: Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: Defining and applying appropriate metrics is necessary for quantifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach and identifying specific areas of improvement.
  - Quick check question: How do the proposed metrics (explored space, unexplored cases, degree of connection, unconnected ideas, idea inconsistencies, idea flow) help in evaluating the quality of a write-up and the effectiveness of the improvement process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input write-up -> Prompt Generator -> LLM response -> Cue Categorizer -> Cue Prioritizer -> Parallel Explorer -> Cue Combiner -> Output improved write-up
- Critical path: Prompt generation -> LLM response -> Cue categorization -> Cue prioritization -> Parallel exploration -> Cue combination -> Write-up improvement
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the breadth and depth of exploration, the specificity of prompts, and the complexity of the Concept Graph representation
- Failure signatures: Ineffective prompts leading to irrelevant LLM responses, cue categorization that does not lead to actionable improvements, or a Concept Graph that fails to capture the nuances of the write-up
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effectiveness of different prompt structures in generating relevant LLM responses for improving write-ups.
  2. Evaluate the impact of cue categorization and prioritization on the quality of the improved write-ups.
  3. Assess the utility of Concept Graphs in identifying structural issues and opportunities for improvement in write-ups.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a cognitive theory for similarity judgment in analogies that explains how relevance emerges and is used during the understanding process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that there are still no accepted cognitive theories on similarity judgment in analogies, including how relevance emerges and is used in understanding analogies.
- Why unresolved: Current understanding of analogy processing relies on puzzle-solving approaches, but lacks a unified cognitive framework for explaining how humans judge similarities and determine relevance during analogy comprehension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating consistent cognitive patterns in how people identify and use relevant features when processing different types of analogies, along with computational models that can predict these patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated cues in terms of their contribution to improving the coherence, credibility, and idea flow of written products?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for evaluation metrics but only proposes preliminary metrics related to explored space, unexplored cases, degree of connection, unconnected ideas, idea inconsistencies, and idea flow.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes some metrics, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing how well LLM-generated cues actually improve the quality of written products, particularly in terms of the three main improvement areas mentioned (coherence, credibility, and idea flow).
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies comparing different evaluation metrics and their correlation with human assessments of write-up quality, as well as validation of these metrics across various types of written content.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we improve the representation of Concept Graphs (CGs) to better capture the implicit relationships and semantic nuances in written products, particularly for complex metaphors and analogies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses Concept Graphs to represent relationships in write-ups but acknowledges limitations in the current representation, such as the need for a "simple sentence understanding procedure" and the potential for different readers to identify different associations.
- Why unresolved: The current representation captures explicit relationships but may miss important implicit connections and semantic nuances, especially in complex metaphors and analogies where meaning often relies on unstated assumptions and cultural context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of more sophisticated representation methods that can capture both explicit and implicit relationships, along with empirical studies demonstrating improved understanding and evaluation of complex written products using these enhanced representations.

## Limitations
- The specific prompts used in the paper are not provided, making it difficult to reproduce the exact experiments and results.
- The evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of the improved write-ups are not fully described, limiting the ability to compare the results to the original write-ups.
- The utility of Concept Graphs depends on the accuracy of the graph representation, which may not always capture the nuances of the write-ups.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach using a diverse set of write-ups and prompts to assess its generalizability and effectiveness.
2. Develop a standardized set of prompts and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparison and reproducibility of the results.
3. Perform a detailed analysis of the Concept Graphs to validate their accuracy and utility in identifying opportunities for improvement in write-ups.
