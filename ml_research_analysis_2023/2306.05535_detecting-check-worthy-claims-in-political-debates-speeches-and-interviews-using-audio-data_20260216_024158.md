# Detecting Check-Worthy Claims in Political Debates, Speeches, and Interviews Using Audio Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2306.05535
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05535
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Audio modality improves check-worthiness detection for multiple speakers (MAP=38.17), and audio-only models can outperform text-only models for single speakers (wav2vec 2.0 MAP=34.27 vs BERT MAP=32.67)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the task of detecting check-worthy claims in political debates, speeches, and interviews using both text and audio data. The authors create a new multimodal dataset containing 48 hours of speech from past political debates in the USA. They propose a novel framework that combines text and audio modalities, including knowledge alignment from text to audio and ensemble methods. The primary results show that adding the audio modality yields sizable improvements over using text alone in the case of multiple speakers, with the best ensemble model achieving a MAP score of 38.17. For a single speaker, an audio-only model could outperform a text-only one, with wav2vec 2.0 achieving a MAP score of 34.27 compared to BERT's 32.67.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a combination of text and audio models to detect check-worthy claims in political debates, speeches, and interviews. Pre-trained models like BERT for text and wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and data2vec-audio for audio are fine-tuned on the dataset. The method includes knowledge alignment from text to audio in a teacher-student setup, where the audio model learns to produce representations that match the fine-tuned textual model's representations. Ensemble methods combine text and audio representations using early fusion (concatenation) and late fusion (confidence combination). The dataset, which includes both textual transcriptions and original audio recordings, is addressed for class imbalance through oversampling techniques.

## Key Results
- Multimodal ensemble models achieve MAP score of 38.17 for multiple speakers
- Audio-only models outperform text-only models for single speakers (wav2vec 2.0 MAP=34.27 vs BERT MAP=32.67)
- Knowledge alignment from text to audio improves audio model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Audio representations can be aligned to textual model outputs via knowledge alignment to improve check-worthiness detection performance.
- Mechanism: The audio model learns to produce vector representations that match the fine-tuned textual model's representations for the same input, trained in a teacher-student setup with joint classification and vector alignment losses.
- Core assumption: The task-specific semantic space of the textual model can be transferred to the audio model through supervised alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel framework that combines text and audio modalities, including knowledge alignment from text to audio"
  - [section] "we train an audio model to represent the input it receives in the same way a fine-tuned textual model represents its input in a teacher-student mode"
- Break condition: If the audio and text modalities encode fundamentally different information or if the audio representations cannot capture the semantic nuances needed for check-worthiness classification.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ensembling text and audio models through early or late fusion improves check-worthiness detection compared to single modality approaches.
- Mechanism: Text and audio feature vectors are either concatenated (early fusion) or their confidence scores are combined (late fusion) before final classification, allowing complementary information from both modalities to be leveraged.
- Core assumption: Text and audio modalities capture complementary aspects of check-worthiness that can improve joint performance when combined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the best ensemble model achieving a MAP score of 38.17"
  - [section] "We leverage both the audio and the textual representations by combining them using two techniques: early fusion... late fusion"
- Break condition: If one modality consistently dominates the other in the ensemble, or if the fusion mechanism cannot effectively combine the complementary information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Audio-only models can outperform text-only models for check-worthiness detection when analyzing a single speaker's utterances.
- Mechanism: Speaker-specific acoustic patterns (prosody, emphasis, emotional cues) in audio provide discriminative features for check-worthiness that may be more reliable than text alone for consistent speakers.
- Core assumption: Individual speakers have consistent acoustic patterns that correlate with their tendency to make check-worthy claims.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For a single speaker, an audio-only model could outperform a text-only one, with wav2vec 2.0 achieving a MAP score of 34.27 compared to BERT's 32.67"
  - [section] "The person with most check-worthy claims is Donald Trump and thus we create a separate dataset with his utterances"
- Break condition: If speaker-specific acoustic patterns are not consistent across their utterances, or if the audio model cannot capture the relevant acoustic features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: The task requires combining information from text and audio modalities to improve check-worthiness detection
  - Quick check question: What are the two main approaches for combining multimodal representations described in the paper?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation/teacher-student learning
  - Why needed here: The knowledge alignment mechanism uses a teacher-student approach where the audio model learns from the textual model
  - Quick check question: What are the two loss components in the knowledge alignment training?

- Concept: Imbalanced classification and oversampling
  - Why needed here: The dataset has very few check-worthy claims (around 2%), requiring oversampling techniques to train effective models
  - Quick check question: What three variants of the training dataset were created to address the imbalance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: Audio noise reduction, text tokenization
  - Textual models: BERT, SVM with TF.IDF, FNN with named entities
  - Audio models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, data2vec-audio
  - Knowledge alignment module: Projector layers, dual loss training
  - Ensemble module: Early fusion (concatenation), late fusion (confidence combination)
  - Evaluation: MAP score calculation on development and test sets

- Critical path: Audio preprocessing → Model training (text/audio) → Knowledge alignment (if used) → Ensemble combination → MAP evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Text-only vs audio-only vs multimodal: Different performance characteristics depending on single/multiple speaker scenarios
  - Knowledge alignment weight (λ): Balancing between alignment loss and classification loss
  - Early vs late fusion: Different ways to combine multimodal information with different complexity implications

- Failure signatures:
  - Knowledge alignment failing: Audio model performance worse than or similar to text-only baseline
  - Ensembles not improving: Combined model performance not exceeding best single modality
  - Imbalance handling failing: Models consistently miss check-worthy claims in evaluation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate BERT baseline on text-only to establish performance floor
  2. Train and evaluate wav2vec 2.0 baseline on audio-only to compare single modality performance
  3. Implement early fusion ensemble of BERT and HuBERT to test multimodal improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the performance of audio-based models for check-worthy claim detection change when applied to languages other than English?
- What is the impact of using contextual information from surrounding utterances on the detection of check-worthy claims?
- How does the proposed knowledge alignment method between text and audio modalities perform with different types of political speech (e.g., interviews vs. debates)?
- What is the optimal strategy for handling the label imbalance problem in check-worthy claim detection beyond the oversampling/undersampling approaches tested?

## Limitations
- The knowledge alignment mechanism's effectiveness is not fully validated independently
- Single-speaker results (particularly for Trump) may not generalize to other speakers
- The dataset construction and split details are not fully specified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The multimodal ensemble approach showing MAP=38.17 on multiple speakers is well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The knowledge alignment mechanism's contribution is plausible but not independently validated
- **Medium Confidence**: Audio-only performance on single speakers (wav2vec 2.0 MAP=34.27) is demonstrated but may not generalize

## Next Checks
1. Run ablation studies to measure the standalone contribution of knowledge alignment by comparing audio models with and without alignment training
2. Test the single-speaker audio model on multiple speakers to assess generalizability beyond Trump's utterances
3. Perform cross-dataset validation by testing the best models on an independent political speech dataset to verify real-world applicability
