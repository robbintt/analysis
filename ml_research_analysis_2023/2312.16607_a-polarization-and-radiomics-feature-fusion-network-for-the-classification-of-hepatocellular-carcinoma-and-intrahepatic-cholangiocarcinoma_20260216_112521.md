# A Polarization and Radiomics Feature Fusion Network for the Classification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16607
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16607
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Dual-modality fusion network achieves 87.67% accuracy in classifying HCC, ICC, and non-cancerous structures using polarization and radiomics features.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a dual-modality machine learning framework for classifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) by fusing polarization features from Mueller matrix images with radiomics features from H&E pathological images. The proposed Polarization and Radiomics Feature Fusion Network (PRFFN) employs a two-tier fusion strategy combining early feature-level fusion and late classification-level fusion. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over single-modality classifiers, with particular advantage in maintaining stability under reduced imaging resolution. The approach leverages complementary information from polarization imaging's microstructural insights and radiomics analysis of spatial patterns in H&E images.

## Method Summary
The method combines polarization features (23 dimensions) extracted from Mueller matrix images with radiomics features (93 dimensions) from H&E images through a two-tier fusion network. Image registration aligns the two modalities at the pixel level using affine transformation. The PRFFN employs early feature-level fusion via weighted summation with attention mechanism, followed by three MLP layers (512, 256, 128 units) with ReLU activation. Late classification-level fusion merges predictions from different network layers using another attention mechanism. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation (14 folds) evaluates performance, with grid search optimizing parameters through cross-validation.

## Key Results
- PRFFN achieves 87.67% accuracy, 88.39% precision, 87.65% recall, and 86.26% F1-score in classifying HCC, ICC, and non-cancerous structures
- Demonstrates superior resolution robustness: accuracy decreases only from 89.3% to 87.3% under reduced resolution, compared to 77.3% to 66.9% for radiomics-only classifiers
- Outperforms single-modality classifiers and traditional fusion approaches through complementary polarization and radiomics feature integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Dual-modality feature fusion improves classification accuracy over single-modality classifiers by combining polarization features that provide sub-wavelength microstructural information not visible in H&E images with radiomics features that capture spatial distribution patterns. The two feature types are complementary rather than redundant, yielding a more complete representation of tissue characteristics.

### Mechanism 2
The two-tier fusion strategy (early feature-level and late classification-level) outperforms single-tier fusion approaches by first combining raw features from both modalities to create a richer feature representation, then merging predictions from different network layers to allow the model to weigh information at multiple hierarchical levels.

### Mechanism 3
The PRFFN maintains stable performance under reduced imaging resolution due to the robustness of polarization features, which rely on polarization characteristics rather than pixel-level detail. This makes the classifier more robust to resolution degradation compared to radiomics-only approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mueller matrix polarimetry and its derived parameters (linear retardation, depolarization, optical rotation, diattenuation)
  - Why needed here: These parameters form the polarization features that capture microstructural information invisible to standard H&E imaging
  - Quick check question: What physical tissue properties do linear retardation and depolarization parameters represent in Mueller matrix decomposition?

- Concept: Radiomics feature extraction (intensity-based and texture-based features)
  - Why needed here: These features quantify spatial patterns and pixel intensity distributions in H&E images, providing macro-structural information
  - Quick check question: How do gray level co-occurrence matrix features differ from gray level run length matrix features in characterizing tissue texture?

- Concept: Affine image registration and its role in multi-modal data fusion
  - Why needed here: Registration aligns Mueller matrix and H&E images at the pixel level, ensuring corresponding features are extracted from the same tissue locations
  - Quick check question: Why is affine transformation preferred over rigid transformation for registering Mueller matrix and H&E images in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer (23 polarization + 93 radiomics features) → Early fusion layer (weighted summation with attention) → MLP layers (512, 256, 128 units with ReLU) → Late fusion layer (weighted summation with attention) → Output layer (softmax classification)
- Critical path: Feature extraction → Early fusion → MLP processing → Late fusion → Classification
- Design tradeoffs: Polarization features enable resolution robustness but require specialized imaging equipment; two-tier fusion adds complexity but captures complementary information at different levels; MLP architecture chosen for simplicity but may be less powerful than deeper architectures
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation if feature registration is inaccurate; overfitting if training data is insufficient for the high-dimensional feature space; loss of resolution robustness if polarization features are corrupted at low resolutions
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train and evaluate single-modality classifiers (polarization-only and radiomics-only) to establish baseline performance; 2) Implement early fusion only (skip late fusion) to isolate the contribution of each fusion stage; 3) Test performance degradation as H&E image resolution is artificially reduced to verify resolution robustness claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do polarization features specifically capture sub-wavelength microstructural information that is not visible in standard H&E images, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "polarization features at the low-resolution pixel level and image features of the corresponding color pathological images at the high-resolution image level are complementary" and that "polarization imaging whose imaging mechanism depends on each pixel's polarization characteristics and less on imaging resolution and which could provide effective information that may not be visible to human eyes."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the benefits of polarization features but does not provide a detailed explanation of the specific physical mechanisms by which polarization imaging captures sub-wavelength microstructural information that is not visible in standard H&E images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental data showing the specific microstructural features captured by polarization imaging that are not visible in H&E images, along with a detailed explanation of the underlying physical mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal fusion strategy for combining polarization and radiomics features, and how does it compare to other fusion methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the proposed PRFFN with other fusion methods, including "direct early fusion of polarization and image features" and "late fusion of the prediction results of classifiers using only polarization features and classifiers using only image features."
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that the proposed PRFFN outperforms other fusion methods, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the optimal fusion strategy or a comprehensive comparison with other fusion methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of different fusion strategies, including the proposed PRFFN, with a detailed analysis of the optimal fusion strategy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the PRFFN change with different imaging resolutions, and what is the minimum resolution required for accurate classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the performance of the PRFFN at different imaging resolutions and shows that "the accuracy of classifier that uses only H&E image features significantly decreases from 77.3% to 66.9% with decreasing resolution of H&E images" while "that of classifiers that use only polarization features remains stable with decreasing resolution of PBPs images."
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that the PRFFN maintains stable performance with decreasing resolution, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the minimum resolution required for accurate classification or the performance at different resolutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the PRFFN's performance at different imaging resolutions, including the minimum resolution required for accurate classification.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (14 patients per class) limits generalizability and raises concerns about overfitting in the high-dimensional feature space
- Weak corpus support for key mechanisms, particularly the claimed advantages of dual-modality complementarity and two-tier fusion strategy
- Manual image registration process introduces potential reproducibility challenges and may affect feature alignment accuracy

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The PRFFN architecture and implementation details are clearly specified, enabling faithful reproduction
- Medium Confidence: Performance metrics are supported by leave-one-patient-out cross-validation, but small sample size limits generalizability
- Low Confidence: Mechanisms underlying dual-modality complementarity and two-tier fusion advantages lack strong empirical validation through ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing early fusion only vs. late fusion only vs. two-tier fusion to quantify the contribution of each fusion stage
2. Perform feature correlation analysis between polarization and radiomics features to empirically verify their complementarity assumption
3. Test the model's performance under progressively degraded resolution conditions (beyond the single comparison point) to validate the claimed resolution robustness advantage
