# Cognitive modeling and learning with sparse binary hypervectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18316
- Reference count: 3
- This paper proposes a cognitive model using sparse binary hypervectors to address transparency, efficiency, and cost issues in deep neural networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a cognitive modeling framework that leverages sparse binary hypervectors within a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to create transparent and efficient AI systems. The approach addresses key limitations of deep neural networks by providing immediate interpretability, reduced computational costs, and the ability to operate on resource-constrained devices. The model uses online learning algorithms that update incrementally in streaming fashion, enabling real-time inference without requiring large datasets. By encoding compositional structures like sets and sequences, the framework supports analogical reasoning and knowledge transfer, offering a path toward democratizing AI technology.

## Method Summary
The method implements sparse binary hypervectors with N=65536 dimensions and sparsity s=1/256, creating segmented hypervectors in space C′. It employs bundle and bind operations defined within the VSA framework, using an online bundling learner L(k) that updates incrementally with streaming data. For word-level embedding in NLP tasks, the approach generates observation hypervectors using context windows and maintains separate learners for each word, enabling immediate model updates and inference without backpropagation. The framework leverages the high-dimensional algebraic properties of sparse binary vectors to encode compositional structures and perform analogical reasoning through release operations.

## Key Results
- Proposes transparent, efficient cognitive models using sparse binary hypervectors
- Enables streaming online learning without large datasets or backpropagation
- Supports compositional structures and analogical reasoning for knowledge transfer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sparse binary hypervectors enable transparent and efficient cognitive modeling by leveraging high-dimensional algebraic operations.
- Mechanism: Sparse binary hypervectors in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) use sparse binary vectors with high dimensionality and low sparsity to represent cognitive entities. Algebraic operations like bundling (⊕) and binding (⊗) allow for compositional structures and analogical reasoning. The online learning algorithm updates models in a streaming fashion, reducing storage and computational costs.
- Core assumption: High-dimensional sparse binary vectors can effectively represent and manipulate cognitive entities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Proposes a cognitive model using sparse binary hypervectors to address transparency, efficiency, and cost issues in deep neural networks.
  - [section] Discusses the use of sparse binary hypervectors and their properties, including overlap and Hamming distance as measures of similarity.
  - [corpus] Related papers explore hyperdimensional computing and vector symbolic architectures, indicating ongoing research in this area.
- Break condition: If the high-dimensional space does not provide the expected properties for similarity measurement or compositional operations fail to capture complex relationships.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The online learning algorithm enables immediate model updates and inference without the need for large datasets.
- Mechanism: The online learner L(k) updates the model incrementally with each new data point, using a learning rate that decreases over time (1/(k+1)). This allows the model to adapt to new information while retaining previous knowledge, facilitating real-time inference.
- Core assumption: Incremental updates can effectively capture the evolving nature of data streams without loss of information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Introduces online learning algorithms that operate in a streaming fashion, allowing immediate use of updated models for inference.
  - [section] Details the online bundling learner, explaining how it updates with each new data point and retains similarity to all experiences.
  - [corpus] Research on efficient hyperdimensional computing suggests the feasibility of streaming algorithms.
- Break condition: If the incremental updates lead to model drift or if the decreasing learning rate becomes too small to capture significant changes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Compositional structures encoded in high-dimensional space enable analogical reasoning and knowledge transfer.
- Mechanism: By encoding sets and sequences as hypervectors, the model can perform analogical reasoning through operations like release (⊘). This allows for the retrieval of related information and the transfer of knowledge across different domains.
- Core assumption: High-dimensional space can effectively encode and retrieve complex compositional structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Supports compositional structures like sets and sequences, facilitating analogical reasoning.
  - [section] Explains the encoding of sets and sequences, and demonstrates analogical reasoning with examples like "the dollar of Mexico."
  - [corpus] Studies on tensor products and hyperdimensional computing explore compositional operations in high-dimensional spaces.
- Break condition: If the compositional operations fail to maintain the integrity of encoded structures or if analogical reasoning produces incorrect or irrelevant results.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sparse Binary Hypervector Generator -> Online Learner Module -> Compositional Structure Encoder -> Analogical Reasoning Engine -> Near-Neighbor Search Module

- Critical path:
  1. Generate sparse binary hypervectors for cognitive entities.
  2. Update the model incrementally with new data using the online learner.
  3. Encode compositional structures as needed.
  4. Perform analogical reasoning when required.
  5. Use near-neighbor search for inference and retrieval tasks.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High dimensionality vs. computational efficiency: While high dimensions enable rich representations, they may increase computational demands.
  - Sparsity level: Higher sparsity improves efficiency but may affect the model's ability to capture nuanced relationships.
  - Streaming updates vs. batch processing: Streaming allows real-time adaptation but may be less stable than batch processing.

- Failure signatures:
  - Degradation in similarity measures: If overlap or Hamming distance calculations become unreliable, it may indicate issues with hypervector generation.
  - Ineffective analogical reasoning: Failure to retrieve relevant information suggests problems with compositional encoding or release operations.
  - Model drift: If the model's performance degrades over time, it may indicate issues with the online learning algorithm.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate hypervector generation: Test the generation of sparse binary hypervectors to ensure they meet specified dimensionality and sparsity requirements.
  2. Test online learning updates: Simulate a data stream to verify that the online learner correctly updates the model and maintains similarity to previous experiences.
  3. Evaluate analogical reasoning: Use predefined sets and sequences to assess the model's ability to perform analogical reasoning and retrieve related information accurately.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
