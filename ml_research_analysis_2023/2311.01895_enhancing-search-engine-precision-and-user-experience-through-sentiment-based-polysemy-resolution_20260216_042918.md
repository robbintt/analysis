# Enhancing search engine precision and user experience through sentiment-based polysemy resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01895
- Reference count: 40
- VADER model achieves 85% accuracy in sentiment analysis

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of polysemy in search engines by developing a sentiment-based smart search function integrated into the BBC search engine. The approach combines natural language processing techniques including tokenization, stemming, inverted indexing, and BM25 ranking with sentiment analysis using multiple lexicons to classify news articles by polarity. The proposed system demonstrates improved search precision and relevance by using sentiment signals to disambiguate polysemous search terms.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting BBC news articles using a web crawler, preprocessing text data with NLTK (tokenization, stemming, stop word removal), creating an inverted index for efficient keyword matching, applying BM25 ranking for relevance scoring, and implementing sentiment analysis using five different models (VADER, SentiWordNet, Sentistrength, Liu-Hu, AFINN-111). The system evaluates performance using precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score metrics to identify the optimal sentiment analysis model.

## Key Results
- VADER model achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming other sentiment models
- Proposed search function improves data structure and quality compared to normal search
- System effectively combines sentiment analysis with optimized search functions for more accurate information retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sentiment polarity signals disambiguate polysemous search terms
- Mechanism: The system uses sentiment analysis of retrieved news articles to infer user intent. When a polysemous term is queried, the sentiment distribution of top results indicates which meaning the user likely wants.
- Core assumption: Sentiment of retrieved articles correlates with the intended meaning of polysemous search terms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proposes a solution to this issue by embedding a smart search function into the search engine, which can differentiate between different meanings based on sentiment"
  - [section] "Sentiment analysis of search results can help with this problem by providing additional context and clues to disambiguate the meaning of a query"
- Break condition: Sentiment distributions overlap significantly between meanings, or articles lack clear sentiment signals

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: VADER achieves highest accuracy (85%) due to optimized sentiment lexicon for news text
- Mechanism: VADER's lexicon includes social media patterns that also capture sentiment in news headlines and content. The rule-based approach with compound scoring handles the short, context-dependent nature of news snippets well.
- Core assumption: VADER's lexicon features are applicable to news text despite being optimized for social media
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the VADER model achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming other models"
  - [section] "The proposed search function is envisioned as an optimized algorithmic pipeline that provides the most relevant results from the search engine"
- Break condition: News domain shifts make VADER's lexicon features less predictive

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Inverted indexing with BM25 ranking improves search precision for polysemous terms
- Mechanism: The system tokenizes queries and documents, builds an inverted index mapping terms to documents, then ranks results using BM25 which weights term frequency and document length.
- Core assumption: BM25 ranking with proper term weighting can distinguish relevant contexts for polysemous terms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The BM25 method is utilized to tokenize the user's keywords into distinct words and then apply a ranking function to arrange matching information based on their significance"
- Break condition: Document corpus too small for reliable frequency statistics, or polysemous terms appear in similar contexts across meanings

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Polysemy and word sense disambiguation
  - Why needed here: The core problem being solved is distinguishing between different meanings of the same word in search queries
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between polysemy and homonymy, and why does this distinction matter for search engines?

- Concept: Sentiment analysis lexicons and scoring
  - Why needed here: The system uses multiple sentiment analysis models to classify news articles by polarity
  - Quick check question: How does VADER's compound score differ from simple positive/negative ratios, and why is this useful?

- Concept: Information retrieval ranking (BM25)
  - Why needed here: The search function uses BM25 to rank results based on term frequency and document length
  - Quick check question: What role does the k1 parameter play in BM25 scoring, and how does it affect ranking for rare vs. common terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BBC web crawler → JSON storage → Database (news table) → NLTK preprocessing (tokenize, stem, stopword removal) → Inverted index → BM25 ranking → Sentiment analysis (VADER/SentiWordNet/etc) → Results display
- Critical path: User query → BM25 ranking → Sentiment classification → Display results sorted by relevance and sentiment
- Design tradeoffs: Using multiple sentiment models increases accuracy but adds computational overhead; simpler models could be faster but less accurate
- Failure signatures: High misclassification rate (>20%) indicates sentiment models not capturing domain nuances; low recall suggests indexing issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test BM25 ranking on a small set of polysemous queries and measure precision@5
  2. Compare VADER vs. other sentiment models on a labeled subset of BBC news articles
  3. Measure the impact of stopword removal on search result relevance for polysemous terms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the proposed sentiment-based search function perform when scaled to analyze real-time streaming data from multiple news sources beyond BBC?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest that "the proposed list of categories such as Covid, Vaccine, and Travel can still be extended to improve the search efficiency and reliability" and mention potential for "automatically create search categories using artificial intelligence"
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is limited to a static database of 800 BBC articles with predetermined categories. Real-time streaming would introduce challenges of processing speed, dynamic category creation, and handling multiple simultaneous data sources that weren't tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics (precision, accuracy, F1 score) comparing the current static database approach versus real-time streaming implementation across multiple news sources with dynamically generated categories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal weighting scheme for combining adverbs and adjectives in sentiment analysis that would improve classification accuracy beyond the current lexicon-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: The authors note "Adverbs were identified as the most critical linguistic feature for sentiment extraction" but also state "adjectives and adverbs should not carry equal weight in predicting the sentiment" and suggest combining them "using appropriate feature weighting techniques"
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the importance of adverbs and suggests they shouldn't be weighted equally with adjectives, it doesn't provide experimental results on different weighting schemes or determine what the optimal weighting ratio might be.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative performance results showing accuracy, precision, and F1 scores across different weighting schemes for combining adjective and adverb sentiment scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the search function's performance change when applied to languages other than English, particularly those with rich morphological structures like French or Spanish?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge "the absence of lexicons in languages like French, Spanish, Chinese, and Swahili will impede the deployment of smart search engines" and note that "building a robust and smart sentiment analysis framework for search engines requires tackling challenges such as polysemy, irony, sarcasm, and multi-polarity"
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies heavily on English-specific NLP tools and sentiment lexicons designed for English. The paper doesn't explore how these techniques would transfer to morphologically rich languages or whether the same accuracy levels could be maintained.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-linguistic performance comparisons showing precision, recall, and F1 scores for the same search function implemented in multiple languages, along with error analysis highlighting language-specific challenges.

## Limitations

- Corpus size of 800 articles may be insufficient to capture full complexity of polysemous terms
- Sentiment analysis evaluation relies solely on accuracy metrics without considering news media nuances
- Study does not address potential domain shifts or performance with different news sources

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Technical implementation of BM25 ranking and inverted indexing follows established IR principles
- Medium Confidence: Claim that sentiment polarity can disambiguate polysemous terms is supported but lacks empirical validation
- Low Confidence: Specific accuracy claim of 85% for VADER lacks transparency in evaluation methodology

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study comparing search precision with and without sentiment analysis on a diverse set of polysemous queries
2. Test sentiment analysis models on a labeled dataset specifically curated for news domain sentiment
3. Evaluate system performance across different news categories and sources to assess robustness to domain shifts
