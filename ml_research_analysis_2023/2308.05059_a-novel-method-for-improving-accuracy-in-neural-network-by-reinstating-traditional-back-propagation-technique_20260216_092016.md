# A Novel Method for improving accuracy in neural network by reinstating traditional back propagation technique

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05059
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05059
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Proposed method achieves 97.84% MNIST accuracy vs 96.91% for standard backpropagation

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for improving neural network training accuracy by reinstating traditional backpropagation techniques with layer-wise modifications. The approach calculates errors at each layer and updates parameters using layer-wise loss functions and learning rates, which accelerates learning and avoids vanishing gradient problems. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy compared to standard backpropagation and direct feedback alignment methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves a forward pass through all layers, followed by error calculation at each layer using a layer-wise loss function, and then parameter updates for each layer using the calculated error and a layer-wise learning rate. This process is repeated until convergence. The layer-wise approach allows for more localized and efficient updates that can potentially accelerate the training process and avoid vanishing and exploding gradient problems. The method eliminates the need for computing gradients at each layer, as in traditional backpropagation.

## Key Results
- Proposed method achieves 97.84% accuracy on MNIST compared to 96.91% for standard backpropagation
- Proposed method achieves 96.58% accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to 95.22% for standard backpropagation
- The method demonstrates superior precision, recall, and F1 scores across both datasets compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Layer-wise error calculation reduces vanishing gradient impact
- Mechanism: By computing error at each layer using local deviation rather than backpropagating from output, gradient magnitudes remain stable across layers
- Core assumption: Local loss functions at each layer capture sufficient information for parameter updates
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach accelerates learning, avoids the vanishing gradient problem"
  - [section] "The layer wise approach allows for more localized and efficient updates that can potentially accelerate the training process and avoid the vanishing and exploding gradient problem"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss alternative training methods but don't directly support this mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Layer-wise learning rates enable adaptive update scaling
- Mechanism: Different layers can have different learning rates, allowing more stable updates for earlier layers while permitting aggressive updates for later layers
- Core assumption: Different layers benefit from different learning rate magnitudes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "update the weights and biases of each layer using the calculated error and a layer-wise learning rate that controls the magnitude of the update"
  - [abstract] "updating parameters using layer-wise loss functions and learning rates"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus - this appears to be an inference from the paper's description

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Instant parameter updates eliminate backward pass overhead
- Mechanism: Parameters are updated immediately after error calculation at each layer, removing the need for a separate backward pass phase
- Core assumption: The computational savings from eliminating backward pass outweigh any additional forward pass computations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "eliminates the need for computing gradients at each layer"
  - [section] "Our approach differs from the traditional backpropagation algorithm, which calculates the error at the output layer and backpropagates it to update the parameters of all the layers"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss alternative training but don't specifically address backward pass elimination

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Layer-wise loss function design
  - Why needed here: The method depends on defining appropriate loss functions at each layer, not just the output layer
  - Quick check question: What mathematical form would a layer-wise loss function take for a convolutional layer in image classification?

- Concept: Chain rule and gradient computation
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional backpropagation is essential to appreciate how this method differs
  - Quick check question: How does the chain rule apply differently when computing gradients layer-by-layer versus through full backpropagation?

- Concept: Learning rate scheduling and adaptation
  - Why needed here: Layer-wise learning rates introduce additional complexity in hyperparameter tuning
  - Quick check question: How would you initialize and adapt layer-wise learning rates during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Forward pass module -> Error calculation module -> Parameter update module -> Layer-wise learning rate controller -> Loss function registry

- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass through all layers
  2. Error calculation at each layer
  3. Parameter updates for each layer
  4. Repeat until convergence

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Memory: Storing intermediate activations for error calculation vs. recomputation
  - Computational efficiency: Layer-wise updates vs. batch updates
  - Flexibility: Task-specific loss functions vs. standard cross-entropy

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence: Check layer-wise loss function definitions
  - Unstable training: Verify learning rate scaling is appropriate
  - Memory issues: Monitor activation storage requirements

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace standard backpropagation with layer-wise error calculation on MNIST using identical architecture and hyperparameters
  2. Test different layer-wise learning rate configurations (constant vs. adaptive) on CIFAR-10
  3. Compare convergence speed and final accuracy against baseline methods using identical training conditions

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed mathematical formulations for the layer-wise loss function and parameter update equations
- Experimental results show only modest improvements (1-2% accuracy gains) that could be within training variance
- The comparison with direct feedback alignment may not be directly relevant as it uses a fundamentally different approach

## Confidence
**Low Confidence** - The experimental results lack sufficient detail about implementation, hyperparameters, and statistical significance testing. The absence of mathematical formulations for the core algorithmic innovations prevents proper evaluation of the claimed mechanisms.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the layer-wise error calculation and parameter update mechanism with multiple layer-wise loss function formulations to test which configuration actually works
2. Conduct ablation studies removing layer-wise learning rates to isolate their contribution to performance gains
3. Perform statistical significance testing on the accuracy differences between methods using multiple training runs with different random seeds
