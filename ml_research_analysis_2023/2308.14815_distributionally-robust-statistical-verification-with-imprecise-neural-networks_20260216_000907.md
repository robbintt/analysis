# Distributionally Robust Statistical Verification with Imprecise Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14815
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Provides statistical guarantees for high-dimensional autonomous systems with learned components using distributionally robust formulation with INN ensemble and active learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of providing statistical guarantees for autonomous systems with learned components when facing distribution shift. Traditional conformal prediction methods require a fixed input distribution, which is difficult to guarantee in practice. The authors propose a distributionally robust approach that provides worst-case performance bounds over a family of distributions rather than a single fixed distribution. The key innovation combines Imprecise Neural Networks (INN) for uncertainty quantification with active learning guided by neural network verification to efficiently explore high-uncertainty regions.

## Method Summary
The method uses an Imprecise Neural Network ensemble that outputs upper and lower bounds on performance predictions. Uncertainty is defined as the width between these bounds. Active learning explores regions with maximum uncertainty using Sherlock verification tool to identify exploration points. The process iteratively samples high-uncertainty regions, evaluates ground truth performance, and retrains the INN. Performance bounds are computed by finding minima of the lower bound function over explored regions. The method provides guarantees that hold across a family of distributions constructed from the explored regions.

## Key Results
- Achieves coverage rates above 95% across 10 Mujoco control environments
- Maintains reliable performance guarantees in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings
- Provides scalable statistical verification for high-dimensional systems where Gaussian Processes fail to scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The INN provides principled uncertainty measures that guide active learning in high-dimensional spaces where Gaussian Processes fail to scale
- Core assumption: INN output interval width is a valid measure of epistemic uncertainty satisfying continuity, monotonicity, and probability consistency
- Evidence: Definition of network uncertainty as U(x) = Φ(x) − Φ(x), where Φ(x) and Φ(x) are upper and lower bounds
- Break condition: If INN constituent networks converge to similar predictions, uncertainty width becomes uninformative

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Distributionally robust formulation provides guarantees across a family of distributions rather than single fixed distribution
- Core assumption: α-contaminated class of distributions captures realistic deployment scenarios with distribution shift
- Evidence: Family defined as PX := {PX : PX = (1−δ) ˜P +αQ, where Q is any distribution on X }, for some α ∈ (0, 1)
- Break condition: If explored regions don't cover high-uncertainty areas, constructed family may not capture realistic scenarios

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Active learning with exhaustive neural network verification provides scalable statistical guarantees
- Core assumption: Iterative process of uncertainty-guided sampling followed by local exhaustive verification converges to meaningful guarantees
- Evidence: Active learning uses Sherlock to maximize uncertainty and sample new points, then computes local minima for bounds
- Break condition: If Sherlock verification cost becomes prohibitive, method loses scalability

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distributionally robust optimization and families of distributions
  - Why needed: Moving from single-distribution guarantees to family-wide guarantees that remain valid under distribution shift
  - Quick check: How does an α-contaminated class differ from a simple mixture of distributions?

- Concept: Imprecise probabilities and credal sets
  - Why needed: INN framework built on imprecise probability theory where sets of distributions replace single probabilities
  - Quick check: What properties must an uncertainty measure satisfy in imprecise probability framework?

- Concept: Active learning and query strategies in continuous spaces
  - Why needed: Active learning differs from standard settings with no fixed unlabeled dataset - must propose new query points in continuous space
  - Quick check: How does greedy uncertainty maximization differ from traditional query-by-committee?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Black-box simulator -> Performance oracle ψ -> INN ensemble {Φ(x), Φ(x)} -> Sherlock verification -> Active learning loop -> Distribution family constructor -> Performance bound calculator

- Critical path: 1) Initial random sampling from X0 to create training set T 2) Train INN on T using loss function (3) 3) Use Sherlock to find x* that maximizes U(x) 4) Sample δ-ball around x* and evaluate ψ 5) Add new data to T and retrain INN 6) Repeat for M iterations 7) Use Sherlock to find local minima of Φ(x) 8) Take minimum of all local minima and subtract λβ 9) Construct distribution family PX

- Design tradeoffs: INN vs. Bayesian neural networks (guaranteed bounds vs. probabilistic interpretation), active learning vs. uniform sampling (sample-efficient vs. simpler computation), Sherlock vs. sampling-based approaches (exhaustive guarantees vs. lower computational cost)

- Failure signatures: Coverage rates drop below 95%, Sherlock query count becomes prohibitive, constructed distribution family is too restrictive

- First 3 experiments: 1) Verify INN uncertainty width satisfies four properties on synthetic problem 2) Compare active learning against uniform sampling on low-dimensional problem 3) Test distribution family construction by evaluating coverage on out-of-distribution samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of scalability for the INN approach compared to Gaussian Processes in high-dimensional spaces?
- Basis: Paper states GPs have limited scalability and sample efficiency in higher dimensions (>10) compared to INNs
- Why unresolved: No concrete analysis or experiment comparing theoretical scalability limits
- Evidence needed: Experiment comparing performance of INNs and GPs across varying dimensional spaces and sample sizes

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of β affect the trade-off between coverage and interval width in the INN approach?
- Basis: Paper presents results with different β values but no theoretical analysis of trade-off
- Why unresolved: Relationship between β and balance between coverage rate and interval width not formally derived
- Evidence needed: Theoretical analysis or empirical study showing how varying β affects coverage and interval width

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the active learning strategy be optimized to reduce the number of expensive queries to the neural network verification tool?
- Basis: Paper mentions expensive queries to Sherlock in active learning and suggests exploring more efficient ways
- Why unresolved: No alternative strategies proposed or tested to minimize these queries
- Evidence needed: Comparison of different active learning strategies with varying query costs and their impact on performance guarantees

## Limitations
- Scalability depends critically on Sherlock's ability to efficiently handle high-dimensional verification problems
- Assumption that uniform distributions over explored regions capture realistic deployment scenarios may be overly conservative
- Construction of distribution family from explored regions may not capture complex multimodal distributions in practice

## Confidence
- High confidence: Theoretical framework connecting INN uncertainty to active learning and distributionally robust guarantees
- Medium confidence: Empirical evaluation across 10 Mujoco environments with strong coverage rates
- Low confidence: Scalability claims for very high-dimensional problems due to lack of experiments in such settings

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability test**: Evaluate method on synthetic high-dimensional control task (20+ state dimensions) to measure Sherlock verification cost as dimensionality increases
2. **Distribution family sensitivity**: Systematically vary number and size of explored regions to assess how constructed family affects tightness of performance bounds
3. **Real-world distribution shift**: Test method on physical robot control task where initial state distribution in deployment differs significantly from training distribution
