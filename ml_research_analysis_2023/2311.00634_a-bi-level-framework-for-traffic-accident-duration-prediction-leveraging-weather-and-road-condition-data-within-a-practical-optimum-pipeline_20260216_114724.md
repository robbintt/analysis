# A Bi-level Framework for Traffic Accident Duration Prediction: Leveraging Weather and Road Condition Data within a Practical Optimum Pipeline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.00634
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00634
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Bi-level framework combining Random Forest classification (83% accuracy) with LightGBM regression achieves MAE of 26.15 and 13.3 minutes for short and long-term accident predictions using only weather and road condition data.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a bi-level framework for predicting traffic accident duration using only weather and road condition data, without requiring accident severity or textual descriptions. The approach separates accidents into short-term and long-term impact categories using binary classification, then applies tailored regression models for precise duration prediction. Random Forest achieves 83% classification accuracy, while LightGBM regression yields MAE values of 26.15 and 13.3 minutes for short and long-term accidents respectively. The integrated pipeline produces RMSE and MAE values of 94.70 and 68.68 minutes, demonstrating practical applicability in accident management without requiring contextual accident data.

## Method Summary
The method employs a bi-level framework that first classifies accidents as short-term or long-term impact using Random Forest classification, then applies separate regression models (LightGBM, RFCNN, CatBoost, LSTM) for precise duration prediction. The framework uses static features including weather conditions (temperature, wind chill, humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed/direction, precipitation, weather condition), road conditions (POI features like amenity, bump, crossing, junction, traffic signal), and accident duration calculated from start and end times. The dataset covers Texas state traffic accidents from February 2016 to December 2021, with preprocessing including missing value handling, outlier removal, and 75/25 train-validation split.

## Key Results
- Random Forest classification achieves 83% accuracy in distinguishing short-term from long-term accident impact
- LightGBM regression yields MAE of 26.15 minutes for short-term and 13.3 minutes for long-term accident predictions
- End-to-end pipeline produces RMSE of 94.70 minutes and MAE of 68.68 minutes using only static features
- Wind chill and precipitation identified as most influential features through SHAP analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bi-level framework improves accuracy by separating accident duration prediction into classification and regression tasks.
- Mechanism: The first level classifies accidents as short-term or long-term using a Random Forest model, allowing tailored regression models to predict duration more precisely. This reduces noise and error propagation by focusing each model on a specific range of durations.
- Core assumption: Accident durations are bimodal in distribution and can be effectively separated at a threshold (164 minutes in this case).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A bi-level framework combines binary classification (short vs. long-term impact) with separate regression models for precise duration prediction."
  - [section]: "This allows us to tackle the problem from both a classification and regression standpoint."
- Break condition: If the duration distribution is not clearly bimodal or the threshold is poorly chosen, the classification step may introduce errors that harm overall accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Static features (weather and road conditions) are sufficient to predict accident duration without needing contextual data like severity or textual descriptions.
- Mechanism: The model uses readily available static variables such as wind chill, precipitation, wind speed, road features, and time-based features to capture environmental and situational factors that influence how long an accident affects traffic.
- Core assumption: The duration of an accident's impact is primarily determined by environmental and road conditions rather than the specific nature of the accident.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This study tackles the challenge of predicting traffic accident duration using only weather and road condition data, without relying on accident severity or textual descriptions."
  - [section]: "We explore the utilization of various machine learning (ML) methodologies with the objective of predicting the duration of traffic accidents...categorizing accidents into either short-term or long-term, based on the average accident duration."
- Break condition: If accident severity or type is a dominant factor in duration that is not captured by static features, predictions will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LightGBM regression outperforms other models for precise duration prediction in both short and long-term categories.
- Mechanism: LightGBM's gradient boosting approach efficiently captures non-linear relationships and interactions among features, leading to lower MAE and RMSE values compared to models like RFCNN, CatBoost, and LSTM.
- Core assumption: The dataset is large and tabular, making gradient boosting particularly effective at finding complex patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LightGBM regression yielded MAE values of 26.15 and 13.3 minutes for short and long-term accidents, respectively."
  - [section]: "LightGBM accurately predicted the duration of long-term and short-term accidents independently by utilising gradient enhancing techniques."
- Break condition: If the data contains very different patterns or if interpretability is required, other models might be preferred.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Binary classification for bimodal data
  - Why needed here: Accident durations naturally split into short and long categories, and treating them separately improves model accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What threshold was used to separate short-term from long-term accidents in this study?
- Concept: Feature importance and SHAP values
  - Why needed here: Understanding which static features (like wind chill and precipitation) most influence predictions helps validate the model and guide improvements.
  - Quick check question: Which two weather-related features were identified as most influential for accident duration?
- Concept: Regression error metrics (MAE, RMSE)
  - Why needed here: These metrics quantify prediction accuracy and allow comparison between models and against prior work.
  - Quick check question: What were the MAE values achieved by LightGBM for short and long-term predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw data -> preprocessing -> classification -> regression -> evaluation
- Critical path:
  Data ingestion and preprocessing (handling missing values, outlier removal) → Feature engineering (duration calculation, statistical analysis) → Binary classification (Random Forest) → Regression models (LightGBM, RFCNN, CatBoost, LSTM) → Pipeline integration (classification output feeds regression models) → Evaluation and interpretation (SHAP analysis, error metrics)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using only static features increases applicability but may reduce accuracy compared to models using contextual data.
  - Separate models for short/long durations increase complexity but improve precision.
  - LightGBM chosen for speed and accuracy; LSTM adds complexity but was not superior.
- Failure signatures:
  - High classification error → both regression models get wrong input type.
  - Poor regression performance → feature set insufficient or model choice suboptimal.
  - Overfitting → especially if training data is not representative of new regions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Random Forest classification accuracy with different duration thresholds.
  2. Compare regression model performances (LightGBM vs. CatBoost vs. RFCNN) on short-term data only.
  3. Run end-to-end pipeline on a subset of data and measure combined RMSE/MAE.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the predictive performance of the bi-level framework change when applied to datasets from regions with significantly different weather patterns than Texas?
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating accident severity and textual description data on the accuracy of the traffic accident duration prediction model?
- Question: How does the model's performance vary when applied to smaller geographic areas within Texas, such as individual cities or counties?

## Limitations

- Reliance on static features may limit accuracy compared to models using contextual accident data like severity or textual descriptions
- 164-minute threshold for classifying short vs. long-term accidents may not generalize to other geographic regions
- Study only tested framework on Texas data, limiting validation of cross-regional applicability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Bi-level framework concept and implementation using Random Forest classification and LightGBM regression
- Medium confidence: Static features alone are sufficient for practical deployment
- Low confidence: Generalizability of the 164-minute threshold across different geographic regions

## Next Checks

1. Test classification performance using different duration thresholds (120, 180, 240 minutes) to determine optimal separation for various geographic regions
2. Replicate study using additional contextual features (accident severity, textual descriptions) to quantify performance gap
3. Apply trained pipeline to accident data from a different state or country to assess model performance degradation and generalizability
