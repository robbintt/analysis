# Escaping the sentence-level paradigm in machine translation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2304.12959
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12959
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Demonstrates that standard Transformers with increased capacity can effectively handle document-level translation when trained on backtranslated data and evaluated with generative metrics.

## Executive Summary
Machine translation has remained in a decades-old sentence-level paradigm despite the clear need for document-level translation to handle discourse phenomena like anaphora, deixis, and cohesion. This paper identifies three key changes needed to move translation into a document-based paradigm: using standard Transformer models with sufficient capacity, training with document samples from backtranslated data, and introducing generative variants of contrastive metrics. The authors demonstrate that this combination improves performance on both sentence-level and document-level metrics across four language pairs (DE→EN, EN→EN→DE, EN→FR, and EN→RU), with the largest gains on discourse-rich test sets. They show that standard 6-layer Transformers are insufficient for document-level translation, and that document context is particularly beneficial for anaphora resolution.

## Method Summary
The method involves training standard Transformer architectures (12-layer encoder, 6-layer decoder, 1024 embedding dimension, 16k FFN size) on document-level samples created by concatenating adjacent sentences within document boundaries. Training data is assembled from backtranslated monolingual data with document metadata rather than parallel document data. The models are evaluated using both traditional contrastive test sets and newly proposed generative variants that directly test the model's ability to generate correct discourse-sensitive translations. The approach maintains the standard Transformer architecture but scales capacity and changes the training data composition and evaluation methodology.

## Key Results
- Standard 6-layer Transformers are insufficient for document-level translation; larger models show consistent improvements
- Document context is particularly beneficial for anaphora resolution, with the largest gains observed on discourse-rich test sets
- Backtranslated data with document metadata outperforms parallel document data for training document-level MT models
- Generative evaluation metrics reveal discrepancies in model performance that contrastive metrics miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Document-level translation can be achieved with standard Transformers if given sufficient capacity.
- Mechanism: Increasing encoder depth and FFN width enables better capture of long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena.
- Core assumption: Longer-range dependencies require more model capacity; standard Transformers are expressive enough if scaled appropriately.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states standard Transformer architecture is sufficient with enough capacity; section 6.4 shows performance rises with wider 18-layer model.
- Break condition: Scaling beyond tested ranges yields diminishing returns or discourse phenomena require fundamentally different architectures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Backtranslated monolingual data with document metadata is preferable to parallel document data for training.
- Mechanism: Backtranslated data avoids MT output artifacts present in parallel document data while providing clean document context.
- Core assumption: Parallel document data often contains machine-translated segments introducing noise; monolingual backtranslated data is cleaner and more available.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes backtranslated data is more readily available and of higher quality; section 6.1 compares DOC(P,Bd) vs DOC(Pd,Bd) showing former performs better.
- Break condition: High-quality parallel document data becomes widely available or backtranslated data introduces other artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generative variants of contrastive metrics better measure actual generation ability for discourse-sensitive translation.
- Mechanism: Generative metrics directly test whether models can produce correct pronouns/phrases in context rather than just scoring contrastive pairs.
- Core assumption: Discriminative contrastive metrics may overestimate ability by only testing discrimination, not generation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract proposes generative variants to better discriminate among document systems; section 6.1 shows clear discrepancies between contrastive and generative metrics.
- Break condition: Generative metrics prove too difficult to compute reliably or fail to capture all relevant discourse phenomena.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Discourse phenomena (anaphora, deixis, ellipsis, cohesion)
  - Why needed here: These document-level phenomena require context beyond single sentences to resolve and are the target of improvement.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between anaphora and deixis, and why does each require document context to resolve in translation?

- Concept: Backtranslation
  - Why needed here: Creates large amounts of monolingual data with document metadata used to train document-level MT models.
  - Quick check question: Why might backtranslated data be preferable to parallel document data for training document-level MT models?

- Concept: Contrastive vs. generative evaluation
  - Why needed here: Paper argues existing contrastive test sets are insufficient and proposes generative variants instead.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between contrastive and generative evaluation, and why might contrastive metrics overestimate model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Parallel data (CCMatrix, crawled web data) -> Monolingual data (crawled web with metadata) -> Backtranslated data -> Document samples -> Standard Transformer (12L encoder, 6L decoder, 1024 embedding, 16k FFN) -> Generative evaluation
- Critical path: 1) Assemble document samples from monolingual backtranslated data with metadata, 2) Train large-capacity Transformer on these samples, 3) Evaluate using generative variants of contrastive test sets
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models require more compute and data but may be necessary for long-range dependencies; backtranslated data avoids parallel document issues but may limit diversity
- Failure signatures: Insufficient model capacity shows contrastive improvements but not generative; noisy training data causes models to learn artifacts rather than resolve discourse phenomena
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train standard 6-layer Transformer on backtranslated document samples and evaluate on contrastive test sets for baseline
  2. Increase encoder depth to 12 layers and evaluate on both contrastive and generative test sets to measure capacity impact
  3. Train model on only parallel document data (if available) and compare performance to backtranslated data model on generative metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal architecture and model size for document-level machine translation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - paper shows improvements up to 18-layer Transformers but suggests even larger models might yield further improvements
- Why unresolved: Only experiments with limited range of model sizes; optimal configuration may depend on language pair, dataset size, and computational resources
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying architectures and sizes while controlling for other factors

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we automatically identify sentences that require document context for correct translation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - paper highlights challenge of evaluating document-level systems due to difficulty identifying context-requiring sentences
- Why unresolved: Automatically identifying such sentences is challenging; existing methods based on discourse connectives or anaphora resolution aren't always accurate
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating new identification methods and comparing to human judgments

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop scalable and trustworthy document-level evaluation metrics?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - paper demonstrates existing contrastive test sets are ineffective and proposes generative variants with limitations
- Why unresolved: Metrics need to be both accurate and scalable; existing metrics aren't designed for document-level phenomena
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating new document-level metrics and comparing to human judgments

## Limitations
- Architecture scaling boundaries remain unclear beyond tested configurations
- Approach heavily depends on quality of backtranslated data and availability of document metadata
- Generative evaluation requires significantly more computational resources than contrastive methods

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Standard Transformers with sufficient capacity can handle document-level translation (well-supported by controlled experiments)
- **Medium Confidence**: Backtranslated data is preferable to parallel document data (supported by comparisons but needs broader testing)
- **Medium Confidence**: Generative metrics better discriminate among document systems (supported by discrepancies but practical challenges not fully addressed)

## Next Checks

1. **Scaling Boundary Analysis**: Conduct experiments beyond 18-layer Transformers to identify point of diminishing returns and establish when architectural innovations become necessary versus scaling existing architectures.

2. **Cross-Dataset Robustness**: Replicate document-level training approach using multiple parallel document datasets with varying quality levels to assess robustness and identify failure modes.

3. **Resource-Constrained Evaluation**: Implement cost-benefit analysis comparing contrastive and generative evaluation approaches across different resource constraints to provide practical guidance for adoption decisions.
