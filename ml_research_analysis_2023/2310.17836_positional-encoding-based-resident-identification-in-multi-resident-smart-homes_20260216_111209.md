# Positional Encoding-based Resident Identification in Multi-resident Smart Homes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.17836
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17836
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Proposed framework achieves 94.5% and 87.9% accuracy in resident identification on two real-world datasets, significantly outperforming baseline models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for identifying residents in multi-occupant smart homes using positional encoding and LSTM models. The approach builds accessibility graphs from layout maps and uses Node2Vec to generate node embeddings that encode topological information. These embeddings are integrated with temporal sensor event sequences to train an LSTM model. Experimental results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over baseline methods, providing a promising solution for resident identification in smart home environments.

## Method Summary
The framework transforms layout maps into accessibility graphs, converts them to accessibility probability graphs, and applies Node2Vec to generate node embeddings. These embeddings encode connectivity and relative distances between points of interest. The embeddings are concatenated with time-transformed sensor event sequences and fed into a bidirectional LSTM model for resident identification. The method leverages both spatial topology and temporal patterns to distinguish between residents based on their movement behaviors within the home.

## Key Results
- Achieves 94.5% accuracy on one real-world dataset and 87.9% on another
- Outperforms baseline models without positional encoding
- Demonstrates effectiveness of combining spatial topology with temporal sensor data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Positional encoding via Node2Vec node embeddings improves multi-resident identification accuracy by integrating spatial topology into temporal event sequences. The method transforms layout maps into an accessibility graph, converts it to an accessibility probability graph, and applies Node2Vec to generate embeddings that encode connectivity and relative distances. These embeddings are concatenated with temporal sensor event sequences, allowing the LSTM model to learn both temporal and spatial dependencies.

### Mechanism 2
The accessibility probability graph (APG) better models resident movement than raw distance-weighted graphs by accounting for transition likelihoods. AG edges are weighted by distance; APG inverts this to probabilities (1/(distance+1)), then normalizes per node. This models the assumption that closer POIs are more likely to be visited next, reflecting realistic movement patterns where residents tend to move to nearby locations.

### Mechanism 3
Bidirectional LSTM captures both forward and backward temporal context, improving identification accuracy over unidirectional models. The LSTM processes the concatenated feature vector (time embedding + node embedding + sensor event) in both directions, allowing the model to use future events to better infer current resident identity. This bidirectional context provides richer information about movement patterns and temporal dependencies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph representation of physical space (POIs, edges, weights)**: Enables encoding spatial relationships into machine learning-friendly vectors. *Quick check*: What does each vertex and edge represent in the accessibility graph?
- **Node embeddings (graph neural network style representation)**: Transforms non-Euclidean graph data into fixed-length vectors that can be concatenated with temporal features. *Quick check*: How does Node2Vec differ from simply using raw coordinates?
- **Bidirectional LSTM sequence modeling**: Allows the model to use both past and future events for identifying the current resident. *Quick check*: What advantage does a bidirectional LSTM have over a standard LSTM for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Layout map + sensor coordinates -> Accessibility Graph (AG) -> Accessibility Probability Graph (APG) -> Node2Vec embeddings -> Time-transformed sensor events -> Concatenated features -> Bidirectional LSTM -> Predicted resident identity

- **Critical path**: 1) Parse layout → build AG → convert to APG → train Node2Vec → generate embeddings 2) Parse sensor events → time transform → concatenate embeddings → train/validate LSTM

- **Design tradeoffs**: Graph construction vs. sensor density (sparse coverage loses topological nuance), Node2Vec hyperparams (dim, walk length, window) vs. embedding quality and training cost, Bidirectional LSTM vs. memory/compute vs. accuracy gain

- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy close to baseline without positional encoding (embeddings not capturing useful topology), extremely low training loss but poor validation (overfitting to temporal patterns, embeddings adding noise), Node2Vec training crashes (malformed graph or zero-degree nodes)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run baseline (no positional encoding) vs. coordinate-based encoding to confirm spatial signal is beneficial 2) Vary Node2Vec dimension size (16, 64, 256) to find optimal balance of information vs. noise 3) Compare unidirectional vs. bidirectional LSTM to quantify context gain from backward pass

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How does the proposed positional encoding framework perform in environments with more than three residents, and what is the upper limit of scalability before accuracy degrades significantly? The paper evaluates on datasets with two and three residents but does not explore performance with larger numbers.

2. How sensitive is resident identification accuracy to sensor failure rates and detection intervals, particularly when multiple sensors fail simultaneously in critical areas? While the paper acknowledges detection intervals as a limitation, it does not quantify the impact of sensor failures on overall system accuracy.

3. Can the framework be extended to identify guests or temporary occupants without requiring extensive retraining? The paper explicitly states it does not consider guests and that there is "no good solution for a current supervised approach" to handle temporary occupants.

## Limitations

- Relies heavily on accurate floor plans and assumes sensors are co-located with points of interest
- Node2Vec parameters (dimension size, walk length, window size) are not fully specified
- Assumes uniform movement speed across residents, which may not hold in practice
- Requires sufficient sensor density to capture meaningful topological information

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The overall framework design (graph construction + node embeddings + LSTM) is sound and aligns with established practices in graph representation learning and sequence modeling. The accuracy improvements over baselines are well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of Node2Vec and LSTM architecture, as well as assumptions about uniform movement speed and POI co-location, introduce uncertainty in replication. The claim that APG better models movement than raw distance-weighted graphs lacks direct validation.

**Low confidence**: The claim that bidirectional LSTM significantly outperforms unidirectional models is weakly supported, as related works do not explicitly validate this advantage for resident identification.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce baseline vs. positional encoding comparison: Run the baseline model (no positional encoding) against coordinate-based encoding to confirm that spatial information provides a measurable benefit.

2. Sensitivity analysis on Node2Vec parameters: Vary Node2Vec dimension size (e.g., 16, 64, 256) and random walk parameters to determine optimal settings and assess robustness.

3. Validate APG vs. AG assumptions: Conduct experiments comparing the accessibility probability graph (APG) against the raw distance-weighted accessibility graph (AG) to test whether the transition probability model improves accuracy in practice.
