# LanSER: Language-Model Supported Speech Emotion Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.03978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03978
- Reference count: 0
- Pre-training SER models with LLM-inferred weak emotion labels outperforms supervised learning from scratch

## Executive Summary
LanSER introduces a novel approach to speech emotion recognition (SER) that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate weak emotion labels for unlabeled speech data. The method uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe speech, then applies LLM textual entailment to infer emotion labels from the text. These weak labels enable pre-training SER models on large-scale datasets before fine-tuning on labeled SER benchmarks. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard SER datasets (IEMOCAP and CREMA-D) compared to supervised learning from scratch and language-only baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision for emotion recognition.

## Method Summary
LanSER uses ASR to transcribe speech data, then applies an LLM with textual entailment to generate weak emotion labels. The LLM calculates entailment scores between transcripts and emotion label prompts, selecting the highest scoring label from a predefined taxonomy. SER models are pre-trained on weakly-labeled datasets (People's Speech with 30K hours, Condensed Movies with 1,000 hours) using cross-entropy loss. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on labeled SER datasets (IEMOCAP and CREMA-D) with varying percentages of labeled data. The method uses ResNet-50 as the backbone architecture and demonstrates improved performance over supervised learning from scratch and language-only baselines.

## Key Results
- Pre-training with LLM-derived weak labels improves SER performance compared to supervised learning from scratch
- LanSER outperforms both supervised and language-only baselines on IEMOCAP and CREMA-D benchmarks
- The method shows better label efficiency, maintaining performance with reduced fine-tuning data
- Despite using text-only labels, the approach learns prosodic representations relevant to emotion perception

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Weak labels from LLM textual entailment capture emotion-relevant lexical content that correlates with speech prosody. The LLM infers emotion from transcribed text using textual entailment, selecting labels with highest entailment score between transcript and prompt. These weak labels provide supervisory signal during pre-training. Core assumption: Speech content and prosody are sufficiently correlated that emotion labels derived from text can guide SER model learning of prosodic features. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Despite being pre-trained on labels derived only from text, we show that the resulting representations appear to model the prosodic content of speech." [section 4.3] "Interestingly, LanSER's results on CREMA-D suggest that the model can learn prosodic representations via weak supervision from LLMs."

### Mechanism 2
Pre-training on large unlabeled datasets with weak labels improves fine-tuning performance compared to supervised learning from scratch. SER model pre-trained on large datasets (People's Speech, Condensed Movies) using weak labels transfers knowledge to downstream tasks (IEMOCAP, CREMA-D) when fine-tuned with limited labeled data. Core assumption: Pre-training on large-scale data with weak labels provides better initialization than random initialization for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our experimental results show that models pre-trained on large datasets with this weak supervision outperform other baseline models on standard SER datasets when fine-tuned." [section 4.3] "Overall, LanSER outperforms the NLP and majority class baselines. Notably, LanSER pre-trained with the Condensed Movies showed improved accuracy than with the People's Speech."

### Mechanism 3
Textual entailment approach for weak label generation is more effective than text generation or mask filling approaches. Textual entailment calculates entailment scores between transcript and emotion label prompts, selecting highest scoring label as weak label. This constrains LLM output to predefined taxonomy. Core assumption: Textual entailment approach produces more emotion-relevant labels than other LLM approaches when constrained to specific taxonomy. Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] "We use textual entailment to generate weak labels that also allows us to constrain the emotion taxonomy apriori." [section 4.2] "Among the prompts we explored, 'The emotion of the conversation is {}.' had the highest accuracy."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Textual entailment
  - Why needed here: Used to infer weak emotion labels by calculating entailment scores between speech transcripts and emotion label prompts
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between textual entailment and text generation for weak label generation?

- Concept: Weak supervision
  - Why needed here: Enables pre-training on large unlabeled datasets by using LLM-inferred labels instead of human annotations
  - Quick check question: How does weak supervision differ from semi-supervised learning?

- Concept: Emotion taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Provides constrained set of emotion categories for LLM to select from when inferring weak labels
  - Quick check question: Why might a finer-grained emotion taxonomy improve representation learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ASR (Whisper) → LLM (RoBERTa) → Textual Entailment → Weak Labels → SER Model (ResNet-50) → Fine-tuning
- Critical path: ASR transcription → LLM entailment scoring → weak label selection → SER model pre-training → fine-tuning on downstream task
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using text-only labels vs. audio features for pre-training
  - Choosing between different LLM approaches (entailment vs. generation vs. mask filling)
  - Selecting emotion taxonomy granularity
- Failure signatures:
  - ASR errors propagating to weak labels
  - LLM inferring irrelevant or non-emotional labels
  - Pre-training on dataset too different from downstream tasks
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ASR transcription accuracy on pre-training datasets
  2. Compare different LLM approaches for weak label generation
  3. Evaluate impact of different emotion taxonomies on pre-training performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective is LanSER at zero-shot emotion recognition across diverse domains and languages? The paper demonstrates zero-shot performance on IEMOCAP and CREMA-D but acknowledges it's not as good as fine-tuning. Experiments are limited to two English datasets with specific emotion taxonomies. Testing on multilingual datasets, domain transfer tasks, and with open-set emotion taxonomies would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can prompt engineering be optimized to improve weak label quality and reduce noise in LanSER? The paper explores various prompts but uses only one prompt throughout experiments, noting that additional prompt tuning is future work. The study used a single prompt chosen based on preliminary experiments rather than systematic optimization. A comprehensive study comparing different prompts and their impact on downstream SER performance would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of backbone architecture (e.g., ResNet vs. Conformer) affect LanSER's ability to capture prosodic features? The paper acknowledges that higher capacity models like Conformers might better capture the complex relationship between speech and emotion but uses ResNet-50 throughout. The experiments were limited to ResNet-50 architecture. Direct comparison of LanSER performance using different backbone architectures would resolve this.

## Limitations

- ASR-LLM pipeline reliability is critical and depends on transcription accuracy and LLM's ability to infer emotion from text
- Cross-dataset generalization may be limited as pre-training datasets differ substantially from evaluation datasets in domain and recording quality
- The constrained BRAVE-43 taxonomy may not capture sufficient emotional nuance for all downstream tasks

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core claim that pre-training with LLM-derived weak labels improves SER performance compared to supervised learning from scratch
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that representations learned from text-only weak labels capture prosodic information
- **Low confidence**: The claim that textual entailment approach is superior to other LLM methods for weak label generation

## Next Checks

1. Ablation study on ASR quality: Evaluate SER performance using ground-truth transcripts versus ASR transcriptions for the same utterances to quantify the impact of transcription errors on weak label quality and downstream performance.

2. Representation analysis: Use techniques like t-SNE or PCA to visualize SER model representations before and after pre-training, comparing how well text-derived representations separate different emotion categories and correlate with acoustic features.

3. Taxonomy sensitivity analysis: Pre-train and evaluate SER models using different emotion taxonomies (e.g., original 42-category BRAVE, 7 basic emotions only, dimensional emotion models) to determine the optimal granularity for weak label generation.
