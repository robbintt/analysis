# Statistical properties and privacy guarantees of an original distance-based fully synthetic data generation method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06571
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Novel synthetic data generation framework using CART and distance-based filtering achieves strong privacy guarantees (GTCAP < 0.2, low pMSE 0.123-0.124) while maintaining data utility for public release

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating fully synthetic datasets that balance privacy protection with data utility for Open Science initiatives. The method combines CART-based synthesis, distance-based filtering to remove closely resembling records, and formal noise addition to protect against membership disclosure attacks. Applied to a rich epidemiological dataset, the framework demonstrates excellent privacy guarantees while successfully replicating key statistical properties of the original data. The results suggest that publicly releasable synthetic data with high utility and strong privacy protection is technically feasible.

## Method Summary
The method consists of four steps: (1) manual statistical disclosure control to identify and remove identifiers, (2) CART-based synthesis using the synthpop R package with specified minimum leaf and split sizes, (3) distance-based filtering using Mahalanobis distance to remove synthetic records too similar to original records, and (4) noise addition to quantitative variables to achieve Elemental Correct Attribution Probability (ECAP) below 0.2 for membership disclosure attack protection. The approach was evaluated on a Mental Health In Prison study dataset with 799 observations and 26 variables.

## Key Results
- Mean GTCAP values below 0.2 indicate strong protection against attribute disclosure attacks
- Low propensity score MSE (0.123-0.124) demonstrates successful preservation of data utility
- Successful replication of original data prevalence rates for key variables
- Anonymeter simulations show strong resistance to singling out, linkability, and inference attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The distance-based filtering step removes synthetic rows that are too close to original rows, preventing identification disclosure.
- Mechanism: For each synthetic unit, the algorithm computes the Mahalanobis distance to all original units, finds the nearest original neighbor, and removes the synthetic unit if it is closer than that neighbor's nearest original neighbor.
- Core assumption: A synthetic unit that is closer to an original unit than any two original units are to each other would allow an attacker to identify that original unit with high confidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "distance-based filtering to remove closely resembling records"
  - [section] "we developed an algorithm capable of filtering out these rows based on their distance with other statistical units of the original and synthetic data"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of this specific mechanism in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the distance metric fails to capture true similarity (e.g., with categorical variables or missing data), filtering may not remove identifiable synthetic rows.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The noise addition framework provides formal protection against membership disclosure attacks (MDA) by ensuring that the probability of correctly attributing a value to a specific individual is below a threshold.
- Mechanism: Additive uncorrelated noise is added to quantitative variables such that the Elemental Correct Attribution Probability (ECAP) for each original value is minimized, making it difficult for an attacker to prove membership.
- Core assumption: An attacker can only confidently claim membership if they can show that the probability of a specific value being in the dataset is significantly higher than for other plausible values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "noise addition to protect against membership disclosure attacks"
  - [section] "we chose to develop our own formal model to ensure enough protection against MDA" and "Our approach is based on the addition of uncorrelated noise"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of ECAP or this noise framework in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the attacker has additional information beyond the public dataset and noise parameters, or if the noise variance is too low to achieve desired ECAP.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The GTCAP metric provides a unified way to assess attribute disclosure risk across both numerical and categorical variables.
- Mechanism: For each statistical unique, GTCAP compares the conditional probability of a target variable given key variables in the synthetic data to that in the original data and to the univariate distribution, using specified radii for numerical variables to define equality.
- Core assumption: Attribute disclosure risk is best measured by how much an attacker can improve their prediction of a target variable given key variables, compared to no knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "low propensity score MSE (0.123-0.124)" and "mean GTCAP values below 0.2"
  - [section] "we chose to design a new metric following the same core idea, but suited both to numerical and categorical variables, which we call the Generalized Targeted Correct Attribution Probability (GTCAP)"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of GTCAP in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the choice of radii for numerical variables is inappropriate, or if the set of key and target variables does not capture the true disclosure risk.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
  - Why needed here: The synthesis framework relies on CART to model conditional distributions of variables and generate synthetic data by sampling from leaves.
  - Quick check question: How does the minimum leaf size parameter in CART affect the trade-off between data utility and disclosure risk in synthetic data generation?

- Concept: Differential Privacy
  - Why needed here: Understanding differential privacy provides context for why fully synthetic data can offer stronger privacy guarantees than traditional anonymization methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between syntactic privacy models (like k-anonymity) and semantic privacy models (like differential privacy) in terms of their guarantees against attackers with background knowledge?

- Concept: Mahalanobis Distance
  - Why needed here: The distance-based filtering uses Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity between synthetic and original units while accounting for correlations between variables.
  - Quick check question: Why is Mahalanobis distance preferred over Euclidean distance when filtering synthetic data for privacy protection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Original microdata (after manual SDC) -> CART-based synthesis -> Distance-based filtering -> Noise addition -> Fully synthetic dataset
- Critical path: The synthesis step must complete successfully before filtering and noise addition can be applied. The filtering step must complete before noise addition to ensure noise is only added to retained synthetic units.
- Design tradeoffs: Larger minimum leaf sizes in CART increase privacy but reduce utility. Stricter distance thresholds in filtering increase privacy but may require more iterations to reach desired dataset size. Higher noise variances increase privacy against MDA but reduce utility.
- Failure signatures: If the covariance matrix becomes near-singular during filtering, it indicates high correlation among variables and may require removing some variables. If ECAP values remain high after noise addition, it indicates insufficient noise or inappropriate noise distribution choice.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the synthesis step with different minimum leaf sizes (e.g., 10, 33, 100) and compare utility metrics to understand the privacy-utility tradeoff.
  2. Test the distance-based filtering with different distance metrics (Mahalanobis, Euclidean, Jaccard) on a small dataset to see the impact on filtered dataset size and privacy metrics.
  3. Apply the noise addition framework to a single quantitative variable with known population distribution and verify that ECAP values are below 0.2 for all original values.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the distance-based filtering algorithm at preventing attribute disclosure attacks when applied to datasets with a higher proportion of nominal/categorical variables compared to the original study dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tested the filtering algorithm using Mahalanobis distance on mostly quantitative, binary, and ordinal variables, excluding nominal variables like job. It acknowledges that alternative distance measures like Jaccard index may be more suitable for datasets with predominantly binary variables.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence of the filtering algorithm's effectiveness with different variable types or higher proportions of nominal variables. The choice of distance measure is left to the discretion of the user.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing of the filtering algorithm on synthetic datasets with varying proportions of nominal/categorical variables, using appropriate distance measures for each variable type.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of synthetic datasets to release for each original dataset to balance privacy protection and data utility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the debate between releasing one synthetic dataset versus multiple datasets, referencing Rubin's original proposal for multiple imputation and the US Census Bureau's policy of releasing one synthetic dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence to determine the optimal number of synthetic datasets to release. It only presents arguments for releasing one dataset based on their specific use case.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the privacy and utility trade-offs of releasing one versus multiple synthetic datasets for various datasets and use cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the Elemental Correct Attribution Probability (ECAP) metric to violations of its underlying assumptions, such as non-normal distributions or small sample sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces ECAP as a formal protection framework against membership disclosure attacks and discusses its robustness to changes in population size and variance for normal distributions. However, it acknowledges that further research is needed to study its validity conditions, including non-standard distributions and small samples.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence of ECAP's performance under violated assumptions or its comparison to other membership disclosure metrics like F1 score.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing of ECAP on synthetic datasets with non-normal distributions, small sample sizes, and comparisons to other membership disclosure metrics.

## Limitations

The evaluation relies on synthetic data generation from a single epidemiological dataset (799 observations, 26 variables), limiting generalizability to other data types and sizes. The distance-based filtering algorithm and ECAP calculation lack open-source implementation details, preventing independent verification of the claimed privacy guarantees. While GTCAP values below 0.2 suggest strong protection, the effectiveness of this metric against sophisticated attribute disclosure attacks remains untested.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The synthesis framework using CART (via synthpop R package) is well-established and the privacy-utility tradeoff analysis (pMSE values 0.123-0.124) is methodologically sound. The Purdam-Elliot methodology for assessing synthetic data quality is standard practice.

**Medium confidence**: The distance-based filtering mechanism's effectiveness depends on appropriate choice of variables to exclude from distance calculations and the assumption that Mahalanobis distance adequately captures similarity. The ECAP framework for noise addition is formally specified but lacks empirical validation across diverse datasets.

**Low confidence**: The novel GTCAP metric's superiority over existing disclosure risk measures has not been independently verified. The Anonymeter attack simulations, while promising, represent idealized attacker models that may underestimate real-world disclosure risks.

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate the synthesis and filtering pipeline** using the described synthpop parameters (min leaf size 33, min split size 100) on a different categorical-rich dataset to verify the privacy-utility tradeoffs generalize beyond the MHIP data.

2. **Implement and test the distance-based filtering algorithm** with multiple distance metrics (Mahalanobis, Euclidean, Jaccard) on synthetic data with known vulnerabilities to assess whether the filtering step reliably removes identifiable synthetic records.

3. **Conduct membership disclosure attack simulations** where an attacker has partial background knowledge (e.g., demographic statistics from census data) to evaluate whether the ECAP-based noise addition framework maintains protection when attackers possess auxiliary information beyond the synthetic dataset itself.
