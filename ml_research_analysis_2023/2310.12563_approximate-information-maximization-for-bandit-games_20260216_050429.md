# Approximate information maximization for bandit games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12563
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12563
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces AIM, a new class of asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms based on entropy maximization, proven optimal for 2-armed Gaussian bandits

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Approximate Information Maximization (AIM), a novel class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. The core idea is to leverage an approximate information maximization of the whole bandit system by maximizing the entropy of the posterior of the arms' maximal mean. This approach yields strong performances in classical bandit settings and is proven to be asymptotically optimal for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards.

## Method Summary
AIM is built on the principle of maximizing an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. The algorithm leverages an approximate information maximization by maximizing the entropy of the posterior of the arms' maximal mean. This is achieved by developing an approximated analytical physics-based representation of this entropy to forecast the information gain of each action, and greedily choosing the one with the largest information gain. The method is demonstrated through numerical experiments for Bernoulli rewards with two or several arms.

## Key Results
- AIM is proven to be asymptotically optimal for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards
- The algorithm shows strong empirical performances in classical bandit settings, including Bernoulli rewards with two or several arms
- AIM can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, such as linear bandits or many-armed bandits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by minimizing entropy of the posterior distribution of the best arm's mean.
- Mechanism: By approximating the entropy of the posterior distribution of the maximum mean reward, the algorithm greedily chooses the arm that reduces this entropy the most. This approach inherently balances exploration (pulling suboptimal arms to gain information) and exploitation (pulling the best arm to maximize reward).
- Core assumption: The entropy of the posterior distribution of the best arm's mean is a valid proxy for the information gain of the system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system."
  - [section 3.1] "The entropy encompasses a measure of the information carried by all arms in a single functional, characterising a global state description of the game."
- Break condition: If the approximation of the entropy becomes too inaccurate, the balance between exploration and exploitation may be disrupted.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards.
- Mechanism: The algorithm's decision procedure is based on an analytically tractable gradient of the entropy functional, which ensures that the optimal arm is pulled a polynomial number of times with high probability. In the asymptotic regime, the algorithm's behavior aligns with the Lai and Robbins lower bound.
- Core assumption: The optimal arm will be pulled a significant number of times with high probability, and the asymptotic regime behaves as predicted by the entropy approximation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Theorem 1 below states that AIM is asymptotically optimal on the two-armed bandits problem with Gaussian rewards."
  - [section 3.5] "We denote by Nk(t) and ˆµk(t) the number of times the arm k has been pulled and its empirical mean at time t, respectively."
- Break condition: If the algorithm fails to pull the optimal arm a significant number of times, or if the asymptotic regime does not behave as predicted, the algorithm may not achieve asymptotic optimality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The algorithm can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, such as linear bandits or many-armed bandits.
- Mechanism: The functional form of the entropy allows for a straightforward extension to more than two arms, and the approximation scheme can be generalized to various reward distributions belonging to the exponential family.
- Core assumption: The entropy approximation remains valid and tractable for more complex bandit settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings."
  - [section 6] "We have applied our approach (above) to Bernoulli bandits with many arms, where it shows strong empirical performances."
- Break condition: If the entropy approximation becomes too complex or inaccurate for more complex bandit settings, the algorithm may not perform well.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence
  - Why needed here: Entropy is used to measure the information content of the posterior distribution of the best arm's mean, and Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to compare reward distributions.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between entropy and information gain in the context of bandit problems?

- Concept: Bayesian inference and posterior distributions
  - Why needed here: The algorithm relies on Bayesian inference to update the posterior distribution of the arm means based on observed rewards.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of prior distribution affect the posterior distribution and the algorithm's performance?

- Concept: Laplace's method for asymptotic approximations
  - Why needed here: Laplace's method is used to derive asymptotic expressions for the entropy approximation, which simplifies the decision procedure.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions is Laplace's method a valid approximation for integrals involving posterior distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Entropy approximation -> Decision procedure -> Posterior update
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize the posterior distribution of the arm means.
  2. At each time step, compute the entropy approximation.
  3. Use the entropy approximation to choose the next arm to pull.
  4. Observe the reward and update the posterior distribution.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. tractability: The entropy approximation trades off accuracy for tractability, allowing for an analytically tractable decision procedure.
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by minimizing the entropy of the posterior distribution.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance: If the algorithm consistently underperforms compared to baseline algorithms, it may indicate that the entropy approximation is not accurate enough.
  - Entrapment: If the algorithm gets stuck pulling the same suboptimal arm repeatedly, it may indicate that the entropy approximation is not capturing the true information content of the system.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the algorithm's performance to baseline algorithms (e.g., UCB, Thompson sampling) on a simple two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards.
  2. Investigate the impact of the prior distribution on the algorithm's performance by varying the prior parameters.
  3. Extend the algorithm to a multi-armed bandit problem with Bernoulli rewards and compare its performance to baseline algorithms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the AIM algorithm's asymptotic optimality extend to bandit problems with more than two arms, and if so, under what conditions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses extending AIM to more than two arms but does not provide a formal proof of asymptotic optimality for this case.
- Why unresolved: The paper only proves asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Extending this proof to more than two arms requires a different approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof of asymptotic optimality for AIM in bandit problems with more than two arms, under specific conditions such as reward distributions and prior assumptions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of prior distribution affect the performance of AIM in different bandit settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the use of improper uniform priors and discusses the potential for extending AIM to non-uniform priors.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different prior distributions on AIM's performance, leaving open the question of how sensitive the algorithm is to prior choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments comparing AIM's performance with different prior distributions in various bandit settings, such as Bernoulli rewards or linear bandits.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can AIM be adapted to handle bandit problems with heavy-tailed or non-parametric reward distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper briefly mentions the potential for extending AIM to heavy-tailed or non-parametric reward distributions but does not provide a detailed analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the challenges or solutions for adapting AIM to these more complex reward distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis or numerical experiments demonstrating AIM's performance in bandit problems with heavy-tailed or non-parametric reward distributions, along with insights into the necessary modifications to the algorithm.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are only proven for the 2-armed Gaussian case - asymptotic optimality for more complex settings remains unproven
- The entropy approximation relies on Laplace's method, which may break down for certain parameter regimes or reward distributions
- Numerical experiments are limited to relatively simple scenarios (2-armed and 50-armed Bernoulli bandits with close arm means)

## Confidence
- Asymptotic optimality for 2-armed Gaussian bandits: **High** (proven with clear mathematical derivation)
- Strong empirical performance: **Medium** (demonstrated but limited to specific scenarios)
- Applicability to complex bandit settings: **Low** (claimed but not rigorously validated)

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on multi-armed bandits with larger reward gaps (Δμ > 0.01) to verify robustness beyond the "close arms" regime
2. Evaluate performance in contextual bandit settings where the physical analogy may break down
3. Implement a finite-time regret bound analysis to complement the asymptotic optimality proof and understand short-term behavior
