# Solutions to Elliptic and Parabolic Problems via Finite Difference Based Unsupervised Small Linear Convolutional Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.00259
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00259
- Reference count: 34
- This paper proposes an unsupervised CNN approach for solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs using finite difference methods

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs using unsupervised small linear convolutional neural networks. The key innovation is to estimate finite difference solutions directly through a CNN that minimizes a finite difference-based loss function, without requiring training data. The method leverages the PocketNet paradigm to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Tested on various elliptic and parabolic problems including those with non-constant diffusion coefficients and discontinuities, the approach achieves accuracy comparable to traditional finite difference methods for smooth problems and visually indistinguishable results for non-smooth problems.

## Method Summary
The method reformulates the finite difference discretization of PDEs as a convex optimization problem where a small linear CNN learns to map source terms (for elliptic problems) or previous solutions (for parabolic problems) to approximate finite difference solutions. The CNN uses identity activation functions and a PocketNet architecture with 32 constant feature maps per resolution. Training minimizes a finite difference-based loss function that incorporates boundary conditions. For elliptic problems, the CNN takes the source term as input and outputs an approximation to the finite difference solution; for parabolic problems, it takes the previous solution as input and outputs the solution at the next time step.

## Key Results
- Unsupervised CNN predictions achieve comparable accuracy to true finite difference solutions for smooth problems
- Visual solutions for non-smooth problems are indistinguishable from finite difference solutions
- Smaller neural networks (PocketNet approach) can achieve high accuracy for scientific machine learning tasks
- Identity activation functions are sufficient due to the linear nature of finite difference discretizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CNN learns to invert the finite difference matrix without explicitly constructing it
- Mechanism: By minimizing the finite difference-based loss, the CNN learns a mapping from the source term f to the finite difference solution uh that satisfies Ahuh = f
- Core assumption: The finite difference matrix A is invertible and the mapping from f to uh is well-defined
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our approach does not require training data and estimates the solution to a given PDE directly via the optimization process"
  - [section 2.1] Reformulates the finite difference approximation as a convex optimization problem arg min uh ||K∆ ⋆ uh - f||²
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers, but similar concepts exist in physics-informed neural networks
- Break condition: If the finite difference matrix is singular or ill-conditioned, the CNN may fail to learn the inverse mapping

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The PocketNet approach reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy
- Mechanism: By keeping the number of feature maps constant across all resolutions, PocketNet uses fewer parameters than conventional U-Net architectures while still capturing the necessary features
- Core assumption: The constant number of feature maps is sufficient to represent the solution across all resolutions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "we use the PocketNet approach proposed in [7] and leave the number of feature maps (channels) at each resolution within our architecture constant, namely 32"
  - [section 4] "These results indicate that smaller neural networks (in terms of parameters) can achieve high accuracy for scientific machine learning tasks"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers, but the PocketNet concept is novel to this paper
- Break condition: If the constant number of feature maps is insufficient to capture the solution features, accuracy will degrade

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Identity activation functions are sufficient because the relationship between f and uh is linear
- Mechanism: Since the finite difference discretization results in a linear system Ahuh = f, the CNN only needs to learn a linear mapping, which can be achieved with identity activation functions
- Core assumption: The finite difference discretization of the PDE results in a linear system
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "The justification for the lack of non-linear activation functions in our network is that the relationship between the source term f and the finite differences solution uh is given by a system of linear equations"
  - [section 4] "In this sense, we are learning the inverse mapping of the finite difference matrix"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers, but this is a novel insight from this paper
- Break condition: If the finite difference discretization introduces non-linearities, identity activation functions may be insufficient

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Finite difference discretization of PDEs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the PDE is discretized into a linear system is crucial for designing the loss function and interpreting the CNN's learned mapping
  - Quick check question: What is the finite difference stencil for the Laplacian operator in 2D?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and their architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding how CNNs work, particularly the U-Net architecture and the PocketNet approach, is essential for implementing and modifying the proposed method
  - Quick check question: How does the U-Net architecture handle multi-scale feature extraction?

- Concept: Optimization and loss functions in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the CNN is trained by minimizing the finite difference-based loss function is crucial for implementing the proposed method and interpreting the results
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the weighting parameter α in the loss function, and how does it affect the training process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Source term f (or previous solution un-1 for parabolic problems) -> CNN: Small linear U-Net with PocketNet approach and identity activation functions -> Output: Approximate finite difference solution uh (or un for parabolic problems) -> Loss function: Finite difference-based loss incorporating boundary conditions

- Critical path:
  1. Discretize the PDE using finite differences
  2. Design the CNN architecture and loss function
  3. Train the CNN to minimize the loss function
  4. Use the trained CNN to estimate the finite difference solution for new source terms

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Smaller CNN (PocketNet) vs. larger CNN: Fewer parameters but potentially lower accuracy
  - Identity activation vs. non-linear activations: Simpler model but may be insufficient for complex problems
  - Number of optimization steps: More steps may lead to better accuracy but longer training time

- Failure signatures:
  - High loss values during training: CNN is not learning the inverse mapping effectively
  - Low accuracy compared to finite difference method: CNN is not capturing the solution features adequately
  - Slow convergence: CNN may be stuck in a local minimum or the optimization process is inefficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the CNN on a simple elliptic problem with a known exact solution (e.g., the bubble function) and compare the accuracy to the finite difference method
  2. Vary the depth of the U-Net architecture and observe its effect on accuracy and training time
  3. Replace the identity activation functions with ReLU or Tanh and compare the results to the original method

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the accuracy of the unsupervised CNN approach compare to other unsupervised PDE solving methods that do not rely on training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the accuracy of their unsupervised CNN approach to the finite difference method, but does not compare to other unsupervised methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison to other unsupervised methods for solving PDEs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy of the unsupervised CNN approach to other unsupervised methods for solving PDEs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different optimizers (e.g., second-order optimizers) on the convergence and accuracy of the unsupervised CNN approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the Adam optimizer may get stuck in a neighborhood around the global minimum due to its limitations, and suggests that using second-order optimizers may allow for faster convergence to more accurate solutions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide numerical experiments using different optimizers to assess their impact on convergence and accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments comparing the convergence and accuracy of the unsupervised CNN approach using different optimizers.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the accuracy of the unsupervised CNN approach scale with the size of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, number of parameters)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the depth of the U-Net architecture does not generally have a significant effect on the accuracy of the predictions, but does not explore the impact of the number of parameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study of how the accuracy scales with the size of the neural network.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments varying the size of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, number of parameters) and measuring the resulting accuracy.

## Limitations
- The method's performance on higher-dimensional problems (>2D) is not demonstrated, limiting generalizability
- While accuracy is comparable for smooth problems, convergence rates relative to traditional methods are not quantified
- The optimal number of feature maps (32) is chosen empirically without theoretical justification

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism of learning the inverse mapping of the finite difference matrix through finite-difference-based loss functions
- Medium confidence: The PocketNet approach with constant feature maps providing sufficient representational power across resolutions
- Medium confidence: Identity activation functions being sufficient due to the linear nature of finite difference discretizations

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on a 3D elliptic problem to verify scalability to higher dimensions
2. Conduct systematic hyperparameter studies varying the number of feature maps (not just fixed at 32) to determine the minimum sufficient network size
3. Implement convergence rate analysis comparing the CNN-based approach against traditional finite difference methods across different grid resolutions
