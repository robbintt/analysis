# ChatGPT is Good but Bing Chat is Better for Vietnamese Students

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08272
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Bing Chat outperforms ChatGPT in most subjects on the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination dataset, except literature.

## Executive Summary
This study compares ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and Bing Chat (GPT-4) performance on the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination across nine subjects. The results demonstrate that Bing Chat consistently outperforms ChatGPT in most subjects, with the exception of literature essays. Bing Chat's advantages stem from its more advanced GPT-4 architecture, integration with Bing search for accessing online information, and official availability in Vietnam. These findings suggest Bing Chat offers a more comprehensive solution for Vietnamese students' educational needs.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated both language models using a Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination dataset containing 30 literature essay questions and 1,700 multiple-choice questions across nine subjects (mathematics, literature, English, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and civic education) from 2019-2023. The models were prompted to answer questions in Vietnamese, with performance measured by accuracy scores. Bing Chat's additional hyperlink feature was also assessed for quality and relevance.

## Key Results
- Bing Chat achieved higher accuracy scores than ChatGPT in most subjects, with the largest performance gap in mathematics and science subjects
- ChatGPT performed better only in literature essay questions, where subjective evaluation criteria favor its approach
- Bing Chat's availability in Vietnam without VPN requirements provides practical accessibility advantages for students

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BingChat's GPT-4 technology enables superior performance in most subjects except literature.
- Mechanism: GPT-4 has enhanced understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities compared to GPT-3.5, allowing BingChat to better handle complex queries and produce more accurate responses.
- Core assumption: GPT-4's architectural improvements directly translate to better performance on Vietnamese high school subjects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "BingChat leverages the more advanced GPT-4 technology compared to ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5, leading to enhanced understanding and generation of creative and informative text."
  - [section]: "ChatGPT is based on GPT-3.5 technology, while BingChat utilizes the more advanced GPT-4 technology, providing potential advantages in understanding complex queries and generating creative and informative text."
- Break condition: If GPT-4's improvements are domain-specific and don't generalize to educational content, the performance advantage may not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BingChat's access to online information through Bing search engine gives it an advantage in subjects where answers are publicly available.
- Mechanism: By searching the web for information, BingChat can find accurate answers when questions and answers are available online, supplementing its model-based knowledge.
- Core assumption: Relevant information for the VNHSGE exam is available online and can be effectively retrieved and processed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "BingChat's availability in Vietnam and its incorporation of hyperlinks in answers further solidify its superiority."
  - [section]: "BingChat is also connected to the Bing search engine, which gives it access to a vast repository of publicly available online information."
- Break condition: If the VNHSGE exam questions are not publicly available online or are behind paywalls, this advantage would not apply.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BingChat's availability in Vietnam makes it more accessible and practical for Vietnamese students compared to ChatGPT.
- Mechanism: Students can directly access BingChat without needing workarounds like VPNs, and its integration with Bing search provides additional context and resources.
- Core assumption: Accessibility is a significant factor in the effectiveness of educational tools.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, the fact that BingChat is accessible in Vietnam and its integration of hyperlinks within responses serve to reinforce its superiority."
  - [section]: "BingChat is officially available in Vietnam, while ChatGPT is not. This means that Vietnamese students can access BingChat directly without having to use a VPN or other workaround."
- Break condition: If accessibility issues are overcome for ChatGPT or if Vietnamese students find alternative ways to access it, this advantage may diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their architectures
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and how they process information, is crucial to interpreting the performance differences.
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 that could lead to performance improvements?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Evaluating LLM performance on educational exams requires understanding NLP metrics and how to interpret accuracy scores.
  - Quick check question: How would you assess the performance of an LLM on a multiple-choice exam, and what metrics would you use?

- Concept: Vietnamese education system and VNHSGE exam structure
  - Why needed here: The context of the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination is essential to understanding the study's relevance and implications.
  - Quick check question: What subjects are included in the VNHSGE, and how are they weighted in the final score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - BingChat: GPT-4 model + Bing search engine integration + Vietnamese language support
  - ChatGPT: GPT-3.5 model + General language support
  - Evaluation: VNHSGE dataset (300 literature essays, 1700 multiple-choice questions across 9 subjects)

- Critical path:
  1. Load VNHSGE dataset
  2. Process questions through both LLMs
  3. Compare performance across subjects
  4. Analyze differences in capabilities (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5, search integration, availability)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - BingChat: Better performance but dependent on internet connectivity for search features
  - ChatGPT: Less dependent on internet but lower performance due to older architecture
  - Evaluation: Using a specific dataset may not generalize to all educational contexts

- Failure signatures:
  - If BingChat's search integration leads to irrelevant information being included in responses
  - If GPT-4's advantages are not evident in educational content
  - If the VNHSGE dataset is not representative of typical student needs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test both LLMs on a subset of VNHSGE questions to verify performance differences
  2. Evaluate how each LLM handles questions requiring online information lookup
  3. Assess the impact of availability by comparing access methods and user experience in Vietnam

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
