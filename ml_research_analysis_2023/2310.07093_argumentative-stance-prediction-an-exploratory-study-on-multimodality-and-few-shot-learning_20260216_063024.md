# Argumentative Stance Prediction: An Exploratory Study on Multimodality and Few-Shot Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07093
- Reference count: 20
- Text-only ensemble outperforms multimodal and few-shot LLM approaches for stance prediction (F1: 0.817 vs 0.677 vs 0.550)

## Executive Summary
This study explores argumentative stance prediction using multimodal data (tweets with images) on gun control and abortion topics. The authors compare text-only models, multimodal models, and few-shot large language models (LLMs). An ensemble of fine-tuned text models achieved the best performance with 0.817 F1-score, outperforming multimodal models (0.677 F1-score) and few-shot LLMs (0.550 F1-score). The findings indicate that current multimodal models do not significantly benefit from image information, and that in-context examples improve few-shot LLM performance but still underperform fine-tuned text models.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes multiple text-based transformer models (XLNet, BLOOM, Transformer-XL, DeBERTa-v2, XLM-RoBERTa) on the ImgArg dataset, creating an ensemble through weighted voting. For multimodal approaches, the authors compare pixel-based models (ViLT, FLAVA) with textually summarized images using instructBLIP processed by Multimodal RoBERTa. Few-shot experiments use LLaMA-2 with k-means clustered examples as in-context learning prompts. The ensemble approach combines diverse text model predictions to reduce individual model bias and variance.

## Key Results
- Ensemble of fine-tuned text models achieved highest F1-score (0.817)
- Multimodal models with image summarization achieved moderate performance (0.677 F1)
- Few-shot LLMs with clustered examples showed improvement but lower performance (0.550 F1)
- Text summarization of images via instructBLIP outperformed raw pixel-based multimodal approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ensemble of fine-tuned text-based models outperforms multimodal and few-shot LLM approaches.
- Mechanism: Combining multiple transformer-based classifiers reduces individual model bias and variance by leveraging diverse learned representations, leading to improved F1-score.
- Core assumption: Individual model errors are not highly correlated, allowing ensemble voting to correct mistakes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The study shows an ensemble of fine-tuned text-based language models (0.817 F1-score) outperforms both multimodal (0.677 F1-score) and few-shot LLM (0.550 F1-score) approaches.
  - [section] Table 1 shows individual models have varying recall/precision trade-offs; ensemble balances these to achieve highest overall F1.
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention ensemble methods but do not provide direct comparative F1 results against multimodal or few-shot methods.
- Break condition: If models become too similar (e.g., same architecture with minor differences), ensemble gains diminish or vanish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Summarizing images into natural language via instructBLIP and using early fusion with text improves multimodal stance prediction over raw pixel-based approaches.
- Mechanism: Text summaries capture semantic and contextual information (e.g., text in images, symbolic content) that raw pixel-based vision-language models miss due to pretraining focus on object-centric tasks.
- Core assumption: Image content relevant to stance includes textual elements and abstract concepts not easily captured by object detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Multimodal RoBERTa (image-to-text summarization) achieves F1 0.677, higher than pixel-based ViLT (0.528) and FLAVA (0.610).
  - [section] Discussion notes that multimodal models struggle with non-object content (e.g., propaganda posters), whereas instruction-based summarization captures such content.
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus includes related multimodal stance work but lacks direct comparison of image summarization vs pixel-based methods.
- Break condition: If dataset images are purely object-centric and lack textual or symbolic content, summarization may add little value.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: In-context few-shot learning with clustered examples improves stance detection performance over random or zero-shot prompts.
- Mechanism: Clustering training examples by semantic themes provides more relevant contextual examples for the model, leading to better alignment with test instances sharing similar discourse themes.
- Core assumption: Stance-related themes (e.g., mental health, children, religion) are consistent within clusters and transfer effectively to new examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Using in-context examples improves few-shot LLM performance, and clustering-based selection further enhances results (F1 from 0.500 to 0.550).
  - [section] Clustering with k-means identifies interpretable themes (e.g., gun control: "Gun violence as a mental health problem", "Effects on children"), and few-shot examples drawn from the same cluster improve recall and precision.
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions few-shot learning in stance detection but does not detail clustering-based example selection or theme alignment.
- Break condition: If clusters are poorly formed or themes overlap excessively, the benefit of clustering diminishes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning - combining different data modalities (text, image) for joint inference.
  - Why needed here: The task requires interpreting both tweet text and associated images to predict stance, so leveraging both modalities is theoretically beneficial.
  - Quick check question: If images are summarized to text and then processed by a text model, does this still count as multimodal learning?
- Concept: Ensemble methods - combining predictions from multiple models to improve robustness and accuracy.
  - Why needed here: Individual transformer models have different strengths/weaknesses; ensemble voting can balance these to maximize overall performance.
  - Quick check question: Would ensembling models with identical architectures but different random seeds be as effective as using different architectures?
- Concept: Few-shot learning - adapting a pretrained model to a new task using very few labeled examples provided in context.
  - Why needed here: Large language models can adapt to stance prediction without full fine-tuning by leveraging in-context examples, offering a fast and resource-efficient alternative.
  - Quick check question: Does few-shot performance depend more on the quality of examples or their quantity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion -> Text preprocessing -> Fine-tuning -> Ensemble prediction
- Critical path: Text preprocessing → fine-tuning → ensemble prediction (primary); alternative path: image summarization → multimodal fine-tuning → prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ensemble vs single model: Higher accuracy but increased compute and complexity
  - Image summarization vs pixel input: Better semantic coverage but potential loss of fine-grained visual detail
  - Few-shot vs fine-tuning: Faster, no retraining, but lower performance; fine-tuning gives better accuracy but requires more resources
- Failure signatures:
  - Low ensemble gain: Model predictions are highly correlated (redundant)
  - Multimodal underperformance: Images lack stance-relevant content or summarization fails to capture key semantics
  - Few-shot instability: Example clusters poorly represent test data distribution or examples are noisy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune each text model individually and measure F1 on validation set
  2. Summarize images via instructBLIP, fine-tune Multimodal RoBERTa, compare against ViLT/FLAVA
  3. Run zero-shot, four-shot random, and four-shot k-means LLaMA-2 predictions; measure performance gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diversity of image content in the dataset impact the performance of multimodal models versus text-only models?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from the finding that multimodal models do not significantly outperform text-only models and the observation that the dataset contains diverse images including propaganda material.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different types of images (object-centric vs. text-heavy) affect model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed breakdown of model performance on different image categories or a study isolating the impact of image content diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would alternative prompting methods like Question Decomposition or Tree-of-Thought improve the few-shot performance of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest these methods as future work to address limited performance with LLaMA-2.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with these prompting strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using these alternative prompting methods against the current few-shot approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is there a specific theme or cluster that consistently improves few-shot learning performance across different stance prediction tasks?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from the finding that using in-context examples from the same theme cluster improves few-shot performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies themes but does not analyze which themes are most effective for few-shot learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of few-shot performance across different themes to identify the most effective ones.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the trade-off between ensemble performance and computational requirements scale with larger datasets or more complex models?
- Basis in paper: The authors question the justification for the computational cost of ensembles given marginal performance improvements.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the scalability of this trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments scaling the ensemble size and dataset complexity to measure the computational cost versus performance gain.

## Limitations

- Text-only ensemble significantly outperforms multimodal approaches, suggesting current multimodal architectures inadequately capture stance-relevant visual information
- Few-shot LLM performance remains substantially below fine-tuned models, limiting practical deployment for stance detection
- The study does not analyze whether stance-relevant visual content exists in images but remains unextracted by current models

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The ensemble of fine-tuned text models achieving superior performance (0.817 F1) compared to multimodal (0.677 F1) and few-shot LLM (0.550 F1) approaches is well-supported by direct experimental results presented in Table 1 and the abstract.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that multimodal models underperform due to inability to capture non-object content in images is plausible but not definitively proven.
- **Low confidence**: The specific themes identified through k-means clustering for few-shot example selection are presented as interpretable but their direct impact on performance gains is not conclusively isolated from other factors.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the ImgArg dataset to quantify the actual stance-relevant visual content in images, determining whether the multimodal underperformance stems from dataset characteristics or model limitations.

2. Test alternative multimodal fusion architectures (such as transformer-based cross-attention mechanisms) to determine if the text summarization approach is suboptimal for combining visual and textual stance information.

3. Systematically vary the number and diversity of in-context examples in few-shot experiments while controlling for prompt quality to isolate the true impact of example selection versus other factors on few-shot performance.
