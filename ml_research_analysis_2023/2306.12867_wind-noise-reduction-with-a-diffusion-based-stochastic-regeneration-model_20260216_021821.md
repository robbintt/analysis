# Wind Noise Reduction with a Diffusion-based Stochastic Regeneration Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.12867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12867
- Reference count: 36
- A diffusion-based stochastic regeneration model (StoRM) outperforms existing methods for wind noise reduction in speech signals.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of wind noise reduction in speech signals, which is particularly problematic for hearing device users. The authors propose a diffusion-based stochastic regeneration model (StoRM) that combines predictive and generative modeling to tackle the non-linear distortions caused by wind noise, such as membrane displacement and clipping. The model uses a non-additive speech in noise model and employs a score-based generative model trained with denoising score matching, along with a predictive component for initial denoising. Experimental results on both simulated and real-recorded wind noise datasets show that the proposed StoRM method outperforms existing neural-network-based wind noise reduction methods, as well as purely predictive and generative models, in terms of instrumental metrics like PESQ, ESTOI, and SI-SDR. The method also demonstrates good generalization to unseen real-recorded wind noise data.

## Method Summary
The proposed StoRM model combines a predictive component (Dθ) and a generative diffusion model (Gφ) to perform wind noise reduction. The predictive model provides an initial denoised estimate using a light NCSN++M architecture, while the generative model refines this estimate using score-based generative modeling. The training data is generated using a non-additive speech in noise model that simulates real-world non-linearities like membrane displacement and clipping. The diffusion process operates in the complex STFT domain with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward process, allowing the model to capture the time-frequency structure of wind noise. The model is trained jointly with a combined denoising score matching and supervised loss, and evaluated on both simulated and real-recorded wind noise datasets.

## Key Results
- StoRM outperforms purely predictive and purely generative models on both simulated and real-recorded wind noise datasets
- The non-additive speech in noise model with compressor and clipping simulation improves performance on real wind noise data
- StoRM generalizes well to unseen real-recorded wind noise, demonstrating good performance on German speech despite being trained on English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The diffusion-based stochastic regeneration model (StoRM) outperforms purely predictive and purely generative models by combining their strengths. StoRM uses an initial predictive stage (Dθ) to generate a denoised estimate, then applies a generative diffusion model (Gφ) to refine the output. The predictive model handles fast inference and coarse noise removal, while the generative model captures complex residual noise patterns and produces higher quality outputs.

### Mechanism 2
The non-additive speech in noise model accounts for non-linear microphone membrane displacement and clipping, improving wind noise reduction. Instead of simply adding wind noise to clean speech, the model simulates real-world non-linearities by applying a compressor sidechained by noise and then hard-clipping the signal. This creates training data that better matches real wind noise recordings where membrane displacement and clipping occur.

### Mechanism 3
Diffusion models in the complex STFT domain with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward process effectively handle the time-frequency structure of wind noise. The forward diffusion process gradually corrupts clean speech with both environmental noise and Gaussian noise according to a controllable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck SDE. This structured corruption preserves time-frequency relationships better than simple additive noise models, allowing the reverse diffusion process to learn meaningful denoising trajectories.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion probabilistic models and score-based generative modeling**: The generative component of StoRM relies on learning the score function (gradient of log probability) to reverse a diffusion process. Understanding how denoising score matching trains these models is crucial for implementing and troubleshooting the approach.
  - Quick check: What is the relationship between the forward diffusion process and the score function estimation in denoising score matching?

- **Speech enhancement evaluation metrics (PESQ, ESTOI, SI-SDR, DNSMOS, WVMOS)**: The paper evaluates performance using multiple metrics that capture different aspects (quality, intelligibility, distortion, perceptual quality). Understanding what each metric measures helps interpret results and identify failure modes.
  - Quick check: How does ESTOI differ from PESQ in measuring speech intelligibility, and why might a model score high on one but not the other?

- **Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and complex spectrogram representation**: The model operates on complex spectrograms, requiring understanding of STFT parameters, magnitude/phase handling, and the implications of working in the complex domain versus magnitude-only.
  - Quick check: Why might operating on complex spectrograms provide advantages over magnitude-only approaches for speech enhancement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Noisy speech → STFT preprocessing → Predictive model (Dθ) → Generative diffusion model (Gφ) → Clean speech estimate
- **Critical path**: STFT preprocessing of training data → Predictive model pre-training (MSE loss) → Joint training of predictive and generative components (DSM + supervised loss) → Inference: Noisy speech → predictive denoiser → generative refinement → clean speech estimate
- **Design tradeoffs**: Parameter count: StoRM (56.0M) vs SGMSE+M (27.8M) - more parameters for combined approach; Inference time: StoRM requires 21 network calls vs SGMSE+M's 60 calls, but StoRM has more parameters per call; Architecture choice: NCSN++M vs GaGNet for predictive stage - GaGNet shows better performance with fewer parameters in StoRM-G
- **Failure signatures**: Poor PESQ/WVMOS but good ESTOI/SI-SDR: Predictive component dominates, producing intelligible but distorted speech; Good PESQ/WVMOS but poor ESTOI/SI-SDR: Generative component overfits, producing high-quality but incomplete denoising; Inconsistent performance across SNRs: Diffusion parameters (σmin, σmax, T) not well-matched to noise characteristics
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation study: Train StoRM without the predictive component (pure generative) and compare to SGMSE+M to verify the benefit of the combined approach; 2) Parameter sensitivity: Vary the stiffness γ and extremal noise levels (σmin, σmax) to find optimal settings for wind noise characteristics; 3) Architecture comparison: Replace NCSN++M predictive component with GaGNet (StoRM-G) and evaluate performance vs parameter count tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the StoRM model perform when trained and tested on real-world wind noise data without simulation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions testing on an unseen dataset with real-recorded wind noise but does not provide detailed results or comparisons for training exclusively on real-world data.
- Why unresolved: The experiments primarily used simulated wind noise for training, and the real-recorded wind noise was only used for testing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the StoRM model on a dataset consisting entirely of real-world wind noise, with detailed performance metrics compared to other methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different wind noise characteristics (e.g., turbulence intensity, microphone placement) on the StoRM model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the challenges of wind noise, including its non-stationary nature and non-linear effects, but does not explore how different wind noise characteristics affect the model.
- Why unresolved: The experiments used a generic wind noise dataset without varying specific characteristics that might influence performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets that vary in wind noise characteristics, such as different turbulence intensities or microphone placements, and analyzing the StoRM model's performance under these conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the StoRM model generalize to different languages or accents in the presence of wind noise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The unseen dataset used for testing contained German speech, but the model was trained on English speech from the WSJ0 corpus.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the model's performance on languages or accents other than those used in the experiments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the StoRM model on datasets with various languages or accents, and comparing the performance to that achieved with English speech.

## Limitations

- Limited architectural transparency: The paper provides high-level descriptions of NCSN++M and GaGNet architectures but lacks detailed implementation specifications, making exact reproduction challenging.
- Dataset composition ambiguity: While the paper mentions using WSJ0 corpus and wind tunnel recordings, the exact dataset sizes, balancing strategies, and augmentation techniques beyond basic specifications are not fully detailed.
- Real-world generalization gap: Although the method shows good performance on real-recorded wind noise data, the validation is limited to controlled wind tunnel recordings.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The combined predictive-generative approach outperforms purely predictive or purely generative models in controlled experiments.
- **Medium confidence**: The non-additive speech in noise model with compressor and clipping simulation meaningfully improves performance on real wind noise data.
- **Low confidence**: The diffusion model operating in the complex STFT domain with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward process is the optimal choice for wind noise reduction.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture ablation study**: Implement and train StoRM with alternative diffusion formulations (e.g., variance-exploding vs Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) and domain choices (magnitude-only vs complex spectrograms) to verify the claimed advantages of the current design.

2. **Real-world field testing**: Evaluate the trained models on diverse real-world wind noise recordings collected from different environments (outdoor recordings, various microphone types, natural wind patterns) to assess true generalization beyond controlled wind tunnel conditions.

3. **Computational efficiency analysis**: Measure inference latency and energy consumption across different devices (hearing aids, smartphones) to verify the practical applicability claims, particularly comparing StoRM variants with different parameter counts and network call requirements.
