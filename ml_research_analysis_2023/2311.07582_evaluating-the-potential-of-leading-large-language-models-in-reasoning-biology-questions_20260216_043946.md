# Evaluating the Potential of Leading Large Language Models in Reasoning Biology Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07582
- Reference count: 0
- GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 on a challenging 108-question biology exam

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated the performance of leading Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, Claude2, and SenseNova on a challenging 108-question multiple-choice exam covering molecular biology, biological techniques, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts. These results highlight GPT-4's superior logical reasoning abilities in biological contexts, indicating its potential to aid biology research through capabilities like data analysis, hypothesis generation, and knowledge integration.

## Method Summary
The study tested five LLMs on a 108-question multiple-choice exam covering biology topics. Each model was evaluated using five different prompts to account for variability due to prompt phrasing. Performance was scored based on the number of questions answered correctly, and consistency across trials was measured to evaluate reasoning stability.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 on the biology exam
- GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts
- GPT-4's performance indicates superior logical reasoning abilities in biological contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4's superior performance stems from its deeper logical reasoning capabilities enabled by larger model size and advanced training.
- Mechanism: The larger parameter count and broader training data allow GPT-4 to recognize complex patterns and apply multi-step reasoning to biology questions.
- Core assumption: Model size and training data diversity directly translate to improved logical reasoning on specialized tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts"
- Break condition: If domain-specific fine-tuning proves more important than general model size, this mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt engineering consistency across trials reveals model confidence and reasoning stability.
- Mechanism: Different prompt phrasings test the model's ability to maintain consistent reasoning regardless of surface-level variations.
- Core assumption: Consistency across prompt variations indicates genuine understanding rather than pattern matching.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "GPT-4...demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts"
- Break condition: If models simply memorize common question patterns regardless of prompt phrasing.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4's multimodal capabilities (text + image processing) provide advantage in biology reasoning.
- Mechanism: Ability to process visual information alongside text enables better understanding of complex biological concepts.
- Core assumption: Visual reasoning is important for biology questions beyond text-only comprehension.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "GPT-4 can process both text and images, extracting complex content and relationships from visual input"
- Break condition: If biology questions don't require visual reasoning or if visual processing doesn't improve accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multiple-choice question design principles
  - Why needed here: Questions must test genuine reasoning rather than memorization
  - Quick check question: How do you ensure distractors in multiple-choice questions are plausible but incorrect?

- Concept: Statistical analysis of model performance
  - Why needed here: Need to quantify consistency and confidence across trials
  - Quick check question: What statistical measures best capture model performance variability?

- Concept: Prompt engineering basics
  - Why needed here: Different prompt phrasings can significantly impact model outputs
  - Quick check question: How do you structure prompts to minimize model confusion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question bank → LLM API calls → Answer collection → Statistical analysis → Visualization
- Critical path: Question design → Model testing → Data analysis → Result interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Model accuracy vs. computational cost, question difficulty vs. model capability
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent answers across trials, low confidence scores, domain-specific errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each model with identical prompts to establish baseline performance
  2. Vary prompt phrasing systematically to measure consistency
  3. Analyze error patterns by question category to identify model weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LLMs be fine-tuned on biological domain-specific corpora to improve their performance on complex biological reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Fine-tuning biology corpora can teach LLMs the language of biological data" and that "continually training LLMs on high-quality biological datasets through a lifelong learning approach may maximize their utility for advancing scientific research and education."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates GPT-4's superior performance, it does not explore the impact of fine-tuning on other LLMs or the optimal methods for fine-tuning on biological data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of fine-tuned LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, along with analysis of the most effective fine-tuning strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of using LLMs for hypothesis generation in biological research, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential of LLMs to "generate novel hypotheses" and "uncover novel strategies human engineers may not conceive of," but does not address potential limitations or challenges.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the potential benefits of LLMs in hypothesis generation but does not explore the limitations or challenges associated with this application.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing the quality and novelty of hypotheses generated by LLMs versus human experts, along with analyses of the factors influencing LLM performance in hypothesis generation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLMs be integrated into existing biological research workflows to maximize their impact on scientific discovery and education?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "harnessing LLMs to complement human intelligence could catalyze breakthroughs" and that "Further interdisciplinary research that brings together biologists, computer scientists, and experts across fields will be key to transforming these potentials into realities."
- Why unresolved: While the paper emphasizes the potential of LLMs in biology, it does not provide specific guidance on how to effectively integrate LLMs into existing research workflows or educational settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies demonstrating successful integration of LLMs into biological research and education, along with best practices and guidelines for effective implementation.

## Limitations

- Question quality and domain specificity remain unclear, potentially affecting the validity of performance comparisons
- Results are based on multiple-choice format, which may not translate to real-world research tasks
- Model versions and access parameters are not specified, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- High Confidence: GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts
- Medium Confidence: GPT-4's superior logical reasoning abilities indicate its potential to aid biology research through data analysis, hypothesis generation, and knowledge integration
- Low Confidence: Specific mechanisms underlying GPT-4's superiority (larger model size, multimodal capabilities, human feedback) are inferred rather than directly tested

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Format Validation: Test the same models on open-ended biology questions requiring explanatory answers rather than multiple-choice selection

2. Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning Comparison: Evaluate whether biology-domain fine-tuned versions of smaller models can match or exceed GPT-4's performance

3. Error Pattern Analysis by Biology Subdomain: Conduct detailed error analysis categorizing incorrect answers by biology subdomain to identify specific knowledge gaps and reasoning weaknesses
