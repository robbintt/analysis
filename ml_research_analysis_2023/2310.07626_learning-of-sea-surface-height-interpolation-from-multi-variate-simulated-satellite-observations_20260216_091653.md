# Learning of Sea Surface Height Interpolation from Multi-variate Simulated Satellite Observations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07626
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07626
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Supervised ABED network achieves 41% decrease in SSH RMSE compared to DUACS using multi-variate SST data

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of Sea Surface Height (SSH) interpolation from satellite observations with significant data gaps. The authors propose a novel multi-variate Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) that emulates 20 years of SSH and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) satellite observations. They develop and train an Attention-Based Encoder-Decoder (ABED) deep learning network on this data, demonstrating that incorporating SST information significantly improves SSH reconstruction performance. The work establishes the feasibility of training deep learning methods on multi-variate oceanographic data and highlights the potential for improved eddy detection through enhanced SSH reconstruction.

## Method Summary
The method employs a 20-year OSSE simulation of SSH and SST observations based on GLORYS12 ocean reanalysis data. An ABED deep learning network is trained using either supervised loss (MSE against ground truth) or unsupervised loss (MSE against simulated observations). The network architecture incorporates temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to effectively extract features from the multi-variate input data. The trained model is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods (DUACS, 4dvarnet, musti) on both the NATL60 OSSE and real data from the Ocean Data Challenge 2021.

## Key Results
- Supervised ABED network achieves 41% reduction in SSH RMSE compared to DUACS
- SST data integration improves SSH reconstruction and eddy detection performance
- Unsupervised training with observation-based loss functions shows promising results without ground truth data
- The method successfully handles data gaps in satellite observations while maintaining physical consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SST data improves SSH interpolation because temperature and sea surface height are physically linked through advection dynamics.
- Mechanism: The neural network learns the complex, non-linear relationship between SST and SSH by using SST as additional contextual information during interpolation.
- Core assumption: The physical link between SST and SSH captured in the simulation is representative of real-world dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SST is physically linked to geostrophic currents through advection"
  - [section 2.1]: "Combining the geostrophic and the advection Equations...we see why a time series of SST observations should provide pertinent information for constraining the SSH reconstruction"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - neighboring papers focus on deep learning for SSH but don't explicitly validate the SST-SSH physical link mechanism
- Break Condition: If the physical relationship between SST and SSH in the simulation does not generalize to real ocean conditions, or if SST data quality is too degraded by cloud cover.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Attention-Based Encoder-Decoder (ABED) architecture effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from multi-variate ocean data.
- Mechanism: The attention blocks in ABED highlight salient features across both temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing the network to focus on relevant patterns in the data.
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism can learn meaningful relationships in oceanographic data that simpler architectures might miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "The attention mechanism allows to emphasize important features while neglecting irrelevant ones which makes it well-suited to extract information from contextual variables"
  - [section 3.2]: "We extend this idea by incorporating temporal information in the channel attention mechanism"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - neighboring papers use various architectures but don't specifically validate the ABED approach for this application
- Break Condition: If the attention mechanism fails to learn meaningful patterns or if simpler architectures perform equally well, indicating the added complexity isn't necessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Unsupervised learning with observation-based loss functions enables training without ground truth data, making the approach applicable to real-world scenarios.
- Mechanism: The network learns to reconstruct SSH fields by minimizing the error between its predictions and actual satellite observations, using either direct observations or observations with added smoothness regularization.
- Core assumption: The observation operator Hssh applied to the network's predictions provides sufficient signal for learning the inverse problem.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "We propose to train neural networks using the 3 following losses...The MSE using only observations"
  - [section 3.3]: "Ltri(Yssh, ˆXssh) = 1/N Σ(Yssh_i - Hssh(ˆXssh)_i)^2"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - neighboring papers use various loss functions but don't specifically validate this observation-based approach
- Break Condition: If the network overfits to observations without generalizing, or if the observation operator introduces biases that prevent learning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding of optimal interpolation and its limitations
  - Why needed here: The paper compares the proposed method to DUACS, which uses optimal interpolation, and claims improvements over this approach
  - Quick check question: What are the main limitations of linear optimal interpolation for SSH mapping, and how does the proposed method address them?
- Concept: Familiarity with geostrophic approximation and its relationship to ocean currents
- Concept: Understanding of satellite remote sensing principles for both altimetry and SST
  - Quick check question: How do satellite altimeters and infrared sensors differ in their measurement principles, and what are the implications for data quality and coverage?
- Concept: Basic understanding of attention mechanisms in neural networks
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism in the ABED architecture differ from standard convolutional approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (21-day SSH and SST time series) -> Encoder (2 downsampling blocks) -> Attention blocks (temporal and spatial attention) -> Decoder (2 upsampling blocks) -> Output (SSH field)
- Critical path: The temporal attention component is critical as it allows the network to learn patterns across the 21-day time window, which is essential for the interpolation task.
- Design tradeoffs: Using SST as input increases model complexity but provides better reconstruction performance. The 21-day time window balances computational cost with information content.
- Failure signatures: If the network overfits to training data, validation loss will plateau while training loss continues to decrease. Poor generalization to real data would manifest as high error on test sets.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the ABED network on SSH-only data using supervised loss to establish baseline performance
  2. Add SST as input while keeping supervised loss to measure the impact of SST information
  3. Switch to unsupervised loss functions to test the feasibility of training without ground truth data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed method be effectively adapted and transferred to real-world satellite observations, considering the differences in noise characteristics between simulated and real data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "simulations provide valuable insights, but their direct application to real-world observations can be challenging due to inherent differences between the two domains" and discusses the potential use of transfer learning to adapt the model from simulations to real data.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the challenges in transferring the model to real-world data but does not provide a concrete strategy for addressing these challenges or demonstrate the effectiveness of such an approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that demonstrates the successful transfer of the model from simulated to real-world data, including a comparison of performance metrics before and after transfer learning, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for interpolating SSH data on a global scale, considering the varying characteristics of ocean dynamics at different latitudes and in different regions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential for global interpolation but does not provide a detailed strategy for addressing the challenges associated with different latitudes and regions. It mentions that "as the geostrophic equilibrium depends on the Coriolis force surface projection, and thus on the latitude considered, we may require a model to be trained on several areas with different latitudes."
- Why unresolved: The paper raises the question of global interpolation but does not explore or compare different strategies, such as training a single global model versus multiple regional models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study that evaluates the performance of different global interpolation strategies, including training a single global model versus multiple regional models, would provide insights into the optimal approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the integration of additional physical data sources, such as chlorophyll maps, further enhance the reconstruction of SSH and improve the detection of ocean eddies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential benefits of using SST data for SSH reconstruction and eddy detection, and mentions that "other physical measures might improve the reconstruction, such as chlorophyll maps that track plankton advected by currents."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the use of SST data and does not explore the potential benefits of incorporating other physical data sources, such as chlorophyll maps, into the reconstruction process.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that incorporates chlorophyll maps and other physical data sources into the SSH reconstruction and eddy detection process, and compares the performance to using SST data alone, would provide insights into the potential benefits of using additional data sources.

## Limitations

- The study relies on simulated observations rather than real satellite data, which may not fully capture measurement noise characteristics and sensor degradation patterns
- The physical link between SST and SSH, while theoretically justified, has not been experimentally validated on real-world observations
- The attention-based architecture's superiority over simpler alternatives remains unconfirmed, as ablation studies comparing different network architectures are absent

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The improvement in SSH reconstruction RMSE (41% decrease vs. DUACS) is well-supported by the experimental results and methodology is sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that SST data improves SSH interpolation is plausible but requires validation on real satellite observations to confirm the physical relationship.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the ABED architecture is optimal for this task, and that unsupervised learning can match supervised performance, lacks sufficient comparative analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Real Data Validation**: Apply the trained model to real satellite observations (e.g., from Ocean Data Challenge 2021) and compare performance against DUACS on actual measurement data.
2. **Architecture Ablation Study**: Implement and test simpler architectures (e.g., U-Net, ConvLSTM) with the same multi-variate input to quantify the added value of the ABED architecture.
3. **Temporal Generalization Test**: Evaluate model performance on data from years outside the training range to assess temporal generalization and identify potential overfitting to specific oceanographic conditions.
