# CustomNet: Zero-shot Object Customization with Variable-Viewpoints in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19784
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19784
- Authors: [Authors not provided]
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: CustomNet enables zero-shot object customization in text-to-image diffusion models with viewpoint, location, and background control while maintaining object identity

## Executive Summary
CustomNet addresses limitations in existing object customization methods by integrating 3D novel view synthesis capabilities into the diffusion model pipeline. The method enables simultaneous control over viewpoints, spatial location, and background generation while preserving object identity. By employing a dual cross-attention mechanism and location-controlled reference object concatenation, CustomNet produces diverse outputs without the copy-paste effects common in other approaches. The method is validated through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating superior performance in identity preservation, viewpoint variation, and text alignment compared to existing techniques.

## Method Summary
CustomNet is a fine-tuning approach that extends pre-trained diffusion models (specifically Zero-1-to-3) with three key capabilities: viewpoint control through explicit 3D parameters [R,T], location control via reference object concatenation, and disentangled background control through dual cross-attention. The method trains on a dataset combining synthetic multiview data from Objaverse with natural images from OpenImages, using a reverse pipeline that extracts objects and generates novel views. The dual cross-attention mechanism accepts both fused object embeddings with viewpoint control and textual background descriptions, enabling independent manipulation of object appearance and scene context. The model is fine-tuned for 500K steps with L2 loss minimization between generated and target latents.

## Key Results
- Superior identity preservation compared to existing methods, measured by DINO-I and CLIP-I similarity scores
- Effective viewpoint variation capability demonstrated through user studies and quantitative metrics
- Strong text alignment performance with background descriptions while maintaining object consistency
- Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in generating diverse, harmonious outputs without copy-paste artifacts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit viewpoint control enables identity preservation while allowing diverse outputs
- Mechanism: CustomNet integrates 3D novel view synthesis by conditioning on viewpoint parameters [R,T], generating objects from different views while maintaining identity and avoiding copy-paste effects
- Core assumption: Viewpoint-conditioned diffusion models can maintain object identity across different views
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CustomNet explicitly incorporates 3D novel view synthesis capabilities into the object customization process. This integration facilitates the adjustment of spatial position relationships and viewpoints, yielding diverse outputs while effectively preserving object identity."
  - [section 3.1]: "To enable synthesizing a target customized image complied with the given viewpoint parameter [R, T ], we follow the view-conditioned diffusion method introduced by Zero-1-to-3."
- Break condition: If the viewpoint-conditioned diffusion model cannot maintain identity across views, the method would fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual cross-attention enables disentangled object and background controls
- Mechanism: CustomNet uses two separate cross-attention modules - one for object embedding with viewpoint control and one for textual background embeddings, allowing independent control
- Core assumption: Separate attention modules can learn disentangled representations for object and background
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "We propose a novel dual cross-attention conditioning strategy that accepts both the fused object embedding with viewpoint control and textual descriptions for background."
  - [section 4.3]: "We introduce dual-attention for the disentangled object-level control and background control with textual descriptions."
- Break condition: If the dual attention modules cannot learn disentangled representations, background and object controls may interfere

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Location control through concatenated reference object image
- Mechanism: CustomNet concatenates the reference object image transformed to the desired location and size into the UNet input, enabling precise placement while maintaining identity
- Core assumption: Concatenating location-transformed reference images to UNet input preserves identity and enables precise placement
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "We further control the object location in the synthesized image by concatenating the reference object image transformed by the desired location and size to the UNet input."
  - [section 4.3]: "Concatenating the reference object to the UNet input can also preserve textures."
- Break condition: If the location transformation is not accurately represented in the concatenated image, placement may be incorrect

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D novel view synthesis
  - Why needed here: CustomNet builds on 3D novel view synthesis to generate objects from different viewpoints while preserving identity
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between 2D image manipulation and 3D novel view synthesis in terms of viewpoint control?

- Concept: Diffusion models and conditioning
  - Why needed here: CustomNet extends a pre-trained diffusion model (Zero-1-to-3) with additional conditioning on viewpoint, location, and background
  - Quick check question: How does conditioning a diffusion model with additional inputs (like viewpoint parameters) affect the generation process?

- Concept: Cross-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: CustomNet uses dual cross-attention to separately control object and background generation
  - Quick check question: What is the role of cross-attention in conditioning a diffusion model, and how does it differ from concatenation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIP image encoder → MLP fusion with [R,T] → UNet with dual cross-attention → output image
- Critical path: CLIP image encoder → MLP fusion with [R,T] → UNet with dual cross-attention → output image
- Design tradeoffs: Dual cross-attention vs. single shared attention (more parameters but disentangled control)
- Failure signatures: Copy-paste effects (insufficient viewpoint variation), floating objects (poor background harmonization), identity loss (inadequate object conditioning)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test viewpoint control by generating the same object from different [R,T] parameters
  2. Test location control by placing the object at different positions in the output
  3. Test background control by varying text descriptions while keeping object constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can CustomNet handle non-rigid transformations of objects during customization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CustomNet cannot perform non-rigid transformations or change object styles, which is listed as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore or discuss potential methods to extend CustomNet for non-rigid transformations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing CustomNet's performance on tasks requiring non-rigid transformations, or proposed modifications to enable such capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of CustomNet compare to optimization-based methods when fine-tuning is allowed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that CustomNet enables zero-shot object customization without test-time optimization, but does not compare its performance to optimization-based methods when fine-tuning is permitted.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on zero-shot performance and does not explore the potential benefits of allowing fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments between CustomNet with and without fine-tuning, and against optimization-based methods with fine-tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the dataset construction pipeline be further improved to handle more complex backgrounds and real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the dataset construction pipeline effectively utilizes synthetic multiview data and natural images, but also lists handling real-world objects and complex backgrounds as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the current pipeline or propose specific improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the current pipeline's shortcomings and proposed modifications to address them, along with experimental results demonstrating improved performance on complex backgrounds.

## Limitations
- Cannot perform non-rigid transformations or change object styles
- Relies on pre-existing multiview object datasets (Objaverse) which may limit generalizability
- Implementation details of dual cross-attention mechanism and dataset construction pipeline remain underspecified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of integrating viewpoint parameters into diffusion models (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the Zero-1-to-3 foundation and the quantitative improvements in identity preservation and viewpoint variation.
- **Medium confidence**: The dual cross-attention design (Mechanism 2) is theoretically sound and shows benefits in disentangling object and background controls, but the exact implementation details and whether this architecture is strictly necessary versus simpler alternatives remains uncertain.
- **Medium confidence**: The location control through image concatenation (Mechanism 3) is a reasonable approach, but the paper doesn't provide extensive ablation studies to confirm this is the optimal method for location control.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on attention mechanisms**: Implement a variant of CustomNet using a single shared cross-attention module instead of dual attention to quantify the performance difference and validate whether the added complexity is justified.

2. **Generalization test on unseen objects**: Evaluate CustomNet on objects from categories not well-represented in Objaverse (e.g., highly detailed sculptures, transparent objects, or objects with unusual textures) to assess the method's true zero-shot capabilities beyond the reported test set.

3. **Background control robustness**: Systematically vary background text descriptions from semantically related to unrelated concepts while keeping the object constant, and measure both CLIP-T scores and visual harmony to quantify the robustness of the background disentanglement mechanism.
