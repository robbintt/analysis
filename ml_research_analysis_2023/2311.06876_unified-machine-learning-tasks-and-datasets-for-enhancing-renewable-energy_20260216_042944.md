# Unified machine learning tasks and datasets for enhancing renewable energy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06876
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06876
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces ETT-17, a unified multi-tasking ML model for 17 datasets across six domains related to renewable energy, analyzing dataset dimensions and introducing dataset scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ETT-17, a collection of 17 datasets spanning six domains related to enhancing renewable energy. The authors develop a unified spatio-temporal data representation that enables a single multi-tasking machine learning model to process diverse data modalities. They analyze dataset properties through four scoring metrics (SImb-score, STood-score, IO-score, Outlier-score) and provide performance benchmarks using Random Forest models. The work demonstrates significant variations in data requirements across tasks and shows that unified representation facilitates the development of advanced AI models for climate change-related domains.

## Method Summary
The authors create a unified spatio-temporal data representation by mapping all datasets to canonical coordinates in (virtual) time and space, enabling a single multi-tasking ML architecture to process diverse modalities. They analyze dataset dimensions and introduce four dataset scores to quantify important properties: selection bias (SImb-score), epistemic uncertainty (STood-score), aleatoric uncertainty (IO-score), and evaluation biases (Outlier-score). Performance benchmarks are established using Random Forest models, and the number of parameters required for over-parameterized models is computed for each dataset.

## Key Results
- Large variations exist in the number of data points and model parameters required across different tasks and domains
- Dataset scores reveal consistent similarities between sub-tasks within the same domain
- Random Forest benchmarks show varying performance across tasks with no clear correlation to dataset scores
- The unified data representation successfully standardizes diverse data modalities into a common format

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The unified spatio-temporal data representation enables multi-tasking ML models to process diverse data modalities using a single architecture by assigning each data point a canonical coordinate in (virtual) time and space.
- Mechanism: By expressing all datasets in terms of time-variant, space-variant, and space-time-variant feature components, the model can leverage graph neural networks or transformers to efficiently process the spatial and temporal relationships inherent in each task. This standardization eliminates the need for separate architectures for each modality.
- Core assumption: All relevant tasks can be meaningfully expressed in terms of spatial and temporal coordinates, and that the dimensionality of these coordinates is sufficient to capture the task's structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We standardize data components in (virtual) time and space to formulate a unified data format that is able to bring all tasks and datasets onto a common ground."
  - [section] "A common property among all tasks is that they can be expressed with data components in (virtual) timeandspace."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors focus on domain-specific forecasting, not unified representation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The dataset score metrics (SImb-score, STood-score, IO-score, Outlier-score) quantify specific properties of the data that influence the design requirements for over-parameterized ML models.
- Mechanism: SImb-score measures selection bias by computing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between feature distributions and a uniform distribution. STood-score estimates epistemic uncertainty by measuring distribution shifts across time and space between training and test sets. IO-score approximates aleatoric uncertainty by capturing the sensitivity of labels to changes in features. Outlier-score quantifies evaluation bias by detecting subgroups and edge cases.
- Core assumption: These four metrics capture the most important sources of bias and uncertainty in the datasets, and that these sources are sufficient to characterize the difficulty of each task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further analyse the dimensions of each dataset; investigate what they require for designing over-parameterized models; introduce a set of dataset scores that describe important properties of each task and dataset."
  - [section] "A problem with designing trustworthy AI and ML models for real-world applications is given when these are not evaluated sufficiently on data from regions that are not seen during training (Epistemic uncertainty), or when very similar inputs have drastically different outputs (Aleatoric uncertainty)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not discuss dataset scoring metrics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The large variations in the number of data points and model parameters required for over-parameterized ML models across tasks suggest that multi-tasking and transfer learning models are crucial for solving tasks with limited data availability.
- Mechanism: Tasks with very few data points (e.g., Polianna) can benefit from inductive biases learned from related tasks with more data (e.g., Uber Movement). The unified data representation allows the model to share information across tasks by leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships common to all datasets.
- Core assumption: The tasks are sufficiently related that knowledge transfer is possible, and that the unified representation captures the relevant similarities between tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multi-tasking machine learning (ML) models exhibit prediction abilities in domains with little to no training data available (few-shot and zero-shot learning)."
  - [section] "We find that large variations in the available number of data points exist between different tasks and application domains. This suggests that large multi-tasking and transfer learning models can be highly important for solving real-world problems with small data availability."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors focus on domain-specific applications, not cross-task knowledge transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Interpolation Threshold
  - Why needed here: Understanding the interpolation threshold is crucial for determining the number of parameters required for over-parameterized models to achieve zero training loss and potentially optimal generalization.
  - Quick check question: Given a dataset with n=1000 data points and label dimension Dy=10, what is the minimum number of parameters required to reach the interpolation threshold?

- Concept: Jensen-Shannon Divergence
  - Why needed here: The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used to compute the SImb-score and STood-score, which quantify selection bias and epistemic uncertainty, respectively. Understanding this metric is essential for interpreting the dataset scores.
  - Quick check question: If two probability distributions P and Q are identical, what is the value of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between them?

- Concept: Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty is important for understanding the limitations of ML models and designing appropriate mitigation strategies. The IO-score and STood-score capture these two types of uncertainty, respectively.
  - Quick check question: Which type of uncertainty (aleatoric or epistemic) is irreducible and inherent to the data, and which type can be reduced by collecting more data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component Map: Data Preprocessing -> Model Architecture -> Training Loop -> Evaluation
- Critical Path: Data Preprocessing -> Model Architecture -> Training Loop -> Evaluation
- Design Tradeoffs:
  - Unified Representation vs. Task-Specific Representations: Unified representation simplifies multi-tasking but may not capture task-specific nuances.
  - Over-parameterization vs. Under-parameterization: Over-parameterized models can achieve zero loss but may require more data and computation.
  - Multi-tasking vs. Single-tasking: Multi-tasking can leverage knowledge transfer but may be more complex to train and evaluate.
- Failure Signatures:
  - Poor performance on tasks with very few data points: Indicates insufficient knowledge transfer.
  - High STood-score: Indicates significant distribution shift between training and test sets, suggesting the need for domain adaptation techniques.
  - Low IO-score: Indicates high aleatoric uncertainty, suggesting the need for probabilistic modeling or robust optimization.
- First 3 Experiments:
  1. Train a simple multi-layer perceptron on a single task (e.g., Building Electricity) and evaluate its performance on the test set.
  2. Train a graph neural network on a single task (e.g., Wind Farm) using the unified spatio-temporal representation and compare its performance to the MLP.
  3. Train a multi-tasking model on two related tasks (e.g., Uber Movement cities-10 and cities-20) and evaluate its performance on each task individually and jointly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do dataset scores correlate with the performance of over-parameterized models in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the importance of dataset scores for quantifying properties like selection bias, Epistemic uncertainty, Aleatoric uncertainty, and evaluation biases. They also mention that over-parameterized models can achieve zero-loss training and near-optimal generalization performance.
- Why unresolved: While the authors compute dataset scores and provide RF benchmarks, they note that RF performance has no clear correlation to any of the dataset scores. The paper does not explore the relationship between dataset scores and the performance of over-parameterized models in zero-shot and few-shot learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the performance of over-parameterized models (e.g., large language models, transformers) on the ETT-17 datasets in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios, and how this performance correlates with the computed dataset scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of data sparsity and irregular feature/label lengths on the performance of multi-tasking models in climate change-related domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that some datasets have variable-length features and labels (e.g., Polianna, Open Catalyst). They also discuss the unified data representation and its ability to handle sparse data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical results on how data sparsity and irregular feature/label lengths affect the performance of multi-tasking models. The RF benchmarks are not directly applicable to variable-length data representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of multi-tasking models on datasets with regular vs. irregular feature/label lengths, and on sparse vs. dense data, in the context of climate change-related tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the requirements for over-parameterized models (ipt and sf t) influence the design of effective AI solutions in renewable energy domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compute the interpolation threshold (ipt) and smooth function threshold (sf t) for each dataset, revealing that over-parameterized models would require an impractical number of parameters to achieve interpolation and robustness.
- Why unresolved: While the authors discuss the implications of high ipt and sf t values, they do not provide concrete strategies or empirical results on how to design effective AI solutions given these requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating successful AI solutions in renewable energy domains that effectively address the challenges posed by high ipt and sf t values, such as leveraging active learning techniques or using models that predict one label at a time.

## Limitations

- Implementation Complexity: The unified spatio-temporal data representation requires careful implementation of feature mapping to virtual time and space coordinates, with limited implementation details provided in the paper.
- Dataset Specificity: While the paper claims the approach generalizes across domains, the datasets are all climate/energy focused, limiting generalizability claims to other domains.
- Validation Methodology: The use of out-of-distribution validation and testing is mentioned but not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the results.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The existence of significant variation in dataset sizes and model parameter requirements across tasks is well-supported by the empirical analysis presented.
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the dataset score metrics in characterizing task difficulty is plausible but requires further validation across diverse domains beyond the ETT-17 collection.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that unified representation enables multi-tasking ML models to process diverse data modalities using a single architecture is theoretically sound but not extensively validated with model performance comparisons.

## Next Checks

1. Reimplement Unified Representation: Implement the unified spatio-temporal data representation for a subset of the ETT-17 datasets and verify that it correctly maps diverse data modalities to a common format.

2. Dataset Score Validation: Calculate the dataset scores for a held-out task not included in the original ETT-17 collection and assess whether the scores accurately predict the task's difficulty for ML models.

3. Multi-tasking Model Comparison: Train a multi-tasking model using the unified representation on two or more related tasks from ETT-17 and compare its performance to single-tasking models to validate the claimed benefits of knowledge transfer.
