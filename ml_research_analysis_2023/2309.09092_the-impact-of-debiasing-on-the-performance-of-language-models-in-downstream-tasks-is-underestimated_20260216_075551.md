# The Impact of Debiasing on the Performance of Language Models in Downstream Tasks is Underestimated

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.09092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09092
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Current benchmark datasets systematically underestimate the effects of debiasing on language model performance due to insufficient gender-related instances.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether standard benchmark datasets adequately capture the impact of debiasing methods on language model performance in downstream NLP tasks. The authors find that benchmark datasets like GLUE contain relatively few gender-related instances, causing debiasing effects to be systematically underestimated. They demonstrate that separate evaluation on gender-related instances provides more reliable assessment of debiasing effects and propose a controlled debiasing method to measure performance sensitivity to different levels of debiasing.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze GLUE benchmark datasets to quantify gender-related instances and apply three debiasing methods (CDA, Dropout, Context debiasing) during fine-tuning on downstream tasks using BERT-base-cased. They evaluate performance differences between original and debiased models on all instances versus subsets containing female, male, and occupational words. Additionally, they introduce a controlled debiasing approach that varies the degree of debiasing through parameter r to measure performance sensitivity.

## Key Results
- GLUE benchmark datasets contain relatively few gender-related instances (female, male, and occupational words)
- Performance differences between original and debiased models are larger when evaluated on gender-related instances versus all instances
- Performance differences increase monotonically with the degree of debiasing for datasets containing more gender-related instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Debiasing effects are systematically underestimated in standard benchmarks due to insufficient gender-related instances. When benchmark datasets contain few instances with female, male, or stereotypical words, the performance degradation from debiasing is diluted across the majority of non-gender-related instances, masking the true impact. This occurs because the presence of gender-related words is necessary to observe the full effect of debiasing on model performance.

### Mechanism 2
Separate evaluation on gender-related instances provides more reliable assessment of debiasing effects. By isolating and evaluating performance on instances containing female, male, and stereotypical words separately, the impact of debiasing becomes more apparent as it is no longer diluted by the majority of non-gender-related instances. Performance differences are more pronounced and measurable when evaluated on a subset of data that is more susceptible to debiasing effects.

### Mechanism 3
Controlling the degree of debiasing allows for measuring the sensitivity of datasets to debiasing effects. By applying different levels of debiasing (controlled by parameter r) and measuring the performance difference, one can determine how sensitive a dataset is to debiasing. Datasets with more gender-related instances show larger performance differences as the degree of debiasing increases, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between debiasing degree and performance impact.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gender bias in language models**: Understanding how language models learn and perpetuate gender biases is fundamental to the study of debiasing methods and their evaluation. *Why needed here*: This provides the context for why debiasing is necessary and what constitutes successful bias mitigation. *Quick check*: What are some common ways that gender bias manifests in language models, and why is it important to address these biases?

- **Benchmark datasets and their construction**: Knowledge of how benchmark datasets are constructed and the types of instances they contain is crucial for understanding why current evaluation methods may underestimate debiasing effects. *Why needed here*: This helps explain why existing benchmarks may not adequately capture debiasing impacts. *Quick check*: How are benchmark datasets typically constructed, and what factors might influence their ability to capture the effects of debiasing?

- **Debiasing methods and their evaluation**: Familiarity with various debiasing methods and how their effectiveness is evaluated is necessary to understand the significance of the study's findings and recommendations. *Why needed here*: This provides context for the specific debiasing approaches used and their evaluation. *Quick check*: What are some common debiasing methods used in NLP, and how is the effectiveness of these methods typically evaluated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa) -> Debiasing methods (CDA, Dropout, Context debiasing) -> Fine-tuning on downstream tasks -> Evaluation on benchmark datasets
- **Critical path**: Apply debiasing methods to pre-trained models → Fine-tune on downstream tasks → Evaluate performance on benchmark datasets → Compare performance on all instances versus gender-related instances
- **Design tradeoffs**: The choice of debiasing method involves tradeoffs between the extent of bias mitigation and the preservation of useful information for downstream tasks. The use of separate evaluation on gender-related instances versus the entire dataset involves tradeoffs between specificity and generalizability of the evaluation.
- **Failure signatures**: If performance differences between original and debiased models are not significant, or if the performance on gender-related instances does not differ from the overall performance, it may indicate that the debiasing method is not effective or that the dataset is not sensitive to debiasing.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Apply a debiasing method to a pre-trained language model and evaluate its performance on a benchmark dataset, comparing the results on all instances versus gender-related instances.
  2. Control the degree of debiasing (using a parameter like r) and measure how the performance difference between original and debiased models changes with increasing levels of debiasing.
  3. Compare the performance of different debiasing methods on the same dataset, focusing on their effects on gender-related instances versus all instances.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed debias controlled method perform across different types of social biases beyond gender, such as racial or religious biases? The study only examined gender-related social biases, leaving open whether the methodology would be effective for detecting and measuring other types of biases. Applying the debias controlled method to benchmark datasets containing racial, religious, or other types of social biases and measuring whether performance differences between original and debiased models are similarly underestimated when evaluated on all instances versus bias-specific instances would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
How do the results generalize to non-English languages and morphologically rich languages where gender swapping is more complex? The proposed evaluation methodology relies on identifying and manipulating gender-related words, which may not be straightforward in languages with different grammatical structures. Conducting the same experiments on multilingual datasets or focusing on a specific non-English language to determine if the underestimation of debiasing effects occurs similarly and whether the debias controlled method is applicable would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal balance between removing discriminatory bias information and retaining useful information for downstream tasks? The study demonstrates that debiasing affects performance on gender-related instances but does not explore whether there are levels of debiasing that minimize bias while maximizing downstream task performance. Systematically testing various degrees of debiasing across multiple tasks to identify a point where bias is sufficiently reduced while performance degradation is minimized, potentially using a multi-objective optimization approach, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The study's findings are primarily based on analysis of GLUE benchmark datasets, which may limit generalizability to other benchmark suites
- The effectiveness of the proposed evaluation methodology depends on the completeness and accuracy of the word lists used to identify gender-related instances
- The controlled debiasing method's sensitivity to the parameter r and its relationship to performance differences requires further validation across diverse datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The observation that GLUE datasets contain relatively few gender-related instances (supported by Table 1 analysis)
- **Medium Confidence**: The recommendation to use separate evaluation on gender-related instances (supported by performance difference comparisons, though dependent on word list accuracy)
- **Medium Confidence**: The controlled debiasing method's effectiveness (supported by Figure 1 trends, but requires verification of hyperparameter choices)

## Next Checks

1. **Word List Verification**: Verify the completeness and accuracy of the female, male, and occupational word lists used to extract gender-related instances from benchmark datasets.
2. **Cross-Dataset Replication**: Apply the same methodology to other benchmark suites (e.g., SuperGLUE, RACE) to test generalizability of the underestimation findings.
3. **Method Parameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the controlled debiasing parameter r across a wider range of values to confirm the monotonic relationship between debiasing degree and performance differences.
