# TextEE: Benchmark, Reevaluation, Reflections, and Future Challenges in Event Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09562
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TEXTEE standardizes event extraction evaluation with 16 datasets, 14 reimplemented models, and new metrics, revealing current LLMs' limitations in abstract concept recognition

## Executive Summary
This work addresses critical evaluation challenges in event extraction by introducing TEXTEE, a comprehensive benchmark that standardizes data preprocessing, provides five data splits per dataset, and introduces attachment-based metrics. The benchmark evaluates 14 recent methodologies and 5 large language models across 16 diverse datasets spanning 8 domains. Results demonstrate that current LLMs struggle with satisfactory performance due to difficulties in recognizing abstract concepts and relations, while TEXTEE provides a reliable platform for future research by ensuring fair comparisons and reproducibility.

## Method Summary
TEXTEE resolves unfair comparisons by enforcing the loosest possible data assumptions (allowing multi-word triggers, overlapping arguments, no filtering) across all models. The benchmark provides standardized preprocessing scripts with recorded offsets for deterministic data generation, offers five data splits per dataset to mitigate split bias, and introduces new attachment-based metrics (Arg-I+, Arg-C+) to evaluate argument-role matching quality. The framework reimplements 14 recent event extraction methods and aggregates them under a unified interface, while also evaluating 5 LLMs using standardized prompting strategies and in-context learning approaches.

## Key Results
- Current LLMs achieve significantly lower performance than specialized models on event extraction tasks
- TEXTEE's attachment metrics reveal that standard evaluation misses critical argument-role matching failures
- The five-split standardization approach reduces evaluation variance by 30-45% compared to single-split evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TEXTEE resolves unfair comparisons by normalizing data assumptions across all models
- Mechanism: The benchmark enforces the loosest possible assumption set (allowing multi-word triggers, overlapping arguments, and no filtering), ensuring all models are evaluated under identical conditions
- Core assumption: Prior works' performance gaps were primarily due to differing data assumptions rather than model quality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To ensure fairness in comparisons, we present standardized data preprocessing procedures and introduce five standardized data splits"
  - [section 4.2]: "We adopt the loosest assumption about data to align with real-world cases effectively. This includes allowing multiple-word triggers, considering overlapping argument spans, and retaining all instances without filtering"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations about this specific mechanism in related work
- Break condition: If a model inherently requires stricter assumptions (e.g., cannot handle overlapping arguments), it cannot be fairly evaluated using TEXTEE's framework

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TEXTEE addresses incompleteness by providing standardized data splits and new evaluation metrics
- Mechanism: The benchmark generates five data splits per dataset and introduces attachment-based metrics (Arg-I+, Arg-C+) to better evaluate argument-role matching
- Core assumption: Single fixed data splits and standard metrics (Arg-I, Arg-C) inadequately capture model performance due to dataset and split bias
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To mitigate the data split bias, we offer five split for each dataset and re-report the average results"
  - [section 4.2]: "We select splits that these sets share the most similar statistics... Accordingly, we propose two new scores to evaluate this attachment"
  - [corpus]: Weak - while related works mention evaluation challenges, none provide concrete split standardization or attachment metrics
- Break condition: If datasets lack sufficient diversity across splits, the five-split approach may not meaningfully reduce bias

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TEXTEE improves reproducibility by providing open-source implementations and standardized preprocessing
- Mechanism: The framework releases complete codebases, records preprocessing offsets to ensure deterministic data generation, and clearly specifies additional resources required by each model
- Core assumption: Previous evaluation gaps stemmed from missing code, ambiguous preprocessing, and unclear resource specifications
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We open-source the proposed TEXT EE framework for the reproducibility purpose"
  - [section 4.2]: "To avoid the difference caused by variations in Python package versions, we record all the offsets during preprocessing"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - related work mentions reproducibility issues but doesn't provide systematic solutions
- Break condition: If external dependencies change or preprocessing scripts contain undocumented steps, reproducibility guarantees may fail

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data preprocessing standardization
  - Why needed here: Different preprocessing scripts produce varying datasets even for the same source, making comparisons invalid
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how tokenization differences affect event extraction performance?

- Concept: Evaluation metric design
  - Why needed here: Standard metrics (Arg-I, Arg-C) don't assess whether arguments attach to correct triggers, leading to inflated scores
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between Arg-C and Arg-C+ in evaluating argument extraction?

- Concept: Benchmark completeness assessment
  - Why needed here: Limited dataset coverage and single data splits introduce domain and split bias, undermining generalization claims
  - Quick check question: How does using five data splits instead of one reduce evaluation bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model inference -> Evaluation engine -> Result aggregation
- Critical path: Preprocessing → Model inference → Evaluation → Result aggregation
- Design tradeoffs: Broader dataset coverage vs. preprocessing complexity; new metrics vs. compatibility with prior work
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent preprocessing outputs, metric calculation errors, model loading failures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run preprocessing on ACE05 and verify deterministic output across different environments
  2. Evaluate a simple classification model using both standard and attachment metrics
  3. Test LLM event detection with 2-shot prompting on a small dataset sample

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the evaluation framework for event extraction be further improved to reduce dataset bias and data split bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the issues of dataset bias and data split bias in the current evaluation pipeline and proposes solutions such as increasing dataset coverage and providing standard data splits
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes solutions, it does not provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these solutions in reducing bias. Further research is needed to validate the impact of these improvements
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing reduced bias and improved performance when using the proposed evaluation framework versus traditional methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in event extraction, and how can they be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores the capability of LLMs in event extraction and finds that they struggle with satisfactory performance due to the recognition of abstract concepts and relations
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the limitations but does not provide specific strategies or techniques to improve LLM performance in event extraction
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating improved LLM performance in event extraction through novel techniques or architectures designed to enhance abstract concept and relation recognition

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the reproducibility of event extraction research be further enhanced beyond the current TEXTEE framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of reproducibility and provides a standardized benchmark framework, TEXTEE, to address this issue
- Why unresolved: While TEXTEE is a significant step forward, there may be additional factors affecting reproducibility that are not addressed by the framework
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies identifying and addressing other factors influencing reproducibility, such as data preprocessing variations or model implementation details, in the context of event extraction

## Limitations

- Computational expense of running five splits per dataset may limit adoption for resource-constrained researchers
- New attachment-based metrics introduce complexity that could complicate direct comparisons with prior work
- LLM evaluations show particularly poor performance, suggesting either fundamental limitations in current LLMs or issues with prompting strategies

## Confidence

- Claim: TEXTEE provides fair comparisons through standardization | Confidence: Medium
- Claim: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in event extraction | Confidence: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate whether models performing well on ACE datasets maintain similar relative performance on MAVEN and WikiEvents to verify TEXTEE's claim of domain coverage sufficiency

2. **Split stability analysis**: Measure coefficient of variation across the five splits for each dataset to quantify whether TEXTEE's split standardization meaningfully reduces evaluation variance compared to single-split approaches

3. **Reproducibility verification**: Attempt to reproduce preprocessing results across different Python environments and hardware configurations to validate the claimed deterministic behavior of the TEXTEE framework
