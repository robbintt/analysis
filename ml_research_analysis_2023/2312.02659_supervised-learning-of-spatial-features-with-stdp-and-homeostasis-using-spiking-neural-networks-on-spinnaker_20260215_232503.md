# Supervised learning of spatial features with STDP and homeostasis using Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02659
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: SNN trained on SpiNNaker achieves 100% accuracy on single patterns, with accuracy dropping as pattern similarity (Hamming distance) increases.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to recognize spatial patterns using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and homeostasis. The approach encodes patterns as binary numbers and trains the network to identify these patterns on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware platform. Experiments demonstrate that the network can perfectly identify a single trained pattern, but accuracy decreases as the number of trained patterns increases, particularly when patterns have small Hamming distances between them. The method shows promise for applications requiring identification of static features in pattern recognition and network traffic analysis.

## Method Summary
The method trains SNNs to recognize spatial patterns by encoding them as binary numbers represented through simultaneous spikes. During training, STDP adjusts synaptic weights based on spike timing, with pre-synaptic spikes before post-synaptic spikes causing long-term potentiation and vice versa for depression. Homeostasis is then applied to rescale weights so the network fires exactly once for each learned pattern. The network architecture consists of spike injector populations that feed into an output neuron through plastic synapses. After training on individual patterns, the network is tested on all possible input combinations to evaluate recognition accuracy, with performance measured using classification metrics including accuracy, precision, and specificity.

## Key Results
- Network achieves 100% accuracy in identifying a single trained pattern
- Accuracy decreases as number of trained patterns increases, with performance linked to Hamming distance between patterns
- Homeostatic factor enables detection of patterns with some similarity rather than requiring exact matches
- Network demonstrates potential for pattern recognition applications where static features need identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: STDP and homeostasis can be combined to train SNNs for spatial pattern recognition.
- Mechanism: STDP adjusts synaptic weights based on spike timing, while homeostasis rescales weights to ensure exactly one spike for each learned pattern.
- Core assumption: The combination of STDP and homeostasis can effectively encode spatial patterns into synaptic weights.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states the method uses STDP and homeostasis for supervised learning; corpus supports homeostasis stabilizing STDP.
- Break condition: Network fails to fire exactly once for each learned pattern if homeostatic factor cannot be found.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Accuracy depends on Hamming distance between patterns.
- Mechanism: Synaptic weights are sums of weights from individual patterns; overlapping contributions from similar patterns make distinction harder.
- Core assumption: Hamming distance directly correlates with network's ability to distinguish patterns.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract links accuracy to pattern similarity measured by Hamming distance; section shows performance deterioration related to Hamming distance.
- Break condition: Network cannot distinguish patterns if Hamming distance is too small, leading to false positives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Network can detect patterns with some degree of similarity.
- Mechanism: Adjusting homeostatic factor allows network to respond to patterns similar to trained ones.
- Core assumption: Homeostatic factor can serve as similarity threshold.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract suggests homeostasis enables detection of similar patterns; section shows improved accuracy when dropping highly dissimilar patterns.
- Break condition: Network responds to many non-similar patterns if homeostatic factor is too high.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
  - Why needed here: Primary mechanism for adjusting synaptic weights based on spike timing
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in STDP?

- Concept: Homeostasis in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Stabilizes network response by rescaling synaptic weights
  - Quick check question: How does homeostasis prevent unbounded growth of synaptic weights in SNNs?

- Concept: Hamming distance
  - Why needed here: Measures similarity between patterns to understand accuracy degradation
  - Quick check question: How is Hamming distance calculated between two binary patterns of equal length?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Spike Injector Populations -> Plastic Synapses -> Output Neuron

- Critical path:
  1. Train network on single pattern using STDP
  2. Apply homeostasis to rescale weights
  3. Test network on all possible patterns
  4. Repeat for multiple patterns observing Hamming distance effects

- Design tradeoffs:
  - STDP enables local learning but requires homeostasis for stability
  - Homeostasis stabilizes network but may reduce sensitivity to pattern differences
  - Binary encoding simplifies learning but may not suit all data types

- Failure signatures:
  - Network fails to fire for learned pattern: incorrect weight scaling during homeostasis
  - Network fires for non-similar patterns: homeostatic factor set too high
  - Accuracy drops with multiple patterns: patterns too similar (small Hamming distance)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train on single pattern, verify exactly one spike for that pattern only
  2. Train on two patterns with large Hamming distance, verify accurate identification
  3. Train on two patterns with small Hamming distance, observe accuracy decrease

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the upper limits of pattern similarity that can be successfully learned?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper states accuracy links to pattern similarities and homeostasis may enable detection of similar patterns
- Why unresolved: No quantitative measures or thresholds provided for maximum allowable similarity
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying pattern similarity and measuring network accuracy

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do STDP parameter choices affect learning and recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions parameter values have little relevance but doesn't explore impact of different choices
- Why unresolved: No investigation of network performance sensitivity to STDP parameter variations
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with different STDP parameters comparing network performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can method extend to spatio-temporal patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper focuses on spatial patterns, mentions principles can build toward spatio-temporal systems
- Why unresolved: No exploration of method extension to handle temporal components
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified method tested on datasets containing spatio-temporal patterns

## Limitations
- Precise implementation details of STDP rule and homeostasis on SpiNNaker not fully specified
- Claims about recognizing similar patterns rely on assumptions about homeostatic factor role
- No exploration of network capacity limits or noise effects on accuracy
- Limited experimental validation and lack of comparison with alternative methods

## Confidence
- Core claims about STDP+homeostasis combination: Medium
- Claims about recognizing similar patterns: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate exact STDP and homeostasis implementation on SpiNNaker by reproducing single-pattern results
2. Explore network capacity limits and noise effects through systematic experiments
3. Compare proposed method with alternative pattern recognition approaches to assess relative performance
