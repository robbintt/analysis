# RealBehavior: A Framework for Faithfully Characterizing Foundation Models' Human-like Behavior Mechanisms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11227
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11227
- Reference count: 11
- RealBehavior is a framework that goes beyond mere measurement to assess the faithfulness of human-like behavior characterization in foundation models using four psychometric metrics.

## Executive Summary
RealBehavior is a framework that addresses the critical gap in foundation model evaluation by assessing not just whether models exhibit human-like behaviors, but whether those measurements are faithful and meaningful. The framework operationalizes psychometric reliability and validity principles through four metrics: reproducibility, internal consistency, external consistency, and generalizability. When applied to personality assessment using the Big-Five traits, the framework reveals that simple psychological tests cannot faithfully characterize all human-like behaviors, with agreeableness and conscientiousness showing higher faithfulness than other dimensions. The study also demonstrates that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) creates systematic biases in personality scores, particularly increasing agreeableness and conscientiousness in ways that may limit model diversity.

## Method Summary
RealBehavior is a two-stage framework for characterizing foundation models' human-like behaviors. First, it measures personality using established psychological scales (BFM and NEO) through a zero-shot approach with carefully designed prompts. Second, it evaluates the faithfulness of these measurements using four psychometric metrics: test-retest consistency (reproducibility), Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency), cross-validation between scales (external consistency), and behavioral consistency on daily life occasions (generalizability). The framework generates pseudo behavior descriptions for daily life scenarios, trains personality tendency classifiers, and tests whether models' responses to these scenarios align with their personality test scores.

## Key Results
- RealBehavior framework successfully operationalizes psychometric reliability and validity metrics for foundation model evaluation
- Personality scores show systematic biases across GPT model versions, with agreeableness and conscientiousness increasing most dramatically
- Behavioral consistency scores vary significantly across personality dimensions, with agreeableness (0.20) and conscientiousness (0.22) showing higher faithfulness than other traits
- RLHF alignment objectives focusing on harmlessness create predictable personality biases that may limit model diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RealBehavior framework improves faithfulness of human-like behavior characterization by applying psychometric reliability and validity metrics
- Mechanism: The framework operationalizes four psychometric principles—reproducibility, internal consistency, external consistency, and generalizability—to assess whether psychological test results applied to models are trustworthy and align with intended measurement purposes
- Core assumption: Psychometric theories developed for human assessment remain valid when adapted to evaluate model-generated behaviors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our framework assesses the faithfulness of results based on reproducibility, internal and external consistency, and generalizability"
  - [section 4.1] Formal definitions of Test-Retest Consistency (T rC), Internal Consistency (InC), External Consistency (ExC), and Behavioral Consistency (BC)
  - [corpus] Weak: only 1 neighbor paper explicitly addresses psychometric evaluation of LLMs; most focus on jailbreaking or affective cognition without methodological rigor
- Break condition: If the model's internal processing fundamentally differs from human cognitive processes, psychometric metrics may not capture meaningful behavioral consistency

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Occasion-based behavior tests enable assessment of personality trait generalizability across different interaction contexts
- Mechanism: The framework generates pseudo behavior descriptions for daily life occasions, trains classifiers to identify personality tendencies, then evaluates whether model-generated behaviors under these occasions align with their personality test scores
- Core assumption: Personality traits should manifest consistently across different behavioral contexts, and models can simulate human-like responses to these contexts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] Detailed methodology for generating occasion-based test data and training classifiers
  - [section 4.4] Results showing behavioral consistency scores (BC) for different personality dimensions
  - [corpus] Moderate: "Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models" explores similar evaluation frameworks but with different focus
- Break condition: If the model's responses to occasion-based prompts are heavily influenced by prompt engineering rather than underlying personality mechanisms

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RLHF alignment objectives systematically bias model personality scores toward specific dimensions, creating predictable imbalances
- Mechanism: The framework correlates model evolution (text-davinci-001 → 002 → 003) with increasing personality scores, particularly in agreeableness and conscientiousness, and links this to RLHF's emphasis on harmlessness
- Core assumption: RLHF training objectives that prioritize harmlessness and helpfulness create systematic biases in personality manifestation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] Analysis linking RLHF alignment goals to personality dimension scores and discussing implications for model diversity
  - [section 3.3] Evidence of increasing scores across model versions with specific emphasis on agreeableness and conscientiousness
  - [corpus] Weak: limited direct evidence in corpus about RLHF's impact on personality; mostly general alignment discussions
- Break condition: If future RLHF implementations diversify their objectives beyond harmlessness and helpfulness, the observed personality biases may diminish

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Psychometric reliability theory
  - Why needed here: To assess whether personality scores from models are consistent across repeated measurements and within test items
  - Quick check question: What does a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.96 indicate about internal consistency?

- Concept: Psychometric validity theory
  - Why needed here: To determine whether psychological tests actually measure the personality dimensions they claim to measure in models
  - Quick check question: How does convergent validity help assess whether different personality tests yield similar results for the same model?

- Concept: Cross-validation between measurement tools
  - Why needed here: To ensure that personality scores are not artifacts of specific test instruments but reflect genuine behavioral tendencies
  - Quick check question: Why compare BFM and NEO scale results when assessing model personality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Measurement module (psychological tests) -> Evaluation module (four faithfulness metrics) -> Analysis module (comparison with human benchmarks and RLHF investigation)
- Critical path: Measure personality → Assess faithfulness via four metrics → Compare with human norms → Analyze RLHF impact
- Design tradeoffs: Using established psychological tests provides interpretability but may introduce biases from training data overlap; automated occasion-based testing enables scalability but relies on model simulation capabilities
- Failure signatures: Low test-retest consistency suggests unstable personality expression; poor external consistency indicates instrument-specific artifacts; low behavioral consistency suggests personality doesn't generalize across contexts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Big-Five personality tests on a new foundation model using both BFM and NEO scales, record raw scores
  2. Assess test-retest consistency by running each test multiple times with different sampling temperatures
  3. Train occasion-based behavior classifiers and evaluate model behaviors under generated daily life scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the faithfulness metrics vary across different types of human-like behaviors beyond personality traits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on personality traits but acknowledges limitations in generalizing to other behaviors
- Why unresolved: The study only tested personality traits, leaving other behaviors unexamined
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply the RealBehavior framework to other human-like behaviors (e.g., theory of mind, decision-making) and compare faithfulness metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the long-term stability of personality scores in foundation models across different versions and fine-tuning approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows personality scores increase as models evolve but doesn't examine long-term stability
- Why unresolved: The study only examined three model versions without considering long-term consistency
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct longitudinal studies tracking personality scores across multiple model versions and fine-tuning approaches over time

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different alignment objectives (beyond helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty) impact the faithfulness of personality characterization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests diversifying alignment objectives but doesn't test specific alternatives
- Why unresolved: The study only discusses theoretical implications without empirical testing of different alignment objectives
- What evidence would resolve it: Design and test models with varied alignment objectives and measure their impact on personality characterization faithfulness

## Limitations

- The framework validation is limited to a single model family (GPT series), raising questions about generalizability to other architectures
- Potential training data contamination from personality test items is not adequately addressed
- The causal relationship between RLHF objectives and personality score biases relies on correlation rather than controlled experiments

## Confidence

- Framework Validity (High): The four-metric approach to assessing faithfulness is well-grounded in psychometric theory and provides clear, measurable criteria for evaluation
- RLHF Personality Bias (Medium): Evidence shows correlation between model evolution and personality scores, but causal mechanisms require further investigation
- Limited Faithfulness (High): The results demonstrating that simple personality tests cannot faithfully characterize all human-like behaviors are robust and well-supported by the data

## Next Checks

1. Apply the RealBehavior framework to diverse model architectures (not just GPT series) including open-weight models like Llama, Mistral, and Claude to test generalizability of findings

2. Design controlled experiments where RLHF training is applied with varying emphasis on different alignment objectives (not just harmlessness) to establish causal relationships between training objectives and personality manifestation

3. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of training data overlap with personality assessment instruments to quantify the potential impact of memorization on test results
