# Foundation Models Meet Visualizations: Challenges and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05771
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05771
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of two emerging research areas at the intersection of foundation models and visualization—visualizations for foundation models (VIS4FM) and foundation models for visualizations (FM4VIS)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic survey of the intersection between foundation models and visualization techniques, identifying two complementary research directions. The authors explore how visualizations can help humans understand, refine, and evaluate complex foundation models (VIS4FM), while also examining how foundation models can advance visualization techniques and systems (FM4VIS). By mapping out current capabilities and identifying underexplored research opportunities, the paper provides a roadmap for future work in this promising interdisciplinary field. The survey covers 40 references and organizes the landscape into actionable research directions spanning data curation, model training, adaptation steering, and evaluation.

## Method Summary
This survey paper synthesizes existing literature on the intersection of foundation models and visualization techniques. Rather than presenting original empirical results, the authors systematically review current approaches in two main areas: visualizations that help humans understand and work with foundation models (VIS4FM), and foundation models that enhance visualization generation and analysis (FM4VIS). The paper identifies research opportunities by analyzing gaps in current methodologies, focusing on underexplored areas such as data curation for model training, diagnosis of training processes, adaptation steering through interactive visualizations, and comprehensive model evaluation frameworks. The methodology involves categorizing existing approaches, identifying patterns and limitations, and proposing future research directions based on these observations.

## Key Results
- Identifies two main research areas: visualizations for foundation models (VIS4FM) and foundation models for visualizations (FM4VIS)
- Highlights underexplored opportunities including data curation, training diagnosis, adaptation steering, and model evaluation in VIS4FM
- Outlines research directions for FM4VIS including feature extraction, visualization generation, and active engagement
- Provides comprehensive mapping of current capabilities and future research directions at the foundation model-visualization intersection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visualization serves as an interactive bridge between humans and complex foundation models, enabling transparency, explainability, fairness, and robustness.
- Mechanism: By mapping high-dimensional model states (activations, gradients, attention maps) into visual representations, users can intuitively inspect and reason about model behavior without requiring deep technical expertise.
- Core assumption: Visual representations can preserve the essential semantics of model internals while being cognitively accessible to non-experts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "visualization techniques [are] a critical bridge to human comprehension of complex models [9–15]"
  - [section 3.2] "Visualization techniques provide an interactive and intuitive environment to streamline the performance diagnosis process"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct corpus mention of visualization–model interpretability link
- Break Condition: If the visual abstraction introduces too much information loss or misinterpretation, user trust and understanding degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Foundation models can automatically generate high-quality visualization content (e.g., layouts, annotations, interactions) by learning from large-scale multimodal data.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models extract semantic features from raw data and map them into visual primitives, styles, and interaction patterns using code generation or direct synthesis.
- Core assumption: The semantic richness captured by foundation models generalizes well to visualization design tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "Foundation models have been utilized to facilitate the visualization generation process by either directly generating visualization content (e.g., visualization type, data encoding, annotations) [63, 64] or generating visualization styles (e.g., color scheme, layout style, typography) [65]"
  - [section 5.2.2] "Large language models, as widely studied foundation models, have shown the capabilities of generating source code given natural language prompts"
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus evidence of code-generation for visualization beyond basic prompts
- Break Condition: If the generated code does not adhere to best practices or if the visual semantics are misaligned, the quality and usability of the visualization suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive visualizations enable iterative steering of foundation models during fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and alignment via human feedback.
- Mechanism: Users provide feedback through visual interfaces (e.g., selecting problematic samples, rating outputs), which is then used to refine datasets, prompts, or model parameters.
- Core assumption: Human feedback, when visualized and integrated effectively, improves model adaptation more than automated methods alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Visualizations serve two functions: they either aid in collecting human feedback to improve training data or offer an interactive platform to iteratively refine the model outputs"
  - [section 5.1.3] "Interactive visualizations have already demonstrated their value in enhancing the process of collecting human feedback"
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus evidence of interactive human feedback loops for model adaptation
- Break Condition: If feedback collection is too slow or noisy, the adaptation process becomes inefficient or ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature extraction from unstructured data using foundation models
  - Why needed here: Enables rich semantic inputs for visualization pipelines that traditional methods cannot capture
  - Quick check question: How do foundation models differ from traditional feature extractors when handling text or images?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in transformers
  - Why needed here: Central to interpreting model behavior and designing explanations in VIS4FM
  - Quick check question: What information does an attention head encode and how can it be visualized?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: Critical for adapting foundation models to visualization tasks without retraining
  - Quick check question: What makes a prompt effective and how can its impact be evaluated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data curation → Model training → Adaptation steering → Evaluation (VIS4FM); Feature extraction → Visualization generation → Understanding → Active engagement (FM4VIS)
- Critical path: In VIS4FM, the critical path is training diagnosis → adaptation steering → evaluation; in FM4VIS, it is feature extraction → visualization generation → user interaction
- Design tradeoffs: Between interpretability and complexity in VIS4FM; between automation and user control in FM4VIS
- Failure signatures: In VIS4FM, misleading visualizations or scalability bottlenecks; in FM4VIS, low-quality generated content or poor interaction relevance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple attention visualization for a pre-trained BERT model on a text classification task.
  2. Generate a basic bar chart from a table using a code-generation prompt in GPT-3.5.
  3. Create an interactive feedback loop for a classification model where users can correct misclassified samples and see the effect on the model's decision boundary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can visualizations be effectively used to detect and correct shortcuts in foundation model training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that data correction involves addressing spurious correlations (shortcuts) between inputs and outputs in training datasets.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the existence of shortcuts and the need for data correction, it doesn't provide specific visualization techniques or methods for detecting and correcting these shortcuts in the context of foundation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of visualization techniques specifically designed to identify and correct shortcuts in foundation model training data, with demonstrated effectiveness in improving model performance and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can visualizations be used to monitor and understand the behavior changes that occur during the fine-tuning of foundation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need to understand how generic knowledge evolves into task-specific knowledge during fine-tuning and how visualizations can help analyze these behavior changes.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the importance of monitoring behavior changes during fine-tuning, it doesn't provide specific visualization methods or techniques for this purpose.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of visualization tools that can effectively track and display the changes in model behavior during fine-tuning, with validation through user studies showing improved understanding and decision-making by model developers.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can visualizations be used to evaluate the robustness of foundation models to input perturbations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the importance of evaluating model robustness and suggests using visualizations to compare model responses to perturbed inputs.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for robustness evaluation but doesn't provide specific visualization methods or techniques for this purpose.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of visualization techniques that can effectively display the impact of input perturbations on model outputs, with demonstrated ability to identify weaknesses and guide model improvement.

## Limitations
- Claims primarily based on literature survey rather than empirical validation, limiting strength of evidence
- Does not address computational costs or scalability challenges of applying foundation models to visualization tasks
- Assumed alignment between human visual perception and model-generated visualizations remains theoretical without user studies
- Limited empirical data demonstrating effectiveness of VIS4FM and FM4VIS approaches in practice

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general categorization of research areas (VIS4FM and FM4VIS) and the identification of broad research opportunities are well-supported by existing literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed mechanisms linking foundation models to visualization capabilities are theoretically sound but lack comprehensive empirical validation.
- **Low confidence**: Specific quantitative claims about the superiority or effectiveness of VIS4FM/FM4VIS approaches compared to traditional methods are not supported by experimental evidence in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled user study comparing the interpretability of model behaviors using traditional visualization techniques versus VIS4FM approaches, measuring both accuracy of understanding and time to insight.

2. Implement and benchmark a specific FM4VIS application (e.g., automatic chart generation from text descriptions) against established visualization generation tools, measuring output quality, code correctness, and user satisfaction.

3. Evaluate scalability and performance by applying foundation models to visualization tasks on progressively larger datasets, documenting computational requirements, latency, and any degradation in output quality.
