# An Intent Taxonomy of Legal Case Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.13298
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13298
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents a novel hierarchical intent taxonomy for legal case retrieval that improves satisfaction prediction and ranking performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical intent taxonomy for legal case retrieval, categorizing search intents into five types: Search for Particular Case(s), Characterization, Penalty, Procedure, and Interest. The taxonomy was developed through interviews, editorial user studies, and query log analysis. A laboratory user study revealed significant differences in user behavior and satisfaction across intents, with users spending more time examining case documents for learning tasks and being least satisfied with results for procedural tasks. The intent taxonomy was successfully applied to improve satisfaction prediction accuracy and result ranking performance in legal case retrieval systems.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a hierarchical intent taxonomy through a multi-stage process including literature review, user surveys, query log analysis, interviews with legal practitioners, and editorial user studies. They then conducted a laboratory user study with controlled search tasks to collect behavioral data and satisfaction feedback. The taxonomy was applied to downstream tasks including satisfaction prediction and result ranking, where intent-aware models outperformed intent-agnostic baselines. The research used data from a commercial legal case search engine and focused on English-language legal systems.

## Key Results
- Hierarchical intent taxonomy successfully categorized legal search queries into five distinct types
- User behavior and satisfaction significantly differed across intent categories
- Intent-aware models improved satisfaction prediction accuracy and result ranking performance
- Users spent more time examining case documents for learning tasks compared to other intents
- Users were least satisfied with results for procedural tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The hierarchical intent taxonomy improves downstream task performance by explicitly modeling user search intent in legal case retrieval.
- Mechanism: By categorizing search intents into five distinct types and applying them to tasks like satisfaction prediction and ranking, the system can tailor relevance criteria and ranking strategies to match user expectations for each intent type.
- Core assumption: User satisfaction and search behavior differ significantly across these intent categories, and capturing this variation improves model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We apply the proposed taxonomy to various downstream legal retrieval tasks, e.g., result ranking and satisfaction prediction, and demonstrate its effectiveness."
  - [section 6] "integrating search intents into ranking improves the performance of existing intent-agnostic ranking algorithms in legal case retrieval."
  - [corpus] "Average neighbor FMR=0.433, average citations=0.0" (weak evidence for related work)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different search intents require different relevance criteria and result presentation strategies.
- Mechanism: The taxonomy identifies that users searching for Particular Cases prioritize precision and recall for specific documents, while Learning tasks emphasize diversity, authority, and timeliness of case content. This allows systems to adjust ranking algorithms and result presentation accordingly.
- Core assumption: The five intent categories represent meaningfully different information needs with distinct relevance criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3.1] "Users pay attention to different factors beyond relevance (e.g., diversity, region, inspiration, ranking, etc.) given different search intents."
  - [section 3] "According to Criterion 1, users would have strong needs for both precision and recall under the PC intent. The potential relevant cases might be definite and of a limited size."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers" (limited evidence for this specific mechanism)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit modeling of search intent improves satisfaction prediction accuracy by providing context for interpreting behavioral signals.
- Mechanism: The intent taxonomy allows satisfaction prediction models to interpret behavioral signals (clicks, dwell time, hover patterns) differently based on what type of task the user is performing, leading to more accurate predictions.
- Core assumption: The same behavioral signals have different meanings under different search intents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1.3] "the intent-aware model performs better than the intent-agnostic model most of the time, given different features."
  - [section 5.3.2] "online metrics demonstrate varying performances when used as indicators of user satisfaction. Given the diversity of search intents, it is essential to reconsider the extent to which a metric can accurately reflect user satisfaction."
  - [corpus] "Top related titles: Rules, Resources, and Restrictions: A Taxonomy of Task-Based Information Request Intents" (weak evidence)

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical classification systems
  - Why needed here: The taxonomy uses a three-level hierarchical structure (Criterion 1, Criterion 2, Criterion 3) to organize search intents, which requires understanding how to build and validate multi-level classification systems.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the three criteria work together to create the five final intent categories?

- Concept: User behavior analysis in information retrieval
  - Why needed here: The paper analyzes click patterns, hover behavior, and dwell time across different search intents, requiring understanding of how to collect and interpret these behavioral metrics.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in user behavior between the Particular Case(s) and Learning intent categories according to the study?

- Concept: Legal information retrieval domain characteristics
  - Why needed here: Legal case retrieval has unique characteristics (longer documents, specialized terminology, different relevance criteria) that affect how taxonomies and retrieval systems should be designed.
  - Quick check question: How does legal case retrieval differ from general web search in terms of user behavior and document characteristics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User query -> Intent classification -> Intent-aware ranking -> Result presentation -> Behavioral logging -> Satisfaction prediction -> System optimization
- Critical path: User query → Intent classification → Intent-aware ranking → Result presentation → Behavioral logging → Satisfaction prediction → System optimization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. usability: More detailed intent categories provide better modeling but may be harder to annotate and apply
  - Behavioral signal richness vs. noise: Collecting more behavioral data improves modeling but increases complexity and potential for noisy signals
  - Intent-aware vs. generic approaches: Intent-aware systems perform better but require maintaining separate models for each intent
- Failure signatures:
  - Low inter-annotator agreement on intent classification suggests taxonomy is not clearly defined
  - Satisfaction prediction performance similar with/without intent information indicates taxonomy adds no value
  - Ranking improvements only on certain metrics suggests intent modeling may be overfitting to specific evaluation criteria
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test intent classification agreement by having multiple annotators label the same set of user queries and measure inter-annotator reliability
  2. Compare satisfaction prediction performance with intent features removed to assess their contribution to model accuracy
  3. Implement A/B testing where one group sees intent-aware rankings and another sees generic rankings to measure real-world impact on user satisfaction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the intent taxonomy be adapted and validated for legal systems beyond the Chinese legal system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the taxonomy was primarily developed and validated within the Chinese legal system, but suggests it can inspire similar taxonomies in other legal systems.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete steps or evidence for adapting the taxonomy to other legal systems. It remains unclear how the underlying principles and categorization framework can be applied and validated in different jurisdictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating a similar intent taxonomy for another legal system, such as the US or UK, and demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding user intents and improving legal case retrieval performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal strategies for handling multi-intent queries in legal case retrieval?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that approximately 10% of search tasks involve multiple intents and suggests that retrieval methods explicitly recognizing multi-intent queries are needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose or evaluate specific strategies for handling multi-intent queries. It remains unclear how to effectively model and satisfy users' information needs when multiple intents are present.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing algorithms that can accurately identify and handle multi-intent queries in legal case retrieval, and demonstrating improvements in user satisfaction and retrieval performance compared to single-intent approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the intent taxonomy be leveraged to improve the evaluation and optimization of legal case retrieval systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the intent taxonomy in improving satisfaction prediction and result ranking tasks. It suggests that optimization and evaluation methodologies should be adapted to different search intents.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive framework for incorporating the intent taxonomy into the evaluation and optimization process of legal case retrieval systems. It remains unclear how to effectively use the taxonomy to guide the development of intent-aware ranking strategies, evaluation metrics, and system design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic study that integrates the intent taxonomy into the entire lifecycle of legal case retrieval system development, from data collection and annotation to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Demonstrating improvements in system performance and user satisfaction across different intent categories.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy's generalizability beyond legal case retrieval remains untested, though related work suggests broader applicability
- Limited behavioral data (only 2-3 sessions per user) may constrain the robustness of observed patterns
- The study focuses on English-language legal systems, potentially limiting applicability to other jurisdictions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The hierarchical structure of the taxonomy and its application to satisfaction prediction (supported by significant behavioral differences across intent categories)
- **Medium confidence**: The taxonomy's effectiveness in ranking improvements (shown in experiments but with room for further validation)
- **Low confidence**: The taxonomy's performance in real-world deployment scenarios (laboratory study results may not fully translate to production environments)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Apply the taxonomy structure to non-legal retrieval tasks to test generalizability of the hierarchical intent classification approach
2. **Longitudinal study**: Track user behavior across extended search sessions to validate whether observed patterns hold over time
3. **A/B testing in production**: Deploy intent-aware ranking in a live legal search system to measure real-world impact on user satisfaction metrics beyond controlled laboratory conditions
