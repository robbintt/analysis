# HeLM: Highlighted Evidence augmented Language Model for Enhanced Table-to-Text Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08896
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: State-of-the-art BLEU scores of 34.18 (FetaQA) and 25.0 (QTSumm) using evidence highlighting in table-to-text generation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HeLM, a novel table-to-text generation approach that enhances LLaMA2 through evidence highlighting. The method employs a two-module architecture consisting of a table reasoner that identifies relevant row evidence and a table summarizer that generates text based on highlighted tables. By constructing reasoning labels through greedy search and using parameter-efficient QLoRA fine-tuning, HeLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both FetaQA and QTSumm datasets. The approach demonstrates that highlighting relevant table rows significantly improves model performance while providing valuable interpretability through evidence tracing.

## Method Summary
HELMs approach involves fine-tuning LLaMA2 with a focus on highlighting table-specific row data. The method consists of two modules: a table reasoner that identifies relevant row evidence and outputs index lists, and a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the highlighted table. Training labels for the reasoner are constructed using a greedy search strategy that iteratively selects rows maximizing summarizer reward. The entire model is fine-tuned using QLoRA with LoRA adapters (r=16, α=32) to enable efficient parameter updates while preserving general language capabilities. Tables are flattened and queries are processed to generate highlighted evidence that guides the summarizer.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art BLEU score of 34.18 on FetaQA dataset
- Achieves state-of-the-art BLEU score of 25.0 on QTSumm dataset
- Demonstrates superior performance over existing methods through evidence highlighting
- Shows significant improvements in both precision and interpretability metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Table reasoner identifies salient rows by generating index lists, enabling focused attention in the summarizer.
- Mechanism: The reasoner receives a flattened table and query, outputs a list of row indices E, and the summarizer processes only highlighted cells. This reduces irrelevant context and directs model capacity to evidence.
- Core assumption: The quality of evidence indices directly improves summarizer performance; highlighting is better than full-table input.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Greedy search constructs training labels for the reasoner by iteratively selecting rows that maximize summarizer reward.
- Mechanism: Start with single-row evidence sets, rank by summarizer output quality, then greedily add rows that improve reward. This yields a near-optimal evidence subset without full 2^n search.
- Core assumption: Summarizer reward correlates with true evidence quality; greedy addition preserves most of the optimal subset.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parameter-efficient QLoRA fine-tuning of LLaMA2 preserves model generalization while adapting to table reasoning.
- Mechanism: Add LoRA adapters to all linear layers with r=16, α=32, and 4-bit quantization. This reduces trainable parameters and memory, enabling efficient fine-tuning on both reasoner and summarizer.
- Core assumption: LoRA adapters capture task-specific patterns without catastrophic forgetting of general language knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Table reasoning as row evidence selection
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to isolate relevant data from large tables, improving focus and interpretability.
  - Quick check question: How does the model decide which rows to highlight without ground-truth labels?

- Concept: Greedy search optimization
  - Why needed here: Provides a tractable method to construct training labels when exhaustive search is infeasible.
  - Quick check question: Why does the algorithm start with single-row evidence sets rather than the empty set?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: Allows adaptation of large LLaMA2 models within limited GPU memory while preserving general capabilities.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the α scaling factor in LoRA adapters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Table T, Query Q → Table Reasoner MR → Indices E → Highlight T* → Table Summarizer MS → Output Y
- Critical path: MR(Prompt(T, Q)) → E → HL(T, E) → MS(Prompt(T*, Q)) → Y
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Two-stage vs. end-to-end: Two-stage offers interpretability but requires evidence label construction.
  - Highlighting vs. sub-table input: Highlighting preserves full table context; sub-tables may lose global signals.
  - Greedy search vs. learned reasoner: Greedy is deterministic and label-efficient; learned reasoner generalizes better.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low BLEU despite high reasoner accuracy → summarizer overfits to highlighted rows.
  - Reasoner outputs empty E → no evidence highlighted, summarizer defaults to general language.
  - Training instability → learning rate or LoRA rank mismatch.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run reasoner inference on validation set, check distribution of E lengths and overlap with ground-truth evidence.
  2. Ablation: MS with/without highlighting, measure BLEU drop.
  3. Stress test: Increase table size, observe reasoner latency and summarizer BLEU degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of the table reasoner change when using different search strategies for label construction, beyond the greedy approach?
  - Basis in paper: The authors mention that there is significant room for improvement in the greedy search labels generated by the table reasoner and suggest exploring reinforcement learning strategies.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only implements a greedy search algorithm for label construction and does not compare it with other search strategies or reinforcement learning approaches.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of the table reasoner using various search strategies, including reinforcement learning, against the greedy approach.

- Question: What is the impact of table highlighting on the interpretability of the model's outputs, and how can this be quantified?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state that highlighting input tables significantly enhances the model's performance and provides valuable interpretability, but do not provide a quantitative measure of this interpretability.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not define or measure interpretability, leaving it unclear how highlighting contributes to understanding the model's reasoning process.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study that quantifies interpretability through metrics such as the clarity of the reasoning process, the ability to trace the model's decision to specific table entries, or user studies assessing the ease of understanding the model's outputs.

- Question: Can the table reasoner and table summarizer modules be trained jointly to improve performance and reduce the need for separate training?
  - Basis in paper: The paper describes the two modules as separate components, but does not explore the possibility of joint training or end-to-end learning.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the sequential use of the table reasoner and table summarizer, without investigating whether joint training could lead to better performance or efficiency.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of the current sequential approach with a jointly trained model, including training time, resource usage, and output quality.

## Limitations
- Performance gap between greedy search and GPT-based labels (7.6 vs 34.2 BLEU) suggests room for improvement in label construction
- Model's effectiveness primarily validated on two datasets, limiting generalizability claims
- Computational overhead of two-stage fine-tuning and highlighted input dependency may pose deployment challenges

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism of using evidence highlighting to improve table-to-text generation is well-supported by empirical results, with consistent BLEU score improvements across both datasets.
- Medium confidence: The greedy search algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated, but the relatively large performance gap with GPT-based labels suggests the approach may not be optimal for all table types.
- Medium confidence: QLoRA fine-tuning is shown to work effectively, though the specific hyperparameters' optimality is not thoroughly explored.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a detailed ablation study comparing different label construction methods (greedy search, GPT-based, random) across tables of varying complexity to understand when each approach succeeds or fails.

2. Test the model's generalization by evaluating on additional table-to-text datasets not used in training, measuring performance degradation and identifying potential overfitting to FetaQA/QTSumm patterns.

3. Analyze the computational efficiency trade-off by measuring inference latency with and without the two-stage pipeline, and assess whether the performance gains justify the additional complexity in real-world applications.
