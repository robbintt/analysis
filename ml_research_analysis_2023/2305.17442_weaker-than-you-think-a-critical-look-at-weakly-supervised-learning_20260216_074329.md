# Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.17442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17442
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Simple fine-tuning baselines often outperform sophisticated weakly supervised learning methods when clean validation data is available

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines the effectiveness of weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches in NLP, finding that existing methods heavily rely on clean validation data for model selection. The authors demonstrate that simply fine-tuning on clean validation samples often matches or exceeds the performance of sophisticated WSL techniques. Even when WSL models are allowed to train on clean validation data, they struggle to surpass basic fine-tuning baselines. The study suggests that WSL approaches may be overestimating their practical benefits and recommends future work to fully leverage available clean samples while including simple baselines for fair comparison.

## Method Summary
The authors implement five WSL methods (FT, L2R, MLC, BOND, COSINE) using RoBERTa-base and compare them against fine-tuning baselines on eight NLP datasets from the WRENCH benchmark. They conduct experiments varying the amount of clean validation data available for model selection and training, measuring test set performance (accuracy/F1) relative to weak labels. The study also introduces a continuous fine-tuning approach (CFT) that combines clean and weak labels during training, testing different agreement ratios between the two label sources.

## Key Results
- Simple fine-tuning baselines match or exceed sophisticated WSL methods when clean validation data is available
- WSL methods heavily depend on clean validation data for model selection, limiting their practical applicability
- The amount of clean validation data needed to outperform WSL methods is surprisingly small (often just 10-50 samples per class)
- Pre-trained models' linguistic knowledge helps them resist weak label biases, making simple fine-tuning effective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Weakly supervised learning methods underperform when given clean validation data because they rely heavily on clean data for model selection rather than learning robust patterns from weak labels. WSL methods use clean validation data primarily for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping, which masks their inability to learn effectively from noisy weak labels alone. When given clean training data, simple fine-tuning outperforms these methods because the model directly learns from high-quality examples. The model's ability to generalize is more dependent on the quality of training data than on sophisticated noise-handling techniques when clean data is available.

### Mechanism 2
Pre-trained language models contain linguistic knowledge that helps them resist biases from weak labels, making simple fine-tuning effective. Large pre-trained models have learned general linguistic patterns during pre-training. When fine-tuned on weak labels, these models initially rely on this general knowledge rather than fitting to the noisy weak labels, allowing them to generalize better than the weak labels themselves. Pre-training on large corpora provides models with sufficient linguistic priors to resist overfitting to weak supervision noise.

### Mechanism 3
The agreement ratio between clean and weak labels determines the effectiveness of combining both data sources for training. When clean labels agree with weak labels, they reinforce the weak label's bias. When they disagree, they provide contradictory examples that help the model learn to distinguish between reliable and unreliable signals. Contradictory examples are necessary for the model to learn which features are actually predictive versus which are artifacts of the weak supervision process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Label noise in weakly supervised learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how noisy labels affect model training is fundamental to evaluating WSL methods and their limitations
  - Quick check question: What happens when a model is trained on data where 30% of the labels are incorrect?

- Concept: Model selection and validation strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper shows that WSL methods rely heavily on clean validation data for model selection, which is unrealistic in low-resource settings
  - Quick check question: Why might using weakly labeled data for validation be less effective than using clean validation data?

- Concept: Pre-trained language model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that standard fine-tuning on clean data often outperforms sophisticated WSL methods, highlighting the importance of understanding PLM fine-tuning behavior
  - Quick check question: How does the amount of pre-training data affect a model's ability to resist overfitting to noisy labels?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WRENCH datasets -> weak labeling functions -> weak labels and clean validation splits -> WSL methods (L2R, MLC, BOND, COSINE) or fine-tuning baselines (FTW, adapters, LoRA, BitFit) -> RoBERTa-base model -> test set evaluation
- Critical path: Weak labeling functions generate noisy labels from raw text -> WSL methods or fine-tuning approaches train models using weak labels and optionally clean validation data -> model selection occurs using clean validation sets -> final evaluation on clean test sets
- Design tradeoffs: Using clean data for training vs. validation (immediate performance vs. model selection capability), computational cost of sophisticated WSL methods vs. simple fine-tuning, and the amount of clean data needed to outperform WSL methods
- Failure signatures: WSL methods failing to outperform weak labels when no clean validation data is available for model selection, performance plateaus when clean validation data exceeds certain thresholds, and simple fine-tuning outperforming WSL methods when sufficient clean data is available
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare FTW vs. COSINE on AGNews with 10 clean samples per class to verify that simple fine-tuning can match sophisticated WSL methods
  2. Test different agreement ratios (0%, 50%, 70%, 100%) on IMDb to confirm that contradictory examples improve performance
  3. Evaluate RoBERTa-small-1M vs. RoBERTa-base-10M on TREC to demonstrate how pre-training corpus size affects resistance to weak label bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How do WSL approaches perform when weak labels are generated by more sophisticated methods like large language models rather than simple heuristic rules? The paper acknowledges its limitation of using only weak labels from simple rules like regular expressions, while noting that other methods like using large language models or hyperlink information as weak labels exist but were not explored.

- What is the optimal agreement ratio between clean and weak labels for CFT to maximize performance, and does this vary by dataset or task type? While the paper identifies that contradictory samples help combat bias, it only tests a limited range of agreement ratios and doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of optimal values across different tasks.

- How do WSL approaches perform on low-resource languages without strong pre-trained language models available? The paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation, noting that their experiments concentrate on English tasks where strong PLMs are available, and that training may not be as effective for low-resource languages without PLMs.

## Limitations

- The evaluation focuses on synthetic weak labels rather than real-world weak supervision sources, potentially underestimating the benefits of WSL in practical applications where clean labels are prohibitively expensive to obtain.

- The study's core claims depend on the specific choice of weak labeling functions and dataset splits, which may not generalize to all WSL scenarios.

- The paper doesn't extend its analysis beyond English, leaving open questions about WSL effectiveness in truly low-resource settings where neither strong PLMs nor large amounts of clean data are available.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Simple fine-tuning baselines can match or exceed sophisticated WSL methods when clean validation data is available
- **Medium confidence**: Pre-trained models' inherent linguistic knowledge helps them resist weak label biases
- **Medium confidence**: The agreement ratio between clean and weak labels significantly impacts combined training performance

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed mechanisms on real-world weak supervision sources (e.g., Snorkel labels from heuristics or distant supervision) rather than synthetic labels to assess practical applicability.

2. Measure how WSL method performance scales with increasing pre-training corpus size to better understand the relationship between pre-training and weak label resistance.

3. Evaluate whether combining contradictory clean and weak examples during training improves WSL method performance when clean validation data is unavailable, addressing the practical limitation of relying on clean validation sets.
