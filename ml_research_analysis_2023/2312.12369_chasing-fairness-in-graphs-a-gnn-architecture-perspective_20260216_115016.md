# Chasing Fairness in Graphs: A GNN Architecture Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12369
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Proposes Fair Message Passing (FMP), a GNN architecture that improves fairness-accuracy tradeoff by explicitly incorporating sensitive attributes during message passing

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by proposing Fair Message Passing (FMP), a novel architecture that explicitly uses sensitive attribute information during the forward propagation phase. The method is designed within a unified optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes for graph smoothness and fairness, achieving better fairness-accuracy tradeoffs compared to existing approaches. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FMP outperforms several baselines in terms of both fairness metrics (demographic parity and equal opportunity) and accuracy.

## Method Summary
FMP is a GNN architecture that incorporates sensitive attribute information during message passing through a three-step process: feature transformation via MLP, neighbor aggregation, and a debiasing step that pushes representation centers of different demographic groups together. The method uses a unified optimization framework with smoothness and fairness objectives, solved via Fenchel conjugate and gradient descent. The approach provides transparent usage of sensitive attributes during forward propagation, distinguishing it from methods that encode this information in model parameters.

## Key Results
- FMP achieves better fairness-accuracy tradeoff compared to multiple baseline GNN models
- The method explicitly pushes representation centers of different demographic groups together during message passing
- FMP provides white-box usage of sensitive attributes, making it more transparent than existing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FMP reduces bias by explicitly pushing representation centers of different demographic groups together during message passing
- Core assumption: Graph neural networks amplify bias through neighbor aggregation, and this bias can be mitigated by explicitly modeling group differences in the forward pass
- Evidence anchors: The abstract states "the bias mitigation step explicitly pushes demographic group node presentation centers together," and the paper describes using gradients in probability space transformed back to representation space

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FMP achieves better fairness-accuracy tradeoff by jointly optimizing graph smoothness and fairness objectives
- Core assumption: It is possible to balance the trade-off between smoothness and fairness by adjusting regularization coefficients
- Evidence anchors: The optimization problem formulation integrates both fairness and smoothness objectives with regularization parameters λs and λf

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FMP provides transparency in fairness by explicitly using sensitive attribute information in forward propagation
- Core assumption: Transparency in fairness is important for understanding and auditing machine learning models
- Evidence anchors: The paper notes that "such white-box usage of sensitive attributes is a promising property to understand how sensitive attribute usage forces fairness"

## Foundational Learning

  - Why needed here: FMP is specifically designed to address fairness issues in GNNs
  - Quick check question: What are some common fairness metrics, and how do they relate to the fairness objectives in FMP?

- Concept: Optimization Frameworks
  - Why needed here: FMP is designed within a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes for graph smoothness and fairness
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the optimization framework in FMP, and how does it help achieve the desired tradeoff between fairness and accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature Transformation -> Message Passing -> Debiasing -> Classification
- Critical path: Input node features and graph structure → Feature transformation using MLP → Message passing with neighbor aggregation → Debiasing step using sensitive attribute information → Output node representations for classification
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing smoothness and fairness objectives through regularization coefficients; tradeoff between transparency and potential privacy concerns of using sensitive attributes; computational complexity of debiasing step
- Failure signatures: Poor fairness performance despite using FMP; significant decrease in accuracy compared to baseline models; inability to effectively debias representations in highly biased graph structures
- First 3 experiments: 1) Evaluate FMP on a synthetic graph dataset with known bias and compare fairness metrics to baseline GNN models; 2) Ablation study: Remove the debiasing step from FMP and compare fairness and accuracy to the full FMP model; 3) Sensitivity analysis: Vary the regularization coefficients λs and λf to understand their impact on the fairness-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper mentions several future work directions including extending FMP to handle continuous sensitive attributes, applying the method to link prediction and graph classification tasks, and addressing cases where sensitive attribute information is limited or incomplete during training.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifics for the bias mitigation step, particularly the gradient computation using the softmax property
- The effectiveness of FMP on graphs with complex or multiple sensitive attributes remains untested
- The computational overhead introduced by the explicit debiasing step during message passing is not thoroughly discussed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of pushing representation centers together during message passing and the joint optimization framework are well-specified and theoretically grounded
- **Medium Confidence**: The fairness improvements demonstrated on the three datasets are promising, but the limited dataset diversity and lack of ablation studies for key hyperparameters reduce confidence in generalizability
- **Low Confidence**: The transparency claims regarding sensitive attribute usage are not validated with concrete examples or user studies demonstrating practical interpretability

## Next Checks
1. Implement the softmax-based gradient calculation and verify it matches the theoretical formulation in Theorem 0.2
2. Systematically vary λs and λf across a wider range and measure their impact on both fairness metrics and accuracy to identify optimal tradeoffs
3. Evaluate FMP on an additional graph dataset with different characteristics (e.g., different graph density, sensitive attribute distributions) to assess robustness
