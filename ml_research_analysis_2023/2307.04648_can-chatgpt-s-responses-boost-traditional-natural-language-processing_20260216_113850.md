# Can ChatGPT's Responses Boost Traditional Natural Language Processing?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.04648
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04648
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: Early fusion of ChatGPT responses with RoBERTa embeddings consistently improves performance over standalone NLP methods in sentiment analysis, suicide tendency detection, and personality assessment.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether ChatGPT's verbose responses can enhance traditional NLP models in affective computing tasks through fusion strategies. The authors evaluate three problems—sentiment analysis, suicide tendency detection, and big-five personality assessment—by pairing ChatGPT's verbose explanations with NLP features (RoBERTa embeddings and BoW) and fusing them using early (feature concatenation) or late (probability averaging) fusion. Results show that fusion, particularly early fusion of ChatGPT responses with RoBERTa features, consistently improves performance over standalone NLP methods, with accuracy gains up to ~2–3% and UAR improvements up to ~6% in specific tasks. This demonstrates that ChatGPT's responses contain novel, complementary knowledge that boosts existing NLP techniques.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating ChatGPT verbose responses for input texts, then extracting RoBERTa embeddings (768 dimensions) and bag-of-words features (10k for text, 2k for ChatGPT responses) from both the original text and ChatGPT output. These features are fused either early (concatenation) or late (probability averaging) and fed into multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with varying architecture (0-3 layers, 64-512 units). Hyperparameters are optimized using SMAC across 20 samples. The approach is evaluated on three datasets: Twitter Sentiment140 (28k tweets), Reddit suicide dataset (16k posts), and First Impressions personality dataset (10k video transcripts with continuous labels).

## Key Results
- Early fusion of ChatGPT responses with RoBERTa features consistently outperforms standalone NLP models and late fusion approaches
- Accuracy improvements of ~2-3% and UAR gains up to ~6% are observed across sentiment analysis and suicide detection tasks
- The fusion approach particularly benefits tasks requiring nuanced understanding, such as personality assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ChatGPT's verbose responses contain complementary knowledge that NLP models lack, improving fusion-based predictions
- Mechanism: ChatGPT's explanations add contextual reasoning absent from static embeddings (RoBERTa) or n-gram features (BoW), enriching the feature space when fused
- Core assumption: The knowledge encoded in ChatGPT's verbose responses is both novel and relevant to the task domain (sentiment, suicide, personality)
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states "ChatGPT has indeed novel knowledge that can improve existing NLP techniques by way of fusion"; [section] describes using ChatGPT's verbose responses alongside RoBERTa/BoW features in early/late fusion; [corpus] shows related work exploring ChatGPT's task-solving abilities
- Break condition: If ChatGPT's responses are too generic or task-irrelevant, the complementary knowledge is diluted or misleading

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Early fusion of ChatGPT+RoBERTa with Text+RoBERTa consistently outperforms other fusion combinations
- Mechanism: Concatenating RoBERTa embeddings from both original text and ChatGPT response creates a richer joint representation than late fusion
- Core assumption: RoBERTa's contextual embeddings are sufficiently robust to benefit from concatenation with ChatGPT's output embeddings
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] reports "early fusion of ChatGPT responses with RoBERTa features...consistently improves performance"; [section] shows early fusion of Text+RoBERTa and ChatGPT+RoBERTa gave highest gains; [corpus] lacks direct evidence of early fusion superiority; assumes from paper's results
- Break condition: If RoBERTa embeddings are already saturated with task-relevant information, adding ChatGPT embeddings may cause redundancy without benefit

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Processing ChatGPT's verbose responses via NLP techniques (RoBERTa/BoW) is more effective than parsing binary labels from non-verbose outputs
- Mechanism: NLP methods can extract latent semantic features from ChatGPT's explanations, which contain richer cues than binary labels alone
- Core assumption: The verbose explanations contain actionable linguistic features beyond the binary label
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions "investigating the utility of verbose responses...processed with traditional NLP techniques"; [section] contrasts current work with previous parsing-only approach, showing improved results; [corpus] does not directly address this comparison
- Break condition: If ChatGPT's verbose responses are structurally noisy or inconsistent, NLP processing may fail to extract useful features

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Feature-level vs. prediction-level fusion
  - Why needed here: Determines how ChatGPT's response features combine with NLP model outputs to improve accuracy
  - Quick check question: If early fusion concatenates feature vectors and late fusion averages prediction probabilities, which approach preserves more task-specific signal from both sources?

- **Concept**: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture tuning
  - Why needed here: Hyperparameter selection (layers, units, learning rate) critically impacts fusion performance
  - Quick check question: In a regression task with continuous personality scores, why would MAE loss be preferable to cross-entropy loss?

- **Concept**: N-gram bag-of-words representation
  - Why needed here: Provides a simple, interpretable feature set for ChatGPT responses, complementing RoBERTa embeddings
  - Quick check question: Why might unigrams alone be insufficient for capturing multi-word expressions in ChatGPT's explanations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Original text → ChatGPT API → verbose response; RoBERTa tokenizer → embedding extraction; n-gram BoW → TF-IDF vector; Early/Late fusion; MLP with ReLU activations, sigmoid output, Adam optimizer; Evaluation (Accuracy, UAR, MAE)
- **Critical path**: 1. Prompt ChatGPT → 2. Extract features from both text sources → 3. Concatenate or average → 4. Train/fuse MLPs → 5. Evaluate
- **Design tradeoffs**: Early fusion requires tuning once but may overfit if feature spaces are incompatible; Late fusion allows different training regimes per modality but needs hyperparameter tuning per branch; RoBERTa richer but computationally heavier; BoW simpler but may miss contextual nuance
- **Failure signatures**: Performance plateau or drop when adding ChatGPT features; High variance in fusion results across tasks; Overfitting when early fusion concatenates very high-dimensional vectors
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Run single-modality Text+RoBERTa to establish baseline; 2. Add ChatGPT+RoBERTa (no fusion) to compare standalone performance; 3. Apply early fusion of Text+RoBERTa and ChatGPT+RoBERTa to test complementarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the fusion of ChatGPT responses with traditional NLP methods impact performance on tasks outside affective computing, such as general text classification or information retrieval?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explores the fusion of ChatGPT responses with traditional NLP methods specifically for affective computing tasks (sentiment analysis, suicide tendency detection, and personality assessment). The authors conclude that this fusion yields improvements, but they do not extend this to other domains.
  - Why unresolved: The study is limited to affective computing problems, leaving the potential of this fusion approach in other domains unexplored.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the same fusion techniques to tasks like document classification, question answering, or entity recognition, with a comparative analysis of performance gains or limitations.

- **Open Question 2**: What are the computational trade-offs of using early fusion versus late fusion when integrating ChatGPT responses with traditional NLP models, especially in terms of scalability and real-time applications?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of early and late fusion, noting that early fusion requires hyperparameter tuning once, while late fusion allows different training sizes for each modality. However, it does not delve into the computational costs or scalability of these methods.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for each fusion method or their impact on processing time and scalability.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A detailed benchmark comparing the computational time, memory usage, and scalability of early and late fusion methods across various dataset sizes and hardware configurations.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the quality and relevance of ChatGPT's verbose responses vary across different types of input texts, and what impact does this variability have on the performance of fusion models?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that ChatGPT's verbose responses contain novel knowledge that improves NLP models, but it does not analyze how the quality or relevance of these responses varies with different input texts or how this variability affects model performance.
  - Why unresolved: The study does not assess the consistency or reliability of ChatGPT's responses across diverse input types, which could influence the effectiveness of fusion models.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's responses across a wide range of input texts, measuring response quality, relevance, and consistency, and correlating these metrics with the performance of fusion models.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on relatively small datasets (28k tweets, 16k Reddit posts, 10k personality videos), which may not generalize to broader domains
- The study focuses on three specific affective computing tasks, leaving open whether similar gains would occur in other NLP applications
- Reliance on OpenAI's API introduces potential reproducibility concerns and ongoing costs that may limit practical deployment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core finding that early fusion of ChatGPT responses with RoBERTa embeddings improves performance over baseline NLP models is well-supported by consistent results across all three tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that ChatGPT's verbose responses contain "novel knowledge" is supported by performance gains, but the qualitative nature of this knowledge remains unexplored
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of early fusion over late fusion is demonstrated, but the optimal fusion strategy may depend on specific task characteristics not fully explored

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test the fusion approach on non-social media datasets (e.g., product reviews, medical texts) to assess generalizability beyond the current affective computing focus
2. **Ablation study**: Systematically remove different feature components (ChatGPT BoW, ChatGPT RoBERTa, original text RoBERTa) to quantify each source's contribution to performance gains
3. **Cost-benefit analysis**: Measure the actual API costs and latency introduced by generating ChatGPT responses versus the performance improvements achieved, to determine practical viability for production systems
