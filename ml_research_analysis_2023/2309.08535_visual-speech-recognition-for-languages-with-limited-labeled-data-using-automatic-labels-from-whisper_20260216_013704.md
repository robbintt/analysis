# Visual Speech Recognition for Languages with Limited Labeled Data using Automatic Labels from Whisper

## Quick Facts

- This paper proposes a method for Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) in low-resource languages by automatically labeling unlabeled audio-visual data.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for Visual Speech Recognition in low-resource languages by leveraging automatic labeling from the Whisper model. The method automatically identifies and transcribes target language data from large unlabeled audio-visual datasets, producing 1,002 hours of training data for French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the mTEDx benchmark, demonstrating that automatically generated labels can perform comparably to human-annotated data while significantly expanding the available training corpus.

## Method Summary
The method uses a pre-trained Whisper model to perform language identification and speech recognition on unlabeled audio-visual datasets (VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech), filtering out English data and generating transcriptions for the target languages. The automatically labeled data is combined with the human-labeled mTEDx dataset to train VSR models. The VSR architecture employs a ResNet-18 visual encoder, Conformer audio encoder, and Transformer decoder, initialized with English lip-reading pre-trained weights and fine-tuned on the multilingual data.

## Key Results
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on mTEDx benchmark with significant WER improvements across all four target languages
- Automatic labels achieve similar performance to human-labeled data despite 7-12% ASR WER
- Produces 1,002 hours of training data, with Portuguese showing the largest improvement (WER from 78.32% to 47.89%)
- Ablation studies show consistent performance gains with increased training data volume

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Whisper's multitask pre-training enables high-quality automatic transcriptions for low-resource languages. Pre-trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual data with joint language identification and speech recognition supervision, Whisper can both filter target language utterances and generate transcriptions without human labeling. Core assumption: Whisper's multilingual pretraining generalizes sufficiently to handle diverse audio-visual data distributions in VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech.

### Mechanism 2
Automated labels achieve similar VSR performance to human labels despite ASR WERs of 7-12%. The VSR model's visual modality provides complementary cues that help recover from audio transcription errors. The model learns to focus on lip movements that disambiguate homophones and pronunciation variations. Core assumption: Visual modality provides sufficient disambiguating information to offset transcription errors up to ~12% WER.

### Mechanism 3
Increasing training data size improves VSR performance more than advanced model architectures alone. The ablation study shows WER decreases monotonically with increased training hours, suggesting data scale is a dominant factor. Even simple models benefit significantly from larger datasets. Core assumption: VSR benefits from data scaling similarly to other deep learning tasks, where more data consistently improves generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning (audio-visual fusion)
  - Why needed here: VSR requires integrating visual lip movements with audio signals to improve robustness in noisy environments.
  - Quick check question: How does the encoder-decoder architecture fuse visual and audio features in this paper?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels
  - Why needed here: The approach generates labels for unlabeled data, requiring understanding of when and how pseudo-labels can substitute for human annotations.
  - Quick check question: What criteria did the authors use to filter low-quality automatic transcriptions?

- Concept: Transfer learning from high-resource to low-resource languages
  - Why needed here: The method initializes VSR models with pre-trained English lip reading weights before fine-tuning on target languages.
  - Quick check question: Why might pre-training on English help VSR performance on French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Whisper (language ID + ASR) → Automatic Transcription → VSR Encoder-Decoder (ResNet-18 + Conformer + Transformer) → Output Text
- Critical path: Data filtering → Automatic labeling → VSR training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using Whisper for both language ID and ASR simplifies pipeline but may propagate errors; separate specialized models might be more accurate but require more resources.
- Failure signatures: High WER in automatic labels → degraded VSR performance; language ID errors → missing target language data; insufficient visual cues → poor handling of homophenes.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Whisper on a small subset of VoxCeleb2 and verify language ID accuracy for FR, IT, ES, PT.
  2. Generate automatic transcriptions for the identified target language subset and measure WER against ground truth.
  3. Train a VSR model on mTEDx using both human-labeled and automatically labeled data, compare WER.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- Primary limitation is dependence on Whisper's performance for both language identification and transcription quality
- Success relies on assumption that visual modality can compensate for audio transcription errors up to ~12% WER without thorough validation
- Dataset curation process involves filtering out English data, but exact criteria and performance metrics are not specified

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of using Whisper for automatic labeling and achieving state-of-the-art performance on mTEDx is well-supported by experimental results. The WER improvements over previous methods are substantial and consistently reported across multiple languages.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that automated labels perform comparably to human-labeled data is supported by results on mTEDx, but this comparison is limited to a single dataset. The mechanism by which visual modality compensates for audio transcription errors is plausible but not thoroughly validated through ablation studies or error analysis.

**Low Confidence:** The scalability assumption that more data will consistently improve performance is supported by the ablation study but lacks broader validation across different VSR architectures and language pairs.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic evaluation of Whisper's language identification and transcription accuracy on held-out samples from VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech specifically for the four target languages, comparing performance against dedicated language-specific models.

2. Perform detailed error analysis on mTEDx test examples where automated labels differ from human labels, quantifying how often visual cues correctly disambiguate homophenes or pronunciation variations versus cases where visual information is insufficient.

3. Design experiments to test the saturation point of performance improvements with additional training data, identifying at what point (if any) additional automatically labeled data ceases to provide meaningful WER reductions or potentially degrades performance due to noise accumulation.
