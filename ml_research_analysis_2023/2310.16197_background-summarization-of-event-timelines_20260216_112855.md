# Background Summarization of Event Timelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16197
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16197
- Reference count: 26
- One-line primary result: Background summarization task that complements timeline updates with historical context, achieving strong baseline performance with Flan-T5 and GPT-3.5

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces background summarization as a task that complements timeline updates with relevant historical context from preceding events. The authors construct a dataset by merging Timeline17, Crisis, and Social Timeline datasets, then annotate background summaries for each timestep. They establish strong baseline performance using state-of-the-art systems including Flan-T5 and GPT-3.5, and propose a novel Background Utility Score (BUS) metric to evaluate how well background summaries answer questions about current events.

## Method Summary
The authors merge three timeline datasets to create a comprehensive corpus of 14 major news events with over 1,100 background summaries annotated by experts. They explore both generic and query-focused summarization approaches, where query-focused uses the current update as a query to guide summarization of past updates. The system is implemented using Flan-T5, LongT5, and GPT-3.5 models, with instruction fine-tuning for Flan-T5. Evaluation combines automatic metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, QuestEval) with the novel BUS metric and human evaluation on MTurk.

## Key Results
- Flan-T5 and GPT-3.5 achieve strong baseline performance on background summarization task
- Query-focused summarization outperforms generic approaches when properly implemented
- BUS metric shows correlation with human evaluation and effectively measures background summary utility
- Human evaluation shows 45% preference for human-written summaries over model-generated ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Background summarization complements timeline updates with historical context, improving comprehension for newcomers.
- Mechanism: For each timeline update at timestep t, the system generates a background summary Bt from past updates U1...Ut-1. This summary provides relevant historical context without including content from the current update Ut.
- Core assumption: Historical context from past updates is sufficient to contextualize the current update.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our proposed task of background summarization serves a complimentary purpose to updates."
  - [section 3.1] "For each timestep t > 1, we wish to find the background summary Bt that maximizes p(Bt | U1, ..., Ut-1; q)"
- Break condition: If past updates lack relevant context for the current update, the background summary will be ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Query-focused summarization using the current update as a query improves background summary utility.
- Mechanism: The current update Ut is used to direct summarization of past updates toward content that can help explain Ut. This is implemented through template-based input formatting for T5-based systems.
- Core assumption: The current update contains sufficient information to guide effective summarization of relevant past content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "In a query-focused setting, q is set to the current update Ut. While the background summary does not include content from the current update, the current update can still be used for conditioning the summarization of past updates."
  - [section 4] "We explore both generic and query-focused summarization settings (§3.1)."
- Break condition: If the current update is too vague or unrelated to past content, query-focused summarization may not improve results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BUS metric effectively measures background summary utility by quantifying how well summaries answer questions about updates.
- Mechanism: GPT models generate questions from updates and extract answers from background summaries. BUS measures the percentage of questions answerable by the background.
- Core assumption: Questions generated from updates accurately represent what information readers need from background summaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "Our metric, Background Utility Score (BUS), measures the utility of a background Bt to the corresponding update Ut."
  - [section 6.3] "BUS can be extended to related summarization tasks such as TV recaps and disentangled summarization of scientific articles."
- Break condition: If generated questions don't accurately represent reader needs, BUS won't measure true utility.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Timeline summarization and update summarization
  - Why needed here: Background summarization builds on these established tasks but provides complementary functionality by contextualizing updates rather than replacing them.
  - Quick check question: How does background summarization differ from timeline summarization in terms of input documents and output format?

- Concept: Long-form summarization techniques
  - Why needed here: Background summarization often requires processing long timelines with multiple updates, necessitating efficient handling of long sequences.
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when summarizing timelines with 100+ updates, and how do LongT5 and similar models address these?

- Concept: QA-based evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Standard ROUGE metrics poorly capture the utility of background summaries for contextualizing updates, requiring more nuanced evaluation approaches.
  - Quick check question: How does BUS differ from QuestEval in terms of question generation and answer extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data pipeline: Timeline datasets → Merge timelines → Expert annotation (rewritten updates + background summaries)
  - Model training: Flan-T5/LongT5/GPT-3.5 → Generic and query-focused summarization
  - Evaluation: ROUGE/QuestEval/BERTScore/BUS → Human evaluation on MTurk

- Critical path:
  1. Load merged timeline dataset
  2. Format input for chosen model (generic or query-focused)
  3. Generate background summary
  4. Evaluate using automatic metrics and BUS
  5. (Optional) Human evaluation via MTurk

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Generic vs query-focused: Generic is simpler but may miss context-specific details; query-focused requires careful query formulation
  - Automatic vs human evaluation: Automatic is faster but less accurate; human evaluation is more reliable but expensive
  - Input truncation: Truncating oldest updates preserves recent context but may lose important historical information

- Failure signatures:
  - Low BUS scores indicate background summaries fail to answer questions about updates
  - Poor ROUGE scores suggest summaries don't match reference content
  - Human evaluation showing preference for human-written summaries indicates model-generated summaries lack comprehensiveness

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline Flan-T5 with generic summarization on dev set, evaluate with ROUGE and BUS
  2. Test query-focused variant using full update text as query, compare performance to baseline
  3. Implement BUS using GPT-3.5 for question generation and answer extraction, analyze results against automatic metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their current approach, particularly the lack of personalization in background summaries and the focus on only global, popular events?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention these limitations in the "Limitations" section, acknowledging the need for personalized backgrounds and the current focus on global events.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any concrete plans or future work to address these limitations. It only acknowledges their existence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Future work by the authors or other researchers that addresses these limitations, such as developing methods for personalized background generation or expanding the dataset to include local events.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the BUS metric perform when applied to other summarization tasks beyond background summarization, such as news article summarization or meeting summarization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest in the conclusion that BUS could be extended to related summarization tasks like TV recaps and disentangled summarization of scientific articles.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any empirical evidence or experiments to support the claim that BUS is effective for other summarization tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying BUS to other summarization tasks and comparing its performance to existing evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific challenges and considerations involved in generating background summaries directly from news articles instead of past updates, as mentioned as a future direction in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention this as a future direction in the "Limitations" section, acknowledging the potential benefits of capturing sub-events previously considered unimportant but directly consequential to the latest news update.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific challenges or considerations involved in this approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research papers or experiments that explore the feasibility and effectiveness of generating background summaries directly from news articles, addressing challenges such as information overload, noise, and the need for temporal alignment.

## Limitations

- Background summarization assumes historical context from past updates is sufficient, which may not hold for rapidly evolving situations
- BUS metric effectiveness depends on GPT-3.5's question generation accuracy, which may vary across different event types and reader backgrounds
- Annotation process may introduce bias through choice of annotators and averaging approach that may not capture diverse perspectives

## Confidence

High confidence: Flan-T5 and GPT-3.5 baseline performance supported by quantitative metrics and human evaluation showing 45% preference for human-written summaries.

Medium confidence: BUS metric correlation with human evaluation, though dependent on GPT-3.5's question generation and answer extraction capabilities.

Low confidence: Claim about background summarization significantly improving comprehension for newcomers lacks direct experimental validation through user studies.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled user study comparing comprehension of current events with and without background summaries, measuring information retention and contextual understanding across different reader expertise levels.

2. Test BUS metric reliability by having human annotators evaluate the same background-summary pairs independently, then compare human BUS scores against GPT-3.5 generated BUS scores to quantify measurement consistency.

3. Evaluate background summarization performance on non-news domains (e.g., scientific literature, social media discussions) to assess generalizability beyond the news event context used in this study.
