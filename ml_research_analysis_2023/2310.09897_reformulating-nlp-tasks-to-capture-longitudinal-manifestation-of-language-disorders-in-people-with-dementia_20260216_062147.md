# Reformulating NLP tasks to Capture Longitudinal Manifestation of Language Disorders in People with Dementia

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09897
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Digital linguistic markers based on reformulated NLP tasks robustly characterize dementia speech and correlate with clinical markers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to automatically learning linguistic patterns of language disorders in people with dementia by reformulating NLP tasks as text-to-text generation. The method leverages a pre-trained language model (RoBERTa) fine-tuned on reformulated tasks that force the model to focus on linguistic patterns rather than just learning a unified label space. Digital linguistic markers are constructed from the model's probability estimates to measure communication quality and the intensity of language disorders like anomia, disfluency, and agrammatism. The approach outperforms existing methods and demonstrates strong correlations with clinical markers.

## Method Summary
The method fine-tunes RoBERTa using reformulated NLP tasks that encapsulate contextual information and enhance gradient signals with linguistic patterns. Multiple reformulation strategies are explored including standard classification, multitask learning with masked language modeling, entailment-based fine-tuning, and prompt-based approaches with and without demonstrations. The best-performing model is then used to construct digital linguistic markers that measure overall communication quality and the intensity of various language disorders. The approach is evaluated on the ADReSS and DementiaBank datasets using macro-averaged F1 score, accuracy, and correlation with clinical markers (MMSE, CDR).

## Key Results
- Reformulated NLP tasks significantly outperform standard fine-tuning approaches
- Digital linguistic markers robustly characterize dementia speech and correlate with clinical markers
- The communication marker shows significant differences across cohorts (cognitively normal, MCI, dementia)
- The approach provides insights into the gradual language impairment associated with disease progression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reformulating NLP tasks as text-to-text generation improves the model's ability to learn linguistic disorder patterns compared to standard classification.
- Mechanism: The reformulation forces the model to focus on the language itself and extract signal from linguistic patterns rather than just learning a unified label space.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-trained knowledge can be effectively leveraged when tasks are reformulated to explicitly require understanding of linguistic patterns.
- Evidence anchors: "Our experiments show that NLP tasks that encapsulate contextual information and enhance the gradient signal with linguistic patterns benefit performance."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating context in the form of additional information improves performance over tasks learning a unified space without context.
- Mechanism: Tasks that include context, such as label definitions or demonstration examples, provide the model with more information to focus on the relevant linguistic patterns.
- Core assumption: The additional context helps the model distinguish between different linguistic disorder patterns and improves its ability to generalize.
- Evidence anchors: "Tasks incorporating context in the form of additional information exhibit superior performance over tasks learning a unified space without context."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed digital linguistic markers can effectively measure communication quality and the intensity of language disorders in people with dementia.
- Mechanism: The markers are constructed using the probability estimates from the best model, which has been trained to recognize linguistic disorder patterns. The markers capture the overall quality in communication and the intensity of various language disorders.
- Core assumption: The model's probability estimates accurately reflect the presence and severity of linguistic disorders in the speech of people with dementia.
- Evidence anchors: "We then use the probability estimates from the best model to construct digital linguistic markers measuring the overall quality in communication and the intensity of a variety of language disorders."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preprocessed transcribed speech data -> RoBERTa model fine-tuning -> Reformulated NLP tasks -> Digital linguistic markers -> Evaluation metrics
- Critical path: 1) Preprocess the transcribed speech data, 2) Fine-tune the pre-trained language model using reformulated NLP tasks, 3) Construct digital linguistic markers using the model's probability estimates, 4) Evaluate the markers using various metrics and compare them to existing approaches
- Design tradeoffs: Choosing between different reformulated NLP tasks (e.g., multitask learning, entailment-based, prompt-based), balancing the weights of different objectives in multitask learning, selecting the appropriate evaluation metrics and clinical markers for comparison
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on minority classes (e.g., anomia), lack of significant difference in the communication marker across cohorts, weak correlation between the communication marker and clinical markers
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare the performance of different reformulated NLP tasks (e.g., standard fine-tuning, multitask learning, entailment-based, prompt-based) on the validation set, 2) Analyze the impact of incorporating context in the form of additional information on the model's performance, 3) Evaluate the proposed digital linguistic markers using various metrics and compare them to existing approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the performance of the reformulated NLP tasks change if they were applied to a larger, more diverse dementia dataset with more participants and multiple cognitive disorders?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that DementiaBank is the largest available longitudinal dementia dataset but has limitations in terms of participant numbers and diversity. The authors suggest exploring the generalizability of their approach on a novel fine-grained longitudinal multi-modal dataset in the future.
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited by the available datasets, particularly DementiaBank, which has a small number of participants, especially for the MCI cohort, and is limited to speech elicited through the CTP task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the reformulated NLP tasks on a larger, more diverse dataset with multiple cognitive disorders and various types of speech elicitation tasks would provide insights into the generalizability and robustness of the approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating speaker-dependent information or style-shifting factors into the language models improve the sensitivity of the digital linguistic markers for detecting language disorders in dementia?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that both inter and intra-speaker variability in language could affect the sensitivity of the proposed digital markers. They mention that it is possible to tackle intra-speaker language variability by integrating speaker-dependent information, but inter-speaker variability remains an open research question.
- Why unresolved: The current study does not explore the impact of speaker-dependent information or style-shifting factors on the performance of the digital linguistic markers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of the digital linguistic markers with and without speaker-dependent information or style-shifting factors would provide insights into the potential benefits of incorporating these factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the performance of the reformulated NLP tasks change if they were applied to spontaneous conversational speech data rather than picture description tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that the DementiaBank and ADReSS datasets contain transcribed speech from picture description tasks, which may not fully capture the interactive aspects of everyday conversational interaction. They mention the Carolinas Conversation Collection dataset, which contains more natural conversations between patients and clinical practitioners, as a potential alternative.
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited to speech elicited through the CTP task, which may not fully represent the complexity and variability of spontaneous conversational speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the reformulated NLP tasks on spontaneous conversational speech data from datasets like the Carolinas Conversation Collection would provide insights into the generalizability of the approach to more naturalistic speech contexts.

## Limitations

- The approach relies on CHAT annotations for linguistic disorders, but the exact utterance-level annotations for anomia, disfluency, and agrammatism are not directly provided in the datasets.
- The effectiveness of the reformulated tasks depends on the quality of the label definitions and prompt templates, which are not fully specified in the paper.
- The small sample sizes in the ADReSS and DementiaBank datasets may limit the generalizability of the results, particularly for minority classes like anomia.

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Reformulation Improves Pattern Learning): Medium confidence
- Mechanism 2 (Context Improves Performance): Medium confidence
- Mechanism 3 (Markers Measure Disorder Intensity): Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Reformulation Strategies**: Conduct an ablation study to isolate the impact of different reformulation strategies (e.g., multitask learning, entailment-based, prompt-based) on the model's ability to learn linguistic disorder patterns. This will help validate the claim that reformulation improves pattern learning.

2. **Analysis of Context Influence**: Perform a detailed analysis of how context (e.g., label definitions, demonstration examples) influences the model's decision-making process. This could involve techniques like attention visualization or feature importance analysis to understand the role of context in the model's performance.

3. **Validation of Marker Accuracy**: Validate the accuracy of the digital linguistic markers by comparing them to gold-standard annotations from speech-language pathologists. This will help establish the reliability of the markers in measuring the presence and severity of linguistic disorders in people with dementia.
