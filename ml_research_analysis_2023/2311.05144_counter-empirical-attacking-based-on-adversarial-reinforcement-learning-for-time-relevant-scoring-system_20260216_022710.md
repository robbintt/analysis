# Counter-Empirical Attacking based on Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Time-Relevant Scoring System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.05144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05144
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces adversarial reinforcement learning framework for robust scoring systems without ground-truth labels

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for designing robust scoring systems in applications without ground-truth labels by leveraging adversarial reinforcement learning. The approach uses a counter-empirical attacker to generate behavior traces that violate preset empirical criteria, while an enhancer adjusts the scoring function to resist such attacks. The framework employs a hybrid actor-critic model to handle complex action spaces and uses soft-DTW regularization to ensure generated behaviors remain realistic. Experiments on cloud resource platforms and financial credit systems demonstrate improved scoring robustness against adversarial behavior.

## Method Summary
The framework trains an attacker using a hybrid actor-critic model to generate behavior traces that violate empirical criteria, while an enhancer adjusts the scoring function parameters to resist such attacks. The attacker uses separate discrete and continuous components to handle complex action spaces and is regularized by real user data through soft-DTW distance minimization. The enhancer updates scoring function parameters to minimize attacker rewards, formulated as a two-player zero-sum game optimized through iterative alternating updates. The approach requires real user activity traces but no labeled data, making it suitable for new scoring applications.

## Key Results
- The adversarial approach improves scoring robustness against counter-empirical attacks
- The hybrid actor-critic architecture effectively handles discrete and continuous action spaces
- The final system effectively distinguishes good and bad user behaviors in real-world applications
- Soft-DTW regularization ensures generated attack traces remain realistic and similar to actual user behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The adversarial learning framework improves scoring robustness by iteratively exposing weaknesses through counter-empirical attacks.
- Mechanism: The attacker generates behavior traces designed to violate empirical criteria, while the enhancer adjusts the scoring function to resist such attacks. This forms a two-player zero-sum game where the scoring system evolves to become more robust against adversarial behavior.
- Core assumption: The empirical criteria are correctly specified and represent the intended behavior patterns that the scoring system should reward.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose a 'counter-empirical attacking' mechanism that can generate 'attacking' behavior traces and try to break the empirical rules of the scoring system"
  - [section 3.3] "we design an iterative algorithm to optimize the policy of attacker and enhancer alternatively"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct matches in related papers, though adversarial reinforcement learning is a known technique
- Break condition: If the empirical criteria themselves are flawed or contradictory, the attacker may exploit these inconsistencies rather than genuinely adversarial behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hybrid actor-critic architecture enables effective policy learning for complex action spaces involving both discrete and continuous decisions.
- Mechanism: The actor network uses separate discrete and continuous components, with the discrete actor selecting action types and the continuous actor determining specific values, allowing for more efficient learning than treating all actions uniformly.
- Core assumption: The action space can be meaningfully decomposed into discrete action types followed by continuous parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "we choose to use the actor-critic structure due to its effectiveness to deal with both discrete action space and continuous action space"
  - [section 3.2.2] "we design a discrete actor and a continuous actor in our actor network"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related papers on hybrid action spaces exist but don't directly validate this specific architecture
- Break condition: If the action space structure changes (e.g., continuous actions can occur without discrete precursors), this architecture may become suboptimal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Soft-DTW regularization ensures generated attack trajectories remain realistic and similar to actual user behavior patterns.
- Mechanism: The attacker is penalized based on the soft dynamic time warping distance between generated trajectories and real user data, encouraging realistic attack patterns that could occur in practice.
- Core assumption: Real user behavior data is available and representative of legitimate usage patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.3] "we propose a regulation component in the training network" and "reduce the distance between the attacker's activity trajectories and the real users' activity records"
  - [section 3.2.3] "To deal with the temporal sequences of the generated trajectories and users' activity records with variable length, we introduce the soft dynamic time warping"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this specific regularization approach appears novel
- Break condition: If real user data is insufficient, biased, or unavailable, the regularization may not function properly or could enforce incorrect behavior patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement learning fundamentals (states, actions, rewards, policies)
  - Why needed here: The attacker learns through trial and error to maximize rewards by violating scoring criteria, requiring understanding of RL concepts
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a policy from a value function in RL?

- Concept: Adversarial learning and game theory
  - Why needed here: The framework pits attacker against enhancer in a competitive setting, requiring understanding of minimax optimization and Nash equilibrium concepts
  - Quick check question: In a two-player zero-sum game, what relationship exists between the optimal strategies of the players?

- Concept: Hybrid action space handling
  - Why needed here: The framework must manage both discrete action selection (e.g., choose action type) and continuous action parameters (e.g., specify amount), requiring specialized architectures
  - Quick check question: Why might treating discrete and continuous actions with separate networks be more efficient than a single network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment -> Scoring Function -> Attacker (generates action) -> Environment (evaluates) -> Scoring Function (calculates reward) -> Attacker/Enhancer (updates parameters)

- Critical path: The attacker generates behavior traces, the scoring function evaluates them, and the enhancer updates scoring parameters to minimize attacker rewards

- Design tradeoffs: Using a two-player adversarial framework adds training complexity but produces more robust scoring systems compared to supervised approaches that require labeled data

- Failure signatures: If attacker rewards plateau at high values, the enhancer isn't effectively improving the scoring function; if rewards remain consistently low, the attacker may be too weak or the environment too restrictive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run attacker alone on a simple scoring function to verify it can find counter-examples
  2. Implement enhancer updates and verify scoring function parameters change in response to attacker behavior
  3. Test the complete adversarial loop and measure convergence of both attacker rewards and scoring function robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed framework perform in scoring systems with continuous action spaces only, without discrete actions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on hybrid action spaces combining discrete and continuous actions, but does not evaluate performance on purely continuous scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates effectiveness in hybrid action space settings and does not provide empirical evidence for purely continuous action spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the framework's performance on scoring systems with only continuous actions versus hybrid action spaces.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the smoothing parameter γ in Soft-DTW on the attacker's ability to generate realistic behavior traces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Soft-DTW to regulate the attacker's behavior traces but does not provide an in-depth analysis of how different γ values affect the results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the framework to different γ values in Soft-DTW.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing the effects of different γ values on the attacker's performance and the quality of generated behavior traces.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework handle scoring systems with more than two players, such as scenarios involving multiple competing enhancers or attackers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper formulates the problem as a two-player zero-sum game but does not extend this to multi-player scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper only considers a two-player game between the attacker and enhancer, leaving the multi-player case unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the framework's performance in multi-player settings with multiple enhancers or attackers.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes empirical criteria can be correctly specified without labeled data, but provides no validation that these criteria are complete or accurate for real-world scenarios
- Soft-DTW regularization requires substantial real user data, yet the paper doesn't address scenarios where such data is limited or unavailable
- The two-player game dynamics assume a zero-sum relationship that may not hold when scoring function changes have unintended consequences

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The hybrid actor-critic architecture for handling discrete and continuous actions is well-established in reinforcement learning literature
- **Medium confidence**: The adversarial learning framework structure is sound, but effectiveness depends heavily on proper criterion specification and sufficient real data availability
- **Low confidence**: The specific soft-DTW regularization approach appears novel with no direct validation from related work

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework with deliberately flawed empirical criteria to verify it doesn't amplify incorrect assumptions about user behavior
2. Evaluate performance with varying amounts of real user data to determine minimum data requirements for the soft-DTW regularization
3. Implement the scoring function in a controlled environment where ground-truth labels exist to compare against traditional supervised learning approaches
