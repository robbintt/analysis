core_contribution: This paper introduces a causal perspective to knowledge graph embedding
  (KGE) to address the problem of spurious correlations caused by noisy links and
  trivial patterns in real-world knowledge graphs. The authors propose a Causality-enhanced
  knowledge graph Embedding (CausE) framework that disentangles embeddings into causal
  and confounder components, applies causal intervention to estimate causal effects,
  and employs carefully designed training objectives.

# CausE: Towards Causal Knowledge Graph Embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11610
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: CausE achieves state-of-the-art performance on knowledge graph completion with 1.4% Hit@1 improvement on WN18RR

## Executive Summary
CausE introduces a causal perspective to knowledge graph embedding to address spurious correlations caused by noisy links and trivial patterns. The framework disentangles embeddings into causal and confounder components, applies causal intervention to estimate causal effects, and employs carefully designed training objectives. Evaluated on FB15K-237 and WN18RR, CausE demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in handling noisy data and achieving better generalization.

## Method Summary
CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of confounder embeddings and designs new training objectives to make stable predictions. The framework disentangles embeddings of entities and relations into causal and confounder components, trains them separately with different loss functions, and uses an intervention score to recombine them for unbiased estimation. CausE is evaluated on two public benchmarks (FB15K-237 and WN18RR) for link prediction tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and robustness to noisy data.

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.4% improvement in Hit@1 on WN18RR compared to previous methods
- Demonstrates robustness to noisy data, maintaining performance as noise increases
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component, with intervention score playing a crucial role

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal intervention mitigates the effect of confounder embeddings on predictions by recombining causal and confounder embeddings and calculating an intervention score
- Mechanism: Uses do-calculus to cut the backdoor path from confounder embeddings F to prediction Y, allowing causal embeddings C to make predictions without interference
- Core assumption: Causal and confounder embeddings can be disentangled and that the intervention operator effectively recombines them for unbiased estimation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings"
  - [section] "With the help of do-calculus, the influence from the confounder F to C is manually cut off, which means C, F are independent"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism; this is a novel contribution

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CausE achieves better knowledge graph completion performance by learning causal features rather than spurious correlations
- Mechanism: Disentangles embeddings into causal and confounder components, trains them separately with different loss functions, and uses intervention scores to estimate causal effects
- Core assumption: The KG data contains both causal and confounding information that can be separated into different embedding components
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable predictions"
  - [section] "We decouple the embeddings of entities and relations into causal and confounder embeddings"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific disentanglement mechanism; this is a novel contribution

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The intervention score provides a robust prediction that is less sensitive to noisy links in the knowledge graph
- Mechanism: By considering all possible confounder embeddings through the intervention operator, the model creates a more stable prediction that averages out noise
- Core assumption: The addition operation for combining embeddings effectively captures the causal effect while averaging out noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method also shows robustness to noisy data, maintaining performance as noise increases"
  - [section] "We employ the addition operation as the intervention operation"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific noise-robustness mechanism; this is a novel contribution

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Model (SCM)
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical framework for understanding causal relationships in KGE and identifying backdoor paths
  - Quick check question: What is the backdoor path in the SCM that CausE aims to block?

- Concept: Do-calculus and backdoor adjustment
  - Why needed here: The mathematical tools for implementing causal intervention to remove confounding effects
  - Quick check question: How does do-calculus allow us to estimate P(Y|do(C)) instead of P(Y|C)?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how triples are scored and embeddings are learned is essential for implementing the causal framework
  - Quick check question: What is the typical training objective for KGE models and how does CausE modify it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Entity/relation → Disentangled embeddings (causal + confounder) → Score functions → Losses → Updated embeddings
- Critical path: Entity/relation → Disentangled embeddings (causal + confounder) → Score functions → Losses → Updated embeddings
- Design tradeoffs: The disentanglement approach adds computational overhead but improves robustness; the choice of addition as intervention operator is simple but may not be optimal for all KGE models
- Failure signatures: If ablation studies show significant performance drop when removing Linter, it indicates the causal intervention is crucial; if performance degrades with noisy data, the robustness mechanism may be failing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement CausE with a simple KGE model (e.g., TransE) on FB15K-237 and verify Hit@1 improvement
  2. Test noisy link prediction with increasing noise rates to confirm robustness claims
  3. Perform ablation study by removing each loss component to validate their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would CausE perform on knowledge graphs with temporal dynamics or evolving entities and relations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions exploring more complex scenarios like temporal knowledge graphs in future work, but does not evaluate CausE on such data.
- Why unresolved: The authors only evaluate CausE on static knowledge graphs and do not investigate its performance on temporal KGs with evolving structures over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying CausE to temporal KGs and comparing performance to existing methods for this task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the disentanglement approach in CausE be extended to learn causal and confounder embeddings for entities and relations of different types or classes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper disentangles embeddings for all entities and relations uniformly, but does not explore type-specific disentanglement or discuss implications for different entity/relation types.
- Why unresolved: The current CausE framework does not account for potential differences in causal structure across different types of entities and relations in a knowledge graph.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with type-specific disentanglement in CausE and analysis of performance differences across entity/relation types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is CausE to the choice of hyperparameters, and what is the optimal way to tune them for different knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses grid search to tune hyperparameters but does not provide a systematic analysis of sensitivity or optimal tuning strategies.
- Why unresolved: The authors only report using grid search for hyperparameter tuning without discussing sensitivity or optimal tuning approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis of CausE performance to different hyperparameters and comparison of different tuning strategies.

## Limitations
- The framework adds computational overhead due to disentanglement and multiple loss components
- The choice of addition as intervention operator may not be optimal for all KGE models
- The paper does not explore performance on temporal or heterogeneous knowledge graphs

## Confidence
- State-of-the-art performance claim: High
- Causal intervention mechanism: Medium
- Robustness to noisy data: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement CausE with different KGE models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx) and verify the reported performance improvements on both FB15K-237 and WN18RR
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each loss component (Lcaus, Lconf, Linter, Laux1, Laux2) to overall performance
3. Test CausE's robustness to different types of noise (random link addition, relation-specific noise, entity-specific noise) with varying noise rates to validate the robustness claims
