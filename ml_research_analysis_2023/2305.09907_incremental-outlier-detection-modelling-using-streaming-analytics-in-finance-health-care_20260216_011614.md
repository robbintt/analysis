# Incremental Outlier Detection Modelling Using Streaming Analytics in Finance & Health Care

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.09907
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09907
- Reference count: 31
- The paper proposes a hybrid framework for incremental outlier detection in streaming environments, addressing the limitations of traditional batch methods in handling dynamic data.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid framework for incremental outlier detection in streaming environments, addressing the limitations of traditional batch methods in handling dynamic data. The framework employs two stages: Stage I uses a static model for initial evaluation, while Stage II incorporates incremental learning to continuously retrain the model with incoming data. Eight state-of-the-art outlier detection models were evaluated across seven financial and healthcare prediction tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements with incremental learning, particularly on highly imbalanced datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of two stages: Stage I uses a static model for initial evaluation, while Stage II incorporates incremental learning to continuously retrain the model with incoming data streams. The framework employs a sliding window approach where the model is initially built on the first window of data and then incrementally updated as new windows arrive. Eight outlier detection models (OCSVM, IForest ASD, Exact Storm, ABOD, LOF, KitNet, KNN CAD) were evaluated across seven datasets from finance and healthcare domains, with performance measured using AUC metrics.

## Key Results
- Incremental learning framework significantly improves performance over static batch methods, especially on highly imbalanced datasets
- IForest ASD model consistently ranked among the top three best-performing models across all evaluated datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in fraud detection, churn prediction, and medical diagnosis tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incremental learning adapts to streaming data distribution shifts better than static batch models
- Mechanism: The framework continuously retrains on new data streams using sliding windows, updating model parameters to reflect recent data patterns
- Core assumption: Data distribution changes over time in streaming environments, making static models less effective
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results indicate that our proposed incremental learning framework significantly improves performance, particularly on highly imbalanced datasets"
  - [section 4] "The model is built based on the first window, builds the first model which results the model m1. Thereafter the second window is slided and then the model m1 is taken as the base for this window which results the model m2"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention incremental approaches but don't directly support the specific claim about distribution shift adaptation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ensemble methods (IForest ASD) perform better on highly imbalanced data than single models
- Mechanism: Combining multiple outlier detection models through voting or weighted averaging improves robustness and reduces false positives/negatives
- Core assumption: Different models capture different aspects of outlier patterns, making their combination more comprehensive
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Among all models, the IForest ASD model consistently ranked among the top three best-performing models, demonstrating superior effectiveness across various datasets"
  - [section 6] "Among all the models, the ensemble model strategy IForest ASD model performed better in most of the cases standing in the top 3 models in almost all of the cases"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't directly address ensemble performance on imbalanced data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sliding window approach balances recency and stability in model updates
- Mechanism: By defining window length as a user parameter, the framework controls how much historical data influences the current model versus new incoming data
- Core assumption: Recent data is more relevant for current predictions, but some historical context prevents overreaction to noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "The window length is an user-defined parameter" and "Let us consider an example, where the first window w1 which contains the data streams that arrived between 0-10 seconds. Similarly, the second window contains the data stream from 2-12 seconds"
  - [section 5.2] "All of these datasets are available in opensource platforms such as UCI repository [28] and Kaggle [29] repositories"
  - [corpus] Missing - no corpus evidence about sliding window parameter selection

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Streaming data processing vs batch processing
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on understanding that streaming data requires different handling than static datasets
  - Quick check question: What's the fundamental difference between how batch and streaming models process data?

- Concept: Outlier detection algorithms and their characteristics
  - Why needed here: The paper compares eight different algorithms, each with different strengths for various data types
  - Quick check question: How do distance-based methods like LOF differ from tree-based methods like IForest in detecting outliers?

- Concept: Imbalanced dataset handling
  - Why needed here: The framework specifically performs better on highly imbalanced datasets, which is common in fraud detection
  - Quick check question: Why do traditional accuracy metrics fail on imbalanced datasets and what alternatives should be used?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion layer -> Sliding window manager -> Model update engine -> Evaluation module -> Configuration interface
- Critical path: Data stream → Window buffer → Model update (if window complete) → Prediction → Performance logging → Next window
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window size vs. update frequency: Larger windows provide more stable updates but slower adaptation
  - Algorithm selection vs. computational cost: More algorithms provide better coverage but increase processing time
  - Real-time vs. batch evaluation: Continuous evaluation provides immediate feedback but may be noisy
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation on previously well-performing datasets
  - Increasing prediction latency as data volume grows
  - Model instability with small window sizes (oscillating predictions)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline static model vs incremental model on a simple synthetic dataset with known distribution shifts
  2. Vary window length parameters on the credit card fraud dataset to find optimal balance between stability and adaptation
  3. Compare ensemble vs individual model performance on the highly imbalanced brain stroke dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed incremental outlier detection framework compare to traditional batch methods across different streaming data scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of traditional batch methods in handling dynamic streaming data and proposes an incremental learning approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for specific datasets but does not comprehensively compare the framework's performance across a wide range of streaming data scenarios with varying characteristics (e.g., different data rates, types of anomalies, or noise levels).
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study evaluating the framework's performance across diverse streaming data scenarios with varying characteristics, including different data rates, types of anomalies, and noise levels, would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal parameters for the sliding window approach in the incremental learning framework?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the use of a sliding window approach in the incremental learning framework but does not discuss the optimal parameters for this approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how the sliding window parameters (e.g., window size, sliding interval) affect the framework's performance or how to determine the optimal values for these parameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study investigating the impact of sliding window parameters on the framework's performance and providing guidelines for determining optimal parameter values would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed framework handle concept drift in streaming data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly discuss how the framework handles concept drift, which is a common challenge in streaming data analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the framework's ability to adapt to new data but does not address how it handles changes in the underlying data distribution (concept drift) that may occur in streaming environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating the framework's performance in the presence of concept drift and demonstrating its ability to adapt to changing data distributions would provide evidence to resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The specific mechanisms driving incremental learning improvements remain somewhat opaque
- Computational complexity of maintaining multiple models in streaming environments is not addressed
- Sliding window parameter selection lacks guidance and systematic evaluation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental results showing incremental learning outperforming static batch methods across multiple datasets. The methodology is reproducible and the results are consistent.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that IForest ASD consistently ranks among top performers. While supported by results, the paper doesn't explore why this ensemble method is superior or under what conditions it might fail.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that sliding window parameters can be easily optimized through user definition. The paper doesn't provide guidance on parameter selection or demonstrate the impact of different window sizes.

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Shift Robustness Test**: Design experiments with controlled distribution shifts in synthetic data to verify the incremental learning mechanism's ability to adapt to concept drift.

2. **Window Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary window lengths and sliding intervals across all datasets to identify optimal parameter ranges and understand the tradeoff between stability and adaptation speed.

3. **Computational Overhead Measurement**: Benchmark the incremental framework against static batch methods measuring not just accuracy but also processing time, memory usage, and latency to assess practical deployment feasibility.
