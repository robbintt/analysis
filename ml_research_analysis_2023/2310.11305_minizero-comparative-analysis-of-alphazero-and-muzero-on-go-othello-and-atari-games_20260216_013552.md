# MiniZero: Comparative Analysis of AlphaZero and MuZero on Go, Othello, and Atari Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11305
- Reference count: 40
- MiniZero framework systematically compares AlphaZero, MuZero, Gumbel AlphaZero, and Gumbel MuZero across Go, Othello, and 57 Atari games

## Executive Summary
MiniZero introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating zero-knowledge learning algorithms across board games and Atari environments. The framework compares AlphaZero, MuZero, and their Gumbel variants under various simulation budgets and proposes a progressive simulation method that dynamically adjusts simulation count during training. The authors demonstrate that higher simulation counts generally improve performance in board games, while MuZero with 50 simulations achieves the best overall performance on Atari games. The framework also introduces estimated Q values for non-visited actions to improve exploration and makes trained models publicly available as benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The MiniZero framework implements four algorithms: AlphaZero, MuZero, Gumbel AlphaZero, and Gumbel MuZero, tested across 9x9 Go, 8x8 Othello, and 57 Atari games. The framework uses MCTS with varying simulation budgets (2, 16, 18, 50, 200) and introduces progressive simulation that starts with Nmin simulations and increases to Nmax during training. For board games, AlphaZero and Gumbel AlphaZero are used, while MuZero variants are applied to both board and Atari games. The framework also implements estimated Q values for non-visited actions to improve exploration, calculated as QΣ(s)/(NΣ(s)+1) for board games.

## Key Results
- In 9x9 Go, AlphaZero and MuZero perform similarly with Elo ratings improving from 2020 to 2170-2250 as simulation count increases from 2 to 200
- In 8x8 Othello, AlphaZero outperforms MuZero across all simulation counts, achieving higher Elo ratings
- For Atari games, MuZero with 50 simulations achieves the best overall performance, though Gumbel MuZero with fewer simulations shows competitive results in certain games
- Progressive simulation significantly improves performance in board games but shows mixed results for Atari games

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Progressive simulation improves training efficiency by allocating more simulations to later iterations when the agent's policy is more refined. By initializing with Nmin simulations and progressively increasing to Nmax, the framework avoids wasteful computation in early training when exploration dominates. The marginal benefit of additional simulations is greater when the policy network has already learned useful representations and value estimates.

### Mechanism 2
Estimated Q value for non-visited actions improves exploration by biasing initialization toward smaller values, encouraging the search to explore unvisited branches. Instead of initializing non-visited actions to zero, the framework uses an estimated Q value (ˆQ(s)) based on visited children statistics, effectively sampling a losing outcome once to bias exploration away from unvisited paths.

### Mechanism 3
Gumbel noise guarantees policy improvement even with limited simulations by ensuring that the action selection process is robust to the number of simulations. Gumbel AlphaZero and Gumbel MuZero use the Gumbel-Top-k trick and sequential halving to select actions at the root node, ensuring that even with very few simulations (n=2), the policy improvement theorem holds.

## Foundational Learning

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with PUCT selection**: All algorithms in MiniZero rely on MCTS for planning; understanding PUCT is essential for implementing the simulation budget adjustments
  - Quick check: How does the PUCT formula balance exploration and exploitation in action selection?

- **Representation and dynamics networks in model-based RL**: MuZero variants learn environment models; understanding how these networks predict future states and rewards is crucial for analyzing performance differences
  - Quick check: What are the key differences between representation and dynamics networks in MuZero's architecture?

- **Gumbel-Top-k trick and sequential halving**: Gumbel Zero algorithms use these techniques to guarantee policy improvement with limited simulations
  - Quick check: How does the Gumbel-Top-k trick ensure that the best actions are selected even when only a subset is evaluated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Server -> Self-play workers (generate games) -> Data storage -> Optimization worker (update networks) -> Server
- **Critical path**: Server orchestrates training, manages self-play workers and optimization worker, with data shared via Network File System (NFS)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. progressive simulation budget; estimated Q value modifications; Gumbel noise vs. standard MCTS
- **Failure signatures**: Performance plateaus early, inconsistent training curves, one algorithm consistently underperforms
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run AlphaZero with varying simulation counts (2, 16, 200) on 9x9 Go to observe the relationship between simulation budget and performance
  2. Implement progressive simulation with boundary (2, 200) on 8x8 Othello to verify Elo rating improvements over fixed simulation training
  3. Compare MuZero with and without estimated Q value on Atari games to quantify exploration benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Under what specific game characteristics (e.g., branching factor, state transition predictability, action space size) does MuZero outperform AlphaZero, and vice versa? The paper identifies performance differences but doesn't systematically characterize which game features predict algorithm success.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal simulation budget progression schedule for progressive simulation across different game types? The paper proposes progressive simulation but finds mixed results for Atari games, suggesting the current boundary settings may not be optimal for all game types.

### Open Question 3
How do the estimated Q value modifications for non-visited actions affect long-term learning stability and exploration efficiency compared to traditional MCTS initialization? The paper demonstrates effectiveness but doesn't provide theoretical analysis or ablation studies on how this affects exploration dynamics.

## Limitations
- Limited generalization evidence beyond tested board games and Atari environments
- Lack of computational cost-benefit analysis for higher simulation budgets
- Mixed results for progressive simulation on Atari games without clear explanation of success conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Performance comparisons between AlphaZero and MuZero on 9x9 Go with consistent Elo rating improvements
- **Medium Confidence**: Gumbel Zero algorithms' performance with low simulation counts, showing promise but lacking extensive statistical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Progressive simulation method's effectiveness on Atari games, where results are described as "mixed" without clear explanation

## Next Checks
1. Run ablation study with fixed simulation budgets to isolate whether progressive simulation gains stem from allocation method itself
2. Measure wall-clock training time and FLOPs for each algorithm-simulation combination to quantify actual efficiency improvements
3. Apply MiniZero framework to at least one non-game domain (e.g., simulated robotics) to validate generalization beyond tested environments
