# $μ$PLAN: Summarizing using a Content Plan as Cross-Lingual Bridge

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14205

- Key outcome: Entity-based content planning improves cross-lingual summarization informativeness and faithfulness while enabling better zero-shot transfer to unseen language pairs

## Executive Summary
$μ$PLAN introduces a cross-lingual summarization method that uses entity-based content plans as an intermediate representation to bridge language gaps. The approach leverages a multilingual knowledge base to align entities to their canonical forms across languages, allowing the model to generate summaries conditioned on this cross-lingual bridge rather than relying solely on translation. By formulating plans as ordered sequences of entities, $μ$PLAN separates content selection from surface form generation, enabling improved transfer across language pairs and better faithfulness in generated summaries.

## Method Summary
$μ$PLAN employs an mT5-XL model fine-tuned to generate summaries conditioned on both source documents and entity-based content plans. The method uses Wikidata to canonicalize entities across languages, creating mixed-language plans that contain entity names in both source and target languages. During training, the model learns to generate summaries from concatenated plan-summary sequences, with evaluation showing improved ROUGE scores and entailment-based faithfulness metrics compared to baselines. The approach also demonstrates better zero-shot transfer performance to unseen language pairs when incorporating monolingual target language data during training.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art performance on XWikis dataset across four language pairs (EN↔CZ/FR/DE)
- Average ROUGE-L improvement of 3.5 points over translate-train baselines
- Significant faithfulness improvements with higher entailment scores
- Better zero-shot transfer to unseen language pairs compared to non-planning baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Entity-based content plans serve as cross-lingual bridges by standardizing summarization across languages
- Mechanism: Using a multilingual knowledge base, entities are mapped to canonical names across languages, allowing plans to be generated in the target language rather than relying on translation. This creates a shared conceptualization step that abstracts away surface form differences.
- Core assumption: Entity canonicalization across languages provides sufficient semantic alignment for summarization planning
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Using a multilingual knowledge base, we align entities to their canonical designation across languages and generate the summary conditioned on this cross-lingual bridge and the input"; [section 3.2] "We use the inter-language information from the knowledge base to standardize the content plans across languages"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mixed-language entity plans improve performance over single-language plans
- Mechanism: By concatenating aligned entity names from both languages in the plan sequence, the model receives richer cross-lingual signals that help it map between languages during generation. Natural language entity names leverage the language model's pre-trained knowledge.
- Core assumption: Language models can effectively use mixed-language input to learn cross-lingual mappings
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.2] "We find that mixed language plans that contain entities in both the source and target language...deliver better results than the plans with entities in only one language"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Content planning improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to unseen language pairs
- Mechanism: The planning step separates content selection from surface form generation, allowing the model to transfer summarization knowledge across languages even when direct cross-lingual training data is unavailable. Including monolingual data prevents catastrophic forgetting.
- Core assumption: The planning objective captures language-agnostic summarization knowledge that can transfer across language pairs
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "$μ$PLAN models improve the zero-shot transfer to new cross-lingual language pairs compared to non-planning baselines"; [section 6] "We see that $μ$PLAN results in higher ROUGE-L when evaluated on an unseen language pair"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entity linking and canonicalization in multilingual knowledge bases
  - Why needed here: The system relies on mapping entities to their canonical forms across languages using Wikidata
  - Quick check question: How would the system handle an entity that has no canonical form in the target language?

- Concept: Cross-lingual representation learning and transfer
  - Why needed here: The model needs to understand how to transfer summarization knowledge between languages
  - Quick check question: What happens to transfer performance when moving from high-resource to low-resource language pairs?

- Concept: Content planning as an intermediate representation
  - Why needed here: The system uses ordered entity sequences as plans to separate content selection from generation
  - Quick check question: How sensitive is the generation quality to the order of entities in the plan?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document → Encoder → Content Plan → Summary → Evaluation
- Critical path: Document → Encoder → Content Plan → Summary → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Plan language choice: Source, target, or mixed language plans
  - Plan granularity: Entity-level vs. phrase-level plans
  - Knowledge base selection: Wikidata vs. alternative multilingual sources
  - Zero-shot strategy: Monolingual data inclusion vs. direct transfer
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor ROUGE scores: Plan generation or generation conditioned on plans failing
  - Low entailment scores: Faithfulness issues in generated summaries
  - Plan-entity mismatch: Knowledge base alignment problems
  - Mixed-language plan confusion: Language model struggling with entity name sequences
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare ROUGE scores for different plan formulations (source-only, target-only, mixed-language)
  2. Test zero-shot transfer performance with and without monolingual target language data
  3. Evaluate oracle plan performance vs. predicted plan performance to establish upper bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the entity chain formulation in $μ$PLAN compare to alternative content planning formulations like topic-based or outline-based planning in terms of summarization quality and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions they experiment with different plan formulations but doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other planning approaches
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares $μ$PLAN to non-planning baselines and machine translation approaches, but doesn't benchmark against other content planning methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments between entity chain planning, topic-based planning, and outline-based planning on the same datasets with identical model architectures

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of plan quality on downstream summarization performance, and how can we quantify the relationship between plan F1 scores and summary ROUGE metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reports that predicted plans have ~20% shorter plans with F1 scores around 0.27 compared to gold plans, and shows a gap between oracle and predicted plan performance
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't establish a quantitative relationship between plan quality metrics and summary quality, nor does it explore how much plan quality degradation affects final outputs
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying plan quality (through filtering, editing, or generation quality) and measuring corresponding changes in summary ROUGE scores

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does $μ$PLAN's cross-lingual performance scale to language pairs with significantly different typological features or resource availability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates on four relatively similar Indo-European languages and mentions the methodology could extend to other language pairs
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to four closely related languages, so generalization to distant language pairs (e.g., English-Japanese or English-Arabic) remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on typologically diverse language pairs including low-resource languages, comparing $μ$PLAN's performance degradation to non-planning baselines across different language families

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs between $μ$PLAN's two-stage generation approach and end-to-end summarization in terms of inference speed, memory usage, and training efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the two-stage generation process but doesn't report on computational resource requirements or inference efficiency
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on quality metrics but doesn't provide ablation studies on computational costs or runtime comparisons between planning and non-planning approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed profiling of training and inference times, memory consumption metrics, and parameter counts for $μ$PLAN versus baseline models across different hardware configurations

## Limitations

- Entity canonicalization limitations: The approach assumes clean, unambiguous canonical forms across all target languages, which may not hold for entities with language-specific naming conventions
- Limited language pair evaluation: Experiments only cover four closely related Indo-European languages, limiting generalization claims to distant language families
- Mixed-language processing uncertainty: The paper doesn't adequately address whether language models can consistently process mixed-language sequences across all language pairs, particularly for languages with different scripts

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core mechanism: Using entity-based content plans as cross-lingual bridges provides measurable improvements in both informativeness and faithfulness over non-planning baselines. The ablation studies and controlled experiments provide robust evidence for this claim.

**Medium confidence** in mixed-language plan effectiveness: While the paper shows mixed-language plans outperform single-language plans, the evidence is primarily comparative rather than establishing absolute effectiveness. The language model's ability to process mixed-language entity sequences across diverse language pairs remains somewhat uncertain.

**Medium confidence** in zero-shot transfer claims: The improvement over baselines is demonstrated, but the evaluation scope is limited to one unseen language pair, making broader generalization claims uncertain without further testing.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-lingual entity canonicalization robustness test**: Systematically evaluate entity linking and canonicalization quality across language pairs with varying degrees of linguistic similarity, particularly focusing on languages with different scripts (e.g., EN→JA) and measuring alignment accuracy and plan generation quality.

2. **Mixed-language plan generalization evaluation**: Test the mixed-language plan formulation across a broader range of language pairs, including distant language families and low-resource languages, measuring whether the language model's performance degrades when processing entity sequences that mix languages with different grammatical structures.

3. **Extended zero-shot transfer validation**: Evaluate zero-shot performance across multiple truly unseen language pairs (e.g., EN→RU, EN→ZH) and compare against transfer from related languages, measuring both performance retention and catastrophic forgetting when adding monolingual target language data.
