# Constructing Temporal Dynamic Knowledge Graphs from Interactive Text-based Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01928
- Reference count: 26
- The paper proposes TDGU, a model that constructs dynamic knowledge graphs from interactive text-based games using timestamped graph events and temporal point-based graph neural networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TDGU (Temporal Dynamic Graph Updater), a novel approach for constructing dynamic knowledge graphs from interactive text-based games. The key innovation is representing graph updates as timestamped graph events rather than static update commands, enabling the model to handle temporality and disambiguate objects with identical labels. TDGU employs a temporal point-based graph neural network that leverages absolute timestamps through positional encoding, addressing limitations in prior work like DGU. The model demonstrates superior performance on the TextWorld dataset, particularly in free-run settings that better reflect realistic usage.

## Method Summary
TDGU processes textual observations from interactive text-based games through a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with a graph neural network component. The model converts traditional graph update commands into timestamped graph events (add/remove nodes and edges) and uses positional encoding for temporal embeddings. An autoregressive decoder with four specialized heads predicts event type, source node, destination node, and event label sequentially. The approach is trained via teacher-forcing using negative log-likelihood loss with uncertainty-weighted multi-task learning on the TextWorld FTWP dataset.

## Key Results
- TDGU achieves a free-run F1 score of 0.849 on the original TextWorld dataset, outperforming the baseline DGU
- An ablation study shows that removing temporal information (TDGU no-temp) reduces performance to 0.797 F1 score
- TDGU successfully handles environments with multiple objects sharing the same label, a limitation of previous approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
By representing graph updates as timestamped graph events instead of static commands, TDGU can distinguish between objects with identical labels based on when they were added to the graph. This temporal ordering preserves node identity across updates and prevents the "same label, same node" collapse seen in DGU.

### Mechanism 2
The use of positional encoding for temporal embeddings captures absolute timestamp information more effectively than relative difference encodings in TextWorld's incremental environment. The two-dimensional timestamp [tg, te] provides both game-step and event-step granularity for precise disambiguation.

### Mechanism 3
The autoregressive decoder with specialized heads for event type, source node, destination node, and label generates structured timestamped graph events more effectively than monolithic generation approaches. Each head specializes in predicting one component while maintaining consistency through autoregressive embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal point processes and their application to dynamic graphs**: Understanding how timestamped events can represent dynamic graph changes is fundamental to grasping TDGU's approach versus static graph update methods.
  - Quick check: What are the four types of timestamped graph events defined in the paper, and how do they differ from graph update commands?

- **Graph neural networks and their limitations with dynamic graphs**: TDGU uses a temporal point-based graph neural network, so understanding why traditional GNNs struggle with dynamic graphs is crucial for appreciating the innovation.
  - Quick check: Why can't traditional graph neural networks directly handle dynamic graphs, and what are the common workarounds?

- **Transformer architecture and autoregressive decoding**: TDGU uses a Transformer-based decoder with autoregressive heads, so understanding how Transformers work and how autoregressive decoding functions is essential.
  - Quick check: How does the autoregressive mechanism in TDGU's decoder ensure that each generated event component is conditioned on previously generated components?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text encoder → Graph encoder → Representation aggregator → Transformer-based decoder with 4 autoregressive heads (event type, source node, destination node, event label)
- **Critical path**: Textual observation and previous action → Text encoder → Representation aggregator → Decoder input → Event generation → Graph update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using positional encoding for temporal information vs. harmonic analysis; autoregressive heads vs. monolithic generation; explicit timestamping vs. implicit temporal modeling
- **Failure signatures**: Low free-run F1 score indicates poor generalization; low teacher-force F1 score suggests issues with generation accuracy; poor performance on multiple objects with same label indicates temporal disambiguation failure
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare TDGU vs TDGU no-temp on the original dataset to validate the importance of temporal information
  2. Test TDGU on a modified dataset with multiple objects of same label to verify disambiguation capability
  3. Vary the weight of temporal embeddings in the graph encoder to find optimal balance between temporal and structural information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
The paper does not provide empirical evidence comparing positional encoding with harmonic analysis-based temporal embeddings in the context of TDGU, despite stating that absolute timestamps are more important in TextWorld.

### Open Question 2
The paper suggests potential architectural improvements such as adding an event edge head or using a pretrained language model but does not implement or test these improvements or apply TDGU to other benchmarks like LIGHT and Jericho.

### Open Question 3
The paper identifies the lack of training data as a challenge and suggests exploring self-supervised training methods for TDGU, but does not explore or implement such methods.

## Limitations
- The model's reliance on positional encoding may not generalize well to environments with longer time horizons where relative timing differences are more important
- The autoregressive decoder architecture may suffer from error propagation in longer sequences of graph events
- The evaluation is limited to the TextWorld environment, with untested performance on other interactive text-based game platforms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The temporal point process approach effectively addresses the object label ambiguity problem in dynamic knowledge graph construction
- **Medium Confidence**: The autoregressive decoder with specialized heads provides superior performance compared to monolithic generation approaches
- **Low Confidence**: The specific choice of positional encoding over harmonic analysis for temporal embeddings is optimal across different interactive environments

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Encoding Comparison**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing positional encoding versus harmonic analysis approaches across environments with varying time horizons to determine optimal temporal embedding strategies

2. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Systematically measure error propagation effects in the autoregressive decoder by varying sequence lengths and measuring performance degradation patterns

3. **Cross-Environment Generalization**: Evaluate TDGU performance on at least two additional interactive text-based game platforms beyond TextWorld to assess architectural robustness and generalizability
