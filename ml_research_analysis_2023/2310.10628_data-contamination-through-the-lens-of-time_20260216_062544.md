# Data Contamination Through the Lens of Time

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10628
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Zijian Zhang, et al.
- Primary result: This work presents the first large-scale longitudinal analysis of data contamination in large language models by exploiting the natural experiment of training cutoffs in GPT models.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first thorough longitudinal analysis of data contamination in large language models by exploiting the natural experiment of training cutoffs in GPT models. The authors analyze two longitudinal benchmarks - Codeforces and Project Euler - and find statistically significant trends between a problem's presence on GitHub and LLM pass rates, but only for problems released before the GPT training cutoff. This provides strong evidence of contamination in GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. The authors open-source their dataset, results, and evaluation framework to enable rigorous future analyses of data contamination.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a longitudinal analysis using two benchmarks (Codeforces and Project Euler) with problems spanning different time periods relative to GPT training cutoffs. They compute a GitHub Presence metric for each problem by searching for mentions of problem titles in public GitHub repositories. The analysis uses logistic regression to model the relationship between problem difficulty, GitHub presence, and model performance (pass rates) separately for problems released before and after the training cutoff dates. The unit of analysis is the problem level, with problem difficulty and GitHub presence as key predictors.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant trends between GitHub presence and LLM pass rates exist only for problems released before the training cutoff
- GitHub Presence shows significant positive association with pass rates before cutoff but not after cutoff
- Difficulty negatively correlates with pass rates in both pre- and post-cutoff periods
- The differential effect of GitHub presence across time periods provides strong evidence of data contamination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training cutoff dates create a natural partition for detecting contamination
- Mechanism: Problems released before the model's training cutoff are more likely to be in the training data than those released after, allowing comparison of performance trends based on availability timing
- Core assumption: The model's training data has a strict temporal cutoff and doesn't include post-cutoff data
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we conduct the first thorough longitudinal analysis of data contamination in LLMs by using the natural experiment of training cutoffs in GPT models"; [section 1] "We exploit the known training data cutoff dates of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo [50, 51] to naturally partition benchmark examples"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GitHub presence correlates with model performance only for pre-cutoff problems
- Mechanism: Problems frequently appearing on GitHub are more likely to be in the training data, so models perform better on them, but this correlation disappears for post-cutoff problems
- Core assumption: GitHub is a representative sample of the training data distribution
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.1] "we see that the effect of the GitHub Presence variable is significant before the training cut-off and is not significant after the training cutoff"; [section 4] "GitHub Presence is a proxy metric intended to capture the frequency with which a problem is publicly available on GitHub"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Difficulty affects pass rates differently before and after cutoff
- Mechanism: The relationship between problem difficulty and model performance persists but is moderated after the cutoff, suggesting contamination amplifies the difficulty effect
- Core assumption: Difficulty scores are consistent and comparable across time periods
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.1] "there always exists a statistically significant, negative association between Difficulty and pass rate for each LLM—i.e., this relationship is observed in both the pre-and post-cutoff periods"; [section 4] "Difficulty intuitively captures how challenging a problem is for humans to solve"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural experiments in causal inference
  - Why needed here: The analysis relies on exploiting the training cutoff as a natural experiment to partition data
  - Quick check question: What makes the training cutoff a "natural experiment" rather than a controlled experiment?

- Concept: Logistic regression and odds ratios
  - Why needed here: The statistical analysis uses logistic regression to model binary outcomes and odds ratios to interpret effects
  - Quick check question: How do you interpret an odds ratio of 1.045 in the context of GitHub presence?

- Concept: Data contamination vs. memorization
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between these two related but distinct phenomena
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between contamination and memorization in the context of LLM evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → Feature engineering (GitHub presence, difficulty) → Model evaluation → Statistical analysis → Results interpretation
- Critical path: Collecting problems → Computing GitHub presence → Running LLM evaluations → Performing regression analysis → Drawing conclusions
- Design tradeoffs: GitHub presence as proxy vs. exact training data verification; public vs. private test cases; code generation vs. solution-only evaluation
- Failure signatures: No significant difference in GitHub presence effect before/after cutoff; difficulty effects not moderating; unexpected performance patterns on private vs. public test cases
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate GitHub presence analysis on a different longitudinal benchmark to validate the approach
  2. Test different cutoffs (e.g., GPT-3 vs GPT-4) to see if results are consistent across model versions
  3. Analyze the correlation between GitHub presence and other potential training data proxies (e.g., Google search results)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What latent confounders might influence both exposure to problems and LLM performance on those problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "unobserved confounder(s) influencing change in both problem difficulty and LLM pass rate over time" as a potential explanation for their findings.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this possibility but does not investigate or identify specific confounders. This remains an open area for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies that control for or measure potential confounders (e.g., problem type, language complexity, cultural context) and assess their impact on LLM performance could help identify and quantify these effects.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the training data cutoff date affect contamination and memorization patterns across different LLM architectures and training methodologies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors exploit the natural experiment of training cutoffs in GPT models but note that "training details for GPT-family models are generally secret."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo but does not explore how different training approaches, data sources, or model architectures might influence contamination patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of contamination across multiple LLM architectures, training methods, and cutoff dates would provide insights into the generalizability of the findings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between problem difficulty and the number of test cases, and how does this influence LLM performance over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors hypothesize that "variation in the number of test cases by difficulty level, and/or over time" could contribute to their findings, but do not directly test this hypothesis.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explicitly analyze the relationship between problem difficulty and the number of test cases, leaving this potential factor unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical analyses correlating problem difficulty with the number of test cases and LLM performance would clarify the role of this factor in contamination patterns.

## Limitations

- The analysis only examines two benchmarks (Codeforces and Project Euler), limiting generalizability to other problem types or domains
- GitHub presence is used as a proxy for training data inclusion, but this correlation may not hold perfectly
- The temporal partitioning relies on assumed training cutoff dates that may not be perfectly accurate

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The finding that GitHub presence correlates with pass rates for pre-cutoff problems but not post-cutoff problems is statistically robust and well-supported by the data
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretation that this pattern provides strong evidence of contamination, as alternative explanations (like improved model capabilities over time) are less likely
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of findings to other LLM families, training approaches, or problem domains beyond competitive programming and mathematical challenges

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the analysis using different temporal partitions (e.g., GPT-3 vs GPT-4 training cutoffs) to verify consistency across model versions
2. Test alternative proxies for training data inclusion beyond GitHub presence (e.g., web search frequency, Stack Overflow mentions) to validate the core finding isn't specific to one metric
3. Apply the methodology to non-programming benchmarks (e.g., academic problems, general knowledge questions) to assess generalizability of contamination detection approach
