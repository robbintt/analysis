# Joint Self-Supervised and Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal MRI Data: Towards Predicting Abnormal Neurodevelopment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.15064
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15064
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved 82.4% balanced accuracy for cognitive deficit prediction in preterm infants using multimodal MRI data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning method for multimodal MRI data to predict abnormal neurodevelopment in very preterm infants. The method combines cross-modality-complementary (CMC) and cross-subject-similarity (CSS) feature learning to effectively capture complementary information across different MRI modalities (structural, diffusion tensor, and functional MRI) while also learning shared information across similar subjects. When evaluated on two independent datasets (CINEPS and COEPS), the proposed method significantly outperformed existing deep multimodal learning approaches, achieving 82.4% balanced accuracy, 81.5% AUC, 80.5% sensitivity, and 84.3% specificity for cognitive deficit prediction.

## Method Summary
The proposed method addresses multimodal MRI feature fusion by jointly optimizing CMC and CSS contrastive losses. Feature extraction uses self-attention for connectomic features, pre-trained EfficientNet for T2 images, and fully connected layers for clinical data. The CMC loss pulls together multimodal embeddings from the same subject across different modalities, while CSS loss pushes apart subjects from different classes. The model is trained using 10-fold cross-validation (50 repeats) with equal weighting of both contrastive losses, achieving superior performance compared to baseline multimodal fusion approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved 82.4% balanced accuracy for cognitive deficit prediction in very preterm infants
- Outperformed existing multimodal learning approaches on both CINEPS (300 subjects) and COEPS (83 subjects) datasets
- Demonstrated strong performance across multiple neurodevelopmental outcomes: 80.5% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity for cognitive deficits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint CMC and CSS contrastive losses enable effective multimodal fusion by aligning representations in a shared space while preserving discriminative class boundaries.
- Mechanism: CMC loss pulls together multimodal embeddings from the same subject across different modalities, while CSS loss pushes apart subjects from different classes. Together they learn both complementarity and similarity.
- Core assumption: Heterogeneous multimodal features can be meaningfully projected into a shared representation space where both intra-subject complementarity and inter-subject class separability can be optimized simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "by amalgamating both complementary information across various modalities and among similar subjects"
  - [section 3.3] "By optimizing CMC loss, our method brings the multimodal features of the same subject closer and those of different subjects mutually exclusive"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers explicitly mention joint CMC+CSS contrastive learning
- Break condition: If modalities are fundamentally incompatible or reside in orthogonal representation spaces, joint optimization may fail to converge or degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-attention on connectomic features captures high-order spatial dependencies critical for neurodevelopmental prediction.
- Mechanism: Self-attention computes attention scores between ROIs based on scaled dot-product similarity, allowing the model to weigh ROI relationships adaptively rather than relying on fixed structural connectome definitions.
- Core assumption: The spatial and functional relationships between brain regions contain predictive signal that static adjacency matrices cannot fully capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "brain connectivity, e.g., structural connectome and functional connectome describe their unique characteristics, which can be utilized to analyze the spatial or sequential structure using the self-attention mechanism"
  - [section 3.2] Equation (1)-(2) explicitly define self-attention computation on connectomic features
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related contrastive learning papers but none explicitly validate self-attention on connectomes
- Break condition: If attention weights become uniform or degenerate, self-attention provides no advantage over static connectome representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning mitigates limited labeled data in medical imaging by increasing effective training sample diversity.
- Mechanism: Contrastive pretext tasks (CMC and CSS) create additional training signals by treating different modalities of the same subject as positives and different subjects as negatives, effectively augmenting the labeled dataset.
- Core assumption: The contrastive learning objectives are aligned with the downstream classification task and can learn generalizable representations from limited labeled examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These two pretext tasks largely increase the training samples for the deep learning models, mitigating the inadequate data issue for model training in medical applications"
  - [section 3.5] "Our learning objective is defined as a weighted linear combination of two contrastive loss functions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains self-supervised learning papers but none explicitly validate contrastive learning for limited labeled medical data
- Break condition: If contrastive objectives are misaligned with classification or if augmentation introduces label noise, performance may degrade despite increased sample count.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning fundamentals (positive/negative pairs, embedding space optimization)
  - Why needed here: The entire method relies on optimizing similarity metrics in a shared embedding space
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why pulling positive pairs together and pushing negative pairs apart improves downstream classification?

- Concept: Self-attention mechanisms and multi-head attention
  - Why needed here: Connectomic features are processed through self-attention to capture ROI relationships
  - Quick check question: What does the scaled dot-product in self-attention compute, and why is scaling necessary?

- Concept: Multimodal feature fusion strategies (concatenation, CCA, attention)
  - Why needed here: Method must compare against and improve upon existing fusion approaches
  - Quick check question: Why might naive concatenation of heterogeneous multimodal features be suboptimal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input features (radiomics, structural connectome, functional connectome, T2 images, clinical data) → Feature extractors (self-attention for connectomes/radiomics, EfficientNet for T2, FC for clinical) → Contrastive learning heads (CMC and CSS) → Fusion layer → Classification head
- Critical path: Feature extraction → CMC/CSS contrastive learning → Fusion → Classification
- Design tradeoffs: Separate feature extractors allow modality-specific processing but require careful fusion; joint contrastive learning increases complexity but improves representation quality
- Failure signatures: If contrastive losses dominate, embeddings may collapse; if feature extractors overfit, contrastive learning provides no benefit; poor modality alignment prevents effective fusion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate individual contrastive losses (CMC-only, CSS-only) to assess contribution
  2. Test different λ values for loss weighting to find optimal balance
  3. Compare with baseline multimodal fusion methods on same feature extractors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How would the proposed method perform on datasets with missing or incomplete modalities for some subjects?
- **Open Question 2**: What is the optimal balance between cross-modality-complementary (CMC) and cross-subject-similarity (CSS) loss functions for different types of neurodevelopmental disorders?
- **Open Question 3**: Can the proposed method be extended to incorporate longitudinal MRI data to track neurodevelopmental changes over time?

## Limitations
- Limited external validation (single COEPS dataset, 83 subjects) raises questions about generalizability across different clinical settings and patient populations
- High computational complexity from running 50 repeats of 10-fold CV may not be feasible in clinical deployment
- No ablation study isolating individual modality contributions to final performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Contrastive learning framework and loss formulations (CMC/CSS) are well-established and mathematically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Performance claims on cognitive deficit prediction, though external validation provides some reassurance
- **Low confidence**: Generalization claims across different neurodevelopmental outcomes without additional validation datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Internal ablation analysis**: Systematically remove each modality (clinical, sMRI, DTI, fMRI, T2) to quantify individual contribution and identify redundancy
2. **Cross-site validation**: Apply method to at least two additional independent preterm cohorts from different institutions to assess robustness
3. **Clinical deployment simulation**: Evaluate computational efficiency and latency under realistic clinical workflow constraints
