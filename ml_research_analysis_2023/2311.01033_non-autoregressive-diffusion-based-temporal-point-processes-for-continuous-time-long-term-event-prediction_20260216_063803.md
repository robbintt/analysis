# Non-Autoregressive Diffusion-based Temporal Point Processes for Continuous-Time Long-Term Event Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01033
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01033
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel non-autoregressive diffusion-based temporal point process model achieving superior performance on continuous-time long-term event prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a non-autoregressive diffusion-based temporal point process model for continuous-time long-term event prediction. The model transforms event sequences into a continuous vector space using a bidirectional map, enabling the application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). A denoising network combining RNNs and residual convolutional layers captures both sequential and contextual features of event sequences. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling in multi-step mark prediction while maintaining high accuracy in time prediction across different datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed method addresses long-term event prediction by predicting future event sequences as a whole rather than autoregressively. It employs a bidirectional mapping between event sequences and Euclidean space, allowing diffusion processes to be applied. The denoising network architecture combines RNNs for sequential encoding with residual convolutional layers for contextual feature extraction. The model is trained using a diffusion loss function along with reconstruction and regularization losses, enabling it to handle both time and mark predictions in continuous-time event sequences.

## Key Results
- Superior performance on multi-step mark prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Consistent high performance on time prediction across different datasets
- Effective non-autoregressive generation avoiding error accumulation present in autoregressive models
- Robust performance across synthetic and real-world datasets (StackOverflow, Reddit, Wikipedia)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The non-autoregressive structure avoids error accumulation present in autoregressive models.
- Mechanism: By predicting all future events in a sequence as a whole rather than one at a time, the model eliminates the feedback loop where errors compound across steps.
- Core assumption: The joint prediction of all future events is feasible and doesn't introduce new challenges that outweigh the benefits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Instead of generating events one at a time in an autoregressive way, our model predicts the future event sequence entirely as a whole."
  - [section]: "Instead of generating one event at a time in an autoregressive way, our model predicts the future event sequence entirely as a whole."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.413, average citations=0.0. Top related titles include works on non-autoregressive diffusion methods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The bidirectional map between event sequences and Euclidean space enables the application of diffusion models.
- Mechanism: By embedding event sequences into a continuous vector space, standard diffusion processes can be applied, allowing for noise addition and removal in a tractable manner.
- Core assumption: The embedding transformation preserves the essential structure of event sequences while enabling efficient diffusion operations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "transform event sequences into a continuous vector space using a bidirectional map, enabling the application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)."
  - [section]: "In order to perform diffusion processes on event sequences, we develop a bidirectional map between target event sequences and the Euclidean vector space."
  - [corpus]: The paper is cited in works discussing diffusion for temporal point processes, indicating relevance of this approach.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The denoising network combining RNNs and residual convolutional layers captures both sequential and contextual features.
- Mechanism: RNNs encode the temporal dependencies in event sequences, while residual convolutional layers capture local contextual patterns, providing a comprehensive feature representation for denoising.
- Core assumption: The combination of RNN and convolutional features provides better denoising performance than either approach alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A denoising network combining RNNs and residual convolutional layers is designed to capture both sequential and contextual features of event sequences."
  - [section]: "To capture both sequential and contextual features of event sequences, we propose a novel denoising network framework, which combines an RNN with a convolutional residual network."
  - [corpus]: Related papers discuss similar architectural choices for temporal data, supporting the validity of this approach.

  - Why needed here: DDPMs provide the diffusion framework that is adapted to work with event sequences through the bidirectional mapping.
  - Quick check question: How does the forward diffusion process in DDPMs differ from the reverse process?

- Concept: Non-autoregressive generation
  - Why needed here: This is the key architectural choice that addresses error accumulation in long-term event prediction.
  - Quick check question: What are the main trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: History Encoder → Bidirectional Mapping → Diffusion Process → Denoising Decoder → Reconstruction Layer
- Critical path: History Encoder → Bidirectional Mapping → Diffusion Process → Denoising Decoder → Reconstruction Layer
- Design tradeoffs: Non-autoregressive generation vs. autoregressive accuracy; complex denoising network vs. training efficiency; embedding dimensionality vs. representational capacity
- Failure signatures: Poor mark prediction accuracy indicates issues with embedding reconstruction; degraded time prediction suggests problems with the diffusion process or sequential encoding
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare MAE and ACC on synthetic dataset with different numbers of residual blocks
  2. Test weight decay coefficient sensitivity on StackOverflow dataset
  3. Evaluate ablation study comparing RNN-only vs. full denoising architecture on Reddit dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed model perform on spatio-temporal event prediction tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions extending the model to spatio-temporal event prediction as future work, indicating this is an open area.
- Why unresolved: The current model focuses on temporal point processes without spatial components. Spatio-temporal modeling introduces additional complexity in terms of coordinate transformations and diffusion processes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on datasets with both temporal and spatial dimensions, comparing performance against existing spatio-temporal point process models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of residual blocks and weight decay coefficient for different types of event sequence data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses sensitivity to these hyperparameters and shows different datasets prefer different settings, but doesn't provide a systematic method for determining optimal values.
- Why unresolved: The optimal configuration appears to be dataset-dependent, and the paper only explores a limited range of values. Different event patterns may require different architectural depths.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study across diverse event sequence datasets to establish guidelines for selecting residual block numbers and regularization strength based on dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the non-autoregressive approach compare to autoregressive models in real-time prediction scenarios with streaming data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares performance but focuses on offline batch evaluation. Real-time streaming scenarios introduce additional challenges like latency and data arrival patterns.
- Why unresolved: Streaming data scenarios involve continuous model updates and potentially infinite sequences, which may affect the trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring prediction accuracy, computational latency, and memory usage in simulated streaming environments with varying event arrival rates.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact of different bidirectional mapping mechanisms between event sequences and continuous space on model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a specific bidirectional mapping but acknowledges this as a design choice that could potentially be improved.
- Why unresolved: The mapping mechanism is crucial for the diffusion process, but the paper doesn't explore alternative designs or provide theoretical justification for the chosen approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different mapping strategies (e.g., different transformations, probabilistic vs deterministic mappings) across various event sequence characteristics.

## Limitations
- The bidirectional mapping mechanism, while effective, lacks theoretical justification and exploration of alternative designs
- Optimal hyperparameter configuration (residual blocks, weight decay) appears dataset-dependent without clear guidelines
- Limited evaluation of real-time streaming scenarios where continuous model updates are required

2. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Compare the error growth patterns in the proposed non-autoregressive model versus a comparable autoregressive baseline over multiple prediction steps to empirically verify the error accumulation claim.

3. **Embedding Space Quality Evaluation**: Perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the embedding space by visualizing embedded sequences and measuring reconstruction accuracy under various noise levels to assess the bidirectional mapping quality.
