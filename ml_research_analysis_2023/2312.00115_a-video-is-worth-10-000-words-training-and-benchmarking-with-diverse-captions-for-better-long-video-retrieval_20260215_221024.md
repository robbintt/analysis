# A Video is Worth 10,000 Words: Training and Benchmarking with Diverse Captions for Better Long Video Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00115
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00115
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Existing models struggle with short and partial captions; fine-tuning with synthetic captions improves both 10k Words and standard retrieval performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of long video retrieval by proposing a pipeline that generates synthetic captions with varying complexity levels using large language models. The authors augment existing datasets with simplified, summarized, and partial captions, then validate their quality through human annotation. Their experiments reveal that current video-language models struggle significantly with short and partial captions compared to full paragraphs. To address this, they propose a contrastive fine-tuning method using the synthetic data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the 10k Words datasets while also improving results on standard paragraph-to-video retrieval tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors generate synthetic captions by prompting GPT-3.5 to create variations of existing captions across three axes: duration, summarization, and simplification, plus partial captions. They construct 10k Words datasets by combining original captions with these synthetic variants. For fine-tuning, they employ a contrastive loss that aligns video features with multiple caption variants while maintaining distinctiveness between caption types through projection layers. The method uses data augmentation with a mixing ratio of η=0.75 and projection losses with α_proj=0.1 and α_t2t=0.1 to improve both 10k Words and standard retrieval performance.

## Key Results
- Existing models show significant performance drops on short and partial captions compared to full captions
- Fine-tuning with synthetic captions improves R@1 by 2.8% over SOTA on ActivityNet with diverse captions
- Standard paragraph-to-video retrieval improves by 1.0% R@1 on ActivityNet through the proposed fine-tuning method

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic caption generation with LLMs captures diverse valid descriptions for long videos
- Mechanism: By prompting LLMs to generate summaries and simplifications of ground truth captions, the model produces captions across three axes (duration, summarization, simplification) that represent valid alternative descriptions of the same video content
- Core assumption: LLMs can faithfully preserve semantic meaning while varying structural complexity when prompted appropriately
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos."
  - [section 2.1] "We construct our 10k Words datasets by taking the per-segment captions available for the datasets described in Table 3 and feed them to GPT-3.5 with relevant prompts."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work on synthetic captions but no direct validation of semantic preservation claims
- Break condition: If LLM hallucinations introduce entities or events not present in source videos, retrieval performance would degrade as models learn to associate irrelevant content

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training with diverse captions through contrastive fine-tuning improves both 10k Words and standard retrieval performance
- Mechanism: The proposed loss function aligns video features with multiple caption variants while maintaining distinctiveness between caption types through projection layers, forcing the model to learn a more robust embedding space
- Core assumption: Multiple valid captions for the same video share sufficient semantic overlap that contrastive learning can leverage without creating conflicting gradients
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that finetuning on this data can both mitigate these issues (+2.8% R@1 over SOTA on ActivityNet with diverse captions), and even improve performance on standard paragraph-to-video retrieval (+1.0% R@1 on ActivityNet)."
  - [section 4.1] "To encourage the model to associate all of the descriptions for a video with that video we add the additional 9 captions for a video during training."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss contrastive learning but not specifically for multi-caption scenarios
- Break condition: If caption variants diverge too much semantically, the contrastive loss may push embeddings in conflicting directions, hurting rather than helping performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot models struggle on short captions because they lack fine-grained visual details needed for discrimination
- Mechanism: Short captions remove discriminative visual details present in longer descriptions, creating ambiguity between similar videos that models trained only on full paragraphs cannot resolve
- Core assumption: The semantic gap between short and long captions is large enough that models trained only on long captions cannot bridge it without explicit exposure to short captions during training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on ActivityNet, QuerYD, and LF-VILA show that existing models struggle with short and partial captions."
  - [section 3.2] "Notably, there is only a minor gap in retrieval performance between the Full and Long captions, with a larger difference between Full and Partial captions, and a significant drop for the Short captions."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on video retrieval but limited discussion of caption length effects
- Break condition: If visual features are already highly discriminative, even short captions might provide sufficient information for retrieval, making the proposed fine-tuning less impactful

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with multiple positive pairs
  - Why needed here: The method extends standard contrastive learning by using multiple caption variants per video as positive pairs, requiring understanding of how to handle multiple positives in the same batch
  - Quick check question: In standard contrastive learning, how does the gradient update differ when you have multiple positive pairs versus a single positive pair per anchor?

- Concept: Text summarization and simplification techniques
  - Why needed here: The synthetic caption generation relies on understanding how to control LLM outputs for different complexity levels, which requires knowledge of summarization and simplification principles
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between extractive and abstractive summarization, and which approach is more appropriate for generating diverse video captions?

- Concept: Video-language model architectures
  - Why needed here: The benchmarking and fine-tuning sections assume familiarity with how video-language models like COSA and InternVideo process and embed multimodal inputs
  - Quick check question: How do video-language models typically handle the temporal dimension of videos, and what architectural choices affect their ability to capture long-range dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data generation pipeline: LLM prompts → synthetic captions (3 axes × 3 levels + partial)
  - Benchmark framework: 4 video-language models × 3 datasets × 10 caption types
  - Fine-tuning system: Contrastive loss + projection layers + data mixing
  - Evaluation metrics: R@1, R@5, R@10 across Full/Short/Long/Partial categories

- Critical path:
  1. Generate synthetic captions using LLM prompts
  2. Validate caption quality through human annotation
  3. Run zero-shot benchmarks on existing models
  4. Apply fine-tuning with proposed contrastive losses
  5. Evaluate improvements on both 10k Words and standard metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM generation vs. human annotation: LLMs provide scalability but risk hallucinations
  - Caption diversity vs. semantic consistency: More diverse captions may introduce ambiguity
  - Fine-tuning complexity vs. performance gain: Additional projection layers add parameters but improve results

- Failure signatures:
  - Short caption performance drops indicate insufficient visual discrimination
  - High hallucination rates in synthetic captions degrade model quality
  - Inconsistent improvements across datasets suggest overfitting to specific caption styles

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run zero-shot benchmark with all 4 models on ActivityNet10k to establish baseline difficulty
  2. Apply fine-tuning with only data augmentation (η > 0, α_proj = 0, α_t2t = 0) to measure data-only effects
  3. Enable projection losses (α_proj > 0, α_t2t > 0) to measure contribution of the proposed architectural changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method scale with increasing video length beyond the datasets used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on long video retrieval but does not explore how performance changes with significantly longer videos than those in ActivityNet, QuerYD, and LF-VILA
- Why unresolved: The study uses existing datasets with fixed maximum video lengths, and does not synthetically extend video durations or create new longer video datasets to test scalability
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing retrieval performance on videos longer than those in the current datasets, or ablation studies varying video length within existing datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different large language models (LLMs) beyond GPT-3.5 for generating synthetic captions on retrieval performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses GPT-3.5 for caption generation but does not compare results with other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, or open-source alternatives
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to one LLM, and different models may produce captions with varying quality, structure, or semantic alignment with videos
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using multiple LLMs for caption generation, measuring retrieval performance and caption quality across models

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the retrieval performance to the specific prompts used for generating synthetic captions, and what is the optimal prompt design?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides prompts used for caption generation but does not explore variations in prompt design or conduct prompt engineering studies
- Why unresolved: The study uses fixed prompts without exploring how changes in prompt wording, structure, or instructions affect the quality and diversity of generated captions
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying prompt components and measuring their impact on caption quality and retrieval performance

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the effect of incorporating additional modalities (e.g., audio, subtitles) into the video retrieval framework alongside text descriptions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on text-video retrieval but does not explore the potential benefits of multimodal inputs beyond text and video
- Why unresolved: The proposed method and benchmark are limited to text-video pairs, and the datasets used do not include rich audio or subtitle information
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments extending the framework to incorporate audio or subtitle features, and comparing retrieval performance with and without these modalities

### Open Question 5
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on datasets with different domain distributions or video content types not covered in the current study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates on ActivityNet, QuerYD, and LF-VILA but does not test generalization to other video domains like movies, sports, or user-generated content
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to specific video domains, and the synthetic caption generation may not generalize well to videos with different characteristics or cultural contexts
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the method to diverse video datasets from different domains, measuring retrieval performance and caption quality across domains

## Limitations

- The method relies on existing datasets with per-segment captions, limiting applicability to domains without such annotations
- LLM generation introduces potential hallucinations and bias that could degrade model quality
- Improvements are demonstrated primarily on specific video-language models (COSA and InternVideo), requiring validation on other architectures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The experimental observation that existing models struggle with short and partial captions is well-supported by the controlled benchmark across three datasets and multiple models
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the proposed contrastive fine-tuning method is demonstrated through controlled experiments, but the contribution of individual components could benefit from more granular ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this approach represents a "fundamental problem" in video retrieval may overstate the issue, as performance degradation could be partially mitigated by existing architectural improvements not tested in this study

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies with only data augmentation and only projection losses to isolate their individual contributions to performance gains

2. Test fine-tuned models on a held-out dataset or domain not seen during training to verify generalization beyond the three datasets used for training and validation

3. Perform systematic human evaluation comparing synthetic captions against ground truth captions for semantic equivalence, hallucination rates, and appropriateness for retrieval tasks, particularly focusing on simplified and summarized variants
