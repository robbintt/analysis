# Can Knowledge Graphs Simplify Text?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2308.06975
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06975
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: KGSimple, an unsupervised text simplification framework leveraging knowledge graphs, outperforms text-based approaches on WebNLG and DART datasets in generating shorter, more fluent text while maintaining semantic similarity.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KGSimple, a novel unsupervised text simplification framework that operates on knowledge graphs (KGs) rather than text directly. The method iteratively reduces the KG structure through delete, replace, and merge operations, then generates fluent simplified text using KG-to-text models. KGSimple demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised text simplification models, achieving better geometric mean scores combining compression ratio, syllable ratio, fluency, and saliency metrics on WebNLG and DART datasets.

## Method Summary
KGSimple takes a complex KG as input and applies iterative graph reduction operations (delete, replace, merge) to create simplified KGs. These simplified KGs are then converted to text using pre-trained KG-to-text models (GAP for WebNLG, T5 for DART). The framework employs a scoring function that multiplies multiple metrics (fluency, salience, simplicity, entity preservation) with hard constraints, and uses search algorithms (greater-than-zero, greater-than-previous, simulated annealing) to guide the iterative simplification process.

## Key Results
- KGSimple outperforms text-based unsupervised simplification models on WebNLG and DART datasets
- Generates shorter text with better fluency while maintaining semantic similarity
- Achieves higher geometric mean scores combining compression ratio, syllable ratio, fluency, and saliency metrics
- Iterative graph sampling approach successfully balances simplification and information preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
KGSimple leverages graph structure to guide text simplification, enabling systematic removal and merging of redundant or low-importance information. By applying graph reduction operations (delete, replace, merge) iteratively on the input knowledge graph, KGSimple creates simplified subgraphs that focus on essential entities and relations. The simplified subgraph is then converted to text using a KG-to-text model, ensuring fluency and coherence. Core assumption: Graph reduction preserves semantic core while eliminating noise; KG-to-text models can generate fluent sentences from sparse graphs. Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.2]. Break condition: If the graph reduction removes too much information or the KG-to-text model hallucinates, semantic loss occurs.

### Mechanism 2
Scoring with a product of multiple metrics balances simplicity, fluency, salience, and entity preservation. The reward function multiplies fluency (SLOR), salience (BERTScore), simplicity (FRE), and entity overlap to form a single scalar that guides the iterative simplification search. Hard constraints prevent deletion below a threshold or hallucination of removed entities. Core assumption: Multiplicative combination ensures all aspects are considered equally and hard constraints prevent invalid outputs. Evidence anchors: [section 3.4.6], [abstract]. Break condition: If one metric dominates (e.g., fluency too high) or hard constraints are too strict, the search may get stuck.

### Mechanism 3
Search algorithms (greater-than-zero, greater-than-previous, simulated annealing) balance exploration and exploitation in the iterative simplification process. The framework accepts a proposed KG-text pair based on whether the score improves (or is positive). Simulated annealing allows occasional worse moves early on to escape local minima, then becomes stricter. Core assumption: Iterative sampling with acceptance criteria can converge to a simpler yet fluent output. Evidence anchors: [section 3.5], [abstract]. Break condition: If temperature schedule is wrong, SA may not converge; if acceptance criteria too lax, no simplification occurs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graph structure and representation**: Understanding triples, entities, relations, and graph reduction operations is critical as the model operates directly on KGs. Quick check: What is the difference between a node and an edge in a KG, and how do they correspond to entities and relations?

- **Text generation from structured data (KG-to-text)**: KGSimple uses pre-trained KG-to-text models (GAP, T5) to generate fluent sentences from simplified graphs. Quick check: How does a KG-to-text model handle missing or merged triples compared to a full KG?

- **Text simplification metrics and evaluation**: Understanding metrics like SLOR, BERTScore, FRE, and their roles in scoring is necessary to tune the model. Quick check: Why does SLOR penalize a text by unigram probability, and what problem does this solve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input KG -> Graph Reduction Sampler -> KG-to-Text Generator -> Scoring Function -> Search Controller -> Output simplified text
- **Critical path**: Graph reduction → Text generation → Scoring → Acceptance decision → Next iteration or stop
- **Design tradeoffs**: Graph operations may oversimplify and lose semantics vs. preserve too much and not simplify enough; Product scoring balances aspects but may be sensitive to scaling; Simulated annealing explores more but is slower and may accept poor intermediate outputs; Using KG-to-text models introduces potential hallucination
- **Failure signatures**: Output too short or fragmented → graph reduction too aggressive; Output not fluent → KG-to-text model mismatch or poor scoring; Output hallucinates → entity score too lenient or generator overfitting; Search gets stuck → acceptance criteria too strict or temperature schedule wrong
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Ablation of scoring components: Remove one metric at a time and observe changes in output length, fluency score, and saliency
  2. Compare search algorithms on small dataset: Run KGSimple with zero, prev, SA on a small KG subset and plot convergence and final score distributions
  3. Operation acceptance ratio analysis: Log which operations (delete/replace/merge) are accepted per iteration to understand their relative impact and guide hyper-parameter tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of KGSimple compare to supervised text simplification models on KG-to-text datasets? Basis in paper: The paper focuses on unsupervised approaches and only compares to other unsupervised models. A direct comparison would require additional experiments. What evidence would resolve it: Running KGSimple alongside state-of-the-art supervised text simplification models on the same WebNLG and DART datasets, measuring performance on the same metrics.

### Open Question 2
Can the proposed graph reduction operations be optimized for different types of knowledge graphs (e.g., medical vs. general domain)? Basis in paper: The paper notes that "merge may be further modified depending on the overall structure of the KG's and ontology found in the specific dataset" and that different datasets showed different acceptance patterns for operations. What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with KGSimple on domain-specific KGs with tailored operation probabilities, centrality measures, and replacement dictionaries to measure performance gains.

### Open Question 3
How does KGSimple handle hallucination compared to text-based unsupervised approaches? Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that "as our method is a generative approach (KG-to-text), one limitation is that the approach is prone to hallucination, similar to other generative approaches, such as GRS." However, it doesn't quantify or compare the hallucination rates to text-based methods. What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a systematic hallucination detection method and comparing hallucination rates between KGSimple and text-based models across multiple datasets.

## Limitations
- Implementation details of graph reduction operations are not fully specified
- Product-based scoring lacks ablation or sensitivity analysis
- Limited evaluation on only two KG datasets raises generalization concerns

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core iterative graph reduction + KG-to-text generation framework is well-specified and novel
- **Medium confidence**: The three graph operations (delete, replace, merge) are described but implementation details are sparse
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of simulated annealing vs simpler acceptance criteria is asserted but not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. **Operation ablation study**: Remove each graph operation type and measure impact on output quality to identify essential components
2. **Scoring function sensitivity**: Vary the weights in the product scoring formula and observe changes in final outputs
3. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply KGSimple to additional KG datasets (e.g., MIE) to test generalization beyond WebNLG and DART
