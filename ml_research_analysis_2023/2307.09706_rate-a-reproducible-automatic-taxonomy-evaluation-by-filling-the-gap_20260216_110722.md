# RaTE: a Reproducible automatic Taxonomy Evaluation by Filling the Gap

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.09706
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09706
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: RaTE achieves 84.5% relation accuracy in evaluating taxonomies built by HiExpan, with scores correlating well with human judgment.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RaTE, an automatic label-free method for evaluating taxonomies constructed by automatic taxonomy construction (ATC) algorithms. The method uses masked language models (MLMs) with diversified prompts to check subsumption relations between parent-child pairs in taxonomies, eliminating the need for human judgment or external knowledge bases. RaTE is evaluated on seven taxonomies from the Yelp domain built using three state-of-the-art ATC systems, showing strong correlation with human judgments and sensitivity to artificially introduced noise.

## Method Summary
RaTE evaluates taxonomies by prompting a fine-tuned masked language model with Hearst-like patterns (e.g., "X is a type of [MASK]") for each parent-child pair. The model's predictions are scored based on whether the parent term appears in the top predictions for the child. The approach involves fine-tuning BERT models on domain-specific text with entity masking and extended vocabulary containing taxonomy terms, then evaluating multiple prompt patterns to improve coverage. The final score is the percentage of parent-child pairs correctly predicted.

## Key Results
- Best-performing taxonomy (HiExpan) achieves 84.5% relation accuracy with fine-tuned model m1a
- Artificially degrading taxonomies by removing correct parent-child pairs causes proportional score degradation
- RaTE scores correlate well with human judgments on taxonomy quality
- TaxoGen2 performs worst at 0% accuracy, while HiExpan performs best at 84.5%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Language models can act as a proxy for human judgment in determining hypernymy relationships within taxonomies.
- Mechanism: The method uses masked language models (MLMs) to predict hypernymy by prompting with patterns like "X is a type of [MASK]". The frequency and rank of parent terms appearing in these predictions serve as a score for taxonomy quality.
- Core assumption: The language model's predictions correlate with human judgment about subsumption relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RaTE does not require external knowledge but instead depends on masked language modelling (MLM) to query a large language model for subsumption relations."
  - [section 4.1] "We consider a taxonomy as a set of n parent-child pairs... For each parent-child pair (pi, ci), i ∈ 1, ..., n, we insert ci and the "[MASK]" token into prompts containing 'is-a' patterns..."
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct evidence that LM predictions align with human judgments; only indirect claims in abstract.
- Break condition: If the language model is not sufficiently trained on the domain-specific vocabulary, predictions become unreliable, leading to poor correlation with human judgments.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning the language model on domain-specific text improves hypernymy prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: The model is fine-tuned using masked language modeling on the target corpus, prioritizing masking of taxonomy entities and parent terms to improve recall of domain-specific hypernyms.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific fine-tuning enhances the model's ability to recognize and predict relevant hypernymy relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "To improve hypernymy predictions, we must also address two issues with pre-trained language models... We compared six fine-tuned models, investigating different masking protocols, model vocabulary... and training sizes."
  - [section 5.2] "We experimented with entity masking while fine-tuning model m1a, m1b and m0b, which emphasizes masking task-relevant tokens..."
  - [corpus] Weak: while the paper claims fine-tuning helps, the corpus neighbors do not directly validate this claim.
- Break condition: Overfitting to the training corpus or introducing bias through extended vocabulary can degrade the model's general hypernymy prediction capability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Extending the vocabulary of the language model with domain-specific terms improves prediction accuracy for taxonomy evaluation.
- Mechanism: The tokenizer's vocabulary is expanded to include lemmas of parent terms from the target taxonomy, allowing the model to recognize and predict these terms as whole words rather than subword units.
- Core assumption: Including domain-specific terms in the model's vocabulary increases the likelihood of correct hypernymy predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "We enrich the vocabulary of models m1 and m2, by adding the lemmas... of parent terms... that were not previously included in the base tokenizer..."
  - [section 5.2] "Table 6 showcases the positive effects of extending the vocabulary of the language model... both models m1a and m1b trained with entity masking and an expanded vocabulary correctly predicted 'appetizer' in their top five predictions..."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus evidence directly supports the effectiveness of vocabulary extension.
- Break condition: If the extended vocabulary introduces too much noise or if the model is fine-tuned with limited samples, it may over-predict the added tokens, reducing overall accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  - Why needed here: MLM is the core technique used to predict masked tokens, which in this case are used to infer hypernymy relationships in taxonomies.
  - Quick check question: How does masking tokens in a sentence help a model learn to predict missing words based on context?

- Concept: Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning adapts a general-purpose language model to a specific domain, improving its ability to recognize and predict domain-specific terms and relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between training a model from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a specific dataset?

- Concept: Vocabulary Extension in Tokenizers
  - Why needed here: Extending the tokenizer's vocabulary ensures that domain-specific terms are treated as single tokens, improving the model's ability to predict them accurately.
  - Quick check question: Why might splitting a word into subword units (e.g., 'appetizer' into 'app', '##eti', '##zer') affect the model's ability to predict it correctly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Taxonomy (parent-child pairs) -> Fine-tuned MLM with extended vocabulary -> Prompt generator (multiple Hearst patterns) -> Prediction collector -> Relation accuracy calculator

- Critical path:
  1. Load taxonomy and prepare evaluation prompts
  2. Query fine-tuned MLM with each prompt
  3. Collect top-k predictions for each child term
  4. Check if parent term appears in predictions
  5. Calculate accuracy score as percentage of correct parent-child pairs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using multiple prompts increases coverage but adds computational cost
  - Extending vocabulary improves term recognition but risks overfitting
  - Fine-tuning on domain data improves accuracy but requires additional training resources

- Failure signatures:
  - Low scores across all taxonomies may indicate poor model fine-tuning or vocabulary extension
  - Inconsistent scores between similar taxonomies may suggest sensitivity to prompt choice or tokenization
  - Degradation with artificial noise confirms sensitivity to parent-child pair correctness

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a simple taxonomy using a pre-trained model without fine-tuning to establish baseline performance
  2. Fine-tune the model on the target corpus and re-evaluate to measure improvement from domain adaptation
  3. Extend the vocabulary with taxonomy terms and re-evaluate to assess the impact of vocabulary expansion on accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for extending a language model's vocabulary with domain-specific terms for taxonomy evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss extending the vocabulary of language models with domain-specific terms like "sushi" and "appetizer" to improve hypernymy prediction.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while vocabulary extension helps, it may introduce bias when fine-tuning with limited training samples, and the exact optimal strategies remain to be discussed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different vocabulary extension strategies (e.g., adding all domain terms vs. only high-frequency ones, using pre-trained embeddings for initialization) and their impact on evaluation accuracy and bias.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can RaTE be adapted to measure both precision and recall of taxonomy evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] RaTE is described as an accuracy measure, but the authors mention that depending on the evaluation scenario, it should eventually be coupled with a measure of recall.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide details on how to incorporate recall into RaTE or what such a measure would look like.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a recall-oriented extension to RaTE, along with experiments showing how precision-recall trade-offs vary across different taxonomy construction methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can RaTE be effectively used to optimize hyperparameters of automatic taxonomy construction (ATC) systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that an interesting avenue is to investigate whether RaTE can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ATC system.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or results demonstrating the use of RaTE for hyperparameter optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing that RaTE scores correlate with downstream task performance when used as an objective function for hyperparameter tuning in ATC systems.

## Limitations
- Limited external validation of language model predictions against human judgments
- Unclear whether fine-tuning improvements reflect genuine evaluation quality versus overfitting
- Vocabulary extension benefits lack empirical validation beyond the specific case study

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using masked language models for taxonomy evaluation is technically sound and well-documented. The experimental setup with 7 taxonomies and 3 ATC systems is clearly specified.
- **Medium confidence**: The correlation results with human judgment are promising but based on limited manual evaluation. The artificial degradation experiment provides supporting evidence but doesn't fully validate real-world applicability.
- **Low confidence**: The claims about fine-tuning improvements and vocabulary extension benefits lack external validation. The paper doesn't provide sufficient evidence that these modifications genuinely improve evaluation quality versus introducing bias.

## Next Checks
1. **External correlation validation**: Test RaTE scores against human judgments on a completely different domain (e.g., scientific taxonomy) to verify the method's generalizability beyond the Yelp restaurant domain.

2. **Baseline comparison**: Implement and compare against simpler evaluation methods (e.g., just using pre-trained models without fine-tuning or vocabulary extension) to isolate the actual contribution of each enhancement.

3. **Sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the number of prompts, masking strategies, and vocabulary extension approaches to determine which components are essential versus optional for achieving high evaluation accuracy.
