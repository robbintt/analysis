# An Explainable Deep Learning-Based Method For Schizophrenia Diagnosis Using Generative Data-Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16867
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Deep learning approach with VAE-based data augmentation achieves 99.0% accuracy for schizophrenia diagnosis from EEG spectrograms

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a deep learning approach for automatic schizophrenia diagnosis using EEG recordings. It extracts time-frequency features as spectrograms and applies a CNN for initial classification. To address data scarcity and overfitting, the study employs VAE and WGAN-GP for synthetic data generation. The VAE-augmented dataset achieved 99.0% accuracy, outperforming the non-augmented model (96.0%) and significantly improving convergence and loss. LIME was used to explain model decisions by highlighting influential spectrogram regions. Compared to prior studies on the same datasets, the method achieved superior accuracy without requiring generative augmentation for the 19-channel dataset. The approach demonstrates the potential of generative augmentation in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and trust in medical AI systems.

## Method Summary
The method processes raw EEG signals by segmenting them into 5-second intervals, applying Short-Time Fourier Transform to generate spectrograms, and resizing them to 128x128 pixels for CNN input. A custom CNN architecture with approximately 1.3 million parameters performs binary classification (schizophrenia vs healthy). To address limited training data, VAE and WGAN-GP generative models create synthetic spectrograms that augment the original dataset. The VAE-based augmentation proved most effective, improving accuracy from 96.0% to 99.0%. LIME provides explainability by highlighting the most influential spectrogram regions for each diagnosis, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning models.

## Key Results
- VAE-based data augmentation improved classification accuracy from 96.0% to 99.0% on the 16-channel dataset
- Augmented model achieved faster convergence and lower loss compared to non-augmented version
- LIME explanations identified consistent influential spectrogram regions across multiple samples
- The approach outperformed previous studies on the same datasets without requiring generative augmentation for the 19-channel dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
VAE-based augmentation reduces overfitting and improves convergence by generating synthetic EEG spectrograms that closely resemble the original data distribution. The VAE learns a compressed latent representation of the spectrogram data and reconstructs it. During augmentation, the learned distribution is sampled to create new synthetic spectrograms. These synthetic samples increase the training dataset size and diversity, helping the CNN generalize better and reducing overfitting.

### Mechanism 2
Using spectrograms as input features enables the CNN to learn both temporal and frequency domain patterns associated with schizophrenia. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is applied to the raw EEG signals to generate spectrograms. Each pixel in a spectrogram represents the power of a specific frequency band at a given time point. The CNN learns to identify spatial patterns in these spectrograms that distinguish healthy from schizophrenic subjects.

### Mechanism 3
LIME explanations increase trust in the model by highlighting the most influential spectrogram regions for each diagnosis. LIME generates perturbations of input samples and observes the corresponding changes in the model's output. It then fits a simple, interpretable model (e.g. linear model) to these perturbations to determine which spectrogram regions have the most impact on the diagnosis. These regions are highlighted in a heatmap.

## Foundational Learning

- **EEG signal preprocessing**: Understanding of EEG signal characteristics and common preprocessing techniques (filtering, artifact removal, normalization)
  - Why needed here: EEG signals are noisy and require preprocessing to remove artifacts and normalize across subjects before feature extraction
  - Quick check question: What are the most common types of artifacts in EEG signals, and how can they be removed?

- **Time-frequency analysis**: Familiarity with time-frequency analysis methods (STFT, CWT) and their applications in signal processing
  - Why needed here: Spectrograms are generated using STFT, so understanding this method is crucial for interpreting the input features and designing the CNN architecture
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between STFT and CWT, and when would you use each?

- **Generative models**: Knowledge of generative models (VAE, GAN) and their applications in data augmentation
  - Why needed here: VAE is used to generate synthetic spectrograms for data augmentation, so understanding how it works is important for tuning the model and interpreting the results
  - Quick check question: How does a VAE differ from a standard autoencoder, and what are the advantages of using a VAE for data generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw EEG -> 5-second segmentation -> STFT -> 128x128 Spectrogram -> CNN -> Binary Classification -> VAE/WGAN-GP -> Synthetic Spectrograms -> Augmented Dataset -> Retrained CNN -> Final Classification -> LIME Explanations

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Preprocess raw EEG signals and generate spectrograms
  2. Train CNN on original data
  3. Train VAE and WGAN-GP generators using original spectrograms
  4. Generate synthetic spectrograms using VAE
  5. Augment original dataset with synthetic samples
  6. Retrain CNN on augmented dataset
  7. Evaluate model performance and generate explanations using LIME

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using spectrograms as input features allows the CNN to learn time-frequency patterns, but may lose some temporal resolution compared to using raw signals. Using a custom CNN architecture with fewer parameters than popular models reduces computational cost but may limit the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. Using VAE for data augmentation is computationally efficient but may not generate as high-fidelity samples as GAN-based methods.

- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting: Training accuracy is much higher than validation accuracy, and the model performs poorly on unseen data. Underfitting: Both training and validation accuracies are low, indicating the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns. Poor data quality: The spectrograms contain too much noise or artifacts, making it difficult for the CNN to learn meaningful features.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the CNN on the original dataset without any augmentation and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set
  2. Train the VAE on the original dataset and generate a small set of synthetic spectrograms. Visually inspect the quality of the generated samples
  3. Augment the original dataset with the synthetic samples and retrain the CNN. Compare its performance to the non-augmented model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do WGAN-GP and VAE compare in generating high-fidelity synthetic EEG spectrograms when trained for equivalent durations? The study directly compared WGAN-GP and VAE for synthetic data generation, noting that VAE produced higher-quality samples in less training time, but acknowledged that WGAN-GP could potentially outperform VAE with longer training. This remains unresolved because the paper only trained both models for a limited time (2000 epochs for WGAN-GP vs 6000 epochs for VAE), making it unclear if WGAN-GP's quality would improve significantly with extended training.

### Open Question 2
What specific EEG spectrogram features most reliably distinguish schizophrenia from healthy controls? The LIME algorithm was used to identify important superpixels in spectrograms, revealing that certain frequency regions were consistently important for diagnosis, but the study did not provide detailed analysis of which specific features were most discriminative. This remains unresolved because while LIME highlighted influential regions, the paper did not conduct detailed feature importance analysis or correlation studies to identify the most clinically relevant distinguishing features.

### Open Question 3
Can the proposed generative augmentation approach be effectively applied to other neurological disorders beyond schizophrenia? The authors suggest this as a future direction, noting that the method could potentially improve diagnosis accuracy for other conditions using EEG or ECG signals. This remains unresolved because the study only validated the approach on schizophrenia diagnosis and did not test its generalizability to other neurological conditions.

## Limitations
- Small sample sizes (79 subjects for 16-channel dataset, 28 for 19-channel dataset) constrain generalizability despite reported improvements
- Limited evaluation of LIME explanations without systematic validation of their medical interpretability or correlation with known schizophrenia biomarkers
- Generative models' hyperparameters and detailed architectural specifications are not fully disclosed, making exact replication challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of using spectrograms as CNN input features and the overall framework combining deep learning with generative augmentation
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific performance improvements (99.0% accuracy with VAE augmentation) due to limited replication data and small sample sizes
- **Medium Confidence**: The comparative advantage of VAE over WGAN-GP for this application, based on single-dataset results

## Next Checks

1. Conduct k-fold cross-validation on both datasets to establish confidence intervals for accuracy metrics and assess model stability across different data splits
2. Perform ablation studies comparing different generative model architectures (VAE variants, different GAN formulations) to confirm VAE's superiority is consistent
3. Evaluate LIME explanations by recruiting domain experts to assess whether highlighted spectrogram regions correspond to established schizophrenia biomarkers in EEG literature
