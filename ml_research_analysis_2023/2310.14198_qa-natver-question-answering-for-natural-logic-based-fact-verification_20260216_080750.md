# QA-NatVer: Question Answering for Natural Logic-based Fact Verification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14198
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14198
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves 64.0% accuracy on FEVER with only 32 training samples, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot baselines by 4.3 points

## Executive Summary
QA-NatVer presents a novel approach to fact verification that leverages question answering to predict natural logic operators, eliminating the need for extensive annotated training data. The system achieves strong few-shot performance by framing natural logic operator prediction as a question-answering task using boolean questions. By employing multi-granular chunking and alignment of claim-evidence spans, QA-NatVer produces more plausible and accurate proofs while demonstrating robustness across datasets and languages. The approach significantly outperforms previous systems on the FEVER dataset and shows competitive performance on adversarial datasets, while also surpassing all approaches on a Danish verification dataset without additional annotation.

## Method Summary
QA-NatVer uses question answering to predict natural logic operators for fact verification. The system first chunks claims into non-overlapping spans and merges them to create multi-granular chunks. These claim chunks are then aligned with evidence spans using word-level alignment to ensure semantic coherence. For each aligned span pair, the system predicts natural logic operators (overlap, entailment, alternation, cover, independence, negation) by answering boolean questions using instruction-tuned language models like BART0 and Flan-T5. The proof selection mechanism combines operator probabilities and verdict scores to choose the most appropriate proof, which determines the final veracity label.

## Key Results
- Achieves 64.0% accuracy on FEVER with only 32 training samples, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot baselines by 4.3 points
- Shows competitive performance on an adversarial dataset while maintaining fewer erroneous operators than previous systems
- Surpasses all approaches on a Danish verification dataset without requiring further annotation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: QA-NatVer achieves strong few-shot performance by framing natural logic operator prediction as a question-answering task.
- Mechanism: By leveraging the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models through boolean question prompts, the system can predict natural logic operators without requiring extensive annotated training data.
- Core assumption: Instruction-tuned language models can effectively learn to map semantic relationships between claim and evidence spans to natural logic operators when presented with structured boolean questions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose to use question answering to predict natural logic operators, taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models."
  - [section 3.2] "We formulate the prediction for each NatOp o as a question-answering task (cf. Table 1), each of which is instantiated by one or more boolean question prompts To."
- Break condition: The approach would fail if the instruction-tuned language model lacks sufficient understanding of the semantic relationships expressed in the boolean questions, or if the questions are not well-formed to capture the nuances of each natural logic operator.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-granular chunking and alignment improve the semantic relevance of claim-evidence span pairs.
- Mechanism: By considering claim spans at multiple granularity levels and aligning them with evidence spans using contextualized word alignment, the system can find more semantically coherent pairs that better capture the relationship between claims and evidence.
- Core assumption: The semantic relationship between a claim span and an evidence span is more accurately captured when the granularity of both spans matches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "It is of essence that the granularity of a claim's span matches the evidence span to capture their semantic relationship correctly."
  - [section 3.1] "a more flexible variable-length chunking enables finding more semantically coherent alignments."
- Break condition: This mechanism would break down if the alignment system fails to correctly align words between claim and evidence, or if the chunking process produces spans that are too coarse or too fine-grained to capture meaningful semantic relationships.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proof selection mechanism effectively combines operator probabilities and verdict scores to choose the most appropriate proof.
- Mechanism: By computing a score for each potential proof that combines the average probability of the predicted natural logic operators and a verdict score based on the entire claim-evidence alignment, the system can select the proof that is most likely to lead to the correct verdict.
- Core assumption: The combination of operator probabilities and verdict scores provides a reliable measure of a proof's quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "we compute a score for each one, defined as the sum of a NatOp probability score sp (Eq. 2) and a NatOp verdict score sv (Eq. 3)"
  - [section 3.3] "We select the proof with the highest score."
- Break condition: This mechanism would fail if the probability estimates for the natural logic operators are unreliable, or if the verdict score does not accurately reflect the likelihood of the proof leading to the correct verdict.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Logic
  - Why needed here: Natural logic provides a transparent and interpretable way to reason about the semantic relationships between claims and evidence, which is crucial for faithful fact verification.
  - Quick check question: What are the six natural logic operators used in QA-NatVer and what do they represent?

- Concept: Question Answering with Instruction-Tuned Models
  - Why needed here: Framing natural logic operator prediction as a question-answering task allows the system to leverage the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models, reducing the need for extensive annotated training data.
  - Quick check question: How does the system formulate the prediction of each natural logic operator as a question-answering task?

- Concept: Multi-Granular Chunking and Alignment
  - Why needed here: Considering claim spans at multiple granularity levels and aligning them with evidence spans ensures that the semantic relationship between claims and evidence is accurately captured, improving the system's performance.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to match the granularity of claim and evidence spans when aligning them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Multi-granular chunking and alignment module -> Question-answering module for natural logic operator prediction -> Proof selection module -> Output

- Critical path:
  Chunk claim into non-overlapping spans
  Merge spans to create multi-granular chunks
  Align claim chunks with evidence spans using word-level alignment
  Predict natural logic operators for each aligned span pair using question-answering
  Compute proof scores and select the best proof
  Determine veracity label based on the selected proof

- Design tradeoffs:
  Using question-answering to predict natural logic operators reduces the need for annotated training data but relies on the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned models.
  Multi-granular chunking improves semantic alignment but increases computational complexity.
  The proof selection mechanism combines operator probabilities and verdict scores, balancing the reliability of individual predictions with the overall coherence of the proof.

- Failure signatures:
  Low accuracy on the development set despite high operator prediction accuracy may indicate issues with the proof selection mechanism or the deterministic finite state automaton.
  Poor performance on claims with longer lengths may suggest limitations in the multi-granular chunking and alignment process.
  Inconsistent results across different runs may point to instability in the fine-tuning process or sensitivity to the random initialization of model weights.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the system on a small subset of the FEVER development set with manually annotated proofs to assess the quality of the generated proofs and identify any systematic errors in the natural logic operator predictions.
  2. Perform an ablation study by removing the multi-granular chunking and alignment step to quantify its impact on the system's performance and understand the importance of matching claim and evidence span granularities.
  3. Compare the system's performance using different instruction-tuned language models (e.g., BART0 vs. Flan-T5) to determine the impact of the underlying model's capabilities on the system's few-shot learning performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Here are the open research questions extracted from the paper:

1. **Can QA-NatVer be extended to handle more complex reasoning types beyond natural logic?**
   - [inferred] The paper mentions that natural logic has limitations in handling temporal expressions and numerical reasoning, which are frequently required when semi-structured information is available. Extending QA-NatVer to handle these more complex reasoning types could significantly enhance its capabilities.

2. **How can the quality of generated proofs be further improved to ensure they are both correct and plausible?**
   - [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of both correctness and plausibility of proofs. While QA-NatVer shows improvements over previous systems, further research could focus on refining the proof generation process to ensure higher quality proofs.

3. **Can QA-NatVer be effectively applied to languages with even fewer resources than Danish?**
   - [inferred] The paper demonstrates QA-NatVer's performance on Danish without further training. Investigating its effectiveness on languages with even fewer resources could expand its applicability.

4. **How can the training process of QA-NatVer be made more efficient and less reliant on large annotated datasets?**
   - [explicit] The paper highlights the data efficiency of QA-NatVer compared to other systems. Further research could focus on developing even more efficient training methods that require minimal annotated data.

5. **What are the potential limitations and biases introduced by using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source?**
   - [inferred] The paper acknowledges that Wikipedia, while a valuable resource, has its own limitations and biases. Investigating the impact of these limitations on QA-NatVer's performance and exploring alternative knowledge sources could be beneficial.

6. **How can QA-NatVer be adapted to handle more diverse and complex claim verification tasks beyond simple factual statements?**
   - [inferred] The paper focuses on claim verification for factual statements. Exploring how QA-NatVer can be adapted to handle more complex tasks, such as verifying opinions or detecting misinformation, could broaden its scope.

7. **Can the question-answering formulation used in QA-NatVer be applied to other natural language processing tasks beyond claim verification?**
   - [explicit] The paper mentions that casting natural language problems into a question-answering framework has been explored in various tasks. Investigating the applicability of QA-NatVer's formulation to other NLP tasks could lead to new insights and advancements.

## Limitations
- The evaluation shows strong few-shot performance but relies on specific preprocessing choices that are underspecified
- The claim-evidence alignment mechanism is critical to performance but details about the alignment system implementation are not provided
- The study demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets but evaluation on the Danish dataset is limited to one language pair without broader multilingual validation

## Confidence
- High confidence: The few-shot performance advantage over baselines (64.0% accuracy vs. 59.7% with only 32 training samples) is well-supported by the experimental results and represents the core contribution.
- Medium confidence: The cross-dataset and cross-lingual robustness claims are supported by evidence but limited in scope - the Danish dataset evaluation shows promise but is based on a single language pair without broader multilingual testing.
- Medium confidence: The human evaluation results showing more plausible proofs with fewer erroneous operators are valuable but based on limited manual annotation of 100 samples from development data.

## Next Checks
1. **Alignment System Validation**: Implement and test multiple alignment approaches (e.g., word-level alignment vs. sentence-level alignment) to determine the sensitivity of performance to the alignment mechanism and establish the robustness of the multi-granular chunking approach.

2. **Cross-Lingual Scalability Test**: Evaluate the system on at least three additional language pairs beyond Danish to validate the cross-lingual generalization claims and identify potential language-specific limitations in the instruction-tuned model's ability to handle natural logic operators across languages.

3. **Proof Quality Analysis**: Conduct a systematic error analysis comparing QA-NatVer proofs with previous systems across multiple dimensions (correctness, plausibility, completeness) on a larger sample size (500+ samples) to validate the human evaluation findings and identify specific failure patterns.
