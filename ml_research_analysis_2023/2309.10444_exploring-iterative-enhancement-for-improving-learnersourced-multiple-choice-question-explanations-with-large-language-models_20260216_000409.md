# Exploring Iterative Enhancement for Improving Learnersourced Multiple-Choice Question Explanations with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.10444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10444
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Self-reinforcement framework using LLaMA2-13B outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in BLEU/BERT scores; GPT-4 explanations ranked higher than student-written by human experts.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a self-reinforcement framework for generating and evaluating explanations for learnersourced multiple-choice questions using large language models. The framework iteratively enhances generated explanations by using an explanation evaluation model to provide feedback to the explanation generation model. Experiments on five PeerWise datasets show that fine-tuned LLaMA2-13B outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on automated metrics, while GPT-4-generated explanations are ranked higher by human experts than student-written ones. The framework requires an average of 0.46 iterations to exceed quality thresholds.

## Method Summary
The framework uses instruction fine-tuned large language models for both explanation generation and evaluation. It takes multiple-choice questions from PeerWise datasets as input, generates initial explanations, evaluates them, and iteratively refines them by feeding back evaluation scores into the instruction prompt until a quality threshold is met. The system was tested on five subject-specific PeerWise datasets using Vicuna-13B and LLaMA2-13B models, comparing performance against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on BLEU, BERT scores, and human expert rankings.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned LLaMA2-13B generates explanations with higher BLEU and BERT scores than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- GPT-4-generated explanations ranked higher than student-written explanations by human experts
- Framework requires an average of 0.46 iterations to exceed quality threshold
- Vicuna-13B-generated explanations ranked lower than student-written ones by human experts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative refinement of explanations improves quality by using evaluation scores as feedback to guide generation.
- Mechanism: The framework generates an explanation, evaluates it, and if the score is below a threshold, updates the instruction prompt with the previous score and explanation to generate a better one in the next iteration.
- Core assumption: The evaluation model's score is a reliable proxy for explanation quality and can guide the generation model toward improvement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "iteratively enhances the generated explanations for the given questions with large language models. Comprising an explanation generation model and an explanation evaluation model, the framework generates high-quality student-aligned explanations by iteratively feeding the quality rating score from the evaluation model back into the instruction prompt of the explanation generation model."
  - [section] "If an explanation's evaluation score falls below a defined threshold, the framework iteratively refines and reassesses the explanation."
- Break condition: If the evaluation model is poorly calibrated or the feedback loop introduces drift, the iterations may fail to converge or degrade quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction fine-tuning aligns large language models with student-like explanation styles.
- Mechanism: Models are fine-tuned on high-quality student explanations using instruction prompts that specify explanation generation or evaluation tasks, enabling the models to emulate student writing patterns.
- Core assumption: Student explanations in the training data represent a coherent style that can be learned by fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework emulates the manner in which students compose explanations at the relevant grade level."
  - [section] "Both modules adopt pretrained large language models fine-tuned using instruction fine-tuning."
- Break condition: If student explanations are too heterogeneous or low-quality, fine-tuning may fail to capture a consistent style.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-reinforcement reduces the number of iterations needed to exceed quality thresholds.
- Mechanism: By feeding back the evaluation score and previous explanation into the instruction, the generation model learns to produce better explanations faster than random or non-iterative approaches.
- Core assumption: Each iteration provides actionable feedback that the generation model can incorporate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on five PeerWise datasets show that the fine-tuned LLaMA2-13B model can generate explanations with higher BLEU and BERT scores than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4."
  - [section] "Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ILearner-LLM on LLaMA2-13B and GPT-4 to generate higher quality explanations that are closer to those written by students."
- Break condition: If feedback is noisy or evaluation scores plateau, additional iterations may not yield improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Instruction fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Enables pre-trained models to follow specific tasks (explanation generation/evaluation) aligned with student expectations.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes instruction fine-tuning from standard supervised fine-tuning in this context?

- Concept: BLEU and BERT score metrics
  - Why needed here: Provide quantitative measures of explanation quality relative to student-authored explanations.
  - Quick check question: Why might BLEU alone be insufficient for evaluating explanation quality?

- Concept: PeerWise platform structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding the source of data and constraints (e.g., quality ratings, explanation length) is critical for framing the problem and evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What are the seven components required for a PeerWise multiple-choice question?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question stem -> Explanation Generation (fine-tuned LLM) -> Explanation Evaluation (fine-tuned LLM) -> Iterative feedback loop -> High-quality explanation

- Critical path:
  1. Receive question components
  2. Generate initial explanation
  3. Evaluate explanation
  4. If score < threshold, update instruction and regenerate
  5. Repeat until threshold met or max iterations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. fine-tuning cost (Vicuna-13B vs. LLaMA2-13B)
  - Threshold selection balancing quality vs. iteration count
  - Evaluation score reliability vs. human judgment

- Failure signatures:
  - Stuck in loop with minimal score improvement
  - Evaluation scores diverge from human judgment
  - Generated explanations become repetitive or degenerate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare BLEU/BERT scores of fine-tuned vs. base models on a small test set.
  2. Measure average iterations needed to meet threshold on a held-out dataset.
  3. Human expert ranking of explanations from different model variants on a fixed question set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the iterative enhancement framework vary with different pre-defined quality thresholds?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the framework iterates until the evaluation score exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different threshold values on the number of iterations required or the quality of the final explanation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the framework's performance with various threshold values, measuring iterations and explanation quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework's performance differ across various academic disciplines and educational levels?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions future work to expand the dataset and fine-tune models across a diverse range of academic disciplines and educational levels.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments are limited to a few subjects, and the generalizability of the framework across different domains is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework on a wider range of subjects and educational levels, comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework impact learner engagement and learning outcomes when integrated into a live learner-sourcing platform?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests future work to integrate the framework into a live learner-sourcing platform to examine learner engagement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence on how the generated explanations affect learners' interaction and understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study measuring learner engagement metrics and learning outcomes in a real-world learner-sourcing platform using the framework.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact of using different backbone models (e.g., Vicuna-13B vs. LLaMA2-13B) on the framework's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of Vicuna-13B and LLaMA2-13B in the experiments.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that LLaMA2-13B can outperform Vicuna-13B in certain tasks, it does not explore the reasons behind this or the impact of other backbone models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different backbone models in the context of the framework, potentially including other models.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness relies on the reliability of the evaluation model's scores as a proxy for human judgment, which is not thoroughly validated.
- The paper does not disclose exact instruction templates or hyperparameters, limiting reproducibility.
- The study is limited to a few academic subjects and educational levels, raising questions about generalizability across diverse domains.

## Confidence

- Confidence in the core iterative mechanism: Medium
- Confidence in automated metric reliability: Low-Medium
- Confidence in human expert evaluation: High

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the experiment with a broader set of automated evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, perplexity) and compare their alignment with human judgments.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the iterative feedback loop to quantify its contribution to explanation quality gains.
3. Test the framework on a new, unseen PeerWise dataset or similar platform to assess generalization and robustness to domain shifts.
