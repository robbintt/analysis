# Few-shot Personalized Saliency Prediction Based on Interpersonal Gaze Patterns

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.02799
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02799
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Key outcome**: Tensor-to-matrix regression model preserves structural global information for few-shot PSM prediction, achieving KLdiv of 1.00 and CC of 0.775 on a large-scale dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting personalized saliency maps (PSMs) when limited eye-tracking data is available for a target person. The proposed method leverages gaze patterns from multiple training persons by using a tensor-to-matrix regression model that preserves structural global information without vectorization. The approach includes a multi-task CNN for training person PSMs, an adaptive image selection (AIS) scheme for efficient common image choice, and tensor regression for PSM prediction. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The method predicts personalized saliency maps for a target person using limited eye-tracking data by leveraging gaze patterns from training persons. It employs a multi-task CNN to simultaneously predict PSMs for all training persons, then uses adaptive image selection (AIS) to choose common images that maximize gaze pattern diversity across persons. Finally, a tensor-to-matrix regression model predicts the target person's PSM by preserving structural global information from the training person PSMs, avoiding the information loss associated with vectorization in previous methods.

## Key Results
- **KLdiv improvement**: Achieved KLdiv of 1.00, demonstrating better preservation of structural global information compared to baseline methods
- **Competitive CC performance**: Obtained CC of 0.775, showing the method maintains reasonable local similarity while prioritizing global structure
- **Computational efficiency**: Tensor regression with appropriate rank constraints (R) and regularization (λ) provides good performance without excessive computational complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Tensor-to-matrix regression preserves structural global information without vectorization, improving PSM prediction accuracy
- **Mechanism**: The tensor-to-matrix regression model treats PSMs as multi-array tensors rather than flattened vectors, allowing it to capture spatial relationships and dependencies between training persons' gaze patterns when predicting the target person's saliency map
- **Core assumption**: The structural information in PSMs contains meaningful patterns that are lost when using vector-based regression methods
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions "structural information is preserved using tensor-based regression" and that previous methods "ignore preserving the structural global information of PSMs"

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Adaptive image selection (AIS) efficiently acquires diverse gaze patterns for better person similarity estimation
- **Mechanism**: AIS selects images that maximize variance in PSMs across training persons and object categories, ensuring the chosen images reveal diverse gaze patterns that help distinguish between similar and dissimilar persons
- **Core assumption**: Images that induce diverse gaze patterns across persons provide better information for estimating person similarity than randomly selected images
- **Evidence anchors**: Section states "we choose the common images that the target person gazes at based on the AIS scheme" to bring "more diverse gaze patterns to persons"

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Multi-task CNN trained on extensive training person data provides high-quality PSM predictions for the regression model
- **Mechanism**: The multi-task CNN learns to predict PSMs for all training persons simultaneously, capturing inter-person relationships and providing accurate PSM estimates that serve as input to the tensor regression model
- **Core assumption**: Training person PSMs predicted by the multi-task CNN are accurate enough to serve as reliable inputs for the tensor regression model
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions "the simultaneous prediction of PSMs for several persons has been tried by using a multi-task convolutional neural network (multi-task CNN)"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Tensor operations and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP decomposition
  - **Why needed here**: The tensor-to-matrix regression requires understanding how to unfold tensors, perform tensor products, and apply low-rank approximations
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain the difference between tensor unfolding and vectorization, and why unfolding preserves more structure?

- **Concept**: Saliency map evaluation metrics (KLdiv and CC)
  - **Why needed here**: The paper uses both distribution-based (KLdiv) and pixel-based (CC) metrics to evaluate PSM predictions, requiring understanding their different sensitivities
  - **Quick check question**: Why does the paper report that KLdiv is better for evaluating structural preservation while CC evaluates local similarity?

- **Concept**: Person similarity estimation from limited eye-tracking data
  - **Why needed here**: The method relies on estimating similarity between target and training persons using only common images, requiring understanding of similarity metrics in sparse data scenarios
  - **Quick check question**: How does the AIS scheme ensure that the common images provide sufficient information to estimate person similarity reliably?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Multi-task CNN (PSM predictor for training persons) → AIS (common image selector) → Tensor-to-matrix regression (target PSM predictor)
- **Critical path**: Training multi-task CNN → Selecting common images via AIS → Training tensor regression → Predicting target PSMs
- **Design tradeoffs**: Tensor regression preserves structure but increases computational complexity vs vector regression; AIS adds selection overhead but improves data efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: Poor KLdiv but good CC suggests local patterns are captured but global structure is lost; good KLdiv but poor CC suggests global structure is preserved but fine details are missed
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare tensor regression vs vector regression on a small subset of PSM data to verify structure preservation benefits
  2. Test AIS image selection by comparing diversity metrics (variance, entropy) between AIS-selected and random image sets
  3. Validate multi-task CNN PSM predictions by comparing against ground truth on held-out test images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the performance of the tensor-to-matrix regression model change when using different rank constraints (R) and regularization parameters (λ) in the proposed method?
  - **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions experimental results showing effectiveness but lacks detailed analysis of how different R and λ values affect performance
  - **Why unresolved**: Only shows that higher R is better but with increased computational complexity, and λ = 1000 is best regardless of R
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Comprehensive analysis of impact of different R and λ values on model performance, computational complexity, and generalization ability

- **Open Question 2**: How does the proposed method compare to other deep learning-based methods for personalized saliency map prediction, such as those using recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms?
  - **Basis in paper**: The paper focuses on comparing to previous few-shot PSM prediction methods and universal saliency map prediction methods, not other deep learning approaches
  - **Why unresolved**: Doesn't explore how the proposed method performs against other deep learning-based methods for personalized saliency map prediction
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental results comparing the proposed method to other deep learning-based methods using recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms

- **Open Question 3**: How does the proposed method handle the trade-off between preserving structural global information and capturing local information in personalized saliency maps?
  - **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions that CC (cross correlation) for local similarity is not the best for the proposed method, suggesting a trade-off exists
  - **Why unresolved**: Doesn't provide detailed analysis of how the method handles this trade-off between structural preservation and local similarity
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Detailed analysis of the trade-off between preserving structural global information and capturing local information, including experimental results showing impact of different trade-off settings

## Limitations
- **Implementation details unclear**: Exact architecture of multi-task CNN and implementation specifics of AIS scheme are not fully specified
- **Single dataset evaluation**: Results validated only on one PSM dataset with 30 participants, limiting generalizability
- **Reproducibility concerns**: Missing hyperparameters and architectural details make exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of tensor-to-matrix regression preserving structural information is well-supported by theoretical reasoning and experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Adaptive image selection approach shows promise but lacks detailed implementation specifics
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-task CNN's ability to provide accurate PSM predictions is demonstrated, though exact architecture remains underspecified

## Next Checks
1. **Structure Preservation Verification**: Compare tensor regression vs. vector regression on a controlled subset of PSM data with known structural patterns to empirically verify that tensor methods better preserve global information
2. **AIS Diversity Impact**: Measure and compare diversity metrics (variance, entropy) between AIS-selected and randomly selected image sets to quantify the actual diversity improvement claimed by the method
3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test the proposed method on at least one additional eye-tracking dataset with different characteristics (e.g., different image content, viewing conditions, or participant demographics) to assess generalizability beyond the PSM dataset
