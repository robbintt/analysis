# A Novel Information-Theoretic Objective to Disentangle Representations for Fair Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13990
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces a novel information-theoretic objective, CLINIC, for learning disentangled representations in fair classification tasks. The method aims to minimize the mutual information between the learned representation and the sensitive attribute, conditioned on the target label.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLINIC, a novel information-theoretic objective for learning disentangled representations in fair classification tasks. The method minimizes conditional mutual information between the learned representation and sensitive attribute, conditioned on the target label, using a parameter-free contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four datasets with over 2000 neural network trainings demonstrate that CLINIC outperforms existing techniques in terms of the disentanglement-accuracy trade-off and generalization. The method is also faster to train and requires less hyperparameter tuning compared to previous approaches.

## Method Summary
CLINIC (Conditional mutuaL InformatioN mInimization for fair ClassifIcAtioN) is a parameter-free contrastive learning approach that minimizes the conditional mutual information I(Z; S|Y) between learned representation Z and sensitive attribute S, given target label Y. The method uses contrastive pairs constructed based on label and sensitive attribute combinations, with temperature hyperparameters τp and τn allowing fine-grained control over positive/negative example weighting. Two sampling strategies (S1 and S2) incorporate target label information into pair construction, yielding superior disentanglement-accuracy trade-offs compared to a baseline strategy S0.

## Key Results
- CLINIC offers a better disentanglement/accuracy trade-off than previous techniques across four datasets with over 2000 neural network trainings
- The parameter-free nature of CLINIC makes it faster to train and requires less hyperparameter tuning compared to adversarial approaches
- CLINIC outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization and scalability
- Sampling strategies S1 and S2 consistently improve performance compared to S0

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLINIC minimizes conditional mutual information I(Z; S|Y) rather than unconditional I(Z; S), avoiding the trade-off between disentanglement and classification accuracy.
- Mechanism: By conditioning on Y, the regularizer focuses on removing only the parts of S that are independent of the target label, preserving predictive information while reducing bias.
- Core assumption: The mutual information between Y and S is fixed and cannot be reduced; thus, conditioning on Y avoids penalizing useful predictive features shared by both Y and S.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CLINIC losses are studied through extensive numerical experiments by training over 2k neural networks. We demonstrate that our methods offer a better disentanglement/accuracy trade-off than previous techniques..."
  - [section] "Our method will bypass this issue by minimizing the conditional mutual information I(Z; S|Y) solely..."
  - [corpus] Weak – corpus mentions similar disentanglement works but no direct evidence of conditional vs unconditional MI comparison.
- Break condition: If the shared information between Y and S is large, conditioning on Y may not sufficiently reduce bias without harming accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parameter-free contrastive learning in CLINIC avoids the instability and tuning burden of adversarial or variational MI estimators.
- Mechanism: Contrastive pairs are constructed based on label and sensitive attribute combinations, and the temperature hyperparameters τp and τn allow fine-grained control over positive/negative example weighting without learnable parameters.
- Core assumption: Mutual information can be well-approximated by contrastive loss without requiring additional neural network parameters to estimate densities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The resulting set of losses, called CLINIC, is parameter free and thus, it is easier and faster to train."
  - [section] "The proposed regularizer does not require any additional trainable parameters ϕ."
  - [corpus] Weak – corpus lists related disentanglement papers but none mention contrastive MI estimation without learnable parameters.
- Break condition: If the data distribution is complex or high-dimensional, contrastive estimation may fail to capture full MI structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sampling strategies S1 and S2, which incorporate target label information into positive/negative pair construction, yield superior disentanglement-accuracy trade-offs compared to strategy S0.
- Mechanism: By ensuring positives share the same Y but different S, and negatives share different Y, the contrastive loss explicitly aligns representations by task-relevant features while decorrelating sensitive attributes.
- Core assumption: The structure of the classification task can be leveraged to guide contrastive sampling toward more informative pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Among the three considered sampling strategies for positives and negatives, S1 and S2 are the best and always improve performance upon S0."
  - [section] "Our method offers additional versatility by allowing to fine tune two temperature parameters, τp and τn..."
  - [corpus] Moderate – corpus lists disentanglement papers but lacks contrastive sampling with target label conditioning.
- Break condition: If Y and S are highly correlated, sampling strategy may not effectively disentangle without hurting accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mutual Information (MI) and its conditional variant I(X;Y|Z).
  - Why needed here: CLINIC's objective explicitly minimizes conditional MI to remove sensitive information while preserving predictive power.
  - Quick check question: Can you express I(Z;S|Y) in terms of entropies and explain why conditioning on Y matters?

- Concept: Contrastive Learning and InfoNCE loss.
  - Why needed here: CLINIC uses a contrastive formulation to estimate MI without learnable parameters, relying on positive/negative pair construction.
  - Quick check question: How does the InfoNCE bound relate to MI, and what role do temperature parameters play?

- Concept: Adversarial training and its instability issues.
  - Why needed here: CLINIC is compared against adversarial methods; understanding their weaknesses justifies the parameter-free approach.
  - Quick check question: Why do adversarial disentanglement methods require nested optimization loops, and what are the practical consequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder (RNN or pretrained Transformer) -> Projection head -> CLINIC loss (cross-entropy + contrastive regularizer) -> Optimizer
- Critical path: Forward pass through encoder -> Compute main task CE loss -> Compute contrastive MI regularizer based on sampling strategy -> Backpropagate combined loss -> Update encoder only
- Design tradeoffs: Parameter-free contrastive loss vs. learned MI estimators (no extra parameters but may be less flexible); fixed batch size vs. scalability; choice of sampling strategy vs. disentanglement control
- Failure signatures: High sensitive attribute accuracy despite regularization (insufficient disentanglement); low main task accuracy (over-regularization); training instability with extreme temperatures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CLINIC with S1 strategy on DIAL-M dataset using small batch size (64) and default temperatures; measure main/sensitive accuracies
  2. Vary τp and τn independently to observe effects on disentanglement vs. accuracy trade-off
  3. Compare CLINIC (S1) against adversarial baseline on same data/config to quantify speed and parameter savings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of CLINIC vary across different types of sensitive attributes beyond binary attributes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the main focus is on binary sensitive attributes but reports additional results in Section A.1 for non-binary cases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of CLINIC's performance across various sensitive attribute types, such as multi-class or continuous attributes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing CLINIC on datasets with multi-class or continuous sensitive attributes, comparing its performance to existing methods across different attribute types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the choice of positive and negative sampling strategies on the disentanglement performance in scenarios where the sensitive attribute has complex relationships with the target label?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses two strategies (S1 and S2) for defining positive and negative samples and their impact on performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how these strategies perform in more complex scenarios where the relationship between the sensitive attribute and target label is not straightforward.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using more complex datasets where the sensitive attribute has intricate relationships with the target label, evaluating the effectiveness of different sampling strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can CLINIC be effectively combined with other fairness interventions, such as post-processing techniques, to further enhance fairness in classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on in-processing fairness techniques and mentions the potential for future work to explore combinations with other methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the potential synergies between CLINIC and other fairness intervention methods, such as post-processing or pre-processing techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments combining CLINIC with various post-processing or pre-processing fairness techniques, evaluating the overall impact on fairness metrics and classification performance.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the performance of CLINIC scale with larger and more diverse datasets, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and disentanglement quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper reports results on four datasets and mentions the computational efficiency of CLINIC compared to baselines, but does not explore scaling to larger datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how CLINIC performs as the size and diversity of the dataset increase, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing CLINIC on larger and more diverse datasets, measuring both the computational efficiency and the quality of disentanglement achieved.

## Limitations

- The contrastive MI estimation relies on careful temperature tuning (τp, τn) which may not generalize across all datasets without additional validation
- Generalizability to other domains with different attribute-label correlation structures remains uncertain
- The contrastive sampling strategies require incorporating target label information, which may not be feasible in unsupervised settings or when labels are noisy

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mechanism that CLINIC avoids the trade-off between disentanglement and accuracy by conditioning mutual information on the target label is well-supported by theoretical reasoning and experimental evidence. The parameter-free nature of the method is clearly demonstrated.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that contrastive learning without learnable parameters provides sufficient MI estimation for complex distributions is plausible but requires more extensive validation across diverse data types and distributions.

**Low confidence**: The specific superiority of sampling strategies S1 and S2 over S0 is demonstrated within the paper's experiments but may be sensitive to implementation details and dataset characteristics.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test CLINIC on additional datasets with different attribute-label correlation structures (e.g., tabular data, images) to validate robustness across domains

2. **Temperature sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary τp and τn across multiple orders of magnitude to map the full sensitivity landscape and identify optimal ranges for different dataset characteristics

3. **Unsupervised adaptation**: Evaluate a modified version of CLINIC where target labels are unavailable during training to assess performance in semi-supervised or unsupervised fair representation learning scenarios
