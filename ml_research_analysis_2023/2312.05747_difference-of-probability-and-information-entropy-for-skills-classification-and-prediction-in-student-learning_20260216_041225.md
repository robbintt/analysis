# Difference of Probability and Information Entropy for Skills Classification and Prediction in Student Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.05747
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05747
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: This paper applies Bayes' theorem and probability complement to predict learning materials for students. It uses a SQL pre-assessment dataset to compute probabilities of skill-set events, recommending materials based on student performance. The method calculates the probability of passed and failed skills, identifying what needs to be learned. Information entropy measures knowledge uncertainty, while a J48 decision tree classifies performance with 80% training and 20% test data. Results show that probability-based prediction effectively identifies required learning materials, with entropy values indicating knowledge gaps. The study highlights the importance of accurate classification in educational recommendations to avoid learning gaps.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for predicting student learning needs using Bayes' theorem, probability complement, and information entropy. The approach analyzes pre-assessment data to identify skill gaps and recommend appropriate learning materials. By calculating the difference between expected and actual pass probabilities, the method quantifies learning requirements. Information entropy measures knowledge uncertainty, while a J48 decision tree classifies student performance. The results demonstrate effective identification of required learning materials and highlight the importance of accurate classification in educational recommendations.

## Method Summary
The method uses a SQL pre-assessment dataset containing student performance on skill-set events (parent nodes like "select", "delete" with child nodes like "selectOrderBy", "deleteSelect", etc.), with Pass/Fail outcomes for each skill. The approach calculates probabilities of passed/failed skills using Bayes' theorem, applies the complement of probability to identify required learning materials, uses a J48 decision tree for classification, and measures entropy to quantify knowledge uncertainty. The probability calculation uses Bayes' theorem: P(Fail_node|performance) = P(Fail_node ∩ performance)/ΣP(Fail_i ∩ performance). The complement/difference of probability determines the weight of learning materials needed: argMaxPr(Pass) - Pr(Pass) = Pr(Fail). The J48 decision tree is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Information entropy H(S) = -ΣP(x)log₂P(x) measures knowledge uncertainty and identifies skill gaps.

## Key Results
- Probability-based prediction effectively identifies required learning materials
- Information entropy values indicate knowledge gaps in student performance
- J48 decision tree achieves accurate classification with minimal misclassifications
- The difference of probability method successfully quantifies learning requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The difference of probability method predicts student learning gaps by quantifying the gap between maximum expected pass probability (1) and actual pass probability from pre-assessment.
- Mechanism: For a set of learning objects, the difference between the total expected probability (1) and the sum of passed probabilities yields the probability weight of failed learning objects that need re-learning.
- Core assumption: Learning outcomes are binary (pass/fail) and the probability distribution across all outcomes sums to 1.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the difference of argMaxPr(S) and probability of student-performance quantifies the weight of learning objects for students."
  - [section]: "𝑃𝑟(𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑘) = ∑ 𝑃𝑟(𝑃𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖|𝐴) − ∑ 𝑃𝑟(𝑃𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑗|𝐴)𝑛𝑗=1" (equation 6)
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus focuses on event prediction in general domains, not specifically on learning gaps.
- Break condition: If learning outcomes are not binary or if probability distributions don't sum to 1, the method fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bayes' theorem enables personalized learning material recommendation by calculating the probability of a student needing specific content based on their pre-assessment performance.
- Mechanism: Using Bayes' rule, the probability of a student needing a specific learning object (e.g., a failed skill) is computed as the likelihood of failure given the performance, weighted by prior probabilities.
- Core assumption: Student performance data is representative and the conditional independence of features holds for the Naive Bayes application.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Bayes' theorem, then complement of probability and the difference of probability for occurrences of learning-events, before applying these in the prediction of learning objects in student learning."
  - [section]: "𝑃𝑟(𝐸𝑖|𝐴) = 𝑃𝑟(𝐸𝑖 ∩ 𝐴) / ∑ 𝑃𝑟(𝐴 ∩ 𝐸𝑖)𝑛𝑖=1" (equation 3)
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on event prediction but don't specifically address educational contexts.
- Break condition: If student performance data is biased or conditional independence doesn't hold, Bayes' predictions become inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Information entropy quantifies knowledge uncertainty in student datasets, identifying areas where learning gaps are most pronounced.
- Mechanism: Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty in the skill-set data; high entropy values indicate greater knowledge gaps that require targeted learning interventions.
- Core assumption: Entropy calculation from pre-assessment data accurately reflects student knowledge states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Information entropy measures knowledge uncertainty, while a J48 decision tree classifies performance..."
  - [section]: "𝐻(𝑆) = − ∑ 𝑃(𝑥)𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝑃(𝑥)𝑥∈𝑁" and discussion of entropy values indicating knowledge gaps
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss entropy in event detection but not in educational contexts.
- Break condition: If the dataset is too small or not representative, entropy may not accurately reflect true knowledge gaps.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probability theory and Bayes' theorem
  - Why needed here: These mathematical foundations enable the calculation of learning material recommendations based on student performance data.
  - Quick check question: If a student passes 3 out of 4 pre-assessment quizzes, what is the probability they need the fourth quiz material?

- Concept: Information entropy
  - Why needed here: Entropy quantifies the uncertainty in student knowledge, helping identify where learning interventions are most needed.
  - Quick check question: If all students pass the same pre-assessment perfectly, what would the entropy of their performance data be?

- Concept: Decision tree classification
  - Why needed here: Decision trees classify student performance into categories (pass/fail) to inform learning recommendations.
  - Quick check question: If a decision tree correctly classifies 8 out of 9 instances, what is its accuracy percentage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Input -> SQL pre-assessment dataset with student performance
  - Probability Calculator -> Computes pass/fail probabilities and differences
  - Bayes Predictor -> Applies Bayes' theorem for personalized recommendations
  - Entropy Analyzer -> Measures knowledge uncertainty in the dataset
  - Decision Tree -> Classifies performance using J48 algorithm
  - Output -> Recommended learning materials based on analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess pre-assessment dataset
  2. Calculate pass/fail probabilities for each learning object
  3. Apply difference of probability method to identify learning gaps
  4. Use Bayes' theorem to personalize recommendations
  5. Calculate entropy to identify areas of high uncertainty
  6. Generate final learning material recommendations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Binary vs. multi-level assessment: Binary simplifies probability calculations but may lose granularity
  - Bayes' Naive assumption: Assumes feature independence, which may not always hold in educational contexts
  - Entropy vs. other uncertainty measures: Entropy is well-established but other measures might be more appropriate for specific datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect probability calculations leading to wrong recommendations
  - High misclassification rates in decision tree predictions
  - Entropy values not correlating with actual knowledge gaps

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test probability calculations on a small, known dataset to verify correctness
  2. Compare Bayes' recommendations against actual student performance outcomes
  3. Measure decision tree accuracy and adjust parameters to minimize misclassification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed difference of probability approach compare to other probabilistic methods like Bayesian networks or Markov chains for student learning prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses Bayes' theorem and complement of probability, but does not compare these methods to other probabilistic approaches like Bayesian networks or Markov chains.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison of the proposed method to other probabilistic approaches, making it unclear how it stacks up in terms of accuracy, efficiency, or applicability to different learning scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of the proposed method against Bayesian networks, Markov chains, and other probabilistic methods using the same dataset and evaluation metrics would provide a clear picture of its strengths and weaknesses.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different pre-assessment dataset sizes and distributions on the accuracy of the proposed learning material prediction method?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a SQL pre-assessment dataset, but does not discuss how the size or distribution of the dataset affects the accuracy of the proposed method.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any insights into how the method's performance scales with different dataset sizes or distributions, making it difficult to determine its generalizability to other learning contexts or larger student populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using datasets of varying sizes and distributions, along with an analysis of how these factors affect the method's accuracy and reliability, would help address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle cases where a student's pre-assessment performance is ambiguous or uncertain?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses information entropy as a measure of uncertainty in the skill-set data, but does not elaborate on how the proposed method deals with ambiguous or uncertain pre-assessment results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any insights into how the method handles cases where a student's performance is not clear-cut, which is a common scenario in real-world learning environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed explanation of how the proposed method handles ambiguous or uncertain pre-assessment results, along with experimental results demonstrating its performance in such cases, would help address this question.

## Limitations
- The method's generalizability to other domains beyond SQL skills remains untested
- The small test set (9 instances) limits confidence in the robustness of the classification approach
- Implementation details for translating probability calculations into specific learning recommendations are limited

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical foundations (Bayes' theorem, probability complement, information entropy) are well-established and correctly applied
- **Medium confidence**: The methodology for translating probability calculations into specific learning recommendations is described but implementation details are limited
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of results to broader educational contexts and larger datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test the probability calculation method on a larger, more diverse student dataset to verify robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the Bayes' component to quantify its specific contribution to prediction accuracy
3. Validate the entropy measurements against actual post-intervention student performance to confirm it accurately identifies knowledge gaps
